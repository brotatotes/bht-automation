<p><b>19. For,</b> c.—better, "For
	as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so
	by the obedience of the One shall the many be made righteous."
	On this great verse observe: <i>First,</i> By the "obedience"
	of Christ here is plainly not meant more than what divines call His
	<i>active</i> obedience, as distinguished from His sufferings and
	death it is the entire work of Christ in its <i>obediential</i>
	character. Our Lord Himself represents even His death as His great
	act of obedience to the Father: "This commandment (that is, to
	lay down and resume His life) have I received of My Father" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). <i>Second,</i> The significant word twice rendered <i>made,</i>
	does not signify to <i>work a change upon</i> a person or thing, but
	to <i>constitute</i> or <i>ordain,</i> as will be seen from all the
	places where it is used. Here, accordingly, it is intended to express
	that <i>judicial act</i> which holds men, in virtue of their
	connection with Adam, as sinners; and, in connection with Christ, as
	righteous. <i>Third,</i> The change of <i>tense</i> from the past to
	the future—"as through Adam we <i>were</i> made sinners, so
	through Christ we <i>shall be</i> made righteous"—delightfully
	expresses the enduring character of the act, and of the economy to
	which such acts belong, in contrast with the for-ever-past ruin of
	believers in Adam. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
	<i>Fourth,</i> The "all men" of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> and the "many" of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> are the same party, though under a slightly different
	aspect. In the latter case, the contrast is between the <i>one</i>
	representative (Adam—Christ) and the <i>many</i> whom he
	represented; in the former case, it is between the one <i>head</i>
	(Adam—Christ) and the <i>human race,</i> affected for death and
	life respectively by the actings of that one. Only in this latter
	case it is the redeemed family of man that is alone in view; it is
	<i>humanity</i> as actually lost, but also as actually saved, as
	ruined and recovered. Such as refuse to fall in with the high purpose
	of God to constitute His Son a "second Adam," the Head of a
	new race, and as impenitent and unbelieving finally perish, have no
	place in this section of the Epistle, whose sole object is to show
	how God repairs in the second Adam the evil done by the first. (Thus
	the doctrine of <i>universal restoration</i> has no place here. Thus
	too the forced interpretation by which the "justification of
	all" is made to mean a justification merely in <i>possibility</i>
	and <i>offer</i> to all, and the "justification of the many"
	to mean the <i>actual</i> justification of as many as believe
	[ALFORD, c.], is
	completely avoided. And thus the harshness of comparing a <i>whole</i>
	fallen family with a recovered <i>part</i> is got rid of. However
	true it be in <i>fact</i> that part of mankind is not saved, this is
	not the <i>aspect</i> in which the subject is here presented. It is
	<i>totals</i> that are compared and contrasted and it is the <i>same
	total</i> in two successive conditions—namely, <i>the human race</i>
	as ruined in Adam and recovered in Christ).</p>
