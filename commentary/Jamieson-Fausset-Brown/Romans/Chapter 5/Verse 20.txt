<p><b>20, 21. Moreover the law</b>—"The
	law, however." The Jew might say, If the whole purposes of God
	towards men center in Adam and Christ, where does "the law"
	come in, and what was the use of it? <i>Answer:</i> It 
	</p>
<p><b>entered</b>—But the word
	expresses an important idea besides "entering." It
	signifies, "entered incidentally," or "parenthetically."
	(In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:4">Galatians 2:4</span> the same word is
	rendered, "came in <i>privily.</i>") The meaning is, that
	the promulgation of the law at Sinai was no primary or essential
	feature of the divine plan, but it was "added" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:4- :">Galatians 2:4- :</span>) for a subordinate purpose—the more fully to reveal the
	evil occasioned by Adam, and the need and glory of the remedy by
	Christ. 
	</p>
<p><b>that the offence might
	abound</b>—or, "be multiplied." But what offense?
	Throughout all this section "the offense" (four times
	repeated besides here) has one definite meaning, namely, "the
	one first offense of Adam"; and this, in our judgment, is its
	meaning here also: "All our multitudinous breaches of the law
	are nothing but <i>that one first offense,</i> lodged mysteriously in
	the bosom of every child of Adam as an <i>offending principal,</i>
	and <i>multiplying itself</i> into myriads of particular offenses in
	the life of each." What was one <i>act</i> of disobedience in
	the head has been converted into a vital and virulent <i>principle</i>
	of disobedience in all the members of the human family, whose every
	act of wilful rebellion proclaims itself the child of the original
	transgression. 
	</p>
<p><b>But where sin abounded</b>—or,
	"was multiplied." 
	</p>
<p><b>grace did much more
	abound</b>—rather, "did exceedingly abound," or
	"superabound." The comparison here is between the
	multiplication of one offense into countless transgressions, and such
	an overflow of grace as more than meets that appalling case.</p>
