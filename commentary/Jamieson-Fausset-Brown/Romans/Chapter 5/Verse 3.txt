<p><b>3, 4. we glory in tribulation also;
	knowing that tribulation worketh patience</b>—Patience is the quiet
	endurance of what we cannot but wish removed, whether it be the
	withholding of promised good (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), or the continued experience of positive ill (as here).
	There is indeed a patience of unrenewed nature, which has something
	noble in it, though in many cases the offspring of pride, if not of
	something lower. Men have been known to endure every form of
	privation, torture, and death, without a murmur and without even
	visible emotion, merely because they deemed it unworthy of them to
	sink under unavoidable ill. But this proud, stoical hardihood has
	nothing in common with the <i>grace</i> of patience—which is either
	the meek endurance of ill because it is of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+1:21">Job 1:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+1:22">Job 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+2:10">Job 2:10</span>),
	or the calm waiting for promised good till His time to dispense it
	come (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:36">Hebrews 10:36</span>); in the full
	persuasion that such trials are divinely appointed, are the needed
	discipline of God's children, are but for a definite period, and are
	not sent without abundant promises of "songs in the night."
	If such be the "patience" which "tribulation worketh,"
	no wonder that</p>
