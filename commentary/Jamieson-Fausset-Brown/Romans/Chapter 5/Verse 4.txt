<p><b>4. patience worketh
	experience</b>—rather, "proof," as the same word is
	rendered in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:9">2 Corinthians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:3">2 Corinthians 13:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:22">Philippians 2:22</span>; that is, experimental
	<i>evidence</i> that we have "believed through grace." 
	</p>
<p><b>and experience</b>—"proof."
	</p>
<p><b>hope</b>—"of the glory
	of God," as prepared for us. Thus have we hope in two distinct
	ways, and at two successive stages of the Christian life: <i>first,</i>
	immediately on believing, along with the sense of peace and abiding
	access to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1">Romans 5:1</span>); <i>next,</i>
	after the reality of this faith has been "proved,"
	particularly by the patient endurance of trials sent to test it. We
	first get it by looking <i>away from ourselves</i> to the Lamb of
	God; next by looking <i>into</i> or <i>upon ourselves</i> as
	transformed by that "looking unto Jesus." In the one case,
	the mind acts (as they say) <i>objectively;</i> in the other,
	<i>subjectively.</i> The one is (as divines say) the <i>assurance of
	faith;</i> the other, the <i>assurance of sense.</i></p>
