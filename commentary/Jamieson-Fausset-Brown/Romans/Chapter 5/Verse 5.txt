5. And hope maketh not
	ashamed—putteth not to shame, as empty hopes do. 
	because the love of God—that
	is, not "our love to God," as the Romish and some
	Protestant expositors (following some of the Fathers) represent it;
	but clearly "God's love to us"—as most expositors agree. 
	is shed abroad—literally,
	"poured forth," that is, copiously diffused (compare
	John 7:38; Titus 3:6).
	by the Holy Ghost which
	is—rather, "was." 
	given unto us—that is,
	at the great Pentecostal effusion, which is viewed as the formal
	donation of the Spirit to the Church of God, for all time and for
	each believer. (The Holy Ghost is here first introduced in this
	Epistle.) It is as if the apostle had said, "And how can
	this hope of glory, which as believers we cherish, put us to shame,
	when we feel God Himself, by His Spirit given to us, drenching our
	hearts in sweet, all-subduing sensations of His wondrous love to us
	in Christ Jesus?" This leads the apostle to expatiate on the
	amazing character of that love.
