<p><b>6-8. For when we were yet without

<p><b>Christ died for the
	ungodly</b>—Three signal properties of God's love are here given:
	First, "Christ died <i>for the ungodly,</i>" whose
	character, so far from meriting any interposition in their behalf,
	was altogether repulsive to the eye of God; second, He did this "when
	they were <i>without strength</i>"—with nothing between them
	and perdition but that self-originating divine compassion; third, He
	did this "<i>at the due time,</i>" when it was most fitting
	that it should take place (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), The two former of these properties the apostle now proceeds
	to illustrate.</p>
