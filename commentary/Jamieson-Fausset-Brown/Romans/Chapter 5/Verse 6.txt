6-8. For when we were yet without
	strength—that is, powerless to deliver ourselves, and so ready
	to perish. 
	in due time—at the

	Christ died for the
	ungodly—Three signal properties of God's love are here given:
	First, "Christ died for the ungodly," whose
	character, so far from meriting any interposition in their behalf,
	was altogether repulsive to the eye of God; second, He did this "when
	they were without strength"—with nothing between them
	and perdition but that self-originating divine compassion; third, He
	did this "at the due time," when it was most fitting
	that it should take place (compare  :-), The two former of these properties the apostle now proceeds
	to illustrate.
