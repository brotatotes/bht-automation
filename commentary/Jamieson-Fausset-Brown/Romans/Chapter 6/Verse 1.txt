1. What, c.â€”The subject of
	this third division of our Epistle announces itself at once in
	the opening question, "Shall we (or, as the true reading is,
	"May we," "Are we to") continue in sin, that
	grace may abound?" Had the apostle's doctrine been that
	salvation depends in any degree upon our good works, no such
	objection to it could have been made. Against the doctrine of a
	purely gratuitous justification, the objection is plausible nor has
	there ever been an age in which it has not been urged. That it was
	brought against the apostles, we know from  :-; and we gather from Galatians 5:13;
	1 Peter 2:16; Judges 1:4,
	that some did give occasion to the charge; but that it was a total
	perversion of the doctrine of Grace the apostle here proceeds to
	show.
