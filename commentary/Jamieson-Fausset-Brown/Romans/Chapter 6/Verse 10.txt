<p><b>God</b>—There never,
	indeed, was a time when Christ did not "live unto God." But
	in the days of His flesh He did so under the continual burden of sin
	"laid on Him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:6">Isaiah 53:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>); whereas, now that He
	has "put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself," He "liveth
	unto God," the acquitted and accepted Surety, unchallenged and
	unclouded by the claims of sin.</p>
