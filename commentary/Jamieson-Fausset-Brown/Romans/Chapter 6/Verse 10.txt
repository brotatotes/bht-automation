10. For in that he died, he died
	unto—that is, in obedience to the claims of 
	sin once—for all. 
	but in that he liveth, he
	liveth unto—in obedience to the claims of God. 
	God—There never,
	indeed, was a time when Christ did not "live unto God." But
	in the days of His flesh He did so under the continual burden of sin
	"laid on Him" (Isaiah 53:6;
	2 Corinthians 5:21); whereas, now that He
	has "put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself," He "liveth
	unto God," the acquitted and accepted Surety, unchallenged and
	unclouded by the claims of sin.
