<p><b>11. Likewise</b>—even as your Lord
	Himself. 
	</p>
<p><b>reckon ye also yourselves to
	be dead indeed</b>—"dead on the one hand" 
	</p>
<p><b>unto sin, but alive unto God
	through Jesus Christ our Lord</b>—(The words, "our Lord,"
	at the close of this verse, are wanting in the best manuscripts.)

<p><i>Note,</i> (1) "Antinomianism
	is not only an error; it is a falsehood and a slander" [HODGE].
	That "we should continue in sin that grace may abound," not
	only is never the deliberate sentiment of any real believer in the
	doctrine of Grace, but is abhorrent to every Christian mind, as a
	monstrous abuse of the most glorious of all truths (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). (2) As the death of Christ is not only the expiation of
	guilt, but the death of sin itself in all who are vitally united to
	Him; so the resurrection of Christ is the resurrection of believers,
	not only to acceptance with God, but to newness of life (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). (3) In the light of these two truths, let all who name
	the name of Christ "examine themselves whether they be in the
	faith."

	PRACTICAL USE
	BELIEVERS SHOULD
	MAKE OF THEIR
	DEATH TO SIN
	AND LIFE TO GOD
	THROUGH UNION TO THE
	CRUCIFIED SAVIOUR.

<p>Not content with showing that his
	doctrine has no tendency to relax the obligations to a holy life, the
	apostle here proceeds to enforce these obligations.</p>
