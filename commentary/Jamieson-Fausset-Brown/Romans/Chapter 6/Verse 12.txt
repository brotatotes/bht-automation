12. Let not sin therefore—as a
	Master 
	reign—(The reader will
	observe that wherever in this section the words "Sin,"
	"Obedience," "Righteousness," "Uncleanness,"
	"Iniquity," are figuratively used, to represent a Master,
	they are here printed in capitals, to make this manifest to the eye,
	and so save explanation). 
	in your mortal body, that ye
	should obey it—sin. 
	in the lusts thereof—"the
	lusts of the body," as the Greek makes evident. (The
	other reading, perhaps the true one, "that ye should obey the
	lusts thereof," comes to the same thing). The "body"
	is here viewed as the instrument by which all the sins of the heart
	become facts of the outward life, and as itself the seat of the lower
	appetites; and it is called "our mortal body,"
	probably to remind us how unsuitable is this reign of sin in those
	who are "alive from the dead." But the reign here meant is
	the unchecked dominion of sin within us. Its outward acts are
	next referred to.
