13. Neither yield ye your members
	instruments of unrighteousness unto Sin, but yield yourselves—this
	is the great surrender. 
	unto God as those that are
	alive from the dead, and—as the fruit of this. 
	your members—till now
	prostituted to sin. 
	instruments of righteousness
	unto God—But what if indwelling sin should prove too strong for
	us? The reply is: But it will not.
