<p><b>13. Neither yield ye your members
	instruments of unrighteousness unto Sin, but yield yourselves</b>—this
	is the great surrender. 
	</p>
<p><b>unto God as those that are
	alive from the dead, and</b>—as the fruit of this. 
	</p>
<p><b>your members</b>—till now
	prostituted to sin. 
	</p>
<p><b>instruments of righteousness
	unto God</b>—But what if indwelling sin should prove too strong for
	us? The reply is: But it will not.</p>
