<p><b>14. For Sin shall not have dominion
	over you</b>—as the slaves of a tyrant lord. 
	</p>
<p><b>for ye are not under the law,
	but under grace</b>—The force of this glorious assurance can only
	be felt by observing the grounds on which it rests. To be "under
	the law" is, first, to be under its claim to entire obedience;
	and so, next under its curse for the breach of these. And as all
	power to obey can reach the sinner only through <i>Grace,</i> of
	which the law knows nothing, it follows that to be "under the
	law" is, finally, to be shut up under an <i>inability to keep
	it,</i> and consequently to be the <i>helpless slave of sin.</i> On
	the other hand, to be "under grace," is to be under the
	glorious canopy and saving effects of that "grace which reigns
	through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our
	Lord" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
	The curse of the law has been completely lifted from off them; they
	are made "the righteousness of God in Him"; and they are
	"alive unto God through Jesus Christ." So that, as when
	they were "under the law," Sin <i>could not but</i> have
	dominion over them, so now that they are "under grace," Sin
	<i>cannot</i> but be subdued under them. If before, Sin resistlessly
	triumphed, Grace will now be more than conqueror.</p>
