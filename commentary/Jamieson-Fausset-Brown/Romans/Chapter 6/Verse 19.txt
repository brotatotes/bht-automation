19. I speak after the manner of
	men—descending, for illustration, to the level of common
	affairs. 
	because of the infirmity of
	your flesh—the weakness of your spiritual apprehension. 
	for as ye have yielded—"as
	ye yielded," the thing being viewed as now past. 
	your members servants to
	Uncleanness and to Iniquity unto—the practice of 
	iniquity; even so now yield
	your members servants to Righteousness unto holiness—rather,
	"unto (the attainment of) sanctification," as the same word
	is rendered in 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Corinthians 1:30;
	1 Peter 1:2: —that is, "Looking
	back upon the heartiness with which ye served Sin, and the
	lengths ye went to be stimulated now to like zeal and like
	exuberance in the service of a better Master."
