<p><b>20. For when ye were the
	servants</b>—"were servants" 
	</p>
<p><b>of Sin, ye were free
	from</b>—rather, "in respect of" 
	</p>
<p><b>Righteousness</b>—Difficulties
	have been made about this clause where none exist. The import of it
	seems clearly to be this:—"Since no servant can serve two
	masters, much less where their interests come into deadly collision,
	and each demands the whole man, so, while ye were in the service of
	Sin ye were in no proper sense the servants of Righteousness, and
	never did it one act of real service: whatever might be your
	conviction of the claims of Righteousness, your real services were
	all and always given to Sin: Thus had ye full proof of the nature and
	advantages of Sin's service." The searching question with which
	this is followed up, shows that this is the meaning.</p>
