<p><b>21. What fruit had ye then in those
	things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is
	death</b>—What permanent <i>advantage,</i> and what abiding
	<i>satisfaction,</i> have those things yielded? The apostle answers
	his own question:—"Abiding satisfaction, did I ask? They have
	left only a sense of '<i>shame.</i>' Permanent advantage? 'The end of
	them is <i>death.</i>'" By saying they were "<i>now</i>
	ashamed," he makes it plain that he is not referring to that
	disgust at themselves, and remorse of conscience by which those who
	are the most helplessly "sold under sin" are often stung to
	the quick; but that ingenuous feeling of self-reproach, which pierces
	and weighs down the children of God, as they think of the dishonor
	which their past life did to His name, the ingratitude it displayed,
	the violence it did to their own conscience, its deadening and
	degrading effects, and the death—"the second death"—to
	which it was dragging them down, when mere Grace arrested them. (On
	the sense of "death" here, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, <i>Note</i> 3, and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>: see also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:8">Revelation 21:8</span> —The
	change proposed in the pointing of this verse: "What fruit had
	ye then? things whereof ye are now ashamed" [LUTHER,
	THOLUCK, DE
	WETTE, PHILIPPI,
	ALFORD, &amp;c.], seems
	unnatural and uncalled for. The ordinary pointing has at least
	powerful support [CHRYSOSTOM,
	CALVIN, BEZA,
	GROTIUS, BENGEL,
	STUART, FRITZSCHE]).</p>
