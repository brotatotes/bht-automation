<p><b>being made free from Sin, and
	become servants to God</b>—in the absolute sense intended
	throughout all this passage.

<p><b>ye have</b>—not "ought
	to have," but "do have," in point of fact. 
	</p>
<p><b>your fruit unto
	holiness</b>—"sanctification," as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; meaning that <i>permanently holy state and character</i>
	which is built up out of the whole "fruits of righteousness,"
	which believers successively bring forth. They "have their
	fruit" <i>unto</i> this, that is, all <i>going towards</i> this
	blessed result. 
	</p>
<p><b>and the end everlasting
	life</b>—as the final state of the justified believer; the beatific
	experience not only of complete exemption from the fall with all its
	effects, but of the perfect life of acceptance with God, and
	conformity to His likeness, of unveiled access to Him, and ineffable
	fellowship with Him through all duration.</p>
