3. Know ye not, that so many of us
	as were baptized into Jesus Christ—compare  :-. 
	were baptized into his
	death?—sealed with the seal of heaven, and as it were formally
	entered and articled, to all the benefits and all the
	obligations of Christian discipleship in general, and of His
	death in particular. And since He was "made sin" and
	"a curse for us" (2 Corinthians 5:21;
	Galatians 5:13), "bearing our sins
	in His own body on the tree," and "rising again for our
	justification" (Romans 4:25;
	1 Peter 2:24), our whole sinful case
	and condition, thus taken up into His Person, has been brought to an
	end in His death. Whoso, then, has been baptized into Christ's death
	has formally surrendered the whole state and life of sin, as in
	Christ a dead thing. He has sealed himself to be not only "the
	righteousness of God in Him," but "a new creature";
	and as he cannot be in Christ to the one effect and not to the other,
	for they are one thing, he has bidden farewell, by baptism into
	Christ's death, to his entire connection with sin. "How,"
	then, "can he live any longer therein?" The two things are
	as contradictory in the fact as they are in the terms.
