	"hath died."

	from sin." As death dissolves all claims, so the whole claim of
	sin, not only to "reign unto death," but to keep its
	victims in sinful bondage, has been discharged once for all, by the
	believer's penal death in the death of Christ; so that he is no
	longer a "debtor to the flesh to live after the flesh"
	(Romans 8:12).
