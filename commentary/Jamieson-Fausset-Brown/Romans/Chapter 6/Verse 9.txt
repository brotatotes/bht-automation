<p><b>9-11. Christ being raised from the
	dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him</b>â€”Though
	Christ's death was in the most absolute sense a voluntary act
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:17">John 10:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:18">John 10:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:24">Acts 2:24</span>), that voluntary
	surrender gave death such rightful "dominion over <i>Him</i>"
	as dissolved its dominion over <i>us.</i> But this once past, "death
	hath," even in that sense, "dominion over Him no more."</p>
