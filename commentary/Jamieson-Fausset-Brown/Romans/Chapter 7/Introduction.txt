<p><i>Relation of Believers to the
	Law and to Christ</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p>Recurring to the statement of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, that believers are "not under the law but under
	grace," the apostle here shows <i>how</i> this change is brought
	about, and what holy consequences follow from it.</p>
