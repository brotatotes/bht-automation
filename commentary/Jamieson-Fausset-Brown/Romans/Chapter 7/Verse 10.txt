<p><b>the commandment, which was,</b>

<p><b>to</b>—give 
	</p>
<p><b>life</b>—through the
	keeping of it.

<p><b>I found to be unto

<p><b>For sin</b>—my sinful

<p><b>taking occasion by the

	aside into the very thing which the commandment forbade. 
	</p>
<p><b>and by it slew me</b>—"discovered
	me to myself to be a condemned and gone man" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "I <i>died</i>").</p>
