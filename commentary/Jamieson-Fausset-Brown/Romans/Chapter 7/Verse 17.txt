<p><b>17. Now then it is no more I</b>—<i>my
	renewed self.</i>
</p>
<p><b>that do it</b>—"that
	work it." 
	</p>
<p><b>but sin which dwelleth in
	me</b>—that principle of sin that still has its abode in me. To
	explain this and the following statements, as many do (even BENGEL
	and THOLUCK), of the sins
	of unrenewed men against their better convictions, is to do painful
	violence to the apostle's language, and to affirm of the unregenerate
	what is untrue. That coexistence and mutual hostility of "flesh"
	and "spirit" in the same renewed man, which is so clearly
	taught in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:4">Romans 8:4</span>, c., and in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:4- :">Romans 8:4- :</span>, &amp;c., is the true and only key to the language of this
	and the following verses. (It is hardly necessary to say that the
	apostle means not to disown the blame of yielding to his corruptions,
	by saying, "it is not he that does it, but sin that dwelleth in
	him." Early heretics thus abused his language but the whole
	strain of the passage shows that his sole object in thus expressing
	himself was to bring more vividly before his readers the conflict of
	two opposite principles, and how entirely, as a new man—honoring
	from his inmost soul the law of God—he condemned and renounced his
	corrupt nature, with its affections and lusts, its stirrings and its
	outgoings, root and branch).</p>
