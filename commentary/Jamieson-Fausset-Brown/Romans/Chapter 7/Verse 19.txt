<p><b>19, 21. For,</b> &amp;c.â€”The
	conflict here graphically described between a self that "desires"
	to do good and a self that in spite of this does evil, cannot be the
	struggles between conscience and passion in the <i>unregenerate,</i>
	because the description given of this "desire to do good"
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:22">Romans 7:22</span> is such as cannot be
	ascribed, with the least show of truth, to any but the <i>renewed.</i></p>
