<p><b>22. For I delight in the law of God
	after the inward man</b>â€”"from the bottom of my heart."
	The word here rendered "delight" is indeed stronger than
	"consent" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:16">Romans 7:16</span>;
	but both express a state of mind and heart to which the unregenerate
	man is a stranger.</p>
