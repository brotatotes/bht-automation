23. But I see another—it
	should be "a different" 
	law in my members—(See
	on  :-). 
	warring against the law of my
	mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my
	members—In this important verse, observe, first, that the word
	"law" means an inward principle of action, good or evil,
	operating with the fixedness and regularity of a law. The apostle
	found two such laws within him; the one "the law of sin in his
	members," called (in Galatians 5:17;
	Galatians 5:24) "the flesh which
	lusteth against the spirit," "the flesh with the affections
	and lusts," that is, the sinful principle in the regenerate; the
	other, "the law of the mind," or the holy principle of the
	renewed nature. Second, when the apostle says he "sees" the
	one of these principles "warring against" the other, and
	"bringing him into captivity" to itself, he is not
	referring to any actual rebellion going on within him while he was
	writing, or to any captivity to his own lusts then existing. He
	is simply describing the two conflicting principles, and pointing out
	what it was the inherent property of each to aim at bringing about.
	Third, when the apostle describes himself as "brought into
	captivity" by the triumph of the sinful principle of his
	nature, he clearly speaks in the person of a renewed man. Men
	do not feel themselves to be in captivity in the territories of their
	own sovereign and associated with their own friends, breathing a
	congenial atmosphere, and acting quite spontaneously. But here the
	apostle describes himself, when drawn under the power of his sinful
	nature, as forcibly seized and reluctantly dragged to his enemy's
	camp, from which he would gladly make his escape. This ought to
	settle the question, whether he is here speaking as a regenerate man
	or the reverse.
