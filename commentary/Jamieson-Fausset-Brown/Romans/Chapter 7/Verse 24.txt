24. O wretched man that I am! who
	shall deliver me from the body of this death?â€”The apostle
	speaks of the "body" here with reference to "the law
	of sin" which he had said was "in his members," but
	merely as the instrument by which the sin of the heart finds vent in
	action, and as itself the seat of the lower appetites (see on  :-, and  :-); and he calls
	it "the body of this death," as feeling, at the
	moment when he wrote, the horrors of that death ( :-, and Romans 7:5) into which
	it dragged him down. But the language is not that of a sinner newly
	awakened to the sight of his lost state; it is the cry of a living
	but agonized believer, weighed down under a burden which is not
	himself, but which he longs to shake off from his renewed self. Nor
	does the question imply ignorance of the way of relief at the time
	referred to. It was designed only to prepare the way for that
	outburst of thankfulness for the divinely provided remedy which
	immediately follows.
