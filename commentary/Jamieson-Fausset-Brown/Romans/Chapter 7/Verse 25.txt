<p><b>I myself serve the law of

	man; although that corrupt nature which still remains in me listens
	to the dictates of sin."

<p><i>Note,</i> (1) This whole
	chapter was of essential service to the Reformers in their
	contendings with the Church of Rome. When the divines of that corrupt
	church, in a Pelagian spirit, denied that the sinful principle in our
	fallen nature, which they called "Concupiscence," and which
	is commonly called "Original Sin," had the nature of <i>sin</i>
	at all, they were triumphantly answered from this chapter, where—both
	in the first section of it, which speaks of it in the unregenerate,
	and in the second, which treats of its presence and actings in
	believers—it is explicitly, emphatically, and repeatedly called
	"<i>sin.</i>" As such, they held it to be <i>damnable.</i>
	(See the Confessions both of the Lutheran and Reformed churches). In
	the following century, the orthodox in Holland had the same
	controversy to wage with "the Remonstrants" (the followers
	of Arminius), and they waged it on the field of this chapter. (2)
	Here we see that <i>Inability</i> is consistent with <i>Accountability.</i>
	(See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:18">Romans 7:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:17">Galatians 5:17</span>).
	"As the Scriptures constantly recognize the truth of these two
	things, so are they constantly united in Christian experience.
	Everyone feels that he cannot do the things that he would, yet is
	sensible that he is guilty for not doing them. Let any man test his
	power by the requisition to love God perfectly at all times. Alas!
	how entire our inability! Yet how deep our self-loathing and
	self-condemnation!" [HODGE].
	(3) If the first sight of the Cross by the eye of faith kindles
	feelings never to be forgotten, and in one sense never to be
	repeated—like the first view of an enchanting landscape—the
	experimental discovery, in the latter stages of the Christian life,
	of its power to beat down and mortify inveterate corruption, to
	cleanse and heal from long-continued backslidings and frightful
	inconsistencies, and so to triumph over all that threatens to destroy
	those for whom Christ died, as to bring them safe over the
	tempestuous seas of this life into the haven of eternal rest—is
	attended with yet more heart—affecting wonder draws forth deeper
	thankfulness, and issues in more exalted adoration of Him whose work
	Salvation is from first to last (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:24">Romans 7:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:25">Romans 7:25</span>). (4) It is sad when
	such topics as these are handled as mere questions of biblical
	interpretation or systematic theology. Our great apostle could not
	treat of them apart from personal experience, of which the facts of
	his own life and the feelings of his own soul furnished him with
	illustrations as lively as they were apposite. When one is unable to
	go far into the investigation of indwelling sin, without breaking out
	into an, "O wretched man that I am!" and cannot enter on
	the way of relief without exclaiming "I thank God through Jesus
	Christ our Lord," he will find his meditations rich in fruit to
	his own soul, and may expect, through Him who presides in all such
	matters, to kindle in his readers or hearers the like blessed
	emotions (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:24">Romans 7:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:25">Romans 7:25</span>).
	So be it even now, O Lord!</p>
