<p><b>4. Wherefore . . . ye also are
	become dead</b>—rather, "were slain." 
	</p>
<p><b>to the law by the body of
	Christ</b>—through His slain body. The apostle here departs from
	his usual word "died," using the more expressive phrase
	"were slain," to make it clear that he meant their being
	"crucified with Christ" (as expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:3-6">Romans 6:3-6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>that ye should be married to
	another, even to him that is</b>—"was." 
	</p>
<p><b>raised from the dead</b>—to
	the intent. 
	</p>
<p><b>that we should bring forth
	fruit unto God</b>—It has been thought that the apostle should here
	have said that "the <i>law</i> died to us," not "we to
	the law," but that purposely inverted the figure, to avoid the
	harshness to Jewish ears of <i>the death of the law</i> [CHRYSOSTOM,
	CALVIN, HODGE,
	PHILIPPI, c.]. But this is
	to mistake the apostle's design in employing this figure, which was
	merely to illustrate the general principle that "<i>death
	dissolves legal obligation.</i>" It was essential to his
	argument that <i>we,</i> not the law, should be the dying party,
	since it is we that are "crucified with Christ," and not
	the law. This death dissolves our marriage obligation to the law,
	leaving us at liberty to contract a new relation—to be joined to
	the Risen One, in order to spiritual fruitfulness, to the glory of
	God [BEZA, OLSHAUSEN,
	MEYER, ALFORD,
	&amp;c.]. The confusion, then, is in the expositors, not the text and
	it has arisen from not observing that, like Jesus Himself, believers
	are here viewed as having a double life—the old sin-condemned life,
	which they lay down with Christ, and the new life of acceptance and
	holiness to which they rise with their Surety and Head; and all the
	issues of this new life, in Christian obedience, are regarded as the
	"fruit" of this blessed union to the Risen One. How such
	holy fruitfulness was impossible before our union to Christ, is next
	declared.</p>
