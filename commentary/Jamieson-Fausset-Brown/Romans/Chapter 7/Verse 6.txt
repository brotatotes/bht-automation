<p><b>6. But now</b>—On the same
	expression, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, and
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:15">James 1:15</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>we are delivered from the
	law</b>—The word is the same which, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:15- :">James 1:15- :</span> and elsewhere, is rendered "destroyed," and is but
	another way of saying (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:4">Romans 7:4</span>)
	that "we were <i>slain</i> to the law by the body of Christ";
	language which, though harsh to the ear, is designed and fitted to
	impress upon the reader the <i>violence</i> of that death of the
	Cross, by which, as by a deadly wrench, we are "delivered from
	the law." 
	</p>
<p><b>that being dead wherein we
	were held</b>—It is now universally agreed that the true reading
	here is, "being dead to that wherein we were held." The
	received reading has no authority whatever, and is inconsistent with
	the strain of the argument; for the death spoken of, as we have seen,
	is not the <i>law's,</i> but ours, through union with the crucified
	Saviour. 
	</p>
<p><b>that we should</b>—"so
	as to" or "so that we." 
	</p>
<p><b>serve in newness of
	spirit</b>—"in the newness of the spirit." 
	</p>
<p><b>and not in the oldness of the
	letter</b>—not in our old way of literal, mechanical obedience to
	the divine law, as a set of external rules of conduct, and without
	any reference to the state of our hearts; but in that new way of
	spiritual obedience which, through union to the risen Saviour, we
	have learned to render (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>). 
	</p>
<p><i>False Inferences regarding the
	Law Repelled</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6- :">2 Corinthians 3:6- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p>And first, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6- :">2 Corinthians 3:6- :</span>, in the case of the UNREGENERATE.</p>
