<p><b>9. For I was alive without the law
	once</b>—"In the days of my ignorance, when, in this sense, a
	stranger to the law, I deemed myself a righteous man, and, as such,
	entitled to life at the hand of God." 
	</p>
<p><b>but when the commandment
	came</b>—forbidding all irregular desire; for the apostle sees in
	this the spirit of the whole law. 
	</p>
<p><b>sin revived</b>—"came
	to life"; in its malignity and strength it unexpectedly revealed
	itself, as if sprung from the dead. 
	</p>
<p><b>and I died</b>—"saw
	myself, in the eye of a law never kept and not to be kept, a dead
	man."</p>
