9. For I was alive without the law
	once—"In the days of my ignorance, when, in this sense, a
	stranger to the law, I deemed myself a righteous man, and, as such,
	entitled to life at the hand of God." 
	but when the commandment
	came—forbidding all irregular desire; for the apostle sees in
	this the spirit of the whole law. 
	sin revived—"came
	to life"; in its malignity and strength it unexpectedly revealed
	itself, as if sprung from the dead. 
	and I died—"saw
	myself, in the eye of a law never kept and not to be kept, a dead
	man."
