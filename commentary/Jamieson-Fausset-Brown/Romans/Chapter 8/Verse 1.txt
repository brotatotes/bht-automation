<p><b>1. There is therefore now,</b>
	c.—referring to the immediately preceding context [OLSHAUSEN,
	PHILIPPI, MEYER,
	ALFORD, &amp;c.]. The
	subject with which the seventh chapter concludes is still under
	consideration. The scope of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> is to show how "the law of sin and death" is
	deprived of its power to bring believers again into bondage, and how
	the holy law of God receives in them the homage of a living obedience
	[CALVIN, FRASER,
	PHILIPPI, MEYER,
	ALFORD, &amp;c.]. 
	</p>
<p><b>no condemnation: to them
	which are in Christ Jesus</b>—As Christ, who "knew no sin,"
	was, to all legal effects, "made sin for us," so are we,
	who believe in Him, to all legal effects, "made the
	righteousness of God in Him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) and thus, one with Him in the divine reckoning. there is to
	such "NO CONDEMNATION."
	(Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:18">John 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:19">Romans 5:19</span>).
	But this is no mere legal <i>arrangement:</i> it is a union in <i>life;</i>
	believers, through the indwelling of Christ's Spirit in them, having
	one life with Him, as truly as the head and the members of the same
	body have one life. 
	</p>
<p><b>who walk not after the flesh,
	but after the Spirit</b>—The evidence of manuscripts seems to show
	that this clause formed no part of the original text of this verse,
	but that the first part of it was early introduced, and the second
	later, from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:4">Romans 8:4</span>, probably as
	an explanatory comment, and to make the transition to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:4- :">Romans 8:4- :</span> easier.</p>
