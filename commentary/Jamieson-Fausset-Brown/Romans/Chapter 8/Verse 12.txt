12, 13. Therefore, brethren, we are
	debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the fleshâ€”"Once
	we were sold under sin (Romans 7:14);
	but now that we have been set free from that hard master and become
	servants to Righteousness (Romans 7:14- :), we owe nothing to the flesh, we disown its unrighteous
	claims and are deaf to its imperious demands." Glorious
	sentiment!
