<p><b>12, 13. Therefore, brethren, we are
	debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh</b>â€”"Once
	we were sold under sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:14">Romans 7:14</span>);
	but now that we have been set free from that hard master and become
	servants to Righteousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:14- :">Romans 7:14- :</span>), we owe nothing to the flesh, we disown its unrighteous
	claims and are deaf to its imperious demands." Glorious
	sentiment!</p>
