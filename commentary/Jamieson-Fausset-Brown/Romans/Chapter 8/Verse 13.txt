<p><b>13. For if ye live after the flesh,
	ye shall die</b>—in the sense of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>but if ye through the Spirit

<p><b>ye shall live</b>—in the
	sense of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:22">Romans 6:22</span>. The apostle
	is not satisfied with assuring them that they are under no
	<i>obligations</i> to the flesh, to hearken to its suggestions,
	without reminding them where it will end if they do; and he uses the
	word "mortify" (put to death) as a kind of play upon the
	word "die" just before. "If <i>ye</i> do not kill sin,
	<i>it</i> will kill you." But he tempers this by the bright
	alternative, that if they do, through the Spirit, mortify the deeds
	of the body, such a course will infallibly terminate in "life"
	everlasting. And this leads the apostle into a new line of thought,
	opening into his final subject, the "glory" awaiting the
	justified believer. 
	</p>
<p><i>Note,</i> (1) "There can
	be no <i>safety,</i> no holiness, no happiness, to those who are out
	of Christ: No "safety," because all such are under the
	condemnation of the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1">Romans 8:1</span>);
	no <i>holiness,</i> because such only as are united to Christ have
	the spirit of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span>);
	no <i>happiness,</i> because to be "carnally minded is death"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:6">Romans 8:6</span>)" [HODGE].
	(2) The sanctification of believers, as it has its whole foundation
	in the atoning death, so it has its living spring in the indwelling
	of the Spirit of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:6- :">Romans 8:6- :</span>). (3) "The bent of the thoughts, affections, and
	pursuits, is the only decisive test of character (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:6- :">Romans 8:6- :</span>)" [HODGE].
	(4) No human refinement of the carnal mind will make it spiritual, or
	compensate for the absence of spirituality. "Flesh" and
	"spirit" are essentially and unchangeably opposed; nor can
	the carnal mind, as such, be brought into real subjection to the law
	of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:5-7">Romans 8:5-7</span>). Hence
	(5) the estrangement of God and the sinner is mutual. For as the
	sinner's state of mind is "enmity against God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:5-45.8.7- :">Romans 8:5-45.8.7- :</span>), so in this state he "cannot please God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:5-45.8.7- :">Romans 8:5-45.8.7- :</span>). (6) Since the Holy Ghost is, in the same breath, called
	indiscriminately "the Spirit of God," "the Spirit of
	Christ," and "Christ" Himself (as an indwelling life
	in believers), the <i>essential unity</i> and yet Personal
	<i>distinctness</i> of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, m the
	one adorable Godhead must be believed, as the only consistent
	explanation of such language (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:5-45.8.7- :">Romans 8:5-45.8.7- :</span>). (7) The consciousness of spiritual life in our renewed
	souls is a glorious assurance of resurrection life in the body also,
	in virtue of the same quickening Spirit whose inhabitation we already
	enjoy (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span>). (8) Whatever
	professions of spiritual life men may make, it remains eternally true
	that "if we live after the flesh we shall die," and only
	"if we through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body we
	shall live" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:13">Romans 8:13</span>, and
