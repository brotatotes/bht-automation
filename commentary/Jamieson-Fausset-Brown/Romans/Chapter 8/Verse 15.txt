<p><b>to fear</b>—as under the
	law which "worketh wrath," that is, "Such was your

	incessant forebodings under a sense of unpardoned sin. But it was not

<p><b>we cry, Abba, Father</b>—The
	word "cry" is emphatic, expressing the spontaneousness, the
	strength, and the exuberance of the final emotions. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> this cry is said to proceed from <i>the Spirit</i> in us,
	drawing forth the filial exclamation in our hearts. Here, it is said
	to proceed from <i>our own hearts</i> under the vitalizing energy of
	the Spirit, as the very element of the new life in believers (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:19">Matthew 10:19</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:20">Matthew 10:20</span>;
	and see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:20- :">Matthew 10:20- :</span>). "Abba"
	is the <i>Syro-Chaldaic</i> word for "Father"; and the
	<i>Greek</i> word for that is added, not surely to tell the reader
	that both mean the same thing, but for the same reason which drew
	both words from the lips of Christ Himself during his agony in the
	garden (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:36">Mark 14:36</span>). He,
	doubtless, loved to utter His Father's name in both the accustomed
	forms; beginning with His cherished mother tongue, and adding that of
	the learned. In this view the use of both words here has a charming
	simplicity and warmth.</p>
