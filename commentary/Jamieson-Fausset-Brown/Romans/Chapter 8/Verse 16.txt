<p><b>16. The Spirit itself</b>—It
	should be "Himself" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>beareth witness with our
	spirit, that we are the children</b>—"are children" 
	</p>
<p><b>of God</b>—The testimony of
	our own spirit is borne in that cry of <i>conscious sonship,</i>
	"Abba, Father"; but we are not therein alone; for the Holy
	Ghost within us, yea, even in that very cry which it is His to draw
	forth, sets His own distinct seal to ours; and thus, "in the
	mouth of two witnesses" the thing is established. The apostle
	had before called us "<i>sons</i> of God," referring to our
	<i>adoption;</i> here the word changes to "children,"
	referring to our <i>new birth.</i> The one expresses the <i>dignity</i>
	to which we are <i>admitted;</i> the other the new <i>life</i> which
	we <i>receive.</i> The latter is more suitable here; because a son by
	<i>adoption</i> might not be heir of the property, whereas a son by
	<i>birth</i> certainly is, and this is what the apostle is now coming
	to.</p>
