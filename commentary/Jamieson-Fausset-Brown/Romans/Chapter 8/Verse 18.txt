	of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory
	which shall be revealed in us</b>â€”that is, "True, we must
	suffer with Christ, if we would partake of His glory; but what of
	that? For if such sufferings are set over against the coming glory,
	they sink into insignificance."</p>
