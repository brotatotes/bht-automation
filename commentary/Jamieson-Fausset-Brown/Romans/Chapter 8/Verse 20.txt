20. For the creature—"the
	creation." 
	was made subject to vanity,
	not willingly—that is, through no natural principle of decay.
	The apostle, personifying creation, represents it as only submitting
	to the vanity with which it was smitten, on man's account, in
	obedience to that superior power which had mysteriously linked its
	destinies with man's. And so he adds 
	but by reason of him who hath
	subjected the same —"who subjected
	it." 
	in hope—or "in
	hope that."
