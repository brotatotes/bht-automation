21. Because the creature itself
	also—"even the creation itself." 
	shall be delivered from the
	bondage of corruption—its bondage to the principle of decay. 
	into the glorious
	liberty—rather, "the liberty of the glory." 
	of the children of God—that
	is, the creation itself shall, in a glorious sense, be delivered into
	that freedom from debility and decay in which the children of God,
	when raised up in glory, shall expatiate: into this freedom from
	corruptibility the creation itself shall, in a glorious sense, be
	delivered (So CALVIN,
	BEZA, BENGEL,
	THOLUCK, OLSHAUSEN,
	DE WETTE,
	MEYER, PHILIPPI,
	HODGE, ALFORD,
