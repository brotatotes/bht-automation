<p><b>22. For we know that the whole
	creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now</b>â€”If
	for man's sake alone the earth was cursed, it cannot surprise us that
	it should share in his recovery. And if so, to represent it as
	sympathizing with man's miseries, and as looking forward to his
	complete redemption as the period of its own emancipation from its
	present sin-blighted condition, is a beautiful thought, and in
	harmony with the general teaching of Scripture on the subject. (See
