24. For we are saved by hope—rather,
	"For in hope we are saved"; that is, it is more a salvation
	in hope than as yet in actual possession. 
	but hope that is seen is not
	hope—for the very meaning of hope is, the expectation that
	something now future will become present.
for what a man seeth, why
	doth he yet hope for?—the latter ending when the other comes.
