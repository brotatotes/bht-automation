<p><b>24. For we are saved by hope</b>—rather,
	"For in hope we are saved"; that is, it is more a salvation
	in hope than as yet in actual possession. 
	</p>
<p><b>but hope that is seen is not
	hope</b>—for the very meaning of hope is, the expectation that
	something now <i>future</i> will become <i>present.</i>
</p>
<p><b>for what a man seeth, why
	doth he yet hope for?</b>—the latter ending when the other comes.</p>
