28. And—or, "Moreover,"
	or "Now"; noting a transition to a new particular. 
	we know, c.—The order
	in the original is more striking: "We know that to them that
	love God" (compare 1 Corinthians 2:9
Ephesians 6:24; James 1:12;
	James 2:5) "all things work
	together for good [even] to them who are the called (rather, 'who are
	called') according to His (eternal) purpose." Glorious
	assurance! And this, it seems, was a "household word," a
	"known" thing, among believers. This working of all things
	for good is done quite naturally to "them that love God,"
	because such souls, persuaded that He who gave His own Son for them
	cannot but mean them well in all His procedure, learn thus to take in
	good part whatever He sends them, however trying to flesh and blood:
	and to them who are the called, according to "His purpose,"
	all things do in the same intelligible way "work together for
	good"; for, even when "He hath His way in the whirlwind,"
	they see "His chariot paved with love" (James 2:5- :). And knowing that it is in pursuance of an eternal
	"purpose" of love that they have been "called
	into the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ" (James 2:5- :), they naturally say within themselves, "It cannot be
	that He 'of whom, and through whom, and to whom are all things,'
	should suffer that purpose to be thwarted by anything really adverse
	to us, or that He should not make all things, dark as well as light,
	crooked as well as straight, to co-operate to the furtherance and
	final completion of His high design."
