<p><b>30. Moreover</b>—"And,"
	or "Now"; explanatory of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> —In "predestinating us to be conformed to the image
	of His Son" in final glory, He settled all the successive steps
	of it. Thus 
	</p>
<p><b>whom he did predestinate,
	them he also called</b>—The word "called" (as HODGE
	and others truly observe) is never in the Epistles of the New
	Testament applied to those who have only the <i>outward invitation</i>
	of the Gospel (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:16">Matthew 20:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:14">Matthew 22:14</span>). It always means
	"<i>internally, effectually, savingly called.</i>" It
	denotes the <i>first great step</i> in personal salvation and answers
	to "conversion." Only the word <i>conversion</i> expresses
	the <i>change of character</i> which then takes place, whereas this
	"calling" expresses the <i>divine authorship</i> of the
	change, and the <i>sovereign power</i> by which we are summoned,
	Matthew-like, Zaccheus-like, out of our old, wretched, perishing
	condition, into a new, safe, blessed life.

<p><b>and whom he called</b>—thus.
	</p>
<p><b>them he also
	justified</b>—brought into the definite state of reconciliation
	already so fully described. 
	</p>
<p><b>and whom he justified, them
	he also glorified</b>—brought to final glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:18">Romans 8:18</span>). Noble climax, and so
	rhythmically expressed! And all this is viewed as past; because,
	starting from the past decree of "predestination to be conformed
	to the image of God's Son" of which the other steps are but the
	successive unfoldings—all is beheld as one entire, eternally
	completed salvation.</p>
