	more than conquerors, through him that loved us</b>â€”not, "We
	are so far from being conquered by them, that they do us much good"
	[HODGE]; for though this
	be true, the word means simply, "We are pre-eminently
	conquerors." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.
	And so far are they from "separating us from Christ's love,"
	that it is just "through Him that loved us" that we are
	victorious over them.</p>
