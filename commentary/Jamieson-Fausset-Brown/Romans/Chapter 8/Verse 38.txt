<p><b>38, 39. For I am persuaded, that
	neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
	powers</b>—whether good or bad. But as the bad are not called
	"angels," or "principalities," or "powers,"
	save with some addition to show that such are meant (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:41">Matthew 25:41</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:15">Colossians 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:4">2 Peter 2:4</span> —except perhaps <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:4- :">2 Peter 2:4- :</span>), probably the <i>good</i> are meant here, but merely as the
	same apostle <i>supposes</i> an angel from heaven to preach a false
	gospel. (So the best interpreters). 
	</p>
<p><b>nor things present, nor
	things to come</b>—no condition of the present life and none of the
	unknown possibilities of the life to come.</p>
