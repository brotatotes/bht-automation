38, 39. For I am persuaded, that
	neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
	powers—whether good or bad. But as the bad are not called
	"angels," or "principalities," or "powers,"
	save with some addition to show that such are meant (Matthew 25:41;
	Colossians 2:15; Ephesians 6:12;
	2 Peter 2:4 —except perhaps 2 Peter 2:4- :), probably the good are meant here, but merely as the
	same apostle supposes an angel from heaven to preach a false
	gospel. (So the best interpreters). 
	nor things present, nor
	things to come—no condition of the present life and none of the
	unknown possibilities of the life to come.
