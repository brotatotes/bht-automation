<p><b>4. That the righteousness of the
	law</b>—"the righteous demand," "the requirement"
	[ALFORD], Or "the
	precept" of the law; for it is not precisely the word so often
	used in this Epistle to denote "the righteousness which
	justifies" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:21">Romans 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:5">Romans 4:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:6">Romans 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:21">Romans 5:21</span>),
	but another form of the same word, intended to express the <i>enactment</i>
	of the law, meaning here, we believe, the practical obedience which
	the law calls for. 
	</p>
<p><b>might be fulfilled in us</b>—or,
	as we say, "<i>realized</i> in us." 
	</p>
<p><b>who walk</b>—the most
	ancient expression of <i>the bent of one's life,</i> whether in the
	direction of good or of evil (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:15">Genesis 48:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+1:1">Psalms 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:5">Isaiah 2:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mic+4:5">Micah 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17">Ephesians 4:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:6">1 John 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>not after</b>—that is,
	according to the dictates of 
	</p>
<p><b>the flesh, but after the
	spirit</b>—From <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span> it
	would seem that what is more immediately intended by "the
	spirit" here is <i>our own mind</i> as renewed and actuated by
	the Holy Ghost.</p>
