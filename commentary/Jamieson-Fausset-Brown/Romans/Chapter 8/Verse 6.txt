6. For—a mere particle of
	transition here [THOLUCK],
	like "but" or "now." 
	to be carnally
	minded—literally, "the mind" or "minding of the
	flesh" (Margin); that is, the pursuit of fleshly ends. 
	is death—not only "ends
	in" [ALFORD, c.], but
	even now "is" carrying death into its bosom, so that such
	are "dead while they live" (1 Timothy 5:6;
	Ephesians 2:1; Ephesians 2:5)
	[PHILIPPI]. 
	but to be spiritually
	minded—"the mind" or "minding of the spirit";
	that is, the pursuit of spiritual objects. 
	is life and peace—not
	"life" only, in contrast with the "death" that is
	in the other pursuit, but "peace"; it is the very element
	of the soul's deepest repose and true bliss.
