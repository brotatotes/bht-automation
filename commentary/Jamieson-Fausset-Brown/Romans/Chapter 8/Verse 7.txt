<p><b>7. Because the carnal mind is enmity
	against God</b>—The desire and pursuit of carnal ends is a state of

<p><b>for it is not subject</b>—"doth
	not submit itself."

	indeed can be</b>—In such a state of mind there neither is nor can
	be the least subjection to the law of God. Many things may be done
	which the law requires, but nothing either is or can be done <i>because</i>
	God's law requires it, or purely to please God.</p>
