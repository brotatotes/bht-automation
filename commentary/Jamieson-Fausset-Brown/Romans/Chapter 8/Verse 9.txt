<p><b>9. But ye are not in the flesh, but
	in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you</b>—This
	does not mean, "if the <i>disposition</i> or <i>mind</i> of God
	dwell in you"; but "if <i>the Holy Ghost</i> dwell in you"
	(see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:11">1 Corinthians 6:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:19">1 Corinthians 6:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>, c.). (It thus appears
	that to be "in the spirit" means here to be under the
	dominion of <i>our own renewed mind</i> because the indwelling of
	God's Spirit is given as the evidence that we are "in the
	spirit"). 
	</p>
<p><b>Now</b>—"But." 
	</p>
<p><b>if any man have not the
	Spirit of Christ</b>—Again, this does not mean "the
	<i>disposition</i> or <i>mind</i> of Christ," but the Holy
	Ghost; here called "the Spirit of Christ," just as He is
	called "the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16- :">1 Corinthians 3:16- :</span>). It is as "the Spirit of Christ" that the Holy
	Ghost takes possession of believers, introducing into them all the
	gracious, dove-like disposition which dwelt in Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:34">John 3:34</span>). Now if any man's heart
	be void, not of such dispositions, but of the blessed Author of them,
	"the Spirit of Christ." 
	</p>
<p><b>he is none of his</b>—even
	though intellectually convinced of the truth of Christianity, and in
	a general sense influence by its spirit. Sharp, solemn statement
	this!</p>
