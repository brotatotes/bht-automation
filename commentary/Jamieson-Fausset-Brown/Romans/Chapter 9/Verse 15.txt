<p><b>15. For he saith to Moses</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>I will have mercy on whom I
	will have</b>—"on whom I have" 
	</p>
<p><b>mercy, and I will have
	compassion on whom I will have</b>—"on whom I have" 
	</p>
<p><b>compassion</b>—"There
	can be no unrighteousness in God's choosing whom He will, for to
	Moses He expressly claims the right to do so." Yet it is worthy
	of notice that this is expressed in the positive rather than the
	negative form: not, "I will have mercy on <i>none but</i> whom I
	will"; but, "I will have mercy on <i>whomsoever</i> I
	will."</p>
