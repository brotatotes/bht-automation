16. So then it is not of him that
	willeth—hath the inward desire
nor of him that
	runneth—maketh active effort (compare 1 Corinthians 9:24;
	1 Corinthians 9:26; Philippians 2:16;
	Philippians 3:14). Both these are
	indispensable to salvation, yet salvation is owing to neither, but is
	purely "of God that showeth mercy." See on Philippians 3:14- :, "Work out your own salvation with fear and
	trembling: for it is God which, out of His own good pleasure,
	worketh in you both to will and to do."
