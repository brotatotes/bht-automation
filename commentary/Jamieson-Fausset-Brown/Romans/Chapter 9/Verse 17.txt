<p><b>17. For the scripture saith to
	Pharaoh</b>—observe here the light in which the Scripture is viewed
	by the apostle. 
	</p>
<p><b>Even for this same</b>—"this
	very" 
	</p>
<p><b>purpose have I raised</b>—"raised
	I" 
	</p>
<p><b>thee up,</b> c.—The apostle
	had shown that God claims the right to choose whom He will: here he
	shows by an example that God punishes whom He will. But "God did
	not make Pharaoh wicked He only forbore to make him good, by the
	exercise of special and altogether unmerited grace" [HODGE].
	</p>
<p><b>that I might</b>—"may"
	</p>
<p><b>show my power in thee</b>—It
	was not that Pharaoh was worse than others that he was so dealt with,
	but "in order that he might become a monument of the penal
	justice of God, and it was with a view to this that God provided that
	the evil which was in him should be manifested in this definite form"
	[OLSHAUSEN]. 
	</p>
<p><b>and that my name might</b>—"may"
	</p>
<p><b>be declared</b>—"proclaimed"
	</p>
<p><b>in all the earth</b>—"This
	is the principle on which all punishment is inflicted, that the true
	character of the Divine Lawgiver should be known. This is of all
	objects, where God is concerned, the highest and most important; in
	itself the most worthy, and in its results the most beneficent"
	[HODGE].</p>
