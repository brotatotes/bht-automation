<p><b>doth he yet find fault? for
	who hath resisted</b>—"Who resisteth" 
	</p>
<p><b>his will?</b>—that is,
	"<i>This doctrine is incompatible with human responsibility</i>";
	If God chooses and rejects, pardons and punishes, whom He pleases,
	why are those blamed who, if rejected by Him, cannot help sinning and
	perishing? This objection shows quite as conclusively as the former
	the real nature of the doctrine objected to—that it is Election and
	Non-election to eternal salvation prior to any difference of personal
	character; this is the only doctrine that could suggest the objection
	here stated, and to this doctrine the objection <i>is</i> plausible.
	What now is the apostle's answer? It is twofold. <i>First:</i> "It
	is irreverence and presumption in the creature to arraign the
	Creator."</p>
