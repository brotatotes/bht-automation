<p><b>21. Hath not the potter power over
	the clay; of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and
	another to dishonour?</b>â€”"The objection is founded on
	ignorance or misapprehension of the relation between God and His
	sinful creatures; supposing that He is under obligation to extend His
	grace to all, whereas He is under obligation to none. All are
	sinners, and have forfeited every claim to His mercy; it is therefore
	perfectly competent to God to spare one and not another, to make one
	vessel to honor and another to dishonor. But it is to be borne in
	mind that Paul does not here speak of God's right over His creatures
	<i>as creatures,</i> but <i>as sinful creatures:</i> as he himself
	clearly intimates in the next verses. It is the cavil of a sinful
	creature against his Creator that he is answering, and be does so by
	showing that God is under no obligation to give His grace to any, but
	is as sovereign as in fashioning the clay" [HODGE].
	But, <i>Second:</i> "There is nothing unjust in such
	sovereignty."</p>
