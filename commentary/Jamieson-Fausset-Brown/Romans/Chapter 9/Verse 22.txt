<p><b>22, 23. What if God, willing to
	show</b>—"designing to manifest" 
	</p>
<p><b>his wrath</b>—His holy
	displeasure against sin. 
	</p>
<p><b>and to make his power</b>—to
	punish it 
	</p>
<p><b>known endured with much
	long-suffering the vessels of wrath</b>—that is, "destined to
	wrath"; just as "vessels of mercy," in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, mean "vessels destined to mercy"; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "children of wrath." 
	</p>
<p><b>fitted for destruction</b>—It
	is well remarked by STUART
	that the "difficulties which such statements involve are not to
	be got rid of by softening the language of one text, while so many
	others meet us which are of the same tenor; and even if we give up
	the Bible itself, so long as we acknowledge an omnipotent and
	omniscient God we cannot abate in the least degree from any of the
	difficulties which such texts make." Be it observed, however,
	that if God, as the apostle teaches, expressly "designed to
	manifest His wrath, and to make His power (in the way of wrath)
	known," it could only be by punishing some, while He pardons
	others; and if the choice between the two classes was not to be
	founded, as our apostle also teaches, on their own doings but on
	God's good pleasure, the decision behooved ultimately to rest with
	God. Yet, even in the necessary punishment of the wicked, as HODGE
	observes, so far from proceeding with undue severity, the apostle
	would have it remarked that God "endures with much
	long-suffering" those objects of His righteous displeasure.</p>
