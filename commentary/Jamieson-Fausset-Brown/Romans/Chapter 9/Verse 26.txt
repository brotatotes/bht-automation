<p><b>26. And</b>—another quotation from
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ho+1:10">Hosea 1:10</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>it shall come to pass, that
	in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there
	shall they be called the children</b>—"called sons" 
	</p>
<p><b>of the living God</b>—The
	expression, "in the place where . . . there," seems
	designed only to give greater emphasis to the gracious change here
	announced, from divine exclusion to divine admission to the
	privileges of the people of God.</p>
