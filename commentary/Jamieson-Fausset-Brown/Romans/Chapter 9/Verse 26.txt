26. And—another quotation from
	Hosea 1:10. 
	it shall come to pass, that
	in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there
	shall they be called the children—"called sons" 
	of the living God—The
	expression, "in the place where . . . there," seems
	designed only to give greater emphasis to the gracious change here
	announced, from divine exclusion to divine admission to the
	privileges of the people of God.
