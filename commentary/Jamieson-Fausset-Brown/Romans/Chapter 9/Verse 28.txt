28. For he will finish the work, and
	cut—"is finishing the reckoning, and cutting it" 
	it short in righteousness;
	because a short work—"reckoning" 
	will the Lord make upon the
	earth— (Isaiah 10:22; Isaiah 10:23),
	as in the Septuagint. The sense given to these words by the
	apostle may seem to differ from that intended by the prophet. But the
	sameness of sentiment in both places will at once appear, if we
	understand those words of the prophet, "the consumption decreed
	shall overflow with righteousness," to mean that while a remnant
	of Israel should be graciously spared to return from captivity, "the
	decreed consumption" of the impenitent majority should be
	"replete with righteousness," or illustriously display
	God's righteous vengeance against sin. The "short reckoning"
	seems to mean the speedy completing of His word, both in cutting off
	the one portion and saving the other.
