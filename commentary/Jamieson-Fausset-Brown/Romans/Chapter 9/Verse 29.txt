	probably in an earlier part of his book, namely, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.

<p><b>Except the Lord of
	Sabaoth</b>—that is, "The Lord of Hosts": the word is
	<i>Hebrew,</i> but occurs so in the Epistle of James (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and has thence become naturalized in our Christian
	phraseology.

<p><b>had left us a seed</b>—meaning
	a "remnant"; small at first, but in due time to be a seed
	of plenty (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:30">Psalms 22:30</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:31">Psalms 22:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:12">Isaiah 6:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:13">Isaiah 6:13</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>we had been</b>—"become"
	</p>
<p><b>as Sodom,</b> &amp;c.—But
	for this precious seed, the chosen people would have resembled the
	cities of the plain, both in degeneracy of character and in merited
	doom.</p>
