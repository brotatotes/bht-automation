<p><b>31. But Israel, which
	followed</b>—"following" 
	</p>
<p><b>after the law of
	righteousness, hath not attained</b>—"attained not" 
	</p>
<p><b>unto the law of
	righteousness</b>—The word "law" is used here, we think,
	in the same sense as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span>,
	to denote "a principle of action"; that is, "Israel,
	though sincerely and steadily aiming at acceptance with God,
	nevertheless missed it."</p>
