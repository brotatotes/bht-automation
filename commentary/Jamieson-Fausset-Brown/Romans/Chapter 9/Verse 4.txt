4. Who are Israelites—See
	Romans 11:1; 2 Corinthians 11:22;
	Philippians 3:5. 
	to whom pertaineth—"whose
	is" 
	the adoption—It is true
	that, compared with the new economy, the old was a state of minority
	and pupilage, and so far that of a bond-servant (Philippians 3:5- :); yet, compared with the state of the surrounding heathen,
	the choice of Abraham and his seed was a real separation of them to
	be a Family of God (Exodus 4:22;
	Deuteronomy 32:6; Isaiah 1:2;
	Jeremiah 31:9; Hosea 11:1;
	Malachi 1:6). 
	and the glory—that
	"glory of the Lord," or "visible token of the Divine
	Presence in the midst of them," which rested on the ark and
	filled the tabernacle during all their wanderings in the wilderness;
	which in Jerusalem continued to be seen in the tabernacle and temple,
	and only disappeared when, at the Captivity, the temple was
	demolished, and the sun of the ancient economy began to go down. This
	was what the Jews called the "Shekinah." 
	and the covenants—"the
	covenants of promise" to which the Gentiles before Christ were
	"strangers" (Ephesians 2:12);
	meaning the one covenant with Abraham in its successive
	renewals (see Galatians 3:16;
	Galatians 3:17). 
	and the giving of the
	law—from Mount Sinai, and the possession of it thereafter,
	which the Jews justly deemed their peculiar honor (Deuteronomy 26:18;
	Deuteronomy 26:19; Psalms 147:19;
	Psalms 147:20; Romans 2:17).
	and the service of God—or,
	of the sanctuary, meaning the whole divinely instituted religious
	service, in the celebration of which they were brought so nigh unto
	God. 
	and the promises—the
	great Abrahamic promises, successively unfolded, and which had their
	fulfilment only in Christ; (see Hebrews 7:6;
	Galatians 3:16; Galatians 3:21;
	Acts 26:6; Acts 26:7).
