<p><b>5. Whose are the fathers</b>—here,
	probably, the three great fathers of the covenant—Abraham, Isaac,
	and Jacob—by whom God condescended to name Himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+8:6">Exodus 8:6</span>;

	</p>
<p><b>who is over all, God</b>—rather,

<p><b>blessed for ever. Amen</b>—To
	get rid of the bright testimony here borne to the supreme divinity of
	Christ, various expedients have been adopted: (1) To place a period,
	either after the words "concerning the flesh Christ came,"
	rendering the next clause as a doxology to the Father—"God who
	is over all be blessed for ever"; or after the word "all"—thus,
	"Christ came, who is over all: God be blessed.", c.
	[ERASMUS, LOCKE,
	FRITZSCHE, MEYER,
	JOWETT, &amp;c.]. But it
	is fatal to this view, as even <i>Socinus</i> admits, that in other
	Scripture doxologies the word "Blessed" <i>precedes</i> the
	name of God on whom the blessing is invoked (thus: "Blessed be
	God," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:35">Psalms 68:35</span> "Blessed
	be the Lord God, the God of Israel," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:35- :">Psalms 68:35- :</span>). Besides, any such doxology here would be "unmeaning
	and frigid in the extreme"; the sad subject on which he was
	entering suggesting anything but a doxology, even in connection with
	Christ's Incarnation [ALFORD].
	(2) To transpose the words rendered "who is"; in which case
	the rendering would be, "whose (that is, the fathers') is Christ
	according to the flesh" [CRELLIUS,
	WHISTON, TAYLOR,
	WHITBY]. But this is a
	desperate expedient, in the face of all manuscript authority; as is
	also the conjecture of GROTIUS
	and others, that the word "God" should be omitted from the
	text. It remains then, that we have here no doxology at all, but a
	naked statement of fact, that while Christ is "of" the
	Israelitish nation "<i>as concerning the flesh,</i>" He is,
	<i>in another respect,</i> "God over all, blessed for ever."
	(In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:31">2 Corinthians 11:31</span> the very <i>Greek</i>
	phrase which is here rendered "who is," is used in the same
	sense; and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:25">Romans 1:25</span>,
	<i>Greek</i>). In this view of the passage, as a testimony to the
	supreme divinity of Christ, besides all the orthodox fathers, some of
	the ablest modern critics concur [BENGEL,
	THOLUCK, STUART,
	OLSHAUSEN, PHILIPPI,
	ALFORD, &amp;c.]</p>
