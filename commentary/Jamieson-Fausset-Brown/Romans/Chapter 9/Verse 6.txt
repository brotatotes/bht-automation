<p><b>6. Not as though the word of God had
	taken none effect</b>—"hath fallen to the ground," that
	is, failed: compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:17">Luke 16:17</span>,
	<i>Greek.</i>
</p>
<p><b>for they are not all Israel
	which are of Israel</b>—better, "for not all they which are of
	Israel are Israel." <i>Here the apostle enters upon the profound
	subject of</i> ELECTION,
	the treatment of which extends to the end of the eleventh
	chapter—"Think not that I mourn over the total loss of Israel;
	for that would involve the failure of God's word to Abraham; but not
	all that belong to the natural seed, and go under the name of
	'Israel,' are <i>the</i> Israel of God's irrevocable choice."
	The difficulties which encompass this subject lie not in the
	apostle's teaching, which is plain enough, but in the truths
	themselves, the evidence for which, taken by themselves, is
	overwhelming, but whose perfect harmony is beyond human comprehension
	in the present state. The great source of error here lies in hastily
	inferring (as THOLUCK and
	others), from the apostle's taking tip, at the close of this chapter,
	the calling of the Gentiles in connection with the rejection of
	Israel, and continuing this subject through the two next chapters,
	that the Election treated of in the body of this chapter is <i>national,</i>
	not <i>personal</i> Election, and consequently is Election merely to
	<i>religious advantages,</i> not to <i>eternal salvation.</i> In that
	case, the argument of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:6">Romans 9:6</span>,
	with which the subject of Election opens, would be this: "The
	choice of Abraham and his seed has not failed; because though Israel
	has been rejected, <i>the Gentiles</i> have taken their place; and
	God has a right to choose what nation He will to the privileges of
	His visible kingdom." But so far from this, the Gentiles are not
	so much as mentioned at all till towards the close of the chapter;
	and the argument of this verse is, that "all Israel <i>is not</i>
	rejected, but only a portion of it, the remainder being <i>the</i>
	'Israel' whom God has chosen in the exercise of His sovereign right."
	And that this is a choice not to mere external privileges, but to
	eternal salvation, will abundantly appear from what follows.</p>
