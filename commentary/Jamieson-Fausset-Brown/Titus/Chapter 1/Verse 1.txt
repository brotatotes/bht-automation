<p><b>1. servant of God</b>—not found
	elsewhere in the same connection. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> it is "servant of Jesus Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:10">Galatians 1:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:17">Acts 16:17</span>;

	In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>, there follows,
	"called to be an <i>apostle,</i>" which corresponds to the
	general designation of the office first, "<i>servant of</i>
	GOD," here, followed
	by the special description, "<i>apostle</i> of <i>Jesus Christ.</i>"
	The full expression of his apostolic office answers, in both
	Epistles, to the design, and is a comprehensive index to the
	contents. The <i>peculiar</i> form here would never have proceeded
	from a forger. 
	</p>
<p><b>according to the
	faith</b>—rather, "for," "with a view to subserve
	the faith"; this is the object of my apostleship (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:4">Titus 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:9">Titus 1:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5">Romans 1:5</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the elect</b>—for whose
	sake we ought to endure all things (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5- :">Romans 1:5- :</span>). This election has its ground, not in anything belonging to
	those thus distinguished, but in the purpose and will of God from
	everlasting (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:30-33">Romans 8:30-33</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:7">Luke 18:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12">Colossians 3:12</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12- :">Colossians 3:12- :</span> shows that all faith on the part of the elect, rests on the
	divine foreordination: they do not become <i>elect</i> by their
	faith, but receive <i>faith,</i> and so become believers, because
	they are <i>elect.</i>
</p>
<p><b>and the acknowledging of the
	truth</b>—"and (for promoting) the <i>full knowledge</i> of
	the truth," that is, the Christian truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12- :">Colossians 3:12- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>after godliness</b>—that
	is, which belongs to <i>piety:</i> opposed to the knowledge which has
	not for its object the truth, but error, doctrinal and practical
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:11">Titus 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:16">Titus 1:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:3">1 Timothy 6:3</span>); or even which has for
	its object mere earthly truth, not growth in the divine life.
	"Godliness," or "piety," is a term peculiar to
	the Pastoral Epistles: a fact explained by the apostle having in them
	to combat doctrine tending to "ungodliness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:3- :">1 Timothy 6:3- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:11">Titus 2:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:12">Titus 2:12</span>).</p>
