<p><b>12. One</b>—Epimenides of Phæstus,
	or Gnossus, in Crete, about 600. He was sent for to purify Athens
	from its pollution occasioned by Cylon. He was regarded as a diviner
	and <i>prophet.</i> The words here are taken probably from his
	treatise "<i>concerning oracles.</i>" Paul also quotes from
	two other heathen writers, ARATUS
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:28">Acts 17:28</span>) and MENANDER
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:33">1 Corinthians 15:33</span>), but he does not
	honor them so far as even to mention their names. 
	</p>
<p><b>of themselves . . . their
	own</b>—which enhances his authority as a witness. "To
	Cretanize" was proverbial for <i>to lie:</i> as "to
	Corinthianize" was for <i>to be dissolute.</i>
</p>
<p><b>alway liars</b>—not merely
	<i>at times,</i> as every natural man is. Contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:33- :">1 Corinthians 15:33- :</span>, "God that <i>cannot lie.</i>" They love "fables"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:14">Titus 1:14</span>); even the heathen
	poets laughed at their lying assertion that they had in their country
	the sepulchre of Jupiter. 
	</p>
<p><b>evil beasts</b>—rude,
	savage, cunning, greedy. Crete was <i>a country without wild beasts.</i>
	Epimenides' sarcasm was that its human inhabitants supplied the place
	of wild beasts. 
	</p>
<p><b>slow bellies</b>—indolent
	through pampering their bellies. <i>They themselves</i> are called
	"bellies," for that is the member for which they live
