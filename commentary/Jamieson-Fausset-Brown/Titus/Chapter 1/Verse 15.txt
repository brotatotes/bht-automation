	pure" in themselves; the distinction of pure and impure
	is not in the things, but in the disposition of him who uses them; in
	opposition to "the commandments of men" ( :-), which forbade certain things as if impure intrinsically.
	"To the pure" inwardly, that is, those purified in heart by
	faith (Acts 15:9; Romans 14:20;
	1 Timothy 4:3), all outward things are
	pure; all are open to, their use. Sin alone touches and defiles the
	soul (Matthew 23:26; Luke 11:41).

	mind—their mental sense
	and intelligence. 
	conscience—their moral
	consciousness of the conformity or discrepancy between their motives
	and acts on the one hand, and God's law on the other. A conscience
	and a mind defiled are represented as the source of the errors
	opposed in the Pastoral Epistles (1 Timothy 1:19;
	1 Timothy 3:9; 1 Timothy 6:5).
