<p><b>15. all things</b>—external, "are
	pure" in themselves; the distinction of <i>pure</i> and <i>impure</i>
	is not in the things, but in the disposition of him who uses them; in
	opposition to "the commandments of men" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), which forbade certain things as if impure intrinsically.
	"To the pure" inwardly, that is, those purified in heart by
	<i>faith</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:9">Acts 15:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:20">Romans 14:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:3">1 Timothy 4:3</span>), all outward things are
	pure; all are open to, their use. Sin alone touches and defiles the
	soul (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:26">Matthew 23:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:41">Luke 11:41</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>nothing pure</b>—either
	within or without (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</span>).

<p><b>mind</b>—their mental sense
	and intelligence. 
	</p>
<p><b>conscience</b>—their moral
	consciousness of the conformity or discrepancy between their motives
	and acts on the one hand, and God's law on the other. A conscience
	and a mind defiled are represented as the source of the errors
	opposed in the Pastoral Epistles (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:19">1 Timothy 1:19</span>;
