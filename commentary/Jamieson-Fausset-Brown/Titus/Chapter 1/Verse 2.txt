<p><b>2. In hope of eternal life</b>—connected
	with the whole preceding sentence. That whereon rests my aim as an
	apostle to promote <i>the elect's faith and full knowledge of the
	truth,</i> is, "the hope of eternal life" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:7">Titus 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:6">Acts 23:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:15">Acts 24:15</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>that cannot lie</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:4">Romans 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:29">Romans 11:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:18">Hebrews 6:18</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>promised before the world
	began</b>—a contracted expression for "<i>purposed</i> before
	the world began (literally, 'before the ages of time'), and <i>promised</i>
	actually in time," the promise springing from the eternal
	purpose; as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>, the <i>gift</i>
	of grace was the result of the eternal purpose "before the world
	began."</p>
