<p><b>5. I left thee</b>—"I left
	thee <i>behind</i>" [ALFORD]
	when I left the island: <i>not</i> implying <i>permanence</i> of
	commission (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in Crete</b>—now Candia. 
	</p>
<p><b>set in order</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "that thou mightest <i>follow up</i> (the work
	begun by me), setting right the things that are wanting," which
	I was unable to complete by reason of the shortness of my stay in
	Crete. Christianity, doubtless, had long existed in Crete: there were
	some Cretans among those who heard Peter's preaching on Pentecost (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3- :">1 Timothy 1:3- :</span>). The number of Jews in Crete was large (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3- :">1 Timothy 1:3- :</span>), and it is likely that those scattered in the persecution
	of Stephen (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span>) preached
	to them, as they did to the Jews of Cyprus, c. Paul also was there on
	his voyage to Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19- :">Acts 11:19- :</span>). By all these instrumentalities the Gospel was sure to
	reach Crete. But until Paul's later visit, after his first
	imprisonment at Rome, the Cretan Christians were without Church
	organization. This Paul began, and had commissioned (before leaving
	Crete) Titus to go on with, and now reminds him of that commission.

<p><b>ordain</b>—rather,
	"appoint," "constitute." 
	</p>
<p><b>in every city</b>—"from
	city to city." 
	</p>
<p><b>as I . . . appointed
	thee</b>—that is, as I directed thee prescribing as well the <i>act</i>
	of constituting elders, as also the <i>manner</i> of doing so, which
	latter includes the qualifications required in a presbyter presently
	stated. Those called "elders" here are called "bishops"
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</span>. <i>Elder</i> is the
	term of <i>dignity</i> in relation to the college of presbyters;
	<i>bishop</i> points to the <i>duties</i> of his office in relation
	to the flock. From the unsound state of the Cretan Christians
	described here, we see the danger of the want of Church government.
	The appointment of presbyters was designed to check idle <i>talk</i>
	and speculation, by setting forth the "faithful word."</p>
