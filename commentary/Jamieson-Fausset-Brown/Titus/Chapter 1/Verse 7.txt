<p><b>7. For . . . must</b>—The emphasis
	is on "must." The reason why I said "blameless,"
	is the very idea of a "bishop" (an overseer of the flock;
	he here substitutes for "presbyter" the term which
	expresses his <i>duties</i>) involves the <i>necessity</i> for such
	blamelessness, if he is to have influence over the flock.

<p><b>steward of God</b>—The
	greater the master is, the greater the virtues required in His
	servant [BENGEL], (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); the Church is God's house, over which the minister is set
	as a steward (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:2-6">Hebrews 3:2-6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:10">1 Peter 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:17">1 Peter 4:17</span>).
	Note: ministers are not merely <i>Church</i> officers, but God's
	stewards; Church government is of divine appointment. 
	</p>
<p><b>not self-willed</b>—literally,
	"self-pleasing"; unaccommodating to others; <i>harsh,</i>
	the opposite of "a lover of hospitality" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:17- :">1 Peter 4:17- :</span>); so Nabal (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:17- :">1 Peter 4:17- :</span>); self-loving and imperious; such a spirit would
	incapacitate him for <i>leading</i> a willing flock, instead of
	<i>driving.</i>

<p><b>not given to wine</b>—(See
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:17- :">1 Peter 4:17- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:17- :">1 Peter 4:17- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>not given to filthy lucre</b>—not
	making the Gospel a means of gain (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:3">1 Timothy 3:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8">1 Timothy 3:8</span>). In opposition to those
	"teaching for filthy lucre's sake" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:11">Titus 1:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:5">1 Timothy 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:2">1 Peter 5:2</span>).</p>
