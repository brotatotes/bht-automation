<p><b>10. Not purloining</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"Not <i>appropriating</i>" what does not belong to one. It
	means "keeping back" dishonestly or deceitfully (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:2">Acts 5:2</span>;

<p><b>showing</b>—manifesting in

<p><b>all</b>—all possible.

<p><b>good</b>—really good; not
	so in mere appearance (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5">Ephesians 6:5</span>;

	"The heathen do not judge of the Christian's doctrines from the
	doctrine, but from his actions and life" [CHRYSOSTOM].
	Men will write, fight, and even die for their religion; but how few
	<i>live</i> for it! Translate, "That they may adorn the doctrine
	of our Saviour God," that is, God the Father, the originating
	author of salvation (compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:22-51.3.24- :">Colossians 3:22-51.3.24- :</span>). God deigns to have His Gospel-doctrine adorned even by
	slaves, who are regarded by the world as no better than beasts of
	burden. "Though the service be rendered to an earthly master,
	the honor redounds to God, as the servant's goodwill flows from the
	fear of God" [THEOPHYLACT].
	Even slaves, low as is their status, should not think the influence
	of their example a matter of no consequence to religion: how much
	more those in a high position. His love in being "our Saviour"
	is the strongest ground for our adorning His doctrine by our lives.
	This is the force of "For" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:22-51.3.24- :">Colossians 3:22-51.3.24- :</span>.</p>
