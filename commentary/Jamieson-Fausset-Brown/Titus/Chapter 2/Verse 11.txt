<p><b>11. the grace of God</b>—God's
	<i>gratuitous favor</i> in the scheme of redemption. 
	</p>
<p><b>hath appeared</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"hath been <i>made to appear,</i>" or "<i>shine</i>
	forth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:2">Isaiah 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:79">Luke 1:79</span>).
	"hath been <i>manifested</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:79- :">Luke 1:79- :</span>), after having been long hidden in the loving counsels of God
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:26">Colossians 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:10">2 Timothy 1:10</span>). The image is
	illustrated in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:20">Acts 27:20</span>. The
	grace of God hath now been embodied in Jesus, the <i>brightness</i>
	of the Father's glory," <i>manifested</i> as the "Sun of
	righteousness," "the Word made flesh." The Gospel
	dispensation is hence termed "the day" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:5">1 Thessalonians 5:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:8">1 Thessalonians 5:8</span>; there is a double
	"appearing," that of "grace" here, that of
	"glory," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:12">Romans 13:12</span>). Connect it
	not as <i>English Version,</i> but, "The grace . . . that
	<i>bringeth salvation to all men</i> hath appeared," or "been
	manifested" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:4">1 Timothy 2:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:10">1 Timothy 4:10</span>). Hence God is called
	"our <i>Saviour</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:10- :">1 Timothy 4:10- :</span>). The very name <i>Jesus</i> means the same. 
	</p>
<p><b>to all</b>—of whom he
	enumerated the different classes (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:10- :">1 Timothy 4:10- :</span>): even to servants; to us Gentiles, once aliens from God.
	Hence arises our obligation to all men (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:10- :">1 Timothy 4:10- :</span>).</p>
