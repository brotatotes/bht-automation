<p><b>12. Teaching</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"disciplining us." Grace exercises <i>discipline,</i> and
	is imparted in connection with disciplining chastisements (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:32">1 Corinthians 11:32</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:6">Hebrews 12:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:7">Hebrews 12:7</span>).
	The education which the Christian receives from "the grace"
	of God is a discipline often trying to flesh and blood: just as
	children need disciplining. The <i>discipline</i> which it exercises
	<i>teaches</i> us to <i>deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to
	live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world</i>
	(<i>Greek,</i> "age," or course of things) where such
	self-discipline is needed, seeing that its spirit is opposed to God
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:12">Titus 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:16">Titus 1:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:20">1 Corinthians 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:18">1 Corinthians 3:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:19">1 Corinthians 3:19</span>): in the coming world we
	may gratify every desire without need of self-discipline, because all
	desires there will be conformable to the will of God. 
	</p>
<p><b>that</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "in
	order that"; the end of the "disciplining" is "<i>in
	order that</i> . . . we may live soberly," c. This point is lost
	by the translation, "<i>teaching</i> us." 
	</p>
<p><b>denying . . . lusts</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:23">Luke 9:23</span>). The <i>Greek</i>
	aorist expresses "denying <i>once for all.</i>" We deny
	"worldly lusts" when we withhold our consent from them,
	when we refuse the delight which they suggest, and the act to which
	they solicit us, nay, tear them up by the roots out of our soul and
	mind [ST. BERNARD, <i>Sermon</i>
	11]. 
	</p>
<p><b>worldly lusts</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	article expresses, "<i>the</i> lusts of the world," "<i>all</i>
	worldly lusts" [ALFORD],
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:16">Galatians 5:16</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:3">Ephesians 2:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:15-17">1 John 2:15-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:19">1 John 5:19</span>).
	The <i>world</i> (<i>cosmos</i>) will not come to an end when this
	present <i>age</i> (<i>aeon</i>) or course of things shall end. 
	</p>
<p><b>live soberly, righteously,
	and godly</b>—the <i>positive</i> side of the Christian character;
	as "denying . . . lusts" was the <i>negative.</i>
	"Soberly," that is, <i>with self-restraint,</i> in relation
	to <i>one's self:</i> "righteously" or <i>justly,</i> in
	relation to our <i>neighbor;</i> "godly" or <i>piously,</i>
	in relation to <i>God</i> (not merely <i>amiably</i> and <i>justly,</i>
	but something higher, <i>godly,</i> with love and reverence toward
	God). These three comprise our "disciplining" in <i>faith</i>
	and <i>love,</i> from which he passes to <i>hope</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:19- :">1 John 5:19- :</span>).</p>
