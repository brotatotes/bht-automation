	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>).

<p><b>Looking for</b>—with
	constant <i>expectation</i> (so the <i>Greek</i>) and with joy (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21- :">Philippians 3:21- :</span>). This will prove the antidote to worldly lusts, and the
	stimulus to "live in this present world" conformably to
	this <i>expectation.</i> The <i>Greek</i> is translated, "waiting
	for," in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:25">Luke 2:25</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>that</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"the." 
	</p>
<p><b>blessed</b>—bringing
	blessedness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:7">Romans 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:8">Romans 4:8</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>hope</b>—that is, object of
	hope (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:24">Romans 8:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:5">Galatians 5:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the glorious appearing</b>—There
	is but one <i>Greek</i> article to both "hope" and
	"appearing," which marks their close connection (the <i>hope</i>
	being about to be realized only at the <i>appearing</i> of Christ).
	Translate, "<i>The</i> blessed hope <i>and manifestation</i>
	(compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5- :">Colossians 1:5- :</span>) <i>of the glory.</i>" The <i>Greek</i> for
	"manifestation" is translated "brightness" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5- :">Colossians 1:5- :</span>. As His "coming" (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>parousia</i>")
	expresses the fact; so "brightness, appearing," or
	"manifestation" (<i>epiphaneia</i>) expresses His personal
	<i>visibility</i> when He shall come. 
	</p>
<p><b>the great God and our Saviour
	Jesus</b>—There is but one <i>Greek</i> article to "God"
	and "Saviour," which shows that both are predicated of one
	and the same Being. "Of Him who is at once the great God and our
	Saviour." Also (2) "appearing" (<i>epiphaneia</i>) is
	never by Paul predicated of God the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:16">1 Timothy 6:16</span>), or even of "His
	glory" (as ALFORD
	explains it): it is <i>invariably</i> applied to CHRIST'S
	coming, to which (at His first advent, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:16- :">1 Timothy 6:16- :</span>) the kindred verb "appeared" (<i>epephanee</i>),
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:11">Titus 2:11</span>, refers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:14">1 Timothy 6:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:1">2 Timothy 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>).
	Also (3) in the context (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:14">Titus 2:14</span>)
	there is no reference to the Father, but to Christ alone; and here
	there is no occasion for reference to <i>the Father</i> in the
	exigencies of the context. Also (4) the expression "great God,"
	as applied to Christ, is in accordance with the context, which refers
	to <i>the glory of His appearing;</i> just as "the true God"
	is predicated of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:20">1 John 5:20</span>.
	The phrase occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, but often in the
	Old Testament. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+7:21">Deuteronomy 7:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+10:17">Deuteronomy 10:17</span>,
	predicated of Jehovah, who, as their manifested Lord, led the
	Israelites through the wilderness, doubtless the Second Person in the
	Trinity. Believers now look for the manifestation of His glory,
	inasmuch as they shall share in it. Even the Socinian explanation,
	making "the great God" to be <i>the Father,</i> "our
	Saviour," <i>the Son,</i> places God and Christ <i>on an equal
	relation</i> to "the glory" of the future appearing: a fact
	incompatible with the notion that Christ is not divine; indeed it
	would be blasphemy so to couple any mere created being with God.</p>
