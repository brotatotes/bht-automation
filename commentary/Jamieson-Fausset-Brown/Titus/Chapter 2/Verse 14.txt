14. gave himself—"The
	forcible 'Himself, His whole self, the greatest gift ever given,'
	must not be overlooked." 
	for us—Greek,
	"in our behalf." 
	redeem us—deliver
	us from bondage by paying the price of His precious blood.
	An appropriate image in addressing bond-servants (Titus 2:9;
	Titus 2:10): 
	from all iniquity—the
	essence of sin, namely, "transgression of the law": in
	bondage to which we were till then. The aim of His redemption was to
	redeem us, not merely from the penalty, but from the being of all
	iniquity. Thus he reverts to the "teaching" in
	righteousness, or disciplining effect of the grace of God that
	bringeth salvation (Titus 2:11;
	Titus 2:12). 
	peculiar—peculiarly
	His own, as Israel was of old. 
	zealous—in doing and
	promoting "good works."
