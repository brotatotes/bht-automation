<p><b>5. keepers at home</b>—as
	"guardians of the house," as the <i>Greek</i> expresses.
	The oldest manuscripts read, "<i>Workers</i> at home":
	active in household duties (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+7:11">Proverbs 7:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:13">1 Timothy 5:13</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>good</b>—kind, <i>beneficent</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:15">Matthew 20:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:7">Romans 5:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18">1 Peter 2:18</span>). Not churlish and
	niggardly, but thrifty as housewives. 
	</p>
<p><b>obedient</b>—rather
	"submissive," as the <i>Greek</i> is translated; (see on
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18- :">1 Peter 2:18- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18- :">1 Peter 2:18- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>their own</b>—marking the
	duty of subjection which they owe them, as being <i>their own</i>
	husbands (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:22">Ephesians 5:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:18">Colossians 3:18</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>blasphemed</b>—"evil
	spoken of." That no reproach may be cast on the Gospel, through
	the inconsistencies of its professors (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:8">Titus 2:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:10">Titus 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:24">Romans 2:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:14">1 Timothy 5:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:1">1 Timothy 6:1</span>).
	"Unless we are virtuous, blasphemy will come through us to the
	faith" [THEOPHYLACT].</p>
