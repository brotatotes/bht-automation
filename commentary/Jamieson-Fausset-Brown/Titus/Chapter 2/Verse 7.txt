<p><b>thyself a pattern</b>—though
	but a young man thyself. All teaching is useless unless the teacher's
	example confirm his word.

<p><b>in doctrine</b>—<i>in</i>
	thy ministerial <i>teaching</i> (showing) <i>uncorruptness,</i> that
	is, <i>untainted purity</i> of motive on thy part (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), so as to be "a pattern" to all. As "gravity,"
	c., refers to Titus himself, so "uncorruptness" though,
	doubtless, uncorruptness of <i>the doctrine</i> will be sure to
	follow as a consequence of the Christian minister being of simple,
	uncorrupt integrity himself.
