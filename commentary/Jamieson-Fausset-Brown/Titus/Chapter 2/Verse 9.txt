<p><b>to please them well</b>—"to
	give satisfaction" [ALFORD].
	<i>To be complaisant in everything;</i> to have that zealous desire
	to gain the master's goodwill which will anticipate the master's wish
	and do even more than is required. The reason for the frequent
	recurrence of injunctions to slaves to <i>subjection</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5-8">Ephesians 6:5-8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:22">Colossians 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:1">1 Timothy 6:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:2">1 Timothy 6:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18">1 Peter 2:18</span>)
	was, that in no rank was there more danger of the doctrine of the
	<i>spiritual</i> equality and freedom of Christians being
	misunderstood than in that of slaves. It was natural for the slave
	who had become a Christian, to forget his place and put himself on a
	<i>social</i> level with his master. Hence the charge for each to
	abide in the sphere in which he was when converted (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18- :">1 Peter 2:18- :</span>).

	contradiction</i> to the master: so the <i>Greek,</i> "not
	contradicting" [WAHL].</p>
