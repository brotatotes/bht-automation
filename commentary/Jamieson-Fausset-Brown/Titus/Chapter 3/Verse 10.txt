<p><b>10. heretic</b>—<i>Greek</i>
	"heresy," originally meant a <i>division</i> resulting from
	individual self-will; the individual doing and teaching what he
	<i>chose,</i> independent of the teaching and practice of the Church.
	In course of time it came to mean definitely "heresy" in
	the modern sense; and in the later Epistles it has almost assumed
	this meaning. The heretics of Crete, when Titus was there, were in
	doctrine followers of their own self-willed "questions"
	reprobated in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:9">Titus 3:9</span>, and
	immoral in practice. 
	</p>
<p><b>reject</b>—decline, avoid;
	not formal excommunication, but, "have nothing more to do with
	him," either in admonition or intercourse.</p>
