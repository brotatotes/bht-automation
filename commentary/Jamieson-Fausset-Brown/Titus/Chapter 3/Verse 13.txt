<p><b>Apollos</b>—with Zenas,
	probably the bearers of this Epistle. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, Apollos is mentioned as purposing to visit Corinth; his
	now being at Corinth (on the theory of Paul being at Corinth when he
	wrote) accords with this purpose. Crete would be on his way either to
	Palestine or his native place, Alexandria. Paul and Apollos thus
	appear in beautiful harmony in that very city where their names had
	been formerly the watchword of unchristian party work. It was to
	avoid this party rivalry that Apollos formerly was unwilling to visit
	Corinth though Paul desired him. HIPPOLYTUS
	mentions Zenas as one of the Seventy, and afterwards bishop of
	Diospolis.</p>
