<p><b>15. Greet</b>—"<i>Salute</i>
	them that love us in the faith." All at Crete had not this <i>love</i>
	rooted in <i>faith,</i> the true bond of fellowship. A salutation
	peculiar to this Epistle, such as no forger would have used.

<p><b>Grace</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>The</i> grace," namely, <i>of God.</i>
</p>
<p><b>with you all</b>—not that
	the Epistle is addressed to <i>all</i> the Cretan Christians, but
	Titus would naturally impart it to his flock.</p>
