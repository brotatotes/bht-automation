2. To speak evil of no
	man—especially, not of "dignities" and magistrates. 
	no brawlers—"not
	quarrelsome," not attacking others. 
	gentle—towards those
	who attack us. Yielding, considerate, not urging one's rights to the
	uttermost, but forbearing and kindly (see on  :-). Very different from the innate greediness and spirit
	of aggression towards others which characterized the Cretans. 
	showing—in acts. 
	all—all possible. 
	meekness—(See on  :-); the opposite of passionate severity. 
	unto all men—The duty
	of Christian conduct towards all men is the proper consequence
	of the universality of God's grace to all men, so often set forth in
	the pastoral Epistles.
