<p><b>no brawlers</b>—"not
	quarrelsome," not attacking others.

<p><b>gentle</b>—towards those
	who attack us. Yielding, considerate, not urging one's rights to the
	uttermost, but forbearing and kindly (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Very different from the <i>innate greediness</i> and spirit
	of aggression towards others which characterized the Cretans.

<p><b>all</b>—all possible.

<p><b>meekness</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); the opposite of passionate severity. 
	</p>
<p><b>unto all men</b>—The duty
	of Christian conduct towards <i>all men</i> is the proper consequence
	of the universality of God's grace to all men, so often set forth in
