<p><b>4.</b> To show how little reason the
	Cretan Christians had to be proud of themselves, and despise others
	not Christians (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:2">Titus 3:2</span>).
	It is to the "kindness and love of God," not to their own
	merits, that they owe salvation. 
	</p>
<p><b>kindness</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"goodness," "benignity," which manifests His
	<i>grace.</i>
</p>
<p><b>love . . . toward
	man</b>—teaching us to have such "love (benevolence) toward
	<i>man</i>" (<i>Greek,</i> "philanthropy"), "showing
	all meekness unto all <i>men</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:2- :">Titus 3:2- :</span>), even as God had "<i>toward man</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:2- :">Titus 3:2- :</span>); opposed to the "hateful and hating"
	characteristics of unrenewed men, whose wretchedness moved God's
	<i>benevolent kindness.</i>
</p>
<p><b>of God our Saviour</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"of our Saviour God," namely, the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:2- :">Titus 3:2- :</span>), who "saved us" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:2- :">Titus 3:2- :</span>) "through Jesus Christ our Saviour" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:2- :">Titus 3:2- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>appeared</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"was made to appear"; was manifested.</p>
