	he shed—Greek,
	"poured out"; not only on the Church in general at
	Pentecost, but also "on us" individually. This pouring
	out of the Spirit comprehends the grace received before, in, and
	subsequently to, baptism. 
	abundantly—Greek,
	"richly" (Colossians 3:16). 
	through Jesus Christ—the
	channel and Mediator of the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
	our Saviour—immediately;
	as the Father is mediately "our Saviour." The Father is the
	author of our salvation and saves us by Jesus Christ.
