<p><b>8.</b> <i>Greek,</i> "faithful
	is the saying." A formula peculiar to the Pastoral Epistles.
	Here "the saying" is the statement (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) as to the gratuitousness of God's gift of salvation.
	Answering to the "Amen."

<p><b>these things,</b> c.—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>concerning</i> these things (the truths dwelt on, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> not as <i>English Version,</i> what follow), I will that
	thou affirm (<i>insist</i>) <i>strongly</i> and <i>persistently, in

	for 'believed <i>in</i> God' is different, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 'They who have learnt to credit God' in what He saith) may
	be careful ('Solicitously sedulous'; <i>diligence is necessary</i>)
	to maintain (literally, 'to set before themselves so as to sustain')
	good works." No longer applying their <i>care</i> to
	"unprofitable" and unpractical speculations (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>These things</b>—These
	results of doctrine ("good works") are "good and
	profitable unto men," whereas no such practical results flow
	from "foolish questions." So GROTIUS
	and WIESINGER. But ALFORD,
	to avoid the tautology, "these (good works) are good unto men,"
	explains, "these <i>truths</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
