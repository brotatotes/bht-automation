<p><b>genealogies</b>—akin to the

	Not so much direct heresy as yet is here referred to, as profitless
	discussions about genealogies of aeons, c., which ultimately led to
	Gnosticism. Synagogue discourses were termed <i>daraschoth,</i> that
	is, "discussions." Compare "<i>disputer</i> of this
	world (<i>Greek,</i> 'dispensation')."

<p><b>strivings about the law</b>—about
	the authority of the "commandments of men," which they
	sought to confirm by the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:16- :">2 Timothy 2:16- :</span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:16- :">2 Timothy 2:16- :</span>), and about
	the mystical meaning of the various parts of the law in connection
	with the "genealogies."</p>
