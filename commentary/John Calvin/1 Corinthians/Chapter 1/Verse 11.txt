<p><b>11.</b><i>It has been declared.</i> As general observations have usually little effect, he intimates, that what he had said was more particularly applicable to them. The application, therefore, is designed with the view of leading the Corinthians to perceive, that it was not without good reason that Paul had made mention of harmony. For he shows that they had not merely turned aside from a holy unity, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(58)</sup></span> but had even fallen into contentions, which are worse <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(59)</sup></span> than jarrings of sentiment. And that he may not be charged with believing too readily what was said, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(60)</sup></span> as though he lightly lent his ear to false accusations, he speaks with commendation of his informants, who must have been in the highest esteem, as he did not hesitate to adduce them as competent witnesses against an entire Church. It is not indeed altogether certain, whether <i>Chloe</i> is the name of a place or of a woman, but to me it appears more probable that it is the name of a woman. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(61)</sup></span> I am of opinion, therefore, that it was a well-regulated household that acquainted Paul with the distempered condition of the Corinthian Church, being desirous that it might be remedied by him. The idea entertained by many, in accordance with Chrysostom’s view, that he refrained from mentioning names, lest he should bring odium upon them, appears to me to be absurd. For he does not say that some of the household had reported this to him, but, on the contrary, makes mention of them all, and there is no doubt that they would willingly have allowed their names to be made use of. Farther, that he might not exasperate their minds by undue severity, he has modified the reproof by an engaging form of address; not as though he would make light of the distemper, but with the view of bringing them to a more teachable spirit, for perceiving the severity of the malady. </p>

These conjectures, however, are manifestly more ingenious than solid. It is certain that the name <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Χλόν</span></blu></grk> (Chloe,) was frequent among the Greeks as the name of a female.
