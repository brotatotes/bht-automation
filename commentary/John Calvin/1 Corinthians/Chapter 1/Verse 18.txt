<p><b>18.</b><i>For the preaching of the cross</i>, etc. In this first clause a concession is made. For as it might very readily be objected, that the gospel is commonly held in contempt, if it <i>be</i> presented in so bare and abject a form, Paul of his own accord concedes this, but when he adds, that it is so in the estimation of <i>them that perish</i>, he intimates that no regard must be paid to their judgment. For who would choose to despise the gospel at the expense of perishing? This statement, therefore, must be understood in this way: “Howeverthe preaching of the cross, as having nothing of human wisdom to recommend it to esteem, is <i>reckoned foolishness</i> by <i>them that perish</i>; in <i>our</i> view, notwithstanding, the wisdom of God clearly shines forth in it.” He indirectly reproves, however, the perverted judgment of the Corinthians, who, while they were, through seduction of words, too easily allured by ambitious teachers, regarded with disdain an Apostle who was endowed with <i>the power of God</i> for their <i>salvation</i>, and that simply because he devoted himself to the preaching of Christ. In what way the preaching of the cross is the power of God unto salvation, we have explained in commenting upon <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span> </p>
