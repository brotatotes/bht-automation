<p><b>29.</b><i>That no flesh should glory</i> Though the term <i>flesh</i> here, and in many passages of Scripture, denotes all mankind, yet in this passage it carries with it a particular idea; for the Spirit, by speaking of mankind in terms of contempt, beats down their pride, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+31:3">Isaiah 31:3</span> — <i>The Egyptian is flesh and not spirit</i> It is a sentiment that is worthy to be kept in remembrance — that there is nothing left us in which we may justly glory. With this view he adds the expression <i>in God’s presence</i> For <i>in the presence of the world</i> many delight themselves for the moment in a false glorying, which, however, quickly vanishes like smoke. At the same time, by this expression all mankind are put to silence when they come into the presence of God; as Habakkuk says — </p>
<p>Let all flesh keep silence before God, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:20">Habakkuk 2:20</span>.) </p>
<p>Let every thing, therefore, that is at all deserving of praise, be recognized as proceeding from God. </p>
