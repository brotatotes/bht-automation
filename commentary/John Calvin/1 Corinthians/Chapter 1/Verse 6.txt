<p><b>6.</b><i>Even as the testimony</i>, etc. Erasmus gives a different rendering, to this effect, “that by these things the testimony of Christ was confirmed in them;” that is, by knowledge and by the word. The words, however, convey another meaning, and if they are not wrested, the meaning is easy — that God has sealed the truth of his gospel among the Corinthians, for the purpose of confirming it. Now, this might be done in two ways, either by miracles, or by the inward testimony of the Holy Spirit. Chrysostom seems to understand it of miracles, but I take it in a larger sense; and, first of all, it is certain, that the gospel is properly confirmed in our experience by faith, because it is only when we receive it by faith that we “set to our seal that God is true” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:33">John 3:33</span>.) And though I admit that miracles ought to have weight for the confirmation of it, yet we must go higher in search of the origin, namely this, that the Spirit of God is the earnest and seal. Accordingly, I explain these words in this manner — that the Corinthians excelled in knowledge, inasmuch as God had from the beginning given efficacy to his gospel among them, and that not in one way merely, but had done so both by the internal influence of the Spirit, and by excellence and variety of gifts, by miracles, and by all other helps. He calls the gospel <i>the testimony of Christ</i>, or <i>respecting</i> Christ, because the entire sum of it tends to discover Christ to us, </p>
<p>“In whom all the treasures of knowledge are hid” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+2:3">Colossians 2:3</span>.) </p>
<p>If any one prefers to take it in an active sense, on the ground that Christ is the primary author of the gospel, so that the Apostles were nothing but secondary or inferior witnesses, I shall not much oppose it. I feel better satisfied, however, with the former exposition. It is true that a little afterwards (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1">1 Corinthians 2:1</span>) <i>the testimony of God</i> must, beyond all controversy, be taken in an active sense, as a passive signification would not be at all suitable. Here, however, the case is different, and, what is more, that passage strengthens my view, as he immediately subjoins what it is <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(48)</sup></span> — <i>to know nothing but Christ</i>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:2">1 Corinthians 2:2</span>.) </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(48)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Quel est ce tesmoignage</span></blu>;” — “What this testimony is.” </p>
