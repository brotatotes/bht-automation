<p><b>8.</b><i>Who will also confirm you.</i> The relative here refers not to Christ, but to God, though the word <i>God</i> is the remoter antecedent. For the Apostle is going on with his congratulation, and as he has told them previously what he thought of them, so he now lets them know what hope he has of them as to the future, and this partly for the purpose of assuring them still farther of his affection for them, and partly that he may exhort them by his own example to cherish the same hope. It is as if he had said — Though the expectation of a salvation to come keeps you still in suspense, you ought nevertheless to feel assured that the Lord will never forsake you, but will on the contrary increase what he has begun in you, that when that day comes on which </p>

It is, however, to be observed, that this glorious purity is not in the first instance perfected in us; nay, rather, it goes well with us if we are every day making progress in penitence, and are being <i>purged from the sins</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:9">2 Peter 1:9</span>) that expose us to the displeasure of God, until at length we put off, along with the mortal body, all the offscourings of sin. Of the <i>day of the Lord</i> we shall have occasion to speak when we come to the fourth chapter. </p>
