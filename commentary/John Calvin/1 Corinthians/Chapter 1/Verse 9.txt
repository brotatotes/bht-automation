<p><b>9.</b><i>God is faithful</i> When the Scripture speaks of God as faithful the meaning in many cases is, that in God there is steadfastness and evenness of tenor, so that what he begins he <i>prosecutes</i> to the end, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(50)</sup></span> as Paul himself says elsewhere, that <i>the calling of God is without repentance</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:29">Romans 11:29</span>.) Hence, in my opinion, the meaning of this passage is, that God is steadfast in what he purposes. This being the case, he consequently does not make sport as to his calling, but will unceasingly take care of his work. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(51)</sup></span> From God’s past benefits we ought always to hope well as to the future. Paul, however, has something higher in view, for he argues that the Corinthians cannot be cast off, having been once called by the Lord into Christ’s fellowship. To apprehend fully, however, the force of this argument, let us observe first of all, that every one ought to regard his calling as a token of his election. Farther, although one cannot judge with the same certainty as to another’s election, yet we must always in the judgment of charity conclude that all that are called are called to salvation; I mean efficaciously and fruitfully. Paul, however, directed his discourse to those in whom the word of the Lord had taken root, and in whom some fruits of it had been produced. </p>
<p>Should any one object that many who have once received the word afterwards fall away, I answer that the Spirit alone is to every one a faithful and sure witness of his election, upon which perseverance depends. This, however, did not stand in the way of Paul’s being persuaded, in the judgment of charity, that the calling of the Corinthians would prove firm and immovable, as being persons in whom he saw the tokens of God’s fatherly benevolence. These things, however, do not by any means tend to beget carnal security, to divest us of which the Scriptures frequently remind us of our weakness, but simply to confirm our confidence in the Lord. Now this was needful, in order that their minds might not be disheartened on discovering so many faults, as he comes afterwards to present before their view. The sum of all this may be stated thus, — that it is the part of Christian candor to hope well of all who have entered on the right way of salvation, and are still persevering in that course, notwithstanding that they are at the same time still beset with really distempers. Every one of us, too, from the time of his being <i>illuminated</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:32">Hebrews 10:32</span>) by the Spirit of God in the knowledge of Christ, ought to conclude with certainty from this that he has been adopted by the Lord to an inheritance of eternal life. For effectual calling ought to be to believers an evidence of divine adoption; yet in the meantime we must all walk <i>with fear and trembling</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+2:12">Philippians 2:12</span>.) On this point I shall touch again to some extent when we come to the tenth chapter. </p>
<p><i>Into the fellowship.</i> Instead of this rendering Erasmus translates it <i>into partnership</i> The old interpreter renders it <i>society</i> I have preferred, however, to render it <i>fellowship</i>, as bringing out better the force of the Greek word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κοινωνιας</span></blu></grk> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(52)</sup></span> For this is the design of the gospel, that Christ may become ours, and that we may be engrafted into his body. Now when the Father gives him to us in possession, he also communicates himself to us in him; and hence arises a participation in every benefit. Paul’s argument, then, is this — “Since you have, by means of the gospel which you have received by faith, been called into the fellowship of Christ, you have no reason to dread the danger of death, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(53)</sup></span> having been made <i>partakers</i> of him (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:14">Hebrews 3:14</span>) who rose a conqueror over death.” In fine, when the Christian looks to himself he finds only occasion for trembling, or rather for despair; but having been called into the fellowship of Christ, he ought, in so far as assurance of salvation is concerned, to think of himself no otherwise than as a member of Christ, so as to reckon all Christ’s benefits his own. Thus he will obtain an unwavering hope of final perseverance, (as it is called,) if he reckons himself a member of him who is beyond all hazard of falling away. </p>
