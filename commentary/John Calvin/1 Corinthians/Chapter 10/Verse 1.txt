<p>What he had previously taught by two similitudes, he now confirms by examples. The Corinthians grew wanton, and gloried, as if they had served out their time, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(520)</sup></span> or at least had finished their course, when they had scarcely left the starting-point. This vain exultation and confidence he represses in this manner — “As I see that you are quietly taking your ease at the very outset of your course, <i>I would not have you ignorant</i> of what befell the people of Israel in consequence of this, that their example may arouse you.” As, however, on examples being adduced, any point of difference destroys the force of the comparison, Paul premises, that there is no such dissimilarity between us and the Israelites, as to make our condition different from theirs. Having it, therefore, in view to threaten the Corinthians with the same vengeance as had overtaken them, he begins in this manner — “Beware of glorying in any peculiar privilege, as if you were in higher esteem than they were in the sight of God.” For they were favored with the same benefits as we at this day enjoy; there was a Church of God among them, as there is at this day among us; they had the same sacraments, to be tokens to them of the grace of God; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(521)</sup></span> but, on their abusing their privileges, they did not escape the judgment of God. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(522)</sup></span> Be afraid, therefore; for the same thing is impending over <i>you</i>. Jude makes use of the same argument in his Epistle. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:5">Judges 1:5</span>.) </p>
<p>1. <i>All were under the cloud.</i> The Apostle’s object is to show, that the Israelites were no less the people of God than we are, that we may know, that we will not escape with impunity the hand of God, which punished them <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(523)</sup></span> with so much severity. For the sum is this — “If God spared not them, neither will he spare you, for your condition is similar.” That similarity he proves from this — that they had been honored with the same tokens of God’s grace, for the sacraments are badges by which the Church of God is distinguished. He treats first of baptism, and teaches that the cloud, which protected the Israelites in the desert from the heat of the sun, and directed their course, and also their passage through the sea, was to them as a baptism; he says, also, that in the manna, and the water flowing from the rock, there was a sacrament which corresponded with the sacred Supper. </p>
<p>They were, says he, <i>baptized in Moses</i>, that is, under the ministry or guidance of Moses. For I take the particle <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἰς</span></blu></grk> to be used here instead of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐν</span></blu></grk>, agreeably to the common usage of Scripture, because we are assuredly baptized in the name of Christ, and not of any mere man, as he has stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:13">1 Corinthians 1:13</span>, and that for two reasons. These are, <i>first</i>, because we are by baptism initiated <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(524)</sup></span> into the doctrine of Christ alone; and, <i>secondly</i>, because his name alone is invoked, inasmuch as baptism is founded on his influence alone. They were, therefore, <i>baptized in Moses</i>, that is, under his guidance or ministry, as has been already stated. How? <i>In the cloud and in the sea.</i> “They were, then, baptized twice,” some one will say. I answer, that there are <i>two</i> signs made mention of, making, however, but <i>one</i> baptism, corresponding to ours. </p>
<p>Here, however, a more difficult question presents itself. For it is certain, that the advantage of those gifts, which Paul makes mention of, was temporal. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(525)</sup></span> The <i>cloud</i> protected them from the heat of the sun, and showed them the way: these are outward advantages of the present life. In like manner, their passage through the <i>sea</i> was attended with this effect, that they got clear off from Pharaoh’s cruelty, and escaped from imminent hazard of death. The advantage of <i>our</i> baptism, on the other hand, is spiritual. Why then does Paul turn earthly benefits into sacraments, and seek to find some spiritual mystery <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(526)</sup></span> in them? I answer, that it was not without good reason that Paul sought in miracles of this nature something more than the mere outward advantage of the flesh. For, though God designed to promote his people’s advantage in respect of the present life, what he had mainly in view was, to declare and manifest himself to be their God, and under <i>that</i>, eternal salvation is comprehended. </p>
<p>The <i>cloud</i>, in various instances, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(527)</sup></span> is called the symbol of his presence. As, therefore, he declared by means of it, that he was present with them, as his peculiar and chosen people, there can be no doubt that, in addition to an earthly advantage, they had in it, besides, a token of spiritual life. Thus its use was twofold, as was also that of the passage through the sea, for a way was opened up for them through the midst of the sea, that they might escape from the hand of Pharaoh; but to what was this owing, but to the circumstance, that the Lord, having taken them under his guardianship and protection, determined by every means to defend them? Hence, they concluded from this, that they were the objects of God’s care, and that he had their salvation in charge. Hence, too, the Passover, which was instituted to celebrate the remembrance of their deliverance, was nevertheless, at the same time, a sacrament of Christ. How so? Because God had, under a temporal benefit, manifested himself as a Savior. Any one that will attentively consider these things, will find that there is no absurdity in Paul’s words. Nay more, he will perceive both in the spiritual substance and in the visible sign a most striking correspondence between the baptism of the Jews, and ours. </p>
<p>It is however objected again, that we do not find a word of all this. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(528)</sup></span> This I admit, but there is no doubt, that God by his Spirit supplied the want of outward preaching, as we may see in the instance of the brazen serpent, which was, as Christ himself testifies, a spiritual sacrament, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:14">John 3:14</span>,) and yet not a word has come down to us as to this thing, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(529)</sup></span> but the Lord revealed to believers of that age, in the manner he thought fit, the secret, which would otherwise have remained hid. </p>
