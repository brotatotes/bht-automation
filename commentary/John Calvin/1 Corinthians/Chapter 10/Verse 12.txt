<p><b>12.</b><i>Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth</i> The Apostle concludes from what goes before, that we must not glory in our beginnings or progress, so as to resign ourselves to carelessness and inactivity. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(562)</sup></span> For the Corinthians gloried in their condition in such a way, that, forgetting their weakness, they fell into many crimes. This was a false confidence of such a kind as the Prophets frequently reprove in the Israelitish people. As, however, Papists wrest this passage for the purpose of maintaining their impious doctrine respecting faith, as having constantly doubt connected with it, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(563)</sup></span> let us observe that there are two kinds of assurance. </p>
<p>The <i>one</i> is that which rests on the promises of God, because a pious conscience feels assured that God will never be wanting to it; and, relying on this unconquerable persuasion, triumphs boldly and intrepidly over Satan and sin, and yet, nevertheless, keeping in mind its own infirmity, casts itself <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(564)</sup></span> upon God, and with carefulness and anxiety commits itself to him. This kind of assurance is sacred, and is inseparable from faith, as appears from many passages of Scripture, and especially <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:33">Romans 8:33</span>. </p>
<p>The <i>other</i> arises from negligence, when men, puffed up with the gifts that they have, give themselves no concern, as if they were beyond the reach of danger, but rest satisfied with their condition. Hence it is that they are exposed to all the assaults of Satan. This is the kind of assurance which Paul would have the Corinthians to abandon, because he saw that they were satisfied with themselves under the influence of a silly conceit. He does not, however, exhort them to be always anxiously in doubt as to the will of God, or to tremble from uncertainty as to their salvation, as Papists dream. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(565)</sup></span> In short, let us bear in mind, that Paul is here addressing persons who were puffed up with a base confidence in the flesh, and represses that assurance which is grounded upon men — not upon God. For after commending the Colossians for the solidity or <i>steadfastness of their faith</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+2:5">Colossians 2:5</span>,) he exhorts them to be </p>
<p>rooted in Christ, to remain firm, and to be built up and <br/>confirmed in the faith. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+2:7">Colossians 2:7</span>.) </p>
