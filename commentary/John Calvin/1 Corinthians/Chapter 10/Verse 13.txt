<p><b>13.</b><i>No temptation has taken you.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(566)</sup></span> Let others take their own way of interpreting this. For my part, I am of opinion that it was intended for their consolation, lest on hearing of such appalling instances of the wrath of God, as he had previously related, they should feel discouraged, being overpowered with alarm. Hence, in order that his exhortation might be of advantage, he adds, that there is room for repentance. “There is no reason why you should despond; for I have not had it in view to give you occasion for despair, nor has anything happened to you but what is common to men.” Others are of opinion that he rather chides their cowardice in giving way, on being so slightly tried; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(567)</sup></span> and unquestionably the word rendered <i>human</i> is sometimes taken to mean moderate. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(568)</sup></span> The meaning, then, according to them would be this: “Did it become you thus to give way under a slight trial?” But as it agrees better with the context, if we consider it as consolation, I am on this account rather inclined to that view. </p>
<p><i>But God is faithful</i> As he exhorted them to be of good courage as to the past, in order that he might stir them up to repentance, so he also comforts them as to the future with a sure hope, on the ground that <i>God would not suffer them to be tempted beyond their strength.</i> He exhorts them, however, to look to the Lord, because a temptation, however slight it may be, will straightway overcome us, and all will be over with us, if we rely upon our own strength. He speaks of the Lord, as <i>faithful</i>, not merely as being true to his promises, but as though he had said. The Lord is the sure guardian of his people, under whose protection you are safe, for he never leaves his people destitute. Accordingly, when he has received you under his protection, you have no cause to fear, provided you depend entirely upon him. For certainly this were a species of deception, if he were to withdraw his aid in the time of need, or if he were, on seeing us weak and ready to sink under the load, to lengthen out our trials still farther. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(569)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Now God helps us in two ways, that we may not be overcome by the temptation; for he supplies us with strength, and he sets limits to the temptation. It is of the <i>second</i> of these ways that the Apostle here chiefly speaks. At the same time, he does not exclude the former — that God alleviates temptations, that they may not overpower us by their weight. For he knows the measure of our power, which he has himself conferred. According to that, he regulates our temptations. The term <i>temptation</i> I take here as denoting, in a general way, everything that allures us. </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(569)</span> Mr. Fuller of Kettering, when comparing <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:13">1 Corinthians 10:13</span>, with <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:8">2 Corinthians 1:8</span>, justly observes: “The <i>ability</i> in the former of these passages, and the <i>strength</i> in the latter, are far from being the same. The one is expressive of that divine support which the Lord has promised to give to his servants under all their trials: the other, of the power which we possess naturally as creatures. We may be tried beyond this, as all the martyrs have been, and yet not beyond the other. The outward man may perish, while the inward man is renewed day by day.” — Fuller’s Works, volume 3, p. 609. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
