<p><b>14.</b><i>Wherefore, my beloved, flee, etc.</i> The Apostle now returns to the particular question, from which he had for a little digressed, for, lest bare doctrine should have little effect among them, he has introduced those general exhortations that we have read, but now he pursues the discussion on which he had entered — that it is not allowable for a Christian man to connect himself with the superstitions of the wicked, so as to take part in them. <i>Flee</i>, says he,<i>from idolatry</i> In the first place, let us observe what meaning he attaches to the term <i>Idolatry</i> He certainly did not suspect the Corinthians of such a degree of ignorance or carelessness <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(570)</sup></span> as to think, that they worshipped idols in their heart. But as they made no scruple of frequenting the assemblies of the wicked, and observing along with them certain rites instituted in honor of idols, he condemns this liberty taken by them, as being a very bad example. It is certain, then, that when he here makes mention of <i>idolatry</i>, he, speaks of what is outward, or, if you prefer it, of the profession <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(571)</sup></span> of idolatry. For as God is said to be worshipped by the bending of the knee, and other tokens of reverence, while the principal and genuine worship of him is inward, so is it also as to idols, for the case holds the same in things opposite. It is to no purpose that very many in the present day endeavor to excuse outward actions <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(572)</sup></span> on this pretext, that the heart is not in them, while Paul convicts of idolatry those very acts, and assuredly with good reason. For, as we owe to God not merely the secret affection of the heart, but also outward adoration, the man who offers to an idol an appearance of adoration takes away so much of the honor due to God. Let him allege as he may that his heart is quite away from it. The action itself is to be seen, in which the honor that is due to God is transferred to an idol. </p>
