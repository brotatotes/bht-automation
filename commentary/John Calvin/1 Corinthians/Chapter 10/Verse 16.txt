<p><b>16.</b><i>The cup of blessing</i> While the sacred Supper of Christ has two elements — bread and wine — he begins with the second. He calls it, <i>the cup of blessing</i>, as having been set apart for a mystical benediction. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(574)</sup></span> For I do not agree with those who understand <i>blessing to</i> mean <i>thanksgiving</i>, and interpret the verb <i>to bless</i>, as meaning to <i>give thanks</i> I acknowledge, indeed, that it is sometimes employed in this sense, but never in the construction that Paul has here made use of, for the idea of Erasmus, as to supplying a preposition, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(575)</sup></span> is exceedingly forced. On the other hand, the meaning that I adopt is easy, and has nothing of intricacy. </p>
<p>To <i>bless the cup,</i> then, is to set it apart for this purpose, that it may be to us an emblem of the blood of Christ. This is done by the word of promise, when believers meet together according to Christ’s appointment to celebrate the remembrance of his death in this Sacrament. The consecration, however, which the Papists make use of, is a kind of sorcery derived from heathens, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(576)</sup></span> which has nothing in common with the pure rite observed by Christians. Everything, it is true, that we eat <i>is sanctified by the word of God</i>, as Paul himself elsewhere bears witness, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:5">1 Timothy 4:5</span>;) but that <i>blessing</i> is for a different purpose — that our use of the gifts of God may be pure, and may tend to the glory of their Author, and to our advantage. On the other hand, the design of the mystical <i>blessing</i> in the Supper is, that the wine may be no longer a common beverage, but set apart for the spiritual nourishment of the soul, while it is an emblem of the blood of Christ. </p>
<p>Paul says, that the <i>cup</i> which has been in this manner<i>blessed</i> is <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κοινωνίαν</span></blu></grk> — the<i>comnunion</i> of the blood of the Lord. It is asked, in what sense? Let contention be avoided, and there will be nothing of obscurity. It is true, that believers are united together by Christ’s blood, so as to become one body. It is also true, that a unity of this kind is with propriety termed <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κοινωνία</span></blu></grk> (<i>communion</i>.) I make the same acknowledgment as to <i>the bread</i> Farther, I observe what Paul immediately adds, as it were, by way of explanation — that we <i>all become one body, because we are together partakers of the same bread</i> But whence, I pray you, comes that <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κοινωνία</span></blu></grk> (<i>communion</i>) between us, but from this, that we are united to Christ in such a way, that </p>
<p>we are flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones? <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:30">Ephesians 5:30</span>.) </p>
<p>For we must first of all be incorporated (so to speak) into Christ, that we may be united to each other. In addition to this, Paul is not disputing at present merely in reference to a mutual fellowship among men, but as to the spiritual union between Christ and believers, with the view of drawing from this, that it is an intolerable sacrilege for them to be polluted by fellowship with idols. From the connection of the passage, therefore, we may conclude, that (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κοινωνίαν</span></blu></grk>) the <i>communion of the blood</i> is that connection which we have with the blood of Christ, when he engrafts all of us together into his body, that he may live in us, and we in him. </p>
<p>Now, when the cup is called a <i>participation</i>, the expression, I acknowledge, is figurative, provided that the truth held forth in the figure is not taken away, or, in other words, provided that the reality itself is also present, and that the soul has as truly <i>communion in the blood</i>, as we drink wine with the mouth. But Papists could not say this, that <i>the cup of blessing is a participation in the blood of Christ</i>, for the Supper that they observe is mutilated and torn: if indeed we can give the name of the Supper to that strange ceremony which is a patchwork of various human contrivances, and scarcely retains the slightest vestige of the institution of our Lord. But, supposing that everything else were as it ought to be, this one thing is at variance with the right use of the Supper — the keeping back of the whole of the people from partaking of the cup, which is the half of the Sacrament. </p>
<p><i>The bread which we break</i> From this it appears, that it was the custom of the ancient Church to break one loaf, and distribute to every one his own morsel, in order that there might be presented more clearly to the view of all believers their union to the one body of Christ. And that this custom was long kept up appears from the testimony of those who flourished in the three centuries that succeeded the age of the Apostles. Hence arose the superstition, that no one dared to touch the bread with his hand, but each one had it put into his mouth by the priest. </p>
