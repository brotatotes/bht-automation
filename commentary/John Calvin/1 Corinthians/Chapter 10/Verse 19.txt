<p><b>19.</b><i>What do I say then?</i> It might seem at first view as if the Apostle either argued inconclusively, or ascribed to idols something of existence and of power. Now it might readily be objected — “What comparison is there between the living God and idols? God connects us with himself by the sacraments. Be it so. How comes it that idols, which are <i>nothing</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:4">1 Corinthians 8:4</span>,) have so much power, as to be able to do the like? Do you think that <i>idols are anything</i>, or can do anything?” He answers, that he does not look to the idols themselves; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(583)</sup></span> but rather has in view the intention of those who sacrifice to idols. For that was the source of the pollution that he had indirectly pointed out. He confesses, therefore, that an idol is nothing. He confesses that it is a mere delusion when the Gentiles take it upon them to go through solemn rites of dedication, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(584)</sup></span> and that the creatures of God are not polluted by such fooleries. But as the design of them is superstitious and condemnable, and as the work is base, he infers, that all who connect themselves with them as associates, are involved in pollution. </p>
