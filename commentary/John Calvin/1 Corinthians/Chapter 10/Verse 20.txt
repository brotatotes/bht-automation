<p><b>20.</b><i>But the things</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(585)</sup></span> <i>that the Gentiles sacrifice.</i> To complete the answer, a negative must be understood in this way: “I do not say that <i>an idol is anything</i>, nor do I imagine it to be endued with any virtue, but I say that <i>the Gentiles sacrifice to the devil and not to gods</i> those things which they do sacrifice, and hence I estimate the work by their wicked and impious superstition. For we must always look to the intention with which a thing is done. He, then, who connects himself with them, declares that he has fellowship with them in the same impiety.” He proceeds accordingly with what he had commenced: “If we had to do with God only, those things would be nothing, but, in relation to men, they become faulty; because no one sits down to an idol feast, who does not declare himself to be a worshipper of the idol.” </p>
<p>Some, however, understand the term <i>demons</i> here as meaning the imaginary deities of the Gentiles, agreeably to their common way of speaking of them; for when they speak of <i>demons</i> they meant inferior deities, as, for example, heroes, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(586)</sup></span> and thus the term was taken in a good sense. Plato, in a variety of instances, employs the term to denote <i>genii</i>, or angels. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(587)</sup></span> That meaning, however, would be quite foreign to Paul’s design, for his object is to show that it is no light offense to have to do with actions that have any appearance of putting honor upon idols. Hence it suited his purpose, not to extenuate, but rather to magnify the impiety that is involved in it. How absurd, then, it would have been to select an honorable term to denote the most heinous wickedness! It is certain from the Prophet Baruch, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="bar+4:7">Baruch 4:7</span>,) that <i>those things that are sacrificed to idols are sacrificed to devils</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+32:17">Deuteronomy 32:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+96:5">Psalms 96:5</span>.) In that passage in the writings of the Prophet, the Greek translation, which was at that time in common use, has <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δαιμόνια</span></blu></grk> — <i>demons</i>, and this is its common use in Scripture. How much more likely is it then, that Paul borrowed what he says from the Prophet, to express the enormity of the evil, than that, speaking after the manner of the heathen, he extenuated what he was desirous to hold up to utter execration! </p>
<p>It may seem, however, as if these things were somewhat at variance with what I stated a little ago — that Paul had an eye to the intention of idolaters, for it is not their intention to worship devils, but imaginary deities of their own framing. I answer, that the two things are quite in harmony, for when men become so <i>vain in their imaginations</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21">Romans 1:21</span>) as to render divine honor to creatures, rather than to the one God, this punishment is in readiness for them — that they serve Satan. For they do not find that “middle place” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(588)</sup></span> that they are in search of, but Satan straightway presents himself to them, as an object of adoration, whenever they have turned their back upon the true God. </p>
<p><i>I would not that ye.</i> If the term <i>demon</i> were used in an indifferent sense, how spiritless were Paul’s statement here, while, instead of this, it has the greatest weight and severity against idolaters! He subjoins the reason — because no one can have fellowship at the same time with God and with idols. Now, in all sacred observances, there is a profession of fellowship. Let us know, therefore, that we are then, and then only, admitted by Christ to the sacred feast of his body and blood, when we have first of all bid farewell to every thing sacrilegious. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(589)</sup></span> For the man who would enjoy the one, must renounce the other. O thrice miserable the condition of those <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(590)</sup></span> who, from fear of displeasing men, do not hesitate to pollute themselves with unlawful superstitions! For, by acting in this way, they voluntarily renounce fellowship with Christ, and obstruct their approach to his health-giving table. </p>
