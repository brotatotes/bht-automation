<p><b>23.</b><i>All things are lawful for me</i> Again he returns to the right of Christian liberty, by which the Corinthians defended themselves, and sets aside their objection by giving the same explanation as before. “To eat of meats that were sacrificed, and be present at the banquet, was an outward thing, and therefore was in itself lawful.” Paul declares that he does not by any means call this in question, but he replies, that we must have a regard to edification. <i>All things are lawful for me</i>, says he, <i>but all things are not profitable</i>, that is, for our neighbors, for no one, as he immediately adds, ought to seek his own advantage exclusively, and if anything is not profitable to the brethren, it must be abstained from. He, in the next place, expresses the kind of advantage — when it <i>edifies</i>, for we must not have respect merely to the advantage of the flesh. “What then? <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(594)</sup></span> Does a thing that is in other respects permitted by God, come on this account to be unlawful — if it is not expedient for our neighbor. Then in that <i>case</i> our liberty would be placed under subjection to men.” Consider attentively Paul’s words, and you will perceive that liberty, nevertheless, remains unimpaired, when you accommodate yourself to your neighbors, and that it is only the use of it that is restricted, for he acknowledges that it is <i>lawful</i>, but says that it ought not to be made use of, if it does not <i>edify</i> </p>
