<p><b>25.</b><i>Whatsoever is sold in the shambles</i> He has spoken above of dissembling in connection with idolatry, or, at least, as to those actions which the Corinthians could not engage in, without professing themselves to be the associates of the wicked in their superstitions. He now requires them, not merely to abstain from all professions of idolatry, but also to avoid carefully all occasions of offense, which are wont to arise from the indiscriminate use of things indifferent. For, although there was but one kind of offense on the part of the Corinthians, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(595)</sup></span> there were, at the same time different degrees of it. Now, as to the eating of food, he makes, in the <i>first</i> place, this general statement — that it is lawful to eat, with a safe <i>conscience</i>, any kind of food, because the Lord permits it. In the <i>second</i> place, he restricts this liberty as to the use of it — lest weak consciences should be injured. Thus this conclusion is divided into two parts the <i>first</i> relates to liberty and power as to things indifferent: the <i>second</i> to a limitation of it — that the use of it may be regulated in accordance with the rule of love. </p>

<p><i>For conscience sake</i> — that is to say, Before the judgment-seat of God — “In so far as you have to do with God, there is no occasion for your disputing with yourself, whether it be lawful or not. For I allow you to eat freely of all kinds of meat, because the Lord allows you everything without exception.” </p>
