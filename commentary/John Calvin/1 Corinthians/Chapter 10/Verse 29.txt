<p><b>29.</b><i>Conscience, I say, not thine own</i> He always carefully takes heed not to diminish liberty, or to appear to take from it in any degree. “Thou oughtest to bear with the weak conscience of thy brother, that thou mayest not abuse thy right, so as to give occasion of offense to him; but in the meantime thy conscience remains, nevertheless, free, because it is exempted from that subjection. Let not, therefore, the restraint which I impose upon thee as to outward use, become by any means a snare to entangle thy conscience.” </p>
<p>It must be observed here, that the term <i>conscience</i> is taken here in its strict acceptation; for in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:5">Romans 13:5</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span>, it is taken in a larger sense. “We ought, says Paul, to obey princes, <i>not merely for the sake of wrath</i>, <i>but also for that of conscience</i> ” — that is, not merely from fear of punishment, but because the Lord orders it so, and it is our duty. Is it not reasonable, too, that we should for the same reason accommodate ourselves to weak brethren — that is, because we are to this extent subject to them in the sight of God? Farther, <i>the end of the commandment is love out of a good conscience</i> Is not the affection of <i>love</i> included in a <i>good conscience?</i> Hence its meaning here is, as I have already stated, more restricted, inasmuch as the soul of a pious man looks exclusively to the tribunal of God, has no regard to men, is satisfied with the blessing of liberty procured for it by Christ, and is bound to no individuals, and to no circumstances of time or place. </p>
<p>Some manuscripts repeat the statement — <i>The earth is the Lord’s.</i> But the probability is, that some reader having put it on the margin, it had crept into the text. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(603)</sup></span> It is not, however, a matter of great importance. </p>
<p><i>For why is my liberty</i> It is doubtful, whether Paul speaks in this way of himself, or whether he makes this objection in the name of the Corinthians. If we take it as spoken in his own name, it will be a confirmation of the preceding statement. “In restricting yourself, for the sake of another man’s conscience, your liberty is not thereby made subject to him.” If in the name of the Corinthians, the meaning will be this: “You impose upon us an unjust law, in requiring that our liberty should stand or fall at the caprice of others.” I am of opinion, that Paul says this of himself, but explains it in another way, for hitherto I have been stating the views of others. To be <i>judged</i>, then, I explain here as meaning — to be <i>condemned</i>, agreeably to the common acceptation of the word in Scripture. Paul warns us of the danger that must ensue, if we make use of our liberty unreservedly, so as to give occasion of offense to our neighbors — that they will <i>condemn</i> it. Thus, through our fault, and our unreasonableness, the consequence will be, that this special benefit from God will be <i>condemned</i> If we do not guard against this danger, we corrupt our liberty by our abuse of it. This consideration, then, tends very much to confirm Paul’s exhortation. </p>
