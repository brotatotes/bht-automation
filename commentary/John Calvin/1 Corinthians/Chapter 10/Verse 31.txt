<p><b>31.</b><i>Whether, therefore, ye eat, or drink</i> Lest they should think, that in so small a matter they should not be so careful to avoid blame, he teaches that there is no part of our life, and no action so minute, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(605)</sup></span> that it ought not to be directed to the glory of God, and that we must take care that, even in eating and drinking, we may aim at the advancement of it. This statement is connected with what goes before; for if we are eagerly desirous of the glory of God, as it becomes us to be, we will never allow, so far as we can prevent it, his benefits to lie under reproach. It was well expressed anciently in a common proverb, that we must not <i>live to eat</i>; but <i>eat to live</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(606)</sup></span> Provided the end of living be at the same time kept in view, the consequence will thus be, that our food will be in a manner sacred to God, inasmuch as it will be set apart for his service. </p>
