<p><b>6.</b><i>Now these things were types to us.</i> He warns us in still more explicit terms, that we have to do with the punishment that was inflicted upon them, so that they are a lesson to us, that we may not provoke the anger of God as they did. “God,” says he, “in punishing them has set before us, as in a picture, his severity, that, instructed by their example, we may learn to fear.” Of the term <i>type</i> I shall speak presently. Only for the present I should wish my readers to know, that it is not without consideration that I have given a different rendering from that of the old translation, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(540)</sup></span> and of Erasmus. For they obscure Paul’s meaning, or at least they do not bring out with sufficient clearness this idea — that God has in that people presented a picture for our instruction. </p>

The people, after having been for some time fed with manna, at length took a dislike to it, and began to desire other kinds of food, which they had been accustomed to partake of in Egypt. Now they sinned in two ways, for they despised the peculiar gift of God, and they eagerly longed after a variety of meats and delicacies, contrary to the will of God. The Lord, provoked by this lawless appetite, inflicted upon the people a grievous blow. Hence the place was called the </p>
<p>graves of lust, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(541)</sup></span> because there they buried those whom <br>the Lord had smitten. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:34">Numbers 11:34</span>.) </br></p>
<p>The Lord by this example testified how much he hates those lusts that arise from dislike of his gifts, and from our lawless appetite, for whatever goes beyond the measure that God has prescribed is justly reckoned evil and unlawful. </p>
