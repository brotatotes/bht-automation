<p><b>11.</b><i>But neither is the man without the woman</i> This is added partly as a check upon men, that they may not insult over women; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(634)</sup></span> and partly as a consolation to women, that they may not feel dissatisfied with being under subjection. “The male sex (says he) has a distinction over the female sex, with this understanding, that they ought to be connected together by mutual benevolence, for the one cannot do without the other. If they be separated, they are like the mutilated members of a mangled body. Let them, therefore, be connected with each other by the bond of mutual duty.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(635)</sup></span> </p>
<p>When he says, <i>in the Lord</i>, he by this expression calls the attention of believers to the appointment of the Lord, while the wicked look to nothing beyond pressing necessity. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(636)</sup></span> For profane men, if they can conveniently live unmarried, despise the whole sex, and do not consider that they are under obligations to it by the appointment and decree of God. The pious, on the other hand, acknowledge that the male sex is but the half of the human race. They ponder the meaning of that statement — <i>God created man</i>: <i>male and female created he them</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:27">Genesis 1:27</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+5:2">Genesis 5:2</span>.) Thus they, of their own accord, acknowledge themselves to be debtors to the weaker sex. Pious women, in like manner, reflect upon their obligation. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(637)</sup></span> Thus the man has no standing without the woman, for that would be the head severed from the body; nor has the woman without the man, for that were a body without a head. “Let, therefore, the man perform to the woman the office of the head in respect of ruling her, and let the woman perform to the man the office of the body in respect of assisting him, and that not merely in the married state, but also in celibacy; for I do not speak of cohabitation merely, but also of civil offices, for which there is occasion even in the unmarried state.” If you are inclined rather to refer this to the whole sex in general, I do not object to this, though, as Paul directs his discourse to individuals, he appears to point out the particular duty of each. </p>
