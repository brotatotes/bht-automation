<p><b>12.</b><i>As the woman is of the man</i> If this is one of the reasons, why the man has superiority — that the woman was taken out of him, there will be, in like manner, this motive to friendly connection — that the male sex cannot maintain and preserve itself without the aid of women. For this remains a settled point — that <i>it is not good for man to be alone</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:18">Genesis 2:18</span>.) This statement of Paul may, it is true, be viewed as referring to propagation, because human beings are propagated not by men alone, but by men and women; but I understand it as meaning this also — that the woman is a needful help to the man, inasmuch as a solitary life is not expedient for man. This decree of God exhorts us to cultivate mutual intercourse. </p>
<p><i>But all things of God</i> God is the Source of both sexes, and hence both of them ought with humility to accept and maintain the condition which the Lord has assigned to them. Let the <i>man</i> exercise his authority with moderation, and not insult over the woman who has been given him as his partner. Let the <i>woman</i> be satisfied with her state of subjection, and not take it amiss that she is made inferior to the more distinguished sex. Otherwise they will both of them throw off the yoke of God, who has not without good reason appointed this distinction of ranks. Farther, when it is said that the man and the woman, when they are wanting in their duty to each other, are rebels against the authority of God, the statement is a more serious one than if Paul had said, that they do injury to one another. </p>
<p><i>Doth not even nature itself</i> He again sets forth <i>nature</i> as the mistress of decorum, and what was at that time in common use by universal consent and custom — even among the Greeks — he speaks of as being <i>natural</i>, for it was not always reckoned a disgrace for men to have long hair. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(638)</sup></span> Historical records bear, that in all countries in ancient times, that is, in the first ages, men wore long hair. Hence also the poets, in speaking of the ancients, are accustomed to apply to them the common epithet of <i>unshorn</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(639)</sup></span> It was not until a late period that barbers began to be employed at Rome — about the time of Africanus the elder. And at the time when Paul wrote these things, the practice of having the hair shorn had not yet come into use in the provinces of Gaul or in Germany. Nay more, it would have been reckoned an unseemly thing for men, no less than for women, to be shorn or shaven; but as in Greece it was reckoned all unbecoming thing for a man to allow his hair to grow long, so that those who did so were remarked as effeminate, he reckons as <i>nature</i> a custom that had come to be confirmed. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(640)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(638)</span> It is remarked by President Edwards, that “the emphasis used, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">αὐτὴ ἡ φύσις</span></blu></grk>, <i>nature itself</i>, shows that the Apostle does not mean custom, but nature in the proper sense. It is true it was long custom that made having the head covered a token of subjection, and a feminine habit or appearance, as it is custom that makes any outward action or word a sign or signification of anything; but nature itself, nature in its proper sense, teaches that it is a shame for a man to appear with the established signs of the female sex. Nature itself shows it to be a shame for a father to bow down or kneel to his own child or servant, because bowing down is, by custom, an established token of subjection and submission.” Edwards on Original Sin, part 2, chapter 3, section 3. — <i>Ed</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(639)</span> Instances of this occur in Ovid, Fast. 2. 30, and in Hor., Od. 2, 15, 11. Gaul, to the north of the Alps, was called Gallia <i>comata</i>, from the inhabitants <i>wearing their hair long</i> Homer applies to the Greeks in his time the epithet of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καρηκομόωντες</span></blu></grk> — <i>long-haired</i> Hom. Il., 2. 11. — <i>Ed</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(640)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">I1 appelle Nature ceste coustume desia confermee par vn long temps et vsage commun</span></blu>;” — “He gives the appellation of Nature to this custom, already confirmed by length of time and common use.” </p>
