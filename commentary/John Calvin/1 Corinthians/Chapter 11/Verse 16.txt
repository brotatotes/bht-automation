<p><b>16.</b><i>But if any man seem</i> A <i>contentious</i> person is one whose humor inclines him to stir up disputes, and does not care what becomes of the truth. Of this description are all who, without any necessity, abolish good and useful customs — raise disputes respecting matters that are not doubtful — who do not yield to reasonings — who cannot endure that any one should be above them. Of this description, also, are those (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀκοινώνητοι</span></blu></grk>) would be singular persons <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(641)</sup></span> who, from a foolish affectation, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(642)</sup></span> aim at some new and unusual way of acting. Such persons Paul does not reckon worthy of being replied to, inasmuch as contention is a pernicious thing, and ought, therefore, to be banished from the Churches. By this he teaches us, that those that are obstinate and fond of quarrelling, should rather be restrained by authority than confuted by lengthened disputations. For you will never have an end of contentions, if you are disposed to contend with a combative person until you have vanquished him; for though vanquished a hundred times, he would argue still. Let us therefore carefully mark this passage, that we may not allow ourselves to be carried away with needless disputations, provided at the same time we know how to distinguish <i>contentious</i> persons. For we must not always reckon as <i>contentious</i> the man who does not acquiesce in our decisions, or who ventures to contradict us; but when temper and obstinacy show themselves, let us then say with Paul, that <i>contentions are at variance with the custom of the Church</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(643)</sup></span> </p>
