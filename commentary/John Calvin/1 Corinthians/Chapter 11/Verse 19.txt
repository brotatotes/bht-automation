<p><b>19.</b><i>For there must be also heresies</i> He had previously spoken of <i>divisions</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:18">1 Corinthians 11:18</span>.) Now he uses the term <i>heresies</i>, with the view of amplifying the more, as we may infer, too, from the word <i>also</i>, for it is added for the sake of amplification. (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">προς αὔξησιν</span></blu></grk>.) It is well known in what sense the ancients used those two terms, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(648)</sup></span> and what distinction they made between Heretics and Schismatics. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(649)</sup></span> <i>Heresy</i> they made to consist in disagreement as to doctrine, and <i>schism</i>, on the contrary, in alienation of affection, as when any one withdrew from the Church from envy, or from dislike of the pastors, or from ill nature. It is true, that the Church cannot but be torn asunder by false doctrine, and thus heresy is the root and origin of schism, and it is also true that envy or pride is the mother of almost all heresies, but at the same time it is of advantage to distinguish in this way between these two terms. </p>
<p>But let us see in what sense Paul employs them. I have already expressed my disapprobation of those who explain heresy as meaning the setting up of a separate table, inasmuch as the rich did not partake of their Supper along with the poor; for he had it in view to point out something more hateful. But without mentioning the opinions of others, I take <i>schism</i> and <i>heresy</i> here in the way of less and greater. Schisms, then, are either secret grudges — when we do not see that agreement which ought to subsist among the pious — when inclinations at variance with each other are at work — when every one is mightily pleased with his own way, and finds fault with everything that is done by others. <i>Heresies</i> are when the evil proceeds to such a pitch that open hostility is discovered, and persons deliberately divide themselves into opposite parties. Hence, in order that believers might not feel discouraged on seeing the Corinthians torn with <i>divisions</i>, the Apostle turns round this occasion of offense in an opposite direction, intimating that the Lord does rather by such trials make proof of his people’s constancy. A lovely consolation! “So far, says he, should we be from being troubled, or cast down, when we do not see complete unity in the Church, but on the contrary some threatenings of separation from want of proper agreement, that even if sects should start up, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(650)</sup></span> we ought to remain firm and constant. For in this way hypocrites are detected — in this way, on the other hand, the sincerity of believers is tried. For as this gives occasion for discovering the fickleness of those who were not rooted in the Lord’s Word, and the wickedness of those who had assumed the appearance of good men, so the good afford a more signal manifestation of their constancy and sincerity.” </p>
<p>But observe what Paul says — <i>there must be,</i> for he intimates by this expression, that this state of matters does not happen by chance, but by the sure providence of God, because he has it in view to try his people, as gold in the furnace, and if it is agreeable to the mind of God, it is, consequently, expedient. At the same time, however, we must not enter into thorny disputes, or rather into labyrinths as to a fatal necessity. We know that there never will be a time when there will not be many reprobates. We know that they are governed by the spirit of Satan, and are effectually drawn away to what is evil. We know that Satan, in his activity, leaves no stone unturned with the view of breaking up the unity of the Church. From this — not from fate — comes that necessity of which Paul makes mention. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(651)</sup></span> We know, also, that the Lord, by his admirable wisdom, turns Satan’s deadly machinations so as to promote the salvation of believers. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(652)</sup></span> Hence comes that design of which he speaks — <i>that the good may shine forth more conspicuously</i>; for we ought not to ascribe this advantage to <i>heresies</i>, which, being evil, can produce nothing but what is evil, but to God, who, by his infinite goodness, changes the nature of things, so that those things are salutary to the elect, which Satan had contrived for their ruin. As to Chrysostom’s contending that the particle <i>that</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἴνα</span></blu></grk>) denotes not the cause, but the event, it is of no great moment. For the cause is the secret counsel of God, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(653)</sup></span> by which things that are evil are overruled in such a manner, as to have a good issue. We know, in fine, that the wicked are impelled by Satan in such a manner, that they both act and are acted upon with the consent of their wills. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(654)</sup></span> Hence they are without excuse. </p>
