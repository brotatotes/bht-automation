<p><b>22.</b><i>Have ye not houses</i> ? From this we see that the Apostle was utterly dissatisfied with this custom of feasting, even though the abuse formerly mentioned had not existed. For, though it seems allowable for the whole Church to partake at one common table, yet this, on the other hand, is wrong — to convert a sacred assembly to purposes foreign to its nature. We know for what exercises a Church should assemble — to hear doctrine, to pour forth prayers, and sing hymns to God, to observe the sacraments, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(665)</sup></span> to make confession of their faith, and to engage in pious observances, and other exercises of piety. If anything else is done there, it is out of place. Every one has his own house appointed him for eating and drinking, and hence that is an unseemly thing in a sacred assembly. </p>
<p><i>What shall I say to you?</i> Having fitly stated the case, he now calls them to consider, whether they are <i>worthy to be praised</i>, for they could not defend an abuse that was so manifest. He presses them still further, by asking — “What else could I do? Will you say that you are unjustly reproved?” Some manuscripts connect the words <i>in this</i> with the verb that follows — in this way: <i>Shall I praise you</i> ?<i>In this I do not praise you</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(666)</sup></span> The other reading, however, is the more generally received among the Greeks, and it suits better. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(665)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Pour receuoir et administrer los sacrements</span></blu>;” — “To receive and administer the sacraments.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(666)</span> The earlier English versions follow this reading. Thus Wiclif, (1380) — <i>What schal I seie to zou</i> ?<i>I preise zou</i>: <i>but hereynne I preise zou not</i>; Tyndale, (1534) — <i>What shall I saye unto you</i> ?<i>Shall I prayse you</i>: <i>In this prayse I you not</i>; Cranmer, (1539) — <i>What shall I saye unto you</i> ?<i>Shall I prayse you</i> ?<i>In this prayse I you</i>, <i>not</i>. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
