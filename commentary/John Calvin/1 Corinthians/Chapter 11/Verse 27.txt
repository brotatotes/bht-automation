<p><b>27.</b><i>Therefore he who shall eat this bread unworthily.</i> If the Lord requires gratitude from us in the receiving of this sacrament — if he would have us acknowledge his grace with the heart, and publish it with the mouth — that man will not go unpunished, who has put insult upon him rather than honor; for the Lord will not allow his commandment to be despised. Now, if we would catch the meaning of this declaration, we must know what it is to <i>eat unworthily</i> Some restrict it to the Corinthians, and the abuse that had crept in among them, but I am of opinion that Paul here, according to his usual manner, passed on from the particular case to a general statement, or from one instance to an entire class. There was one fault that prevailed among the Corinthians. He takes occasion from this to speak of every kind of faulty administration or reception of the Supper. “<i>God</i>, ” says he, “<i>will</i> not allow this sacrament to be profaned without punishing it severely.” </p>
<p>To <i>eat unworthily,</i> then, is to pervert the pure and right <i>use</i> of it by our <i>abuse</i> of it. Hence there are various degrees of this <i>unworthiness</i>, so to speak; and some offend more grievously, others less so. <i>Some fornicator</i>, perhaps, or <i>perjurer</i>, or <i>drunkard</i>, or <i>cheat</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:11">1 Corinthians 5:11</span>,) intrudes himself without repentance. As such downright contempt is a token of wanton insult against Christ, there can be no doubt that such a person, whoever he is, receives the Supper to his own destruction. Another, perhaps, will come forward, who is not addicted to any open or flagrant vice, but at the same time not so prepared in heart as became him. As this carelessness or negligence is a sign of irreverence, it is also deserving of punishment from God. As, then, there are various degrees of <i>unworthy participation</i>, so the Lord punishes some more slightly; on others he inflicts severer punishment. </p>
<p>Now this passage gave rise to a question, which some afterwards agitated with too much keenness — whether the <i>unworthy</i> really partake of the Lord’s body? For some were led, by the heat of controversy, so far as to say, that it was received indiscriminately by the good and the bad; and many at this day maintain pertinaciously, and most clamorously, that in the first Supper Peter received no more than Judas. It is, indeed, with reluctance, that I dispute keenly with any one on this point, which is (in my opinion) not an essential one; but as others allow themselves, without reason, to pronounce, with a magisterial air, whatever may seem good to them, and to launch out thunderbolts upon every one that mutters anything to the contrary, we will be excused, if we calmly adduce reasons in support of what we reckon to be true. </p>
<p>I hold it, then, as a settled point, and will not allow myself to be driven from it, that Christ cannot be disjoined from his Spirit. Hence I maintain, that his body is not received as dead, or even inactive, disjoined from the grace and power of his Spirit. I shall not occupy much time in proving this statement. Now in what way could the man who is altogether destitute of a living faith and repentance, having nothing of the Spirit of Christ, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(699)</sup></span> receive Christ himself? Nay more, as he is entirely under the influence of Satan and sin, how will he be capable of receiving Christ? While, therefore, I acknowledge that there are some who receive Christ truly in the Supper, and yet at the same time <i>unworthily</i>, as is the case with many weak persons, yet I do not admit, that those who bring with them a mere historical faith, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(700)</sup></span> without a lively feeling of repentance and faith, receive anything but the sign. For I cannot endure to maim Christ, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(701)</sup></span> and I shudder at the absurdity of affirming that he gives himself to be eaten by the wicked in a lifeless state, as it were. Nor does Augustine mean anything else when he says, that the wicked receive Christ merely in the sacrament, which he expresses more clearly elsewhere, when he says that the other Apostles ate<i>the bread</i> — <i>the Lord</i>; but Judas only the <i>bread of the Lord</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(702)</sup></span> </p>
<p>But here it is objected, that the efficacy of the sacraments does not depend upon the worthiness of men, and that nothing is taken away from the promises of God, or falls to the ground, through the wickedness of men. This I acknowledge, and accordingly I add in express terms, that Christ’s body is presented to the wicked no less than to the good, and this is enough so far as concerns the efficacy of the sacrament and the faithfulness of God. For God does not there represent in a delusive manner, to the wicked, the body of his Son, but presents it in reality; nor is the bread a bare sign to them, but a faithful pledge. As to their rejection of it, that does not impair or alter anything as to the nature of the sacrament. </p>
<p>It remains, that we give a reply to the statement of Paul in this passage. “Paul represents the unworthy as guilty, inasmuch as <i>they do not discern the Lord’s body</i>: it follows, that they receive his body.” I deny the inference; for though they reject it, yet as they profane it and treat it with dishonor when it is presented to them, they are deservedly held guilty; for they do, as it were, cast it upon the ground, and trample it under their feet. Is such sacrilege trivial? Thus I see no difficulty in Paul’s words, provided you keep in view what God presents and holds out to the wicked — not what they receive. </p>
