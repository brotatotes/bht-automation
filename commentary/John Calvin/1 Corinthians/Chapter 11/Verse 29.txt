<p><b>29.</b><i>He who shall eat unworthily, eateth judgment to himself.</i> He had previously pointed out in express terms the heinousness of the crime, when he said that those who should <i>eat unworthily</i> would be <i>guilty of the body and blood of the Lord</i> Now he alarms them, by denouncing punishment; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(706)</sup></span> for there are many that are not affected with the sin itself; unless they are struck down by the judgment of God. This, then, he does, when he declares that this food, otherwise health-giving, will turn out to their destruction, and will be converted into poison to those that <i>eat unworthily</i> </p>
<p>He adds the reasons because they distinguish not the Lord’s body, that is, as a sacred thing from a profane. “They handle the sacred body of Christ with unwashed hands, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:2">Mark 7:2</span>,) <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(707)</sup></span> nay more, as if it were a thing of nought, they consider not how great is the value of it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(708)</sup></span> They will therefore pay the penalty of so dreadful a profanation.” Let my readers keep in mind what I stated a little ago, that the body <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(709)</sup></span> is presented to them, though their unworthiness deprives them of a participation in it. </p>
