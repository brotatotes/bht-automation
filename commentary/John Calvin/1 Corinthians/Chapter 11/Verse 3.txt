<p><b>3.</b><i>But I would have you know</i> It is an old proverb: “Evil manners beget good laws.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(618)</sup></span> As the rite here treated of had not been previously called in question, Paul had given no enactment respecting it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(619)</sup></span> The error of the Corinthians was the occasion of his showing, what part it was becoming to act in this matter. With the view of proving, that it is an unseemly thing for women to appear in a public assembly with their heads uncovered, and, on the other hand, for men to pray or prophesy with their heads <i>covered</i>, he sets out with noticing the arrangements that are divinely established. </p>
<p>He says, that <i>as Christ is subject to God as his head, so is the man subject to Christ, and the woman to the man</i> We shall afterwards see, how he comes to infer from this, that women ought to have their heads covered. Let us, for the present, take notice of those four gradations which he points out. God, then, occupies the <i>first</i> place: Christ holds the <i>second</i> place. How so? Inasmuch as he has in our flesh made himself subject to the Father, for, apart from this, being of one essence with the Father, he is his equal. Let us, therefore, bear it in mind, that this is spoken of Christ as mediator. He is, I say, inferior to the Father, inasmuch as he assumed our nature, <i>that he might be the first-born among many brethren.</i> </p>
<p>There is somewhat more of difficulty in what follows. Here the man is placed in an intermediate position between Christ and the woman, so that Christ is not the head of the woman. Yet the same Apostle teaches us elsewhere, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:28">Galatians 3:28</span>,) that <i>in Christ there is neither male nor female</i>. Why then does he make a distinction here, which in that passage he does away with? I answer, that the solution of this depends on the connection in which the passages occur. When he says that there is no difference between the man and the woman, he is treating of Christ’s spiritual kingdom, in which individual distinctions <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(620)</sup></span> are not regarded, or made any account of; for it has nothing to do with the body, and has nothing to do with the outward relationships of mankind, but has to do solely with the mind — on which account he <i>declares</i> that there is no difference, even between <i>bond</i> and <i>free</i>. In the meantime, however, he does not disturb civil order or honorary distinctions, which cannot be dispensed with in ordinary life. Here, on the other hand, he reasons respecting outward propriety and decorum — which is a part of ecclesiastical polity. Hence, as regards spiritual connection in the sight of God, and inwardly in the conscience, Christ is the head of the man and of the woman without any distinction, because, as to that, there is no regard paid to male or female; but as regards external arrangement and political decorum, the man follows Christ and the woman the man, so that they are not upon the same footing, but, on the contrary, this inequality exists. Should any one ask, what connection marriage has with Christ, I answer, that Paul speaks here of that sacred union of pious persons, of which Christ is the officiating priest, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(621)</sup></span> and He in whose name it is consecrated. </p>
