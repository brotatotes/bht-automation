<p><b>30.</b><i>For this cause</i>, etc. After having treated in a general way of <i>unworthy eating</i>, and of the kind of punishment that awaits those who pollute this sacrament, he now instructs the Corinthians as to the chastisement which they were at that time enduring. It is not known whether a pestilence was raging there at that time, or whether they were laboring under other kinds of disease. However it may have been as to this, we infer from Paul’s words, that the Lord had sent some scourge upon them for their correction. Nor does Paul merely conjecture, that it is on that account that they are punished, but he affirms it as a thing that was perfectly well known by him. He says, then, that <i>many lay sick</i> — that many were kept long in a languishing condition, and that many had died, in consequence of that abuse of the Supper, because they had offended God. By this he intimates, that by diseases and other chastisements from God, we are admonished to think of our sins; for God does not afflict us without good reason, for he takes no pleasure in our afflictions. </p>
<p>The subject is a copious and ample one; but let it suffice to advert to it here in a single word. If in Paul’s times an ordinary abuse of the Supper <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(710)</sup></span> could kindle the wrath of God against the Corinthians, so that he punished them thus severely, what ought we to think as to the state of matters at the present day? We see, throughout the whole extent of Popery, not merely horrid profanations of the Supper, but even a sacrilegious abomination set up in its room. In the <i>first</i> place, it is prostituted to <i>filthy lucre</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8">1 Timothy 3:8</span>) and merchandise. <i>Secondly</i>, it is maimed, by taking away the use of the cup. <i>Thirdly</i>, it is changed into another aspect, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(711)</sup></span> by its having become customary for one to partake of his own feast separately, participation being done away. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(712)</sup></span> <i>Fourthly</i>, there is <i>there</i> no explanation of the meaning of the sacrament, but a mumbling that would accord better with a magical incantation, or the detestable <i>sacrifices</i> of the Gentiles, than with our Lord’s institution. <i>Fifthly</i>, there is an endless number of ceremonies, abounding partly with trifles, partly with superstition, and consequently manifest pollutions. <i>Sixthly</i>, there is the diabolical invention of sacrifice, which contains an impious blasphemy against the death of Christ. <i>Seventhly</i>, it is fitted to intoxicate miserable men with carnal <i>confidence</i>, while they present it to God as if it were an expiation, and think that by this charm they drive off everything hurtful, and that without faith and repentance. Nay more, while they trust that they are armed against the devil and death, and are fortified against God by a sure defense, they venture to sin with much more freedom, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(713)</sup></span> and become more obstinate. <i>Eighthly</i>, an idol is <i>there</i> adored in the room of Christ. In short, it is filled with all kinds of abomination. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(714)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Nay even among ourselves, who have the pure administration of the Supper restored to us, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(715)</sup></span> in virtue of a return, as it were, from captivity, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(716)</sup></span> how much irreverence! How much hypocrisy on the part of many! What a disgraceful mixture, while, without any discrimination, wicked and openly abandoned persons intrude themselves, such as no man of character and decency would admit to common intercourse! <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(717)</sup></span> And yet after all, we wonder how it comes that there are so many wars, so many pestilences, so many failures of the crop, so many disasters and calamities — as if the cause were not manifest! And assuredly, we must not expect a termination to our calamities, until we have removed the occasion of them, by correcting our faults. </p>
