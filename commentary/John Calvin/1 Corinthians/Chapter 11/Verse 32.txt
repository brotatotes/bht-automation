<p><b>32.</b><i>But when we are judged</i> Here we have a consolation that is exceedingly necessary; for if any one in affliction thinks that God is angry with him, he will rather be discouraged than excited to repentance. Paul, accordingly, says, that God is angry with believers in such a way as not in the meantime to be forgetful of his mercy: nay more, that it is on this account particularly that he punishes them — that he may consult their welfare. It is an inestimable consolation <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(720)</sup></span> <sup>—</sup> that the punishments by which our sins are chastened are evidences, not of God’s anger for our destruction, but rather of his paternal love, and are at the same time of assistance towards our salvation, for God is angry with us as his sons, whom he will not leave to perish. </p>
<p>When he <i>says</i> — <i>that we may not be condemned with the world</i>, he intimates two things. The <i>first</i> is, that the children of this world, while they sleep on quietly and securely in their delights, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(721)</sup></span> are fattened up, like hogs, for <i>the day of slaughter</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+12:3">Jeremiah 12:3</span>.) For though the Lord sometimes invites the wicked, also, to repentance by his chastisements, yet he often passes them over as strangers, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(722)</sup></span> and allows them to rush on with impunity, until they <i>have filled up the measure</i> of their final condemnation. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:16">Genesis 15:16</span>.) This privilege, therefore, belongs to believers exclusively — that by punishments they are called back from destruction. The <i>second</i> thing is this — that chastisements are necessary remedies for believers, for otherwise they, too, would rush on to everlasting destruction, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(723)</sup></span> were they not restrained by temporal punishment. </p>
<p>These considerations should lead us not merely to patience, so as to endure with equanimity the troubles that are assigned to us by God, but also to gratitude, that, giving thanks to God our Father, we may resign ourselves <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(724)</sup></span> to his discipline by a willing subjection. They are also useful to us in various ways; for they cause our afflictions to be salutary to us, while they train us up for mortification of the flesh, and a pious abasement — they accustom us to obedience to God — they convince us of our own weakness, they kindle up in our minds fervency in prayer — they exercise hope, so that at length whatever there is of bitterness in them is all swallowed up in spiritual joy. </p>
