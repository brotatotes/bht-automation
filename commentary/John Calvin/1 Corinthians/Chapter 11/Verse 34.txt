<p><b>34.</b><i>The rest I will set in order when I come</i> It is probable, that there were some things in addition, which it would be of advantage to put into better order, but as they were of less importance, the Apostle delays the correction of them until his coming among them. It may be, at the same time, that there was nothing of this nature; but as one knows better what is necessary when he is present to see, Paul reserves to himself the liberty of arranging matters when present, according as occasion may require. Papists arm themselves against us with this buckler, too, for defending their <i>mass</i> For they interpret <i>this</i> to be the <i>setting in order</i> which Paul here promises — as if he would have taken the liberty <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(725)</sup></span> of overturning that eternal appointment of Christ, which he here so distinctly approves of! For what resemblance does the mass bear to Christ’s institution? But away with such trifles, as it is certain that Paul speaks only of outward decorum. As this is put in the power of the Church, so it ought to be arranged according to the condition of times, places, and persons. </p>
