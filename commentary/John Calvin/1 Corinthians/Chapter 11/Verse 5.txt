<p><b>5.</b><i>Every woman praying or prophesying</i> Here we have the <i>second</i> proposition — that women ought <i>to have their heads covered</i> when they <i>pray</i> or <i>prophesy</i>; otherwise they <i>dishonor their head</i> For as the <i>man</i> honors his head by showing his liberty, so the <i>woman</i>, by showing her subjection. Hence, on the other hand, if the woman uncovers her head, she shakes off subjection — involving contempt of her husband. It may seem, however, to be superfluous for Paul to forbid the woman to prophesy with her head uncovered, while elsewhere he wholly </p>
<p>prohibits women from speaking in the Church. <br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:12">1 Timothy 2:12</span>.) </br></p>
<p>It would not, therefore, be allowable for them to prophesy even with a covering upon their head, and hence it follows that it is to no purpose that he argues here as to a covering. It may be replied, that the Apostle, by here condemning the one, does not commend the other. For when he reproves them for prophesying with their head uncovered, he at the same time does not give them permission to prophesy in some other way, but rather delays his condemnation of that vice to another passage, namely in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:34">1 Corinthians 14:34</span>. In this reply there is nothing amiss, though at the same time it might suit sufficiently well to say, that the Apostle requires women to show their modesty — not merely in a place in which the whole Church is assembled, but also in any more dignified assembly, either of matrons or of men, such as are sometimes convened in private houses. </p>
<p><i>For it is all one as if she were shaven.</i> He now maintains from other considerations, that it is unseemly for women to have their heads bare. <i>Nature itself</i>, says he, abhors it. To see a woman shaven is a spectacle that is disgusting and monstrous. Hence we infer that the woman <i>has her hair given her for a covering</i> Should any one now object, that her hair is enough, as being a natural covering, Paul says that it is <i>not</i>, for it is such a covering as requires another thing to be made use of for covering <i>it</i> And hence a conjecture is drawn, with some appearance of probability — that women who had beautiful hair were accustomed to uncover their heads for the purpose of showing off their beauty. It is not, therefore, without good reason that Paul, as a remedy for this vice, sets before them the opposite idea — that they be regarded as remarkable for unseemliness, rather than for what is an incentive to lust. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(625)</sup></span> </p>
