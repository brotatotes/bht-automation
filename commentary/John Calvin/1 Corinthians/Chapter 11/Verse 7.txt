<p><b>7.</b><i>The man ought not to cover his head, because he is the image</i> The same question may now be proposed respecting the <i>image</i>, as formerly respecting the<i>head.</i> For both sexes were created in the image of God, and Paul exhorts women no less than men to be formed anew, according to that image. The <i>image</i>, however, of which he is now speaking, relates to the order of marriage, and hence it belongs to the present life, and is not connected with conscience. The simple solution is this — that he does not treat here of innocence and holiness, which are equally becoming in men and women, but of the distinction, which God has conferred upon the man, so as to have superiority over the woman. In this superior order of dignity the glory of God is seen, as it shines forth in every kind of superiority. </p>
<p><i>The woman is the glory of the man</i> There is no doubt that the woman is a distinguished ornament of the man; for it is a great honor that God has appointed her to the man as the partner of his life, and a helper to him, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(626)</sup></span> and has made her subject to him as the body is to the head. For what Solomon affirms as to a careful wife — that <i>she is a crown to her husband</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="pr+12:4">Proverbs 12:4</span>,) is true of the whole sex, if we look to the appointment of God, which Paul here commends, showing that the woman was created for this purpose — that she might be a distinguished ornament of the man. </p>
