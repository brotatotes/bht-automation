<p><b>8.</b><i>For the man is not from the woman.</i> He establishes by <i>two</i> arguments the pre-eminence, which he had assigned to men above women. The <i>first</i> is, that as the woman derives her origin from the man, she is therefore inferior in rank. The <i>second</i> is, that as the woman was created for the sake of the man, she is therefore subject to him, as the work ultimately produced is to its cause. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(627)</sup></span> That the man is the beginning of the woman and the end for which she was made, is evident from the law. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:18">Genesis 2:18</span>.) </p>
<p>It is not good for a man to be alone. Let us make for him, etc. </p>
