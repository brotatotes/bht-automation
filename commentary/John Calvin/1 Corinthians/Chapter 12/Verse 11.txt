<p><b>11.</b><i>One and the same spirit distributing.</i> Hence it follows that those act amiss who, having no concern as to participation, break asunder that holy harmony, that is fitly adjusted in all its parts, only when under the guidance of the same Spirit, all conspire toward one and the same object. He again calls the Corinthians to unity, by reminding them that all have derived from one fountain whatever they possess, while he instructs them, at the same time, that no one has so much as to have enough within himself, so as not to require help from others. For this is what he means by these words —<i>distributing to every one severally as he willeth</i> The Spirit of God, therefore, distributes them among us, in order that we may make all contribute to the common advantage. To no one does he give all, lest any one, satisfied with his particular portion, should separate himself from others, and live solely for himself. The same idea is intended in the adverb <i>severally,</i> as it is of great importance to understand accurately that diversity by which God unites us mutually to one another. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(746)</sup></span> Now, when <i>will</i> is ascribed to the Spirit, and that, too, in connection with power, we may conclude from this, that the Spirit is truly and properly God. </p>
