<p><b>17.</b><i>If the whole body were an eye</i> He sets aside a foolish aiming at equality, by showing the impossibility of it. “If all the members,” says he, “desire the honor that belongs to the <i>eye,</i> the consequence will be, that the whole body will perish; for it is impossible that the body should remain safe and sound, if the members have not different functions, and a mutual correspondence between them. Hence equality interferes with the welfare of the body, because it produces a confusion that entails present ruin. What madness, then, would it be, should one member, instead of giving way to another, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(755)</sup></span> conspire for its own ruin and that of the body!” </p>
