That member, therefore, which will not rest satisfied with its own station, will wage war with God after the manner of the giants. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(756)</sup></span> Let us, therefore, be subject to the arrangement which God has appointed, that we may not, to no purpose, resist his will.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(757)</sup></span> </p>
