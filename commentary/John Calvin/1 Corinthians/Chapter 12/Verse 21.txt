The <i>eye</i> excels the <i>hand,</i> and yet cannot despise it, or insult over it, as though it were useless; and he draws an argument from utility, to show that it ought to be thus — “Those members, that are less esteemed, are the more necessary: hence, with a view to the safety of the body, they must not be despised.” He makes use of the term <i>weaker</i> here, to mean <i>despised,</i> as in another passage, when he says that he <i>glories in his infirmities,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:9">2 Corinthians 12:9</span>,) he expresses, under this term, those things which rendered him contemptible and abject. </p>
