<p>He has in the beginning of the chapter spoken of <i>gifts:</i> now he begins to treat of <i>offices,</i> and this order it is proper that we should carefully observe. For the Lord did not appoint ministers, without first endowing them with the requisite gifts, and qualifying them for discharging their duty. Hence we must infer, that those are fanatics, and actuated by an evil spirit, who intrude themselves into the Church, while destitute of the necessary qualifications, as many boast that they are under the influence of the Spirit, and glory in a secret call from God, while in the meantime they are unlearned and utterly ignorant. The natural order, on the other hand, is this — that gifts come before the office to be discharged. As, then, he has taught above, that everything that an individual has received from God, should be made subservient to the common good, so now he declares that offices are distributed in such a manner, that all may together, by united efforts, edify the Church, and each individual according to his measure. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(767)</sup></span> </p>
<p>28. <i>First, Apostles</i> He does not enumerate all the particular kinds, and there was no need of this, for he merely intended to bring forward some examples. In the fourth Chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>,) there is a fuller enumeration of the offices, that are required for the continued government of the Church. The reason of this I shall assign there, if the Lord shall permit me to advance so far, though even there he does not make mention of them all. As to the passage before us, we must observe, that of the offices which Paul makes mention of, some are perpetual, others temporary. Those that are perpetual, are such as are necessary for the government of the Church; those that are temporary, are such as were appointed at the beginning for the founding of the Church, and the raising up of Christ’s kingdom; and these, in a short time afterwards, ceased. </p>
<p>To the <i>first</i> class belongs the office of <i>Teacher, to</i> the <i>second</i> the <i>office</i> of <i>Apostle;</i> for the Lord created the Apostles, that they might spread the gospel throughout the whole world, and he did not assign to each of them certain limits or parishes, but would have them, wherever they went, to discharge the office of ambassadors among all nations and languages. In this respect there is a difference between them and <i>Pastors,</i> who are, in a manner, tied to their particular churches. For the <i>Pastor</i> has not a commission to preach the gospel over the whole world, but to take care of the Church that has been committed to his charge. In his Epistle to the Ephesians he places <i>Evangelists</i> after the <i>Apostles,</i> but here he passes them over; for from the highest order, he passes immediately to <i>Prophets</i> </p>
<p>By this term he means, (in my opinion,) not those who were endowed with the gift of prophesying, but those who were endowed with a peculiar gift, not merely for interpreting Scripture, but also for applying it wisely for present use. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(768)</sup></span> My reason for thinking so is this, that he prefers prophecy to all other gifts, on the ground of its yielding more edification — a commendation that would not be applicable to the predicting of future events. Farther, when he describes the office of <i>Prophet</i>, or at least treats of what he ought principally to do, he says that he must devote himself to consolation, exhortation, and doctrine. Now these are things that are distinct from prophesyings. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(769)</sup></span> Let us, then, by <i>Prophets</i> in this passage understand, first of all, eminent interpreters of Scripture, and farther, persons who are endowed with no common wisdom and dexterity in taking a right view of the present necessity of the Church, that they may speak suitably to it, and in this way be, in a manner, ambassadors to communicate the divine will. </p>
<p>Between them and <i>Teachers</i> this difference may be pointed out, that the office of <i>Teacher</i> consists in taking care that sound doctrines be maintained and propagated, in order that the purity of religion may be kept up in the Church. At the same time, even this term is taken in different senses, and here perhaps it is used rather in the sense of Pastor, unless you prefer, it may be, to take it in a general way for all that are endowed with the gift of teaching, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>, where also Luke conjoins them with Prophets. My reason for not agreeing with those who make the whole of the office of Prophet consist in the interpretation of Scripture, is this — that Paul restricts the number of those who ought to speak, to two or three; (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:29">1 Corinthians 14:29</span>,) which would not accord with a bare interpretation of Scripture. In fine, my opinion is this — that the Prophets here spoken of are those who make known the will of God, by applying with dexterity and skill prophecies, threatenings, promises, and the whole doctrine of Scripture, to the present use of the Church. If any one is of a different opinion, I have no objection to his being so, and will not raise any quarrel on that account. For it is difficult to form a judgment as to gifts and offices of which the Church has been so long deprived, excepting only that there are some traces, or shadows of them still to be seen. </p>
<p>As to <i>powers</i> and <i>gift of healings</i>, I have spoken when commenting on the 12th Chapter of the Romans. Only it must be observed that here he makes mention, not so much of the gifts themselves, as of the administration of them. As the Apostle is here enumerating offices, I do not approve of what Chrysostom says, that <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀντιλήψεις</span></blu></grk>, that is, <i>helps</i> or <i>aids</i>, consist in supporting the weak. What is it then? Undoubtedly, it is either an office, as well as gift, that was exercised in ancient times, but of which we have at this day no knowledge whatever; or it is connected with the office of Deacon, or in other words, the care of the poor; and this latter idea pleases me better. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(770)</sup></span> In <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:7">Romans 12:7</span>, he makes mention of two kinds of deacons. Of these I have treated when commenting upon that passage. </p>
<p>By <i>Governments</i> I understand Elders, who had the charge of discipline. For the primitive Church had its Senate, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(771)</sup></span> for the purpose of keeping the people in propriety of deportment, as Paul shows elsewhere, when he makes mention of two kinds of Presbyters. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(772)</sup></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17">1 Timothy 5:17</span>.) Hence <i>government</i> consisted of those Presbyters who excelled others in gravity, experience, and authority. </p>
<p>Under <i>different kinds of tongues</i> he comprehends both the knowledge of languages, and the gift of interpretation. They were, however, two distinct gifts; because in some cases an individual spoke in different languages, and yet did not understand the language of the Church with which he had to do. This defect was supplied by interpreters. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(773)</sup></span> </p>

It is remarked by Dr. Dick, (in his <i>Theology</i>, volume iv, p. 390,) that “there are no persons who may be so reasonably supposed to be meant by <i>helps</i>, as <i>deacons</i>; ” who “were instituted for the express purpose of <i>helping</i> the Apostles, for the purpose of relieving them from the care of the poor, that they might devote themselves exclusively to the ministry of the word.” He observes also, (p.389,) that “it does not follow, because <i>some</i> of the offices and ministrations enumerated in this place were miraculous and extraordinary, that they were <i>all</i> of that description.” — <i>Ed</i> </p>
