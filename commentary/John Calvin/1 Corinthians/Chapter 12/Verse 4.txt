<p><b>4.</b><i>Now there are diversities of gifts</i> The symmetry of the Church <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(730)</sup></span> consists, so to speak, of a manifold unity, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(731)</sup></span> that is, when the variety of gifts is directed to the same object, as in music there are different sounds, but suited to each other with such an adaptation, as to produce concord. Hence it is befitting that there should be a distinction of gifts as well as of offices, and yet all harmonize in one. Paul, accordingly, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:6">Romans 12:6</span>, commends this variety, that no one may, by rashly intruding himself into another’s place, confound the distinction which the Lord has established. Hence he orders every one to be contented with his own gifts, and cultivate the particular department that has been assigned to him. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(732)</sup></span> He prohibits them from going beyond their own limits by a foolish ambition. In fine, he exhorts that every one should consider how much has been given him, what measure has been allotted to him, and to what he has been called. Here, on the other hand, he orders every one to bring what he has to the common heap, and not keep back the gifts of God in the way of enjoying every one his own, apart from the others, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(733)</sup></span> but aim unitedly at the edification of all in common. In both passages, he brings forward the similitude of the human body, but, as may be observed, on different accounts. The sum of what he states amounts to this — that gifts are not distributed thus variously among believers, in order that they may be used apart, but that in the division there is a unity, inasmuch as one Spirit is the source of all those gifts, one God is the Lord of all administrations, and the author of all exercises of power. Now God, who is the beginning, ought also to be the end. </p>
<p><i>One Spirit</i> This passage ought to be carefully observed in opposition to fanatics, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(734)</sup></span> who think that the name Spirit means nothing essential, but merely the gifts or actions of divine power. Here, however, Paul plainly testifies, that there is <i>one</i> essential power of God, whence all his works proceed. The term Spirit, it is true, is sometimes transferred by metonymy to the gifts themselves. Hence we read of the Spirit of knowledge — of judgment — of fortitude — of modesty. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(735)</sup></span> Paul, however, here plainly testifies that judgment, and knowledge, and gentleness, and all other gifts, proceed from <i>one</i> source. For it is the office of the Holy Spirit to put forth and exercise the power of God by conferring these gifts upon men, and distributing them among them. </p>
<p><i>One Lord.</i> The ancients made use of this testimony in opposition to the Arians, for the purpose of maintaining a Trinity of persons. For there is mention made here of <i>the Spirit,</i> secondly of <i>the Lord,</i> and lastly of <i>God</i>, and to these Three, one and the same operation is ascribed. Thus, by the name <i>Lord,</i> they understood Christ. But for my part, though I have no objection to its being understood in this way, I perceive, at the same time, that it is a weak argument for stopping the mouths of Arians; for there is a correspondence between the word <i>administrations</i> and the word <i>Lord. The administrations,</i> says Paul, <i>are different,</i> but there is only one God whom we must serve, whatever <i>administration</i> we discharge. This antithesis, then, shows what is the simple meaning, so that to confine it to Christ is rather forced. </p>
