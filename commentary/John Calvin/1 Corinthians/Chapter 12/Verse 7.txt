Hence we must inquire as to the purpose for which they are conferred. As to this Paul answers — (with a view to utility) — πρὸς τὸ συμφερον; that is, that the Church may receive advantage thereby. The manifestation of the Spirit may be taken in a passive as well as in an active sense — in a passive sense, because wherever there is prophecy, or knowledge, or any other gift, the Spirit of God does there manifest himself — in an active sense, because the Spirit of God, when he enriches us with any gift, unlocks his treasures, for the purpose of manifesting to us those things that would otherwise have been concealed and shut up. The second interpretation suits better. The view taken by Chrysostom is rather harsh and forced — that this term is used, (736) because unbelievers do not recognize God, except by visible miracles. (736) “Que ceci est appele Manifestation :” — “That this is termed a Manifestation. ”
