<p><b>2.</b><i>And if I should have the gift of prophecy.</i> He brings down to nothing the dignity of even this endowment, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(777)</sup></span> which, nevertheless, he had preferred to all others. <i>To know all mysteries,</i> might seem to be added to the term <i>prophecy,</i> by way of explanation, but as the term <i>knowledge</i> is immediately added, of which he had previously made mention by itself, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8">1 Corinthians 12:8</span>,) it will deserve your consideration, whether the <i>knowledge of mysteries</i> may not be used here to mean <i>wisdom.</i> As for myself, while I would not venture to affirm that it is so, I am much inclined to that opinion. </p>
<p>That <i>faith,</i> of which he speaks, is special, as is evident from the clause that is immediately added — so <i>that I remove mountains</i> Hence the Sophists accomplish nothing, when they pervert this passage for the purpose of detracting from the excellence of faith. As, therefore, the term <i>faith</i> is <i>(</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πολύσημον</span></blu></grk> <i>) used in a variety of senses,</i> it is the part of the prudent reader to observe in what signification it is taken. Paul, however, as I have already stated, is his own interpreter, by restricting <i>faith,</i> here, to miracles. It is what Chrysostom calls the <i>“faith</i> of miracles,” and what we term a “special faith,” because it does not apprehend a whole Christ, but simply his power in working miracles; and hence it may sometimes exist in a man without the Spirit of sanctification, as it did in Judas. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(778)</sup></span> </p>
