<p><b>3.</b><i>And if I should expend all my possessions.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(779)</sup></span> This, it is true, is worthy of the highest praise, if considered in itself; but as liberality in many cases proceeds from ambition — not from true generosity, or even the man that is liberal is destitute of the other departments of love, (for even liberality, that is inwardly felt, is only one department of <i>love,)</i> it may happen that a work, otherwise so commendable, has, indeed, a fair show in the sight of men, and is applauded by them, and yet is regarded as nothing in the sight of God. </p>
<p><i>And if I should give up my body.</i> He speaks, undoubtedly, of martyrdom, which is an act that is the most lovely and excellent of all; for what is more admirable than that invincible fortitude of mind, which makes a man not hesitate to pour out his life for the testimony of the gospel? Yet even this, too, God regards as nothing, if the mind is destitute of <i>love.</i> The kind of punishment that he makes mention of was not then so common among Christians; for we read that tyrants, at that time, set themselves to destroy the Church, rather by swords than by flames, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(780)</sup></span> except that Nero, in his rage, had recourse, also, to burning. The Spirit appears, however, to have predicted here, by Paul’s mouth, the persecutions that were coming. But this is a digression. The main truth in the passage is this — that as <i>love</i> is the only rule of our actions, and the only means of regulating the right use of the gifts of God, nothing, in the absence of it, is approved of by God, however magnificent it may be in the estimation of men. For where it is wanting, the beauty of all virtues is mere tinsel — is empty sound — is not worth a straw — nay more, is offensive and disgusting. As for the inference which Papists draw from this — that <i>love</i> is therefore of more avail for our justification than faith, we shall refute it afterwards. At present, we must proceed to notice what follows, </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(779)</span> "<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Et si ie distribue tous mes biens</span></blu>;” — “And if I should distribute all my goods.” </p>
