<p><b>4.</b><i>Love is patient.</i> He now commends <i>love</i> from its effects or fruits, though at the same time these eulogiums are not intended merely for its commendation, but to make the Corinthians understand what are its offices, and what is its nature. The object, however, mainly in view, is to show how <i>necessary</i> it is for preserving the unity of the Church. I have also no doubt that he designed indirectly to reprove the Corinthians, by setting before them a contrast, in which they might recognize, by way of contraries, their own vices. </p>
<p>The <i>first</i> commendation of love is this — that, by patient endurance of many things, it promotes peace and harmony in the Church. Near akin to this is the <i>second</i> excellence — gentleness and lenity, for such is the meaning of the verb <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χρηστεύεσθαι</span></blu></grk> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(781)</sup></span> <i>A third</i> excellence is — that it counteracts <i>emulation,</i> the seed of all contentions. Under <i>emulation</i> he comprehends envy, which is a vice near akin to it, or rather, he means that emulation, which is connected with envy, and frequently springs from it. Hence where envy reigns — where every one is desirous to be the first, or appear so, love <i>there</i> has no place. </p>
<p>What I have rendered —<i>does not act insolently</i> — is in the Greek <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χρηστεύεσθαι</span></blu></grk> Erasmus has rendered it, <i>is not froward.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(782)</sup></span> It is certain that the word has different significations; but, as it is sometimes taken to <i>mean</i> — <i>being fierce, or insolent, through presumption,</i> this meaning seemed to be more suitable to the passage before us. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(783)</sup></span> Paul, therefore, ascribes to <i>love</i> moderation, and declares that it is a bridle to restrain men, that they may not break forth into ferocity, but may live together in a peaceable and orderly manner. He adds, farther, that it has nothing of the nature of pride. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(784)</sup></span> That man, then, who is governed by <i>love, is not puffed up</i> with pride, so as to despise others and feel satisfied with himself. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(785)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(781)</span> The distinction between the. <i>first</i> and <i>second</i> of the commendations here bestowed upon <i>love</i> is stated by <i>Bloomfield</i> as follows: <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Μακροθυμεῖ</span></blu></grk>, “denotes <i>lenity</i>, as opposed to passion and revenge: and <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χρηστεύεται</span></blu></grk>, <i>gentleness</i>, as opposed to severity and misanthropy.” — <i>Ed</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(782)</span> This rendering is followed in two of the old English translations, viz. Tyndale (1534) and Cranmer (1539.) “Love doth not frowardly.” — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(783)</span> Interpreters are by no means agreed as to the precise import of the original term <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">περπερεύεται</span></blu></grk>. Most ancient and many modern commentators explain it as meaning — “to act precipitately and rashly” — and in accordance with this, is the rendering given by our Translators in the <i>Margin</i> — <i>is not rash</i> No <i>single</i> expression, however, appears to bring out more satisfactorily the import of the original word than that which our Translators have inserted in the <i>text</i> — <i>vaunteth not</i> itself. <i>Beausobre</i> makes use of <i>two</i> epithets. “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">N’est point</span></blu> <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">vaine</span></i></blu> <blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">et</span></blu> <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">insolerite</span></i></blu> ;” — “Is not <i>vain</i> and <i>insolent</i>. ” — <i>Ed</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(784)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">I1 dit consequemment que charite</span></blu> <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">ne s’enfle point</span></i></blu> ;” — “He says consequently, that love <i>is not puffed up</i>. ” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(785)</span> <i>Bloomfield</i> considers the distinction between this clause and the preceding one to be this, that the former “refers to <i>pride as shown in words</i>, and the latter to “the <i>carriage</i> and <i>bearing</i>, to denote pride and haughtiness on account of certain external advantages. A similar view is taken by <i>Barnes</i>, who considers the <i>former</i> clause as referring to “the <i>expression</i> of the feelings of pride, vanity,” etc.; and the <i>latter</i>, to “the feeling itself.” — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
