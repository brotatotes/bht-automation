<p><b>5.</b><i>Doth not behave itself unseemly</i> Erasmus renders it <i>“Is not disdainful;”</i> but as he quotes no author in support of this interpretation, I have preferred to retain its proper and usual signification. I explain it, however, in this way — that <i>love</i> does not exult in a foolish ostentation, or does not bluster, but observes moderation and propriety. And in this manner, he again reproves the Corinthians indirectly, because they shamefully set at naught all propriety by an unseemly haughtiness. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(786)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>Seeketh not its own.</i> From this we may infer, how very far we are from having <i>love</i> implanted in us by nature; for we are naturally prone to have love and care for ourselves, and aim at our own advantage. Nay, to speak more correctly, we rush headlong into it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(787)</sup></span> For so perverse an inclination the remedy <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(788)</sup></span> is <i>love,</i> which leads us to leave off caring for ourselves, and feel concerned for our neighbors, so as to love them and be concerned for their welfare. Farther, <i>to seek one’s own things,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(789)</sup></span> is to be devoted to self, and to be wholly taken up with concern for one’s own advantage. This definition solves the question, whether it is lawful for a Christian to be concerned for his own advantage? for Paul does not here reprove every kind of care or concern for ourselves, but the excess of it, which proceeds from an immoderate and blind attachment to ourselves. Now the excess lies in this — if we think of ourselves so as to neglect others, or if the desire of our own advantage calls us off from that concern, which God commands us to have as to our neighbors. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(790)</sup></span> He adds, that <i>love</i> is also a bridle to repress quarrels, and this follows from the first two statements. For where there is gentleness and forbearance, persons in that case do not, on a sudden, become angry, and are not easily stirred up to disputes and contests. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(791)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(786)</span> The proper meaning of the verb <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ασχήμονειν</span></blu></grk>, is to <i>offend against decorum</i> See Eurip. Hec 407. — <i>Ed</i> </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(790)</span> <i>Granville Penn</i> translates the clause as follows: “Seeketh not <i>what is not its own</i>, ” — in accordance with the reading of the Vat.

He supposes the <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">μὢ</span></blu></grk> (<i>not</i>) to have “lapsed, or been erroneously rejected from all the later copies.” — <i>Ed</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(791)</span> The last clause of the verse, which is in our translation, <i>thinketh no evil</i>, is rendered by Bishop Pearce, “<i>meditateth no mischief</i> ” — a sense in which the expression (p.424) <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">λογιζεσθαι κακον</span></blu></grk> occurs in the Septuagint, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+35:4">Psalms 35:4</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+41:7">Psalms 41:7</span>. It is beautifully rendered by <i>Bloomfield</i>, “does not enter it into a note-book, for future revenge. — <i>Ed</i> </p>
