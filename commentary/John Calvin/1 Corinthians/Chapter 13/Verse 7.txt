<p><b>7.</b><i>Beareth all things,</i> etc. By all these statements he intimates, that love is neither impatient nor spiteful. For to <i>bear</i> and <i>endure all things</i> is the part of forbearance to <i>believe</i> and <i>hope all things</i> is the part of candor and kindness. As we are naturally too much devoted to self, this vice renders us morose and peevish. The effect is, that every one wishes that others should carry him upon their shoulders, but refuses for his part to assist others. The remedy for this disease is <i>love,</i> which makes us subject to our brethren, and teaches us to apply our shoulders to <i>their burdens.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:2">Galatians 6:2</span>.) Farther, as we are naturally <i>spiteful,</i> we are, consequently, suspicious too, and take almost everything amiss. <i>Love,</i> on the other hand, calls us back to <i>kindness,</i> so that we think favorably and candidly of our neighbors. </p>
<p><i>When</i> he says <i>all things,</i> you must understand him as referring to the things that <i>ought to be endured,</i> and in such a manner as is befitting. For we are not to bear with vices, so as to give our sanction to them by flattery, or, by winking at them, encourage them through our supineness. Farther, this <i>endurance</i> does not exclude <i>corrections</i> and just punishments. The case is the same as to kindness in judging of things. </p>
<p>Love <i>believeth all things</i> — <i>not</i> that the Christian knowingly and willingly allows himself to be imposed upon — not that he divests himself of prudence and judgment, that he may be the more easily taken advantage of — not that he unlearns the way of distinguishing black from white. What then? He requires here, as I have already said, <i>simplicity</i> and <i>kindness</i> in judging of things; and he declares that these <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(792)</sup></span> are the invariable accompaniments of <i>love.</i> The consequence will be, that a Christian man will reckon it better to be imposed upon by his own kindness and easy temper, than to wrong his brother by an unfriendly suspicion. </p>
