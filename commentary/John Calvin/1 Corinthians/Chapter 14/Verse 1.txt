<p>As he had previously exhorted them to <i>follow after the more excellent gifts,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span>,) so he exhorts them now to <i>follow after love,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(806)</sup></span> for that was the distinguished excellence, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(807)</sup></span> which he had promised that he would show them. They will, therefore, regulate themselves with propriety in the use of gifts, if <i>love</i> prevails among them. For he tacitly reproves the want of <i>love,</i> as appearing in this — that they had hitherto abused their gifts, and, inferring from what goes before, that where they do not assign to <i>love</i> the chief place, they do not take the right road to the attainment of true excellence, he shows them how foolish their ambition is, which frustrates their hopes and desires. </p>
<p>1. <i>Covet spiritual gifts.</i> Lest the Corinthians should object that they wronged God, if they despised his gifts, the Apostle anticipates this objection by declaring, that it was not his design to draw them away even from those gifts that they had abused — nay rather he commends the pursuit of them, and wishes them to have a place in the Church. And assuredly, as they had been conferred for the advantage of the Church, man’s abuse of them ought not to give occasion for their being thrown away as useless or injurious, but in the meantime he commends <i>prophecy</i> above all other gifts, as it was the most useful of them all. He observes, therefore, an admirable medium, by disapproving of nothing that was useful, while at the same time he exhorts them not to prefer, by an absurd zeal, things of less consequence to what was of primary importance. Now he assigns the first place to <i>prophecy. Covet,</i> therefore, <i>spiritual gifts</i> —<i>that</i> is, “Neglect no gift, for I exhort you to seek after them all, provided only <i>prophecy</i> holds the first place.” </p>
