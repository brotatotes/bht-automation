<p><b>11.</b><i>I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(822)</sup></span> The tongue ought to be an index of the mind — not merely in the sense of the proverb, but in the sense that is explained by Aristotle in the commencement of his book — “On Interpretation.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(823)</sup></span> How foolish then it is and preposterous in a man, to utter in an assembly a voice of which the hearer understands nothing — in which he perceives no token from which he may learn what the person means! It is not without good reason, therefore, that Paul views it as the height of absurdity, that a man should be a <i>barbarian</i> to the hearers, by chattering in an unknown tongue, and at the same time he elegantly treats with derision the foolish ambition of the Corinthians, who were eager to obtain praise and fame by this means. “This reward,” says he, “you will earn — that you will be a <i>barbarian.”</i> For the term <i>barbarian,</i> whether it be an artificial one, (as Strabo thinks, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(824)</sup></span>) or derived from some other origin, is taken in a bad sense. Hence the Greeks, who looked upon themselves as the only persons who were good speakers, and had a polished language, gave to all others the name of <i>barbarians,</i> from their rude and rustic dialect. No language, however, is so cultivated as not to be reckoned barbarous, when it is not understood. “<i>He that heareth,”</i> says Paul, “<i>will</i> be unto me a <i>barbarian,</i> and I will be so to him in return.” By these words he intimates, that to speak in an unknown tongue, is not to hold fellowship with the Church, but rather to keep aloof from it, and that he who will act this part, will be deservedly despised by others, because <i>he</i> first despises <i>them.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(822)</span> “The Greeks, after the custom of the Egyptians, mentioned by; Herodotus, (lib. 2,) called all those <i>barbarians</i> who did not speak their language. In process of time, however, the Romans having subdued the Greeks, delivered themselves by the force of arms from that opprobrious appellation; and joined the Greeks in calling all barbarians who did not speak either the Greek or the Latin language. Afterwards, <i>barbarian</i> signified any one who spoke a language which another did not understand. Thus the Scythian philosopher, Anacharsis, said, that among the Athenians the Scythians were <i>barbarians</i>; and among the Scythians the Athenians were <i>barbarians</i>. In like manner Ovid. Trist. 5. 10, ‘<blu><i>Barbarus</i></blu> <blu>hic ego sum, quia</blu> <blu><i>non intelligor</i></blu> <blu>ulli</blu>;’ — ‘I am a <i>barbarian</i> here, because <i>I am not understood</i> by any one.’ This is the sense which the Apostle affixes to the word <i>barbarian</i>, in the present passage. <i>McKnight</i>. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(824)</span> He considers the term <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">βάρβαρος</span></blu></grk>, (barbarian,) to be a term constructed in imitation of the sense — to convey the idea of one that speaks with difficulty and harshness. See <i>Strabo</i>, Book 14. <i>Bloomfield</i> considers the term <i>barbarian</i> to be derived — “not” as some think, “from the Arabic <i>berber</i>, to murmur, but from the Punic <i>berber</i>, <i>a shepherd</i> — having been originally appropriated to the indigenous and pastoral inhabitants of Africa; who, to their more civilized fellow-men on the other side of the Mediterranean, appeared <i>rustics</i> and barbarians. Hence the term <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">βάρβαρος</span></blu></grk> came at length to mean a <i>rustic</i> or <i>clown</i>. ” — <i>Ed</i> </p>
