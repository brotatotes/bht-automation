<p><b>13.</b><i>Wherefore let him that speaketh in another tongue</i> This is an anticipation, by way of reply to a question which might very readily be proposed to him. <i>“If</i> any one, therefore, is able to speak a foreign language, will the gift be useless? Why should that be kept back, which might be brought out to light, to the glory of God?” He shows the remedy. <i>“Let</i> him,” says he, <i>“ask</i> from God the gift of interpretation also. If he is without this, let him abstain in the meantime from ostentation.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(826)</sup></span> </p>
