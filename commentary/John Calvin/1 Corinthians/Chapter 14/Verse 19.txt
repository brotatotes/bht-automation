<p><b>19.</b><i>I would rather speak five words.</i> This is spoken <i>hyperbolically,</i> unless you understand <i>five words,</i> as meaning <i>five sentences.</i> Now as Paul, who might otherwise have exulted loftily in his power of speaking with tongues, voluntarily abstains from it, and, without any show, aims at <i>edification</i> exclusively, he reproves, by this means, the empty ambition of those, that are eagerly desirous to show themselves off with empty <i>tinkling.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:1">1 Corinthians 13:1</span>.) The authority of the Apostle ought, also, to have no little weight in drawing them off from vanity of this kind. </p>
