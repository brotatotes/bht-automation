<p><b>22.</b><i>Therefore tongues are for a sign</i> This passage may be explained in two ways, by considering the word <i>therefore</i> as referring merely to the preceding sentence, or as having a bearing generally on the whole of the foregoing discussion. If it is a particular inference, the meaning will be — <i>“</i> You see, brethren, that what you so eagerly desire is not a blessing bestowed by God upon believers, but a punishment, by which he inflicts vengeance upon unbelievers.” In this way, Paul would not be viewed as taking in the use of tongues under all circumstances, but simply as touching upon what had in <i>one</i> instance occurred. Should any one, however, prefer to extend it to the whole discussion, I have no objection, though I do not dislike the former interpretation. </p>
<p>Taking it in a general way, the meaning will be <i>“Tongues,</i> in so far as they are given <i>for a sign</i> — that is, for a miracle — are appointed not properly for <i>believers,</i> but for <i>unbelievers.”</i> The advantages derived from <i>tongues</i> were various. They provided against necessity — that diversity of <i>tongues</i> might not prevent the Apostles from disseminating the gospel over the whole world: there was, consequently, no nation with which they could not hold fellowship. They served also to move or terrify <i>unbelievers</i> by the sight of a miracle — for the design of this miracle, equally with others, was to prepare those who were as yet at a distance from Christ for rendering obedience to him. Believers, who had already devoted themselves to his doctrine, did not stand so much in need of such preparation. Hence, the Corinthians brought forward that gift improperly and out of its right place, allowing prophecy in the meantime to be neglected, which was peculiarly and specially set apart for <i>believers,</i> and ought, therefore, to be familiar to them, for in <i>tongues</i> they looked to nothing farther than the miracle. </p>
