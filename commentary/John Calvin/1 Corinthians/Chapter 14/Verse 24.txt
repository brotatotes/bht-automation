<p><b>24.</b><i>But if all prophesy</i> As he had previously showed them, how much more advantageous prophecy is to <i>those that are of the household of faith</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:10">Galatians 6:10</span>) than the gift of tongues, so he now shows that it would be useful also to <i>those that are without.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:13">1 Corinthians 5:13</span>.) This is a most powerful consideration for showing the Corinthians their error. For what a base part it is to depreciate a gift that is most useful both within and without, and to be wholly taken up with another gift which is useless to those that are <i>within</i> the house; and, in addition to this, gives occasion of offense to those that are <i>without.</i> He sets before them this advantage of prophecy, that it summons the <i>consciences</i> of the wicked to the tribunal of God, and strikes them with a lively apprehension of divine judgment in such a manner, that he who before in utter regardlessness despised sound doctrine, is constrained to give glory to God. </p>
<p><i>We</i> shall find it, however, much easier to understand this passage, if we compare it with another that occurs in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:12">Hebrews 4:12</span>.) </p>
<p>The Word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword; piercing to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow — a discerner of the thoughts of the heart. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(851)</sup></span> </p>
<p>For in both passages, it is the same kind of efficacy of the Word of God that is spoken of: only in that other passage it is spoken of more fully and distinctly. So far as the passage before us is concerned, it is not difficult to understand now, what is meant by being <i>convinced</i> and <i>judged.</i> The consciences of men are in a torpid state, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(852)</sup></span> and are not touched with any feeling of dissatisfaction on account of their sins, so long as they are enveloped in the darkness of ignorance. In short, unbelief is like a lethargy that takes away feeling. But the Word of God penetrates even to the farthest recesses of the mind, and by introducing, as it were, a light, dispels darkness, and drives away that deadly torpor. Thus, then, unbelievers are <i>convinced,</i> inasmuch as they are seriously affected and alarmed, on coming to know that they have to do with God; and, in like manner, they are <i>judged</i> in this respect, that whereas they were previously involved in darkness, and did not perceive their own wretchedness and baseness, they are now brought into the light of day, and are constrained to bear witness against themselves. </p>
<p>When he says, that they are judged and convinced <i>by all,</i> you must understand him as meaning <i>all that prophesy;</i> for he had said a little before, <i>If ye all prophesy,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:24">1 Corinthians 14:24</span>.) He has expressly made use of a general term, with the view of removing the dislike that they felt for prophecy. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(853)</sup></span> The unbeliever, I say, is <i>convinced</i> — <i>not</i> as if the Prophet pronounced a judgment upon him either silently in the mind, or openly with the mouth, but because the conscience of the hearer apprehends from the doctrine his own judgment. He is <i>judged,</i> inasmuch as he descends into himself, and, after thorough examination, comes to know himself, while previously he was unmindful of himself. To the same purpose, too, is that saying of Christ: </p>
<p>The Spirit, when he is come, will convince the world of sin, <br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:8">John 16:8</span>;) </br></p>
<p>and this is what he immediately adds — that <i>the secrets of his heart are made manifest</i> For he does not mean, in my opinion, that it becomes manifest to others what sort of person he is, but rather that his own conscience is aroused, so that he perceives his sins, which previously lay hid from his view. </p>
<p>Here again Chrysostom asks, how it comes to pass that prophecy is so effectual for arousing <i>unbelievers,</i> while Paul had said a little before that it was not given to them. He answers, that it was not given to them as a useless sign, but for the purpose of instructing them. For my part, however, I think that it will be simpler, and therefore more suitable, to say that it was not given to unbelievers, who perish, whose hearts </p>
<p>Satan has blinded, that they may not see the light which shines forth from it. <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:3">2 Corinthians 4:3</span>.) </p>
<p>It will also suit better to connect this statement with the prophecy <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(854)</sup></span> of Isaiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:11">Isaiah 28:11</span>,) because the Prophet speaks of unbelievers, among whom prophecy is of no profit or advantage. </p>
