<p><b>26.</b><i>What is it then?</i> He now shows the way in which they may remedy those evils. In the first place, each gift must have its place, but in order and in measure. Farther, the Church must not be taken up to no purpose with unprofitable exercises, but must, in whatever is done, have an eye to edification. He speaks, however, in the first place of edification in this way: “Let every one, according as he has been endowed with some particular gift, make it his aim to lay it out for the advantage of all.” For it is in this way that we must understand the word rendered <i>every one</i> — <i>that</i> no one may take it as implying universality, as though all to a man were endowed with some such gift. </p>
