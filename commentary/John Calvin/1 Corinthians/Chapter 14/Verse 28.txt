<p><b>28.</b><i>Let him speak to himself and to God</i> “Let him enjoy,” says he, “his gift in his own conscience, and let him give thanks to God.” For in this way I explain the expression to <i>speak to himself and to God,</i> as meaning — to recognize in his own mind with thanksgiving the favor conferred upon him, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(860)</sup></span> and to enjoy it as his own, when there is not an opportunity for bringing it forward in a public manner. For he draws a contrast between this <i>secret</i> way of speaking, and speaking <i>publicly</i> in the Church — which he forbids. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(861)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(860)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Le benefice et don de Dieu</span></blu>;” — “The kindness and gift of God.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(861)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">En ce cas</span></blu>;” — “In this case.” </p>
