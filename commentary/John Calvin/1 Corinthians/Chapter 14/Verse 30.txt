<p><b>30.</b><i>But if anything be revealed to another</i>. Here is another advantage — that whenever there will be occasion, the way will also be open to them. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(866)</sup></span> Hence they have no longer any occasion to complain, that the Spirit is bound, or that his mouth is shut. For all have opportunity and liberty allowed them of speaking, when there is occasion for it, provided only no one unseasonably intrudes — having it in view to please himself, rather than to serve some useful purpose. Now he requires this modesty on the part of all — that every one in his place shall give way to another that has something better to bring forward. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(867)</sup></span> For this only is the true liberty of the Spirit — not that every one be allowed to blab out rashly whatever he pleases, but that all, from the highest to the lowest, voluntarily allow themselves to be under control, and that the one Spirit be listened to, by whatever mouth he speaks. As to the certainty of the revelation, we shall see ere long. </p>

Examples among the Talmudists are infinite.
