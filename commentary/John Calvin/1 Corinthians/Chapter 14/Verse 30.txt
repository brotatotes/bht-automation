30.But if anything be revealed to another. Here is another advantage — that whenever there will be occasion, the way will also be open to them. (866) Hence they have no longer any occasion to complain, that the Spirit is bound, or that his mouth is shut. For all have opportunity and liberty allowed them of speaking, when there is occasion for it, provided only no one unseasonably intrudes — having it in view to please himself, rather than to serve some useful purpose. Now he requires this modesty on the part of all — that every one in his place shall give way to another that has something better to bring forward.

As to the certainty of the revelation, we shall see ere long. (866) “Que toutes fois et quantes qu’il sera besoin, eux aussi auront lieu de parler;” — “That as often, and in as far as there will be occasion, they will also have opportunity of speaking.” (867) “But if anything be revealed to another that sitteth by That is very frequently said of the Jewish doctors, היה יושכ He sat — which means not barely he was sitting, but he taught out of the seat of the teacher, or he sat teaching, or ready to teach So that, indeed, he sat and he taught are all one.
