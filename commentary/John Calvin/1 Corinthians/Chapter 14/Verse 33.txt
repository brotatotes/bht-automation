<p><b>33.</b><i>For God is not of confusion.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(873)</sup></span> We must understand the word Author, or some term of that kind. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(874)</sup></span> Here we have a most valuable statement, by which we are taught, that we do not serve God unless in the event of our being lovers of <i>peace,</i> and eager to promote it. Whenever, therefore, there is a disposition to quarrel, <i>there,</i> it is certain, God does not reign. And how easy it is to say this! How very <i>generally</i> all have it in their mouths! Yet, in the meantime, the most of persons fly into a rage about nothing, or <i>they</i> trouble the Church, from a desire that <i>they</i> may, by some means, rise into view, and may <i>seem to be somewhat.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:6">Galatians 2:6</span>.) </p>
<p>Let us, therefore, bear in mind, that, in judging as to the servants of Christ, this mark must be kept in view — whether or not they aim at <i>peace</i> and concord, and, by conducting themselves peaceably, avoid contentions to the utmost of their power, provided, however, we understand by this a <i>peace</i> of which the truth of God is the bond. For if we are called to contend against wicked doctrines, even though heaven and earth should come together, we must, nevertheless, persevere in the contest. We must, indeed, in the first place, make it our aim, that the truth of God may, without contention, maintain its ground; but if the wicked resist, we must set our face against them, and have no fear, lest the blame of the disturbances should be laid to our charge. For accursed is that <i>peace</i> of which revolt from God is the bond, and blessed are those contentions by which it is <i>neces</i> sary to maintain the kingdom of Christ. </p>
<p><i>As in all the Churches.</i> The comparison <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(875)</sup></span> does not refer merely to what was said immediately before, but to the whole of the foregoing representation. “I have hitherto enjoined upon you nothing that is not observed in <i>all the Churches,</i> and, in this manner, they are maintained in <i>peace. Let</i> it be your care, therefore, to borrow, what other Churches have found by experience to be salutary, and most profitable for maintaining <i>peace.”</i> His explicit mention of the term <i>saints</i> is emphatic — as if with the view of exempting rightly constituted Churches from a mark of disgrace. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(876)</sup></span> </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(874)</span> <i>Granville Penn</i> reads the verse as follows: <i>For they are not spirits of disorder</i>, <i>but of peace</i> He thinks it probable, that “the <i>singular</i>, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐστι</span></blu></grk>, has caused a vitiation of this passage, by suggesting the introduction of a <i>singular</i> nominative to agree with it, namely <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὁ Θεος</span></blu></grk>, God;’ whereas in the reading of Tertullian, as early as the second or third century, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐστι</span></blu></grk> referred to the neuter plural, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πνεύματα</span></blu></grk> : ‘<blu>Et spiritus prophetarum prophetis subditi sunt — non enim eversionis</blu> <blu><i>sunt</i></blu><blu>, sed pacis</blu>.’ (And the spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets — for <i>they are</i> not of disorder but of peace.) The Greek, therefore, stood thus: <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">οὐ γάρ ἐστιν ἀκαταστασίας</span></blu></grk> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πνεύματα</span></blu></grk>), <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">αλλ εἰρήνης</span></blu></grk>. This early external testimony, combined with the internal testimony of the context, is sufficient evidence, that <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Θεὸς</span></blu></grk> has been unskilfully inserted by philoponists here, as <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Θεὸς</span></blu></grk>, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Κύριος</span></blu></grk>, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Χριστός</span></blu></grk>, have been intruded into many other passages of the Sacred Text.” — <i>Ed</i> </p>
