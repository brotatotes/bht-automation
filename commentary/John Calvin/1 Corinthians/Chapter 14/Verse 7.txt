<p><b>7.</b><i>Nay even things without life.</i> He brings forward similitudes, first from musical instruments, and then afterwards from the nature of things generally, there being no voice that has not some peculiarity, suitable for distinction. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(815)</sup></span> <i>“Even things without life,”</i> says he, <i>“instruct</i> us.” There are, it is true, many random sounds or crashes, without any modulation, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(816)</sup></span> but Paul speaks here of voices in which there is something of art, as though he had said — “A man cannot give life to a harp or flute, but he makes it give forth a sound that is regulated in such a manner, that it can be distinguished. How absurd then it is, that even men, endowed with intelligence, should utter a confused, indistinguishable sound!” </p>
<p>We must not, however, enter here upon any minute discussion as to musical harmonies, inasmuch as Paul has merely taken what is commonly understood; as, for example, the sound of the trumpet, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(817)</sup></span> of which he speaks shortly afterwards; for it is so much calculated to raise the spirits, that it rouses up — not only men, but even horses. Hence it is related in historical records, that the Lacedemonians, when joining battle, preferred the use of the flute, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(818)</sup></span> lest the army should, at the first charge, rush forward upon the enemy with too keen an onset. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(819)</sup></span> In fine, we all know by experience what power music has in exciting men’s feelings, so that Plato affirms, and not without good reason, that music has very much effect in influencing, in one way or another, the manners of a state. To speak into the air is to beat the air (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:26">1 Corinthians 9:26</span>) to no purpose. “Thy voice will not reach either God or man, but will vanish into air.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(815)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">C’est a dire, pour signifier quelque chose</span></blu>;” — “That is to say, for signifying something.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(816)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Sans mesure ou distinction</span></blu>;” — “Without measure or distinction.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(817)</span> “It is well known that trumpets were exclusively employed in almost all ancient armies, for the purpose of directing the movements of the soldiers, and of informing them what they were to do — as when to attack, advance, or retreat. This was the custom in even the most early Jewish armies, as the Law directed two silver trumpets to be made for the purpose. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="nu+10:1">Numbers 10:1</span>.) Of course, a distinction of tones was necessary, to express the various intimations which were in this manner conveyed; and if the trumpeter did not give the proper intonation, the soldiers could not tell how to act, or were in danger, from misconception, of acting wrongly.” <i>Illustrated Commentary</i>. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(818)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Ils vsoyent plustost de fluste, que de trompette</span></blu>;” — “They used the flute, rather than the trumpet.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(819)</span> The use of the flute on such occasions by the Lacedemonians, is supposed by Valerius Maximus to have “been intended to raise the courage of the soldiers, that they might begin the onset with greater violence and fury;” but the reason stated by Calvin accords with the account given of it by Thucydides (with whom the rest of the ancient historians agree) — that it was designed to “render them cool and sedate — trumpets and other instruments being more proper to inspire with heat and rage;” which passions they thought were “fitted rather to beget disorder and confusion, than to produce any noble and memorable actions — valor not being the effect of a sudden and vanishing transport, but proceeding from a settled and habitual firmness and constancy of mind.” Potter’s Gr. Ant. volume 2. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
