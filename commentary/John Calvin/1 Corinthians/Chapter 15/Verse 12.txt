<p><b>12.</b><i>But of Christ.</i> He now begins to prove the resurrection of all of us from that of Christ. For a mutual and reciprocal inference holds good on the one side and on the other, both affirmatively and negatively — from Christ to us in this way: <i>If Christ is risen, then we will rise</i> —<i>If Christ is not risen, then we will not rise</i> — from us to Christ on the other hand: <i>If we rise, then Christ is risen</i> — <i>If we do not rise, then neither is Christ risen.</i> The ground-work of the argument to be drawn from Christ to us in the former inference is this: “Christ did not die, or rise again for himself, but for us: hence his resurrection is the foundation. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(32)</sup></span> of ours, and what was accomplished in him, must be fulfilled in us also.” In the negative form, on the other hand, it is thus: “Otherwise he would have risen again needlessly and to no purpose, because the fruit of it is to be sought, not in his own person, but in his members.” </p>
<p>Observe the ground-work, on the other hand, of the former <i>inference</i> to be deduced from us to him; for the resurrection is not from nature, and comes from no other quarter than from Christ alone. For in Adam we die, and we recover life only in Christ; <i>hence</i> it follows that his <i>resurrection</i> is the foundation of ours, so that if <i>that</i> is taken away, it cannot stand <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(33)</sup></span> The ground-work of the negative <i>inference</i> has been already stated; for as he could not have risen again but on our account, his resurrection would be null and void, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(34)</sup></span> if it were of no advantage to us. </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(34)</span> Billroth, when quoting the above statement of Calvin, remarks, that “Calvin seems to have deceived himself with the double meaning of the words which he uses — ’<blu>nulla ejus resurrectio foret</blu>;’ — these may mean either ‘<blu>ejus resurrectio non est</blu>,’ or ‘<blu>ejus resurrectio non est vera resurrectio</blu>,’ <i>his resurrection is no real ressurection,</i> and indeed only the latter suits his view of Paul’s argument.” It is justly observed, however, by Dr. Alexander, in his translation of Billroth, that Calvin may be considered to have “used the word <blu><i>nulla</i></blu> here in the sense of our <i>null, void, useless,”</i> his assertion being to this effect — that “if we rise not, then Christ’s resurrection becomes <i>null.”</i> See Biblical Cabinet, volume 23 — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
