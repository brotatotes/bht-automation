<p><b>15.</b><i>We are also found to be false witnesses.</i> The other disadvantages, it is true, which he has just now recounted, were more serious, as regards us — that <i>faith was made vain</i> — that the whole doctrine of the gospel was useless and worthless, and that we were bereft of all hope of salvation. Yet this also was no trivial absurdity — that the Apostles, who were ordained by God to be the heralds of his eternal truth, were detected as persons who had deceived the world with falsehoods; for this tends to God’s highest dishonor. </p>
<p>The expression,<i>false witnesses of God,</i> we may understand in two ways — either that by <i>lying</i> they used the name of God under a false pretext, or that they were detected as <i>liars,</i> in testifying what they had received from God. The <i>second</i> of these I rather prefer, because it involves a crime that is much more heinous, and he had spoken previously as to men. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(36)</sup></span> Now, therefore, he teaches that, if the resurrection of Christ is denied, God is made guilty of falsehood in the witnesses that have been brought forward and hired by him. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(37)</sup></span> The reason, too, that is added, corresponds well — because they had declared what was false, not as from themselves, but from God. </p>
<p>I am at the same time well aware that there are some that give another rendering to the particle <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κατα</span></blu></grk> The old interpreter renders it <i>against.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(38)</sup></span> Erasmus, on the other hand — <i>concerning.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(39)</sup></span> But, as it has also among the Greeks the force of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀπό</span></blu></grk>, (from,) this signification appeared to me to be more in accordance with the Apostle’s design. For he is not speaking here of the reputation of men, (as I have already stated, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(40)</sup></span>) but he declares that God will be exposed to the charge of falsehood, inasmuch as what they publish has come forth from him. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(36)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Et aussi il auoit desia parle du deshonneur qui en reuindroit aux hommes, c’est a dire aux Apostres et autres prescheurs</span></blu>;” — “And besides, he had spoken previously of the dishonor that resulted from it to men — that is to say, to the Apostles and other preachers.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(37)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Comme subornez</span></blu>;” — “As it were hired.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(38)</span> In accordance with this Wiclif (1380) renders the words thus — “We haw seide witnessynge agens God.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(39)</span> <i>Raphelius</i> adduces two instances of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Ταῦτα μὲν δὴ κατα πάντων Περσῶν ἔχομεν λέγειν</span></blu></grk> — being employed by classical writers in the sense of <i>concerning.</i> “And these are things that we may affirm <i>concerning</i> all the Persians.” — (Xen. Cyrop., Book 1 page 6, line 33.) ‘<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">̔Ο κατα τῶν τεχνῶν καὶ ἐποστημε̑ν λέγειν εἰώθαμεν ταυτὸν καὶ κατα τὢς ἀρετὢς φατέον ἐστίν</span></blu></grk> “What we are accustomed to say <i>in reference to</i> the arts and sciences, may also be said <i>in reference to</i> virtue.” — (Plutarch, chapter 4.) <i>Bloomfield</i> suggests that the Apostle probably employed <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κατα</span></blu></grk> in the “very rare” sense of <i>concerning,</i> “as wishing to include the sense — to <i>the prejudice</i> of — which falsification would occasion, inasmuch as it would almost imply a want of <i>power</i> in God to raise the dead, for the Gentile philosophers <i>denied</i> it.” — Ed. </p>
