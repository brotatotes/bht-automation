<p><b>18.</b><i>Then they who are fallen asleep.</i> Having it in view to prove, that if the resurrection of Christ is taken away, faith is useless, and Christianity <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(41)</sup></span> is a mere deception, he had said that the <i>living</i> remain in their sins; but as there is a clearer illustration of this matter to be seen in the <i>dead,</i> he adduces them as an example. <i>“Of</i> what advantage were it to the dead that they once were Christians? Hence our brethren who are now dead, did to no purpose live in the faith of Christ.” But if it is granted that the essence of the soul is immortal, this argument appears, at first sight, conclusive; for it will very readily be replied, that the dead have not <i>perished,</i> inasmuch as their souls live in a state of separation from their bodies. Hence some fanatics conclude that there is no life in the period intermediate between death and the resurrection; but this frenzy is easily refuted. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(42)</sup></span> For although the souls of the dead are now living, and enjoy quiet repose, yet the whole of their felicity and consolation depends exclusively on the resurrection; because it is well with them on this account, and no other, that they wait for that day, on which they shall be called to the possession of the kingdom of God. Hence as to the hope of the dead, all is over, unless that day shall sooner or later arrive. </p>
