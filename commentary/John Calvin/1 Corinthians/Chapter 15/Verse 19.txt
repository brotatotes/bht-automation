<p><b>19.</b><i>But if in this life</i> Here is another absurdity — that we do not merely by believing lose our time and pains, inasmuch as the fruit of it perishes at our death, but it were better for us not to believe; for the condition of unbelievers were preferable, and more to be desired. To <i>believe in this life</i> means here to limit the fruit of our faith to this life, so that our faith looks no farther, and does not extend beyond the confines of the present life. This statement shows more clearly that the Corinthians had been imposed upon by some mistaken fancy of a figurative resurrection, such as Hymeneus and Philetus, as though the last fruit of our faith were set before us in this life. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:17">2 Timothy 2:17</span>.) For as the resurrection is the completion of our salvation, and as to all blessings is, as it were, the farthest goal, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(43)</sup></span> the man who says that our resurrection is already past, leaves us nothing better to hope for after death. However this may be, this passage gives at all events no countenance to the frenzy of those who imagine that the soul sleeps as well as the body, until the day of the <i>resurrection.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(44)</sup></span> They bring forward, it is true, this objection — that if the soul continued to live when separated from the body, Paul would not have said that, if the resurrection were taken away, we would <i>have hope only in this life,</i> inasmuch as there would still be some felicity remaining for the soul. To this, however, I reply, that Paul did not dream of Elysian fields, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(45)</sup></span> and foolish fables of that sort, but takes it for granted, that the entire hope of Christians looks forward to the final day of judgment — that pious souls do even at this day rest in the same expectation, and that, consequently, we are bereft of everything, if a confidence of this nature deceives us. </p>
<p>But why does he say that we <i>would be the most miserable of all men,</i> as if the lot of the Christian were worse than that of the wicked? For <i>all things,</i> says Solomon, <i>happen alike to the good and to the bad.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ec+9:2">Ecclesiastes 9:2</span>.) I answer, that all men, it is true, whether good or bad, are liable to distresses in common, and they feel in common the same inconveniences, and the same miseries; but there are two reasons why Christians have in all ages fared worse, in addition to which, there was one that was peculiar to the times of Paul. The <i>first</i> is, that while the Lord frequently chastises the wicked, too, with his lashes, and begins to inflict his judgments upon them, he at the same time peculiarly afflicts his own in various ways; — in the <i>first</i> place, because he <i>chastises those whom he loves,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:6">Hebrews 12:6</span>;) and <i>secondly,</i> in order that he may train them to patience, that he may try their obedience, and that he may gradually prepare them by the cross for a true renovation. However it may be as to this, that statement always holds good in the case of believers <i>It is time, that judgment should begin at the house of God.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+25:29">Jeremiah 25:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:17">1 Peter 4:17</span> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(46)</sup></span>) Again, </p>
<p>we are reckoned as sheep appointed for slaughter.<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+44:22">Psalms 44:22</span>.) </p>
<p>Again, </p>
<p>ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+3:3">Colossians 3:3</span>.) </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the condition of the wicked is for the most part the more desirable, because the Lord feeds them up, as hogs for the day of slaughter. </p>
<p>The <i>second</i> reason is, that believers, even though they should abound in riches and in blessings of every kind, they nevertheless do not go to excess, and do not gormandize at their ease; in fine, they do not enjoy the world, as unbelievers do, but go forward with anxiety, constantly <i>groaning,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:2">2 Corinthians 5:2</span>,) partly from a consciousness of their weakness, and partly from an eager longing for the future life. Unbelievers, on the other hand, are wholly intent on intoxicating themselves with present delights. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(47)</sup></span> </p>
<p>The <i>third</i> reason, which was peculiar, as I have said, to the age of the Apostle, is — that at that time the name of <i>Christians</i> was so odious and abominable, that no one could then take upon himself the name of Christ without exposing his life to imminent peril. It is, therefore, not without good reason that he says that Christians would be <i>the most miserable of all men</i>, if their confidence were confined to this world. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(43)</span> This statement as to the <i>resurrection</i> is strikingly in contrast with the celebrated sentiment of Horace. (Epist. 1:16, 79.) “<blu>Mors est ultima linea rerum</blu>;” — “Death is the ultimate limit of things.” Heathen philosophers denied the possibility of a <i>resurrection.</i> Thus <i>Pliny,</i> Hist. Nat. L. 2, c. 7, says — “<blu>Revocare defunctos ne Deus qidem potest</blu>;” — “To call back the dead is what God himself cannot do.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(44)</span> <i>Pareus,</i> in commenting on this passage, adverts in the following terms to the tenet above referred <i>to</i> — “<blu>Nequaquam vero hinc sequitur, quod Psychopannychitae finxerunt: animas post mortem dormire, aut in nihilum cum corporibus redigi.</blu> <blu><i>Perire</i></blu> <blu>enim dicuntur infideles quoad animas, non physice, quod corruptae intercant; sed theologice, quod viventes felicitatern coelestem non consequantur; sed in tartara ad paenas solae vel cum corporibus tandem detrudantur</blu>;” — “By no means, however, does it follow from this, according to the contrivance of the soul-sleepers, that souls sleep after death, or are reduced to nothing along with the body. For unbelievers are said to <i>perish</i> as to their souls, not physically, as though they corrupted, and died, but theologically, because, while living they do not attain heavenly felicity, but are at length thrust down to hell for punishment, alone, or along with the <i>body.”</i> — <i>Ed.</i> </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(46)</span> Calvin, in commenting on <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:17">1 Peter 4:17</span>, when speaking <i>of judgment beginning at the house of God,</i> says: <i>“</i> <blu><i>Ideo</i></blu> <blu>dicit Paulus</blu>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:19">1 Corinthians 15:19</span>,) <blu>Christianos sublata fide resurrectionis, omnium hominum miserrimos fore: et merito, quia dum alii absque metu sibi indulgent, assidue ingemiscunt fideles: dum aliorum peccata dissimulat Deus, et altos torpore sinit, suos sub cruets disciplina multo rigidins exercet</blu>;” — “Hence Paul says, and justly, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:19">1 Corinthians 15:19</span>,) that Christians, if the hope of a resurrection were taken away, would be of <i>all men the most miserable,</i> because, while others indulge themselves without fear, believers incessantly groan: while God seems to let the sins of others pass unnoticed, and allows others to be in a torpid state, he exercises his own people more strictly under the discipline of the cross.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(47)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Es voluptez et delices de ce monde</span></blu>;” — “With the pleasures and delights of this world.” </p>
