<p><b>20.</b><i>But now hath Christ risen.</i> Having shown what dreadful confusion as to everything would follow, if we were to deny that the dead rise again, he now again assumes as certain, what he had sufficiently established previously — that <i>Christ has risen;</i> and he adds that he is the<i>first-fruits,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(48)</sup></span> by a similitude taken, as it appears, from the ancient ritual of the law. For as in the <i>first-fruits</i> the produce of the entire year was consecrated, so the power of Christ’s resurrection is extended to all of us — unless you prefer to take it in a more simple way — that in him the first fruit of the resurrection was gathered. I rather prefer, however, to understand the statement in this sense — that the rest of the dead will follow him, as the entire harvest does the <i>first-fruits;</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(49)</sup></span> and this is confirmed by the succeeding statement. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(48)</span> “Although the resurrection of Christ, compared with <i>first-fruits</i> of any kind, has very good harmony with them, yet it more especially agrees with the offering of the <i>sheaf,</i> commonly called <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">עומר</span></blu></heb>, <i>omer,</i> not only as the thing itself, but also as to the circumstances of the <i>time.</i> For first there was the <i>passover,</i> and the day following was a <i>sabbatic</i> day, and on the <i>day following</i> that, the first-fruits were offered. So Christ, our <i>passover,</i> was crucified: the day following his crucifixion was the <i>Sabbath,</i> and the day following <i>that,</i> he, the <i>first-fruits of them that slept,</i> rose again, All who died before Christ, and were raised again to life, died afterwards; but Christ is the <i>first-fruits</i> of all who shall be raised from the dead to die no more.” — <i>Lightfoot.</i> — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(49)</span> “The <i>first-fruits</i> were by the command of God presented to him at a stated season, not only as a token of the gratitude of the Israelites for his bounty, but as an earnest of the approaching harvest. In this sense he is called the <i>first-fruits</i> of the dead. He was the first in order of time, for although some were restored to life by the Prophets, and by himself during his personal ministry, none came out of their graves to return to them no more till after his resurrection; and as he was the first in respect of time, so he was the first in order of succession; all the saints following him as the harvest followed the presentation of the <i>first-fruits</i> of the temple. The interval is long, and the dreary sterility of the grave might justify the thought, that the seed committed to it has perished for ever. But our hope rests upon his power, which can make the wilderness blossom as the rose; and we wait till heavenly influences descend as the dew of herbs, when the barren soil shall display all the luxuriance of vegetation, and death itself shall teem with <i>life.”</i> — <i>Dick’s Theology,</i> volume 4 — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
