<p><b>23.</b><i>Every one in his own order.</i> Here we have an anticipation of a question that might be proposed: <i>“If</i> Christ’s life,” some one might say, “draws ours along with it, why does not this appear? Instead of this, while Christ has risen from the grave, we lie rotting there.” Paul’s answer is, that God has appointed another order of things. Let us therefore reckon it enough, that we now have in Christ the <i>first-fruits,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(51)</sup></span> and that his coming <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(52)</sup></span> will be the time of our resurrection. For <i>our life</i> must still be <i>hid with him,</i> because he has not yet <i>appeared.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+3:3">Colossians 3:3</span>.) It would therefore be preposterous to wish to anticipate that day of the revelation of Christ. </p>
