<p><b>3.</b><i>For I delivered to you first of all</i> He now confirms what he had previously stated, by explaining that the resurrection had been preached by him, and that too as a fundamental doctrine of the gospel. <i>First of all,</i> says he, as it is wont to be with a foundation in the erecting of a house. At the same time he adds to the authority of his preaching, when he subjoins, that he <i>delivered</i> nothing but <i>what he had received,</i> for he does not simply mean that he related what he had from the report of others, but that it was what had been enjoined upon him by the Lord. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(11)</sup></span> For the word <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(12)</sup></span> must be explained in accordance with the connection of the passage. Now it is the duty of an apostle to bring forward nothing but what he <i>has received from the Lord,</i> so as from hand to hand <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(13)</sup></span> (as they say) to administer to the Church the pure word of God. </p>
<p><i>That Christ died, etc</i>. See now more clearly whence he received it, for he quotes <i>the Scriptures</i> in proof. In the first place, he makes mention of the death of Christ, nay also of his burial, that we may infer, that, as he was like us in these things, he is so also in his resurrection. He has, therefore, died with us that we may rise with him. In his burial, too, the reality of the death in which he has taken part with us, is made more clearly apparent. Now there are many passages of Scripture in which Christ’s death and <i>resurrection</i> are predicted, but nowhere more plainly <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(14)</sup></span> than in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:0">Isaiah 53:0</span>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="da+9:26">Daniel 9:26</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:0">Psalms 22:0</span> </p>
<p><i>For our sins</i> That is, that by taking our curse upon him he might redeem us from it. For what else was Christ’s death, but a sacrifice for expiating our sins — what but a satisfactory penalty, by which we might be reconciled to God — what but the condemnation of one, for the purpose of obtaining forgiveness for us? He speaks also in the same manner in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span>, but in that passage, on the other hand, he ascribes it also to the resurrection as its effect — that it confers righteousness upon us; for as sin was done away through the death of Christ, so righteousness is procured through his resurrection. This distinction must be carefully <i>observed,</i> that we may know what we must look for from the death of Christ, and what from his resurrection. When, however, the Scripture in other places makes mention only of his death, let us understand that in those cases his <i>resurrection</i> is included in his death, but when they are mentioned separately, the commencement of our salvation is (as we see) in the one, and the consummation of it in the other. </p>
