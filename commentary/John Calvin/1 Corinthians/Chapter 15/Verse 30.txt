<p><b>30.</b><i>Why are we also? “If</i> our resurrection and ultimate felicity are in this world, why do we of our own accord abandon it, and voluntarily encounter death?” The argument might also be unfolded in this manner: “To no purpose would we <i>stand in peril every hour,</i> if we did not look for a better life, after death has been passed through.” He speaks, however, of voluntary dangers, to which believers expose their lives for the purpose of confessing Christ. “This magnanimity of soul, I say, in despising death, would be ascribed to rashness rather than firmness, if the saints perished at death, for it is a diabolical madness to purchase by death an immortal fame.<sup>”</sup> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(74)</sup></span> </p>
