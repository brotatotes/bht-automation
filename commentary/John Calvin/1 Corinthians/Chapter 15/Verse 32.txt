<p><b>32.</b><i>If according to the manner of men</i> He brings forward a notable instance of death, from which it might be clearly seen that he would have been worse than a fool, if there were not a better life in reserve for us beyond death; for it was an ignominious kind of death to which he was exposed. “To what purpose were it,” says he, “for me to incur infamy in connection with a most cruel death, if all my hopes were confined to this world?” <i>According to the manner of men,</i> means in this passage, <i>in respect of human life, so that we obtain a reward in this world.</i> </p>
<p>Now by those that <i>fought with beasts,</i> are meant, not those that were thrown to wild beasts, as Erasmus mistakingly imagined, but those that were condemned to be set to fight with wild beasts — to furnish an amusement to the people. There were, then, two kinds of punishment, that were totally different — to be thrown to wild beasts, and to fight with wild beasts. For those that were thrown to wild beasts were straightway torn in pieces; but those that fought with wild beasts went forth armed into the arena, that if they were endued with strength, courage, and agility, they might effect their escape by dispatching the wild beasts. Nay more, there was a game in which those who fought with wild beasts were trained, like the gladiators <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(81)</sup></span> Usually, however, very few escaped, because the man who had dispatched one wild beast, was required to fight with a second, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(82)</sup></span> until the cruelty of the spectators was satiated, or rather was melted into pity; and yet there were found men so abandoned and <i>desperate,</i> as to hire themselves out for this! <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(83)</sup></span> And this, I may remark by the way, is that kind of <i>hunting</i> that is punished so severely by the ancient canons, as even civil laws brand it with a mark of infamy. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(84)</sup></span> </p>
<p>I return to Paul. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(85)</sup></span> We see what an extremity God allowed his servant to come to, and how wonderfully, too, he rescued him. Luke, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(86)</sup></span> however, makes no mention of this <i>fight.</i> Hence we may infer that he endured many things that have not been committed to writing. </p>
<p><i>Let us eat and drink</i> This is a saying of the Epicureans, who reckon man’s highest good as consisting in present enjoyment. Isaiah also testifies that it is a saying made use of by profligate persons, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+22:13">Isaiah 22:13</span>,) who, when the Prophets of God threaten them with ruin, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(87)</sup></span> with the view of calling them to repentance, making sport of those threatenings, encourage themselves in wantonness and unbridled mirth, and in order to show more openly their obstinacy, say, “Since die we must, let us meanwhile enjoy the time, and not torment ourselves before the time with empty fears.” As to what a certain General said to his army, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(88)</sup></span> “My fellowsoldiers, let us dine heartily, for we shall sup to-day in the regions below,” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(89)</sup></span> that was an exhortation to meet death with intrepidity, and has nothing to do with this subject. I am of opinion, that Paul made use of a jest in common use among abandoned and desperately wicked persons, or (to express it shortly) a common proverb among the Epicureans to the following purpose: “If death is the end of man, there is nothing better than that he should indulge in pleasure, free from care, so long as life lasts.” Sentiments of this kind are to be met with frequently in Horace. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(90)</sup></span> </p>
