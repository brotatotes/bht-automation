<p><b>34.</b><i>Awake righteously</i> As he saw that the Corinthians were in a manner intoxicated, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(97)</sup></span> through excessive carelessness, he arouses them from their torpor. By adding, however, the adverb <i>righteously,</i> he intimates in what way he would have them <i>wake up</i> For they were sufficiently attentive and clear-sighted as to their own affairs: nay more, there can be no doubt that they congratulated themselves on their acuteness; but in the mean time they were drowsy, where they ought most of all to have been on the watch. He says accordingly, <i>awake righteously</i> — that is, <i>“Direct</i> your mind and aim to things that are good and holy.” </p>
<p>He adds at the same time the reason, — <i>For some,</i> says he, <i>among you are in ignorance of God</i> This required to be stated: otherwise they might have thought that the admonition was unnecessary; for they looked upon themselves as marvellously wise. Now he convicts them of <i>ignorance of God,</i> that they may know that the main thing was wanting in them. A useful admonition to those who lay out all their agility in flying through the air, while in the mean time they do not see what is before their feet, and are stupid where they ought, most of all, to have been clear-sighted. </p>
<p><i>To your shame</i> Just as fathers, when reproving their children for their faults, put them to shame, in order that they may by that shame cover their shame. When, however, he declared previously that he did not wish to shame them, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:14">1 Corinthians 4:14</span>,) his meaning was that he did not wish to hold them up to disgrace, by bringing forward their faults to public view in a spirit of enmity and hatred. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(98)</sup></span> In the mean time, however, it was of advantage for them to be sharply reproved, as they were still indulging themselves in evils of such magnitude. Now Paul in reproaching them with <i>ignorance of God,</i> strips them entirely of all honor. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(97)</span> The original word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐκνήψατε</span></blu></grk>, properly signifies to <i>awake sober out of a drunken sleepage</i> It is used in this sense in stone instances in the <i>Septuagint.</i> Thus in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joe+1:5">Joel 1:5</span>, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Εκνηψατε οἱ μεθυντες</span></blu></grk> <i>Awake, ye drunkards.</i> See also <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:24">Genesis 9:24</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1sa+25:37">1 Samuel 25:37</span>. It is used in the same sense by classical writers. <i>“‘</i> Awake to righteousness and sin not, for some have not the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame;’ that is, shake off the mental delusion and stupor in which the <i>intoxication</i> of error has involved you, that, with clear and exerted faculties, you may attend to the most important subject<i>.”</i> — <i>Brown’s Expository Discourses on Peter,</i> volume in. page 8. The expression <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐκνήψατε δικαίως</span></blu></grk> <i>, (awake righteously,)</i> is rendered by <i>Luther</i> <blu><span lang="de-DE" style="">machet recht aui</span></blu> — “Wake right up.” It is, however, generally considered to be elliptical. Some supply <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ζησοτες</span></blu></grk> — “Awake, <i>that ye may live</i> righteously. Others understand <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δικαίως</span></blu></grk>, as equivalent to <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὡς δικαίως δεῖ</span></blu></grk> “as it is fit you should.” “Arrian and Menander,” says <i>Parkhurst,</i> “use <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δικαιως</span></blu></grk> in this sense, as may be seen in Alberti on the text.” To the two authorities quoted by Alberti, Alexander in his Paraphrase on <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:0">1 Corinthians 15:0</span>, adds one from Ocellus Lucanus — <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">̔Ο δε διαμαχομενος δικαιως</span></blu></grk>, but the man who stands up for his own authority <i>as he ought to do.”</i> — <i>Apud Gale,</i> page 533, I. 20.
