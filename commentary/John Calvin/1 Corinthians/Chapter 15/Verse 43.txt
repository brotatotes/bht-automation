<p><b>43.</b><i>It is sown in corruption</i> That there may be no doubt remaining, Paul explains himself, by unfolding the difference between their present condition, and that which will be after the resurrection. What connection, then, would there be in his discourse, if he had intended in the first instance <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(107)</sup></span> to distinguish between the different degrees of future glory among the saints? There can, therefore, be no doubt, that he has been, up to this point, following out one subject. He now returns to the first similitude that he had made use of, but applies it more closely to his design. Or, if you prefer it, keeping up that similitude, he figuratively compares the time of the present life to the seed-time, and the resurrection to the harvest; and he says, that our body is now, indeed, subject to mortality and ignominy, but will then be glorious and incorruptible. He says the same thing in other words in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span> </p>
<p>Christ will change our vile body,<br/>that he may make it like to his own glorious body. </p>
