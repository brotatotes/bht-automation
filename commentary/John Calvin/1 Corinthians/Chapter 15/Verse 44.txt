<p><b>44.</b><i>It is sown an animal body.</i> As he could not express <i>each</i> particular by enumerating one by one, he sums up all <i>comprehensively</i> in one word, by saying that the body is now <i>animal,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(108)</sup></span> but it will then be <i>spiritual.</i> Now that is called <i>animal</i> which is quickened by <i>(</i> <blu><i>anima</i></blu> <i>)</i> the soul: that is <i>spiritual</i> which is quickened by the <i>Spirit.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(109)</sup></span> Now it is the soul that quickens the body, so as to keep it from being a dead carcase. Hence it takes its title very properly from it. After the resurrection, on the other hand, that quickening influence, which it will receive from the Spirit, will be more excellent. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(110)</sup></span> Let us, however, always bear in mind, what we have seen previously — that the substance of the body is the same, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(111)</sup></span> and that it is the quality only that is here treated of. Let the present quality of the body be called, for the sake of greater plainness, <i>animation;</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(112)</sup></span> let the future receive the name of <i>inspiration.</i> For as to the soul’s now <i>quickening</i> the body, that is effected through the intervention of many helps; for we stand in need of drink, food, clothing, sleep, and other things of a similar nature. Hence the weakness of <i>animation</i> is clearly manifested. The energy of the Spirit, on the other hand, for <i>quickening,</i> will be much more complete, and, consequently, exempted from necessities of that nature. This is the simple and genuine meaning of the Apostle; that no one may, by philosophizing farther, indulge in airy speculations, as those do, who suppose that the substance of the body will be spiritual, while there is no mention made here of substance, and no change will be made upon it. </p>
