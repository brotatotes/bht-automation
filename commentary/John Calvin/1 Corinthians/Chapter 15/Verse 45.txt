<p><b>45.</b><i>As it is written, The first Adam was made</i> Lest it should seem to be some new contrivance as to the <i>animal body,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(113)</sup></span> he quotes Scripture, which declares that Adam <i>became a living soul,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:7">Genesis 2:7</span>) — meaning, that his body was quickened by the soul, so that he became a living man. It is asked, what is the meaning of the word <i>soul</i> here? It is well known, that the Hebrew word <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">נפש</span></blu></heb>, <i>(nephesh,)</i> which Moses makes use of, is taken in a variety of senses; but in this passage it is taken to mean either vital motion, or the <i>very essence</i> of life itself. The second of these I rather prefer. I observe that the same thing is affirmed as to beasts — that they were made <i>a living soul,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:20">Genesis 1:20</span>;) but as the soul of every animal must be judged of according to its kind, there is nothing to hinder that a <i>soul,</i> that is to say, vital motion, may be common to all; and yet at the same time the <i>soul</i> of man may have something peculiar and distinguishing, namely, immortal <i>essence,</i> as the light of intelligence and reason. </p>
<p><i>The last Adam.</i> This expression we do not find anywhere <i>written.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(114)</sup></span> Hence the phrase,<i>It is written,</i> must be understood as referring exclusively to the first clause; but after bringing forward this testimony of Scripture, the Apostle now begins in his own person to draw a contrast between Christ and Adam. <i>“Moses</i> relates that Adam was furnished with a <i>living soul;</i> Christ, on the other hand, is endowed with a <i>life-giving Spirit.</i> Now it is a much greater thing to be <i>life,</i> or the <i>source of life,</i> than simply to <i>live.”</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(115)</sup></span> It must be observed, however, that Christ did also, like us, become a <i>living soul;</i> but, besides the <i>soul,</i> the Spirit of the Lord was also poured-out upon him, that by his power he might rise again from the dead, and raise up others, This, therefore, must be observed, in order that no one may imagine, (as Apollinaris <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(116)</sup></span> did of old,) that the Spirit was in Christ in place of a soul. And independently of this, the interpretation of this passage may be taken from the eighth chapter of the Romans, where the Apostle declares, that <i>the body, indeed, is dead, on account of sin,</i> and we <i>carry</i> in us the elements of death; but that <i>the Spirit of Christ, who raised him up from the dead, dwelleth also in us,</i> and that he is life, to raise up us also one day from the dead. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10">Romans 8:10</span>.) From this you see, that we have <i>living souls,</i> inasmuch as we are men, but that we have the <i>life-giving Spirit</i> of Christ poured out upon us by the grace of regeneration. In short, Paul’s meaning is, that the condition that we obtain through Christ is greatly superior to the lot of the <i>first man,</i> because a <i>living soul</i> was conferred upon Adam in his own name, and in that of his posterity, but Christ has procured for us the Spirit, who is <i>life.</i> </p>
<p>Now as to his calling Christ <i>the last Adam,</i> the reason is this, that as the human race was created in the <i>first man,</i> so it is renewed in Christ. I shall express it again, and more distinctly: All men were created in the <i>first man,</i> because, whatever God designed to give to all, he conferred upon that one man, so that the condition of mankind was settled in his person. He by his fall <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(117)</sup></span> ruined himself and those that were his, because he drew them all, along with himself, into the same ruin: Christ came to restore our nature from ruin, and raise it up to a better condition than ever. They <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(118)</sup></span> are then, as it were, two sources, or two roots of the human race. Hence it is not without good reason, that the one is called the <i>first man,</i> and the other the <i>last.</i> This, however, gives no support to those madmen, who make Christ to be one of ourselves, as though there were and always had been only two men, and that this multitude which we behold, were a mere phantom! A similar comparison occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span> </p>

It is true, indeed, that this is a thing much less than what is said of the second Adam, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span>. ‘The first man Adam was made a living soul; the second Adam was a quickening Spirit.’ This latter is a great deal more. A <i>living soul</i> signified him to live himself; but a quickening spirit signifies a power to make others live. <i>That</i> the first Adam could not do; the more excellent kind of life which he had (for there was a complication of lives in the first creation of this man) he could not <i>lose:</i> but he could not <i>give.</i> He could not <i>lose</i> it from himself; but he could never have <i>given</i> it, by any power or immediate efficiency of his own, to another. Here the second Adam — the constitution of the second Adam — was far above that of the first, in that he could quicken others — a <i>quickening spirit,</i> not only quickened passively, but quickened actively, such a spirit as could give spirit, and diffuse life.” — Howe’s Works, (Lond. 1834,) page 1209. — Ed. </p>
