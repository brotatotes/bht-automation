<p><b>49.</b><i>As we have borne</i> Some have thought, that there is here an exhortation to a pious and holy life, into which Paul was led by way of digression; and on that account they have changed the verb from the future tense into the hortative mood. Nay more, in some Greek manuscripts the reading is <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">φορέσωμεν</span></blu></grk> <i>(let us bear,)</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(124)</sup></span> but as that does not suit so well in respect of connection, let us adopt in preference what corresponds better with the object in view and the context. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(125)</sup></span> Let us observe, in the first place, that this is not an exhortation, but pure doctrine, and that he is not treating here of newness of life, but pursues, without any interruption, the thread of his discourse respecting the resurrection of the flesh. The meaning accordingly will be this: “As the <i>animal nature,</i> which has the <i>precedency</i> in us, is the image of Adam, so we shall be conformed to Christ in the <i>heavenly nature;</i> and this will be the completion of our restoration. For we <i>now</i> begin to bear the image of Christ, and are every day more and more transformed into it; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(126)</sup></span> but that image consists in spiritual regeneration. But <i>then</i> it will be fully restored both in body and in soul, and what is now begun will be perfected, and <i>accordingly</i> we will obtain in reality what we as yet only hope for.” If, however, any one prefers a different reading, this statement will serve to spur forward the Corinthians; and if there had been a lively meditation of sincere piety and a new life, it might have been the means of kindling up in them at the same time the hope of heavenly glory. </p>
