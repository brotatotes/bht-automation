<p><b>5.</b><i>That he was seen by Cephas</i> He now brings forward <i>eye witnesses, (</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">αὐτόπτας</span></blu></grk> <i>)</i> as they are called by Luke, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:2">Luke 1:2</span>,) who saw the accomplishment of what the Scriptures had foretold would take place. He does not, however, adduce them all, for he makes no mention of women. When, therefore, he says that he appeared first to Peter, you are to understand by this that he is put before all the <i>men,</i> so that there is nothing inconsistent with this in the statement of Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:9">Mark 16:9</span>) that <i>he appeared to Mary.</i> </p>
<p>But how is it that he says, that <i>he appeared to the twelve,</i> when, after the death of Judas, there were only eleven remaining? Chrysostom is of opinion that this took place after Matthias had been chosen in his room. Others have chosen rather to correct the expression, looking upon it as a mistake <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(15)</sup></span> But as we know, that there were <i>twelve</i> in number that were set apart by Christ’s appointment, though one of them had been expunged from the roll, there is no absurdity in supposing that the name was retained. On this principle, there was a body of men at Rome that were called <blu>Centumviri</blu>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(16)</sup></span> while they were in number 102. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(17)</sup></span> By <i>the twelve,</i> therefore, you are simply to understand the chosen Apostles. </p>
<p>It does not quite appear <i>when</i> it was that this <i>appearing to more than five hundred</i> took place. Only it is possible that this large multitude assembled at Jerusalem, when he manifested himself to them. For Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:33">Luke 24:33</span>) makes mention in a general way of the disciples who had assembled with the eleven; but how many there were he does not say. Chrysostom refers it to the ascension, and explains the word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐπάνω</span></blu></grk> to mean, <i>from on high.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(18)</sup></span> Unquestionably, as to what he says in reference to his having appeared to James apart, this may have been subsequently to the ascension. </p>
<p>By <i>all the Apostles</i> I understand not merely the <i>twelve,</i> but also those disciples to whom Christ had assigned the office of preaching the gospel. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(19)</sup></span> In proportion as our Lord was desirous that there should be many witnesses of his resurrection, and that it should be frequently testified of, let us know that it should be so much the more <i>surely believed among us.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:1">Luke 1:1</span>.) Farther, inasmuch as the Apostle proves the resurrection of Christ from the fact that he appeared to many, he intimates by this, that it was not figurative but true and natural, for the eyes of the body cannot be witnesses of a spiritual resurrection. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(15)</span> <i>Granville Penn</i> supposes that the common reading <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἶτα τοῖς δώδεκα</span></blu></grk> <i>then to the twelve,</i> is a corruption for <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἶτα τοῖς δε δεκα</span></blu></grk> — <i>and then to the ten,</i> understanding the Apostle as meaning, that Christ appeared first to Cephas, and then to the other <i>ten.</i> Dr. Adam Clarke, after stating that “instead of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δώδεκα</span></blu></grk> <i>, twelve,</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἓνδεκα</span></blu></grk> <i>, eleven</i> is the reading of D* E F G, <i>Syriac</i> in the margin, some of the <i>Slavonic, Armenian, Vulgate, Itala,</i> and several of the <i>Fathers,”</i> and that “this reading is supported by <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:14">Mark 16:14</span> <i>,”</i> remarks: “Perhaps the term <i>twelve</i> is used here <i>merely</i> to point out the <i>society of the Apostles.</i> who, though at this time they were only <i>eleven,</i> were still called the <i>twelve,</i> because this was their <i>original number,</i> and a number which was <i>afterwards filled up.”</i> “The <i>twelve</i> was a name not of number, but of office. — <i>McKnight.</i> — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(16)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">C’est a dire, les Cents</span></blu>;” — “That is to say, the Hundred.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(17)</span> The reader will find the same term referred to by Calvin when commenting on <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:8">1 Corinthians 10:8</span>. (See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 1, p. 324, n. 3.) — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(18)</span> “This peculiar use of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐπάνω</span></blu></grk> for <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πλωῖον</span></blu></grk>, (which seems to have been popular or provincial, not being found in the Classical writers,) occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:5">Mark 14:5</span>, but with a genitive. Perhaps, however, it has properly no regimen, but is used parenthetically, like the Latin <blu><i>plus trecentos</i></blu> <i>,</i> 300 and more.” — <i>Bloomfield.</i> The word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὠπάνω</span></blu></grk> is used in a similar way in the Septuagint. Thus in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:14">Exodus 30:14</span> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς και ἐπάνω</span></blu></grk> — <i>from twenty years old and above,</i> and in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+27:7">Leviticus 27:7</span>, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀπὸ ἑξήκονταἐτῶν και ἐπάνω</span></blu></grk> — <i>from sixty years old and above.</i> — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(19)</span> Calvin’s view accords with that of Chrysostom, who says, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἦσαν γὰρ καὶ ἄλλοι ἀπόστολοι ὡς ὁι ἑιβδομήκοντα</span></blu></grk> — “for there were also other Apostles, such as the seventy.” — Ed. </p>
