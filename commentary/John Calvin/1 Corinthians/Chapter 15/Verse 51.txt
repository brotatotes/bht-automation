<p>Hitherto he has included two things in his reasoning. In <i>the first</i> place, he shows that there will be a resurrection from the dead: <i>secondly,</i> he shows of what nature it will be. Now, however, he enters more thoroughly into a description of the manner of it. This he calls a <i>mystery,</i> because it had not been as yet so clearly unfolded in any statement of revelation; but he does this to make them more attentive. For that wicked doctrine had derived strength from the circumstance, that they disputed as to this matter carelessly and at their ease; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(127)</sup></span> as if it were a matter in which they felt no difficulty. Hence by the term <i>mystery,</i> he admonishes them to learn a matter, which was not only as yet unknown to them, but ought to be reckoned among God’s heavenly secrets. </p>
<p><b>51.</b><i>We shall not indeed all sleep.</i> Here there is no difference in the Greek manuscripts, but in the Latin versions there are three different readings. The <i>first</i> is, <i>We shall indeed all die, but we shall not all be changed.</i> The <i>second</i> is, <i>We shall indeed all rise again, but we shall not all be changed.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(128)</sup></span> The <i>third</i> is, <i>We shall not indeed all sleep, but we shall all be changed.</i> This diversity, I conjecture, had arisen from this — that some readers, who were not the most discerning, dissatisfied with the true reading, ventured to conjecture a reading which was more approved by them. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(129)</sup></span> For it appeared to them, at first view, to be absurd to say, that <i>all would not die,</i> while we read elsewhere, that <i>it is appointed unto all men once to die.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:27">Hebrews 9:27</span>.) Hence they altered the meaning in this way — All <i>will not be changed, though all will rise again, or will die;</i> and the <i>change</i> they interpret to mean — the glory that the sons of God alone will obtain. The true reading, however, may be judged of from the context. </p>
<p>Paul’s intention is to explain what he had said — that we will be conformed to Christ, because <i>flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.</i> A question presented itself, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(130)</sup></span> what then will become of those who will be still living at the day of the Lord? His answer is, that although <i>all will not die,</i> yet they will be renewed, that mortality and corruption may be done <i>away.</i> It is to be observed, however, that he speaks exclusively of believers; for although the resurrection of the wicked will also involve <i>change,</i> yet as there is no mention made of them here, we must consider everything that is said, as referring exclusively to the elect. We now see, how well this statement corresponds with the preceding one, for as he had said, that <i>we shall bear the image of Christ,</i> he now declares, that this will take place when we shall be <i>changed,</i> so that </p>
<p>mortality may be swallowed up of life, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:4">2 Corinthians 5:4</span>,) </p>
<p>and that this renovation is not inconsistent with the fact, that Christ’s advent will find some still alive. </p>
<p>We must, however, unravel the difficulty — that <i>it is appointed unto all men once to die;</i> and certainly, it is not difficult to unravel it in this way — that as a <i>change</i> cannot take place without doing away with the previous system, that <i>change</i> is reckoned, with good reason, a kind of <i>death;</i> but, as it is not a separation of the soul from the body, it is not looked upon as an ordinary death. It will then be <i>death,</i> inasmuch as it will be the destruction of corruptible nature: it will not be a <i>sleep,</i> inasmuch as the soul will not quit the body; but there will be a sudden transition from corruptible nature into a blessed immortality. </p>
