<p><b>52.</b><i>In a moment</i> This is still of a general nature; that is, it includes all. For in all the change will be sudden and instantaneous, because Christ’s advent will be sudden. And to convey the idea of <i>a moment,</i> he afterwards makes use of the phrase <i>twinkling</i> (or <i>jerk)</i> of the eye, for in the Greek manuscripts there is a twofold, reading — <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ῥοπὣ</span></blu></grk> <i>(jerk,)</i> or <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ῥιπὣ</span></blu></grk> <i>(twinkling.)</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(131)</sup></span> It matters nothing, however, as to the sense. Paul has selected a movement of the body, that surpasses all others in quickness; for nothing is more rapid than a movement of the eye, though at the same time he has made an allusion to <i>sleep,</i> with which <i>twinkling of the eye</i> is contrasted. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(132)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>With the last trump.</i> Though the repetition of the term might seem to place it beyond a doubt, that the word <i>trumpet</i> is here taken in its proper acceptation, yet I prefer to understand the expression as metaphorical. In <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>, he connects together the <i>voice of the archangel</i> and the <i>trump of God:</i> As therefore a commander, with the sound of a trumpet, summons his army to battle, so Christ, by his far sounding proclamation, which will be heard throughout the whole world, will summon all the dead. Moses tells us, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:16">Exodus 19:16</span>,) what loud and terrible sounds were uttered on occasion of the promulgation of the law. Far different will be the commotion <i>then,</i> when not one people merely, but the whole world will be summoned to the tribunal of God. Nor will the living only be convoked, but even the dead will be called forth from their graves. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(133)</sup></span> Nay more, a commandment must be given to dry bones and dust that, resuming their former appearance and reunited to the spirit, they come forth straightway as living men into the presence of Christ. </p>
<p><i>The dead shall rise</i> What he had declared generally as to all, he now explains particularly as to the living and the dead. This distinction, therefore, is simply an exposition of the foregoing statement — <i>that all will not die, but all will be changed</i> “Those who have already died,” says he, <i>“will</i> rise again incorruptible.” See what a change there will be upon the <i>dead!</i> “Those,” says he, “who will be still alive will themselves also be <i>changed.”</i> You see then as to both. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(134)</sup></span> You now then perceive how it is, that <i>change</i> will be common to all, but not <i>sleep.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(135)</sup></span> </p>
<p>When he says, <i>We shall be changed,</i> he includes himself in the number of those, who are to live till the advent of Christ. As it was now the <i>last times,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span>,) <i>that day</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:18">2 Timothy 1:18</span>) was to be looked for by the saints every hour. At the same time, in writing to the Thessalonians, he utters that memorable prediction respecting the scattering <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(136)</sup></span> that would take place in the Church before Christ’s coming. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</span>.) This, however, does not hinder that he might, by bringing the Corinthians, as it were, into immediate contact with the event, associate himself and them with those who would at that time be alive. </p>

And how startling, how stupendous the summons! Nothing equal to it, nothing like it, was ever heard through all the regions of the universe, or all the revolutions of time. When conflicting armies have discharged the bellowing artillery of war, or when victorious armies have shouted for joy of the conquest, the seas and shores have rung, the mountains and plains have echoed. But the shout of the archangel, and the trump of God, will resound from pole to poles — will pierce the center and shake the pillars of heaven. Stronger — stronger still — it will penetrate even the deepest recesses of the tomb! It will pour its amazing thunder into all those abodes of silence. The dead, the very dead, shall <i>hear.”</i> — <i>Hervey’s</i> Theron and Aspasio, volume 2 page <i>66.</i> — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
