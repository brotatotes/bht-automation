<p><b>54.</b><i>Then shall be brought to pass the saying</i> This is not merely an amplification, <i>(</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐπεξεργασία</span></blu></grk> <i>,)</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(137)</sup></span> but a confirmation, too, of the preceding statement. For what was foretold by the Prophets must be fulfilled. Now this prediction will not be fulfilled, until our bodies, laying aside corruption, will <i>put on incorruption</i> Hence this last result, also, is necessary. To <i>come to pass,</i> is used here in the sense of being <i>fully accomplished,</i> for what Paul quotes is now begun in us, and is daily, too, receiving further accomplishment; but it will not have its complete fulfillment until the last day. </p>
<p>It does not, however, appear quite manifest, from what passage he has taken this quotation, for many statements occur in the Prophets to this effect. Only the probability is, that the first clause is taken either from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+25:8">Isaiah 25:8</span>, where it is said that <i>death will be for ever destroyed</i> by the Lord, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(138)</sup></span> or, (as almost all are rather inclined to think,) from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ho+13:14">Hosea 13:14</span>, where the Prophet, bewailing the obstinate wickedness of Israel, complains that he was like an untimely child, that struggles against the efforts of his mother in travail, that he may not <i>come</i> forth from the womb, and from this he concludes, that it was owing entirely to himself, that he was not delivered from death. <i>I will ransom them,</i> says he, from <i>the power of the grave: I will rescue them from death.</i> It matters not, whether you read these words in the future of the indicative, or in the subjunctive <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(139)</sup></span> for in either way the meaning amounts to this — that God was prepared to confer upon them salvation, if they would have allowed the favor to be conferred upon them, and that, therefore, if they perished, it was their own fault. </p>
<p>He afterwards adds,<i>I will be thy destruction, O death! thy ruin, O grave!</i> In these words God intimates, that he accomplishes the salvation of his people <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(140)</sup></span> only when death and the grave are reduced to nothing. For no one will deny, that in that passage there is a description of completed salvation. As, therefore, we do not see such a destruction of death, it follows, that we do not yet enjoy that complete salvation, which God promises to his people, and that, consequently, it is delayed until <i>that day. Then,</i> accordingly, <i>will death be swallowed up,</i> that is, it will be reduced to nothing, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(141)</sup></span> that we may have manifestly, in every particular, and in every respect, (as they say,) a complete victory over it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(142)</sup></span> </p>

Every thing of mortality, that was hanging about these glorious victors, shall be <i>swallowed up</i> in perfect and endless life. Death is unstung first — disarmed — and then easily overcome. Its sting is said to be sin — the deadliest thing in death. A plain farther proof, by the way, the Apostle intended death also in the moral sense. And the insulting inquiry, ‘where is it?’ implies ‘tis not any where to be found; and signifies a total abolition of it, and, by consequence, must infer that every thing of death besides must, as to them, for ever cease and be no more.
