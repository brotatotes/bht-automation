<p>As to the second clause, in which he triumphs over death and the grave, it is not certain whether he speaks of himself, or whether he meant there also to quote the words of the Prophet. For where we render it, “I will be thy destruction, O death! — thy ruin, O grave<i>!”</i> the Greeks have translated it, “<i>Where, O death, is thy suit?</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(143)</sup></span> <i>where, O grave, thy sting?”</i> Now although this mistake of the Greeks is excusable from the near resemblance of the words, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(144)</sup></span> yet if any one will attentively examine the context, he will see that they have gone quite away from the Prophet’s intention. The true meaning, then, will be this — that the Lord will put an end to death, and destroy the grave. It is possible, however, that, as the Greek translation was in common use, Paul alluded to it, and in that there is nothing inconsistent, though he has not quoted literally, for instead of <i>victory</i> he has used the term <i>action,</i> or <i>law-suit.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(145)</sup></span> I am certainly of opinion, that the Apostle did not deliberately intend to call in the Prophet as a witness, with the view of making a wrong use of his authority, but simply accommodated, in passing, to his own use a sentiment that had come into common use, as being, independently of this, of a pious nature. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(146)</sup></span> The main thing is this — that Paul, by an exclamation of a spirited nature, designed to rouse up the minds of the Corinthians, and lead them on, as it were, to a near view of the resurrection. Now, although we do not as yet behold the victory with our eyes, and the day of triumph has not yet arrived, (nay more, the dangers of war must every day be encountered,) yet the assurance of faith, as we shall have occasion to observe ere long, is not at all thereby diminished. </p>
