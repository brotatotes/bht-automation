<p><b>56.</b><i>The sting of death is sin</i> In other words, “Death has no dart with which to wound us except <i>sin,</i> since <i>death</i> proceeds from the anger of God. Now it is only with our sins that God is angry. Take away sin, therefore, and death will no more be able to harm us.” This agrees with what he said in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:23">Romans 6:23</span>, that <i>the wages of sin is death.</i> Here, however, he makes use of another metaphor, for he compared sin to a <i>sting,</i> with which alone death is armed for inflicting upon us a deadly wound. Let <i>that</i> be taken away, and death is disarmed, so as to be no longer hurtful. Now with what view Paul says this will be explained by him ere long. </p>
<p><i>The strength of sin is the law</i> It is the law of God that imparts to that sting its deadly power, because it does not merely discover our guilt, but even increases it. A clearer exposition of this statement may be found in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:9">Romans 7:9</span>, where Paul teaches us that we <i>are alive,</i> so long as we are <i>without the law,</i> because in our own opinion it is well with us, and we do not feel our own misery, until the law summons us to the judgment of God, and wounds our conscience with an apprehension of eternal death. Farther, he teaches us that sin has been in a manner lulled asleep, but is kindled up by the law, so as to rage furiously. Meanwhile, however, he vindicates the law from calumnies, on the ground that it is <i>holy, and good, and just,</i> and is not of itself the parent of sin or the cause of death. Hence he concludes, that whatever there is of evil is to be reckoned to our own account, inasmuch as it manifestly <i>proceeds</i> from the depravity of our nature. Hence the law is but the <i>occasion</i> of injury. The true <i>cause</i> of ruin is in ourselves. Hence he speaks of the law here as the <i>strength or power of sin</i>, because it executes upon us the judgment of God. In the mean time he does not deny, that sin inflicts death even upon those that know not the law; but he speaks in this manner, because it exercises its tyranny upon them with less violence. For <i>the law came that sin might abound,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:20">Romans 5:20</span>,) or that it <i>might become beyond measure sinful.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:13">Romans 7:13</span>.) </p>
