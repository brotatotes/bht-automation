<p><b>58.</b><i>Wherefore, my brethren</i> Having satisfied himself that he had sufficiently proved the doctrine of the resurrection, he now closes his discussion with an exhortation; and this has much more force, than if he had made use of a simple conclusion with an affirmation. <i>Since your labor,</i> says he, <i>is not in vain in the Lord, be steadfast, and abound in good works</i> Now he says that <i>their labor is not in vain,</i> for this reason, that there is a reward laid up for them with God. This is that exclusive hope which, in the first instance, encourages believers, and afterwards sustains them, so that they do not stop short in the race. Hence he exhorts them to remain <i>steadfast,</i> because they rest on a firm foundation, as they know that a better life is prepared for them in heaven. </p>
<p>He adds — <i>abounding in the work of the Lord;</i> for the hope of a resurrection makes us not be <i>weary</i> in well doing, as he teaches in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+1:10">Colossians 1:10</span>. For amidst so many occasions of offense as constantly present themselves to us, who is there that would not despond, or turn aside from the way, were it not that, by thinking of a better life he is by this means kept in the fear of God? Now, on the other hand, he intimates, that if the hope of a resurrection is taken away, then, the foundation (as it were) being rooted up, the whole structure of piety falls to the ground. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(147)</sup></span> Unquestionably, if the hope of reward is taken away and extinguished, alacrity in running will not merely grow cold, but will be altogether destroyed. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(147)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">D’autant que ceste esperance enest le fondement</span></blu>;” — “Inasmuch as that hope is the foundation of it.” </p>
