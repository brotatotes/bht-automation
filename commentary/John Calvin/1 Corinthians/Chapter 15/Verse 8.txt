<p><b>8.</b><i>Last of all to me, as to one born prematurely,</i> He now introduces himself along with the others, for Christ had manifested himself to him as alive, and invested with glory. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(20)</sup></span> As it was no deceptive vision, it was calculated to be of use <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(21)</sup></span> for establishing a belief in the resurrection, as he also makes use of this argument in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:8">Acts 26:8</span>. But as it was of no small importance that his authority should have the greatest weight and influence among the Corinthians, he introduces, by the way, a commendation of himself personally, but at the same time qualified in such a manner that, while he claims much for himself, he is at the same time exceedingly modest. Lest any one, therefore, should meet him with the objection: “Who art thou that we should give credit to thee?” he, of his own accord, confesses his unworthiness, and, in the first place, indeed he compares himself to one that is <i>born prematurely,</i> and that, in my opinion, with reference to his sudden conversion. For as infants do not come forth from the womb, until they have been there formed and matured during a regular course of time, so the Lord observed a regular period of time in creating, nourishing, and forming his Apostles. Paul, on the other hand, had been cast forth from the womb when he had scarcely received the vital spark. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(22)</sup></span> There are some that understand the term rendered <i>abortive</i> as employed to mean <i>posthumous;</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(23)</sup></span> but the former term is much more suitable, inasmuch as he was in one moment begotten, and born, and a man of full age. Now this premature birth renders the grace of God more illustrious in Paul than if he had by little and little, and by <i>successive</i> steps, grown up to maturity in Christ. </p>

That want, however, was abundantly supplied by the many revelations which his master gave him after he made him an Apostle.” — Ed. </p>
