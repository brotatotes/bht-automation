<p><b>11.</b><i>Let no man, therefore, despise him</i> Here we have a <i>second</i> charge, <i>that they may not despise</i> him — perhaps because he was as yet of a youthful age, which usually draws forth less respect. He wishes them, therefore, to take care, that there be no hinderance in the way of this faithful minister of Christ being held in due esteem — unless, perhaps, it be that Paul reckoned this very thing to be an evidence of contempt, if they were not concerned, as it became them to be, in reference to his life. This injunction, however, appears to include something farther, that they should not undervalue Timothy, from ignorance of his worth. </p>
<p>In the <i>third</i> place, he charges them to <i>conduct him forward in peace,</i> or, in other words, <i>safe from all harm,</i> for <i>peace</i> here means safety. </p>
