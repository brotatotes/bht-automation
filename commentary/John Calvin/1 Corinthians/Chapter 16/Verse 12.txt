<p><b>12.</b><i>As to our brother Apollos.</i> He had succeeded Paul in the work of building up the Corinthians; and hence he has in previous passages ascribed to him the office of <i>watering.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:6">1 Corinthians 3:6</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:1">Acts 19:1</span>.) He now states a reason why he does not come with the others, and he states the reason of this, in order that the Corinthians may not suspect that he had been hindered by him. For the better he was known by them, they were so much the more favourably disposed towards him, and they would be the more ready to conjecture, that matters had been designedly contrived, that he should not go to them, in <i>consequence</i> of offense having been taken. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(167)</sup></span> They might, at least, be prepared to inquire among themselves: “Why has he sent these persons to us rather than Apollos?” He answers, that it was not owing to him, inasmuch as he <i>entreated him;</i> but he promises that he <i>will come as soon as he has opportunity.</i> </p>
