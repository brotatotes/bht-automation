<p><b>13.</b><i>Watch ye</i>. A short exhortation, but of great weight. He exhorts them to <i>watch,</i> in order that Satan may not oppress them, finding them off their guard. For as the warfare is incessant, the <i>watching</i> requires to be incessant too. Now watchfulness of spirit is this — when, free and disentangled from earthly cares, we meditate on the things of God. For as the body is weighed down by <i>surfeiting and drunkenness,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:34">Luke 21:34</span>,) so as to be fit for nothing, so the cares and lusts of the world, idleness or carelessness, are like a spiritual surfeiting that overpowers the mind. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(169)</sup></span> </p>
<p>The <i>second</i> thing is that they <i>persevere in the faith,</i> or that they hold fast the faith, so as to <i>stand firm;</i> because that is the foundation on which we rest. It is certain, however, that he points out the means of perseverance — by resting upon God with a firm faith. </p>
<p>In the <i>third</i> exhortation, which is much of the same nature, he stirs them up to manly fortitude. And, as we are naturally weak, he exhorts them <i>fourthly to</i> strengthen themselves, or gather strength. For where we render it <i>be strong,</i> Paul makes use of only one word, which is equivalent to <i>strengthen yourselves.</i> </p>
