<p><b>2.</b><i>On one of the Sabbaths.</i> The end is this — that they may have their alms ready in time. He therefore exhorts them not to wait till he came, as anything that is done suddenly, and in a bustle, is not done well, but to contribute on the Sabbath what might seem good, and according as every one’s ability might enable — that is, on the day on which they held their sacred assemblies. The clause rendered on <i>one of the Sabbaths, (</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κατὰ μίαν σαββάτων</span></blu></grk> <i>,)</i> Chrysostom explains to mean — <i>the first Sabbath.</i> In this I do not agree with him; for Paul means rather that they should contribute, one on one Sabbath and another on another; or even each of them every Sabbath, if they chose. For he has an eye, first of all, to convenience, and farther, that the sacred assembly, in which the communion of saints is celebrated, might be an additional spur to them. Nor am I more inclined to admit the view taken by Chrysostom — that the term <i>Sabbath</i> is employed here to mean the <i>Lord’s day,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="re+1:10">Revelation 1:10</span>,) for the probability is, that the Apostles, at the beginning, retained the day that was already in use, but that afterwards, constrained by the superstition of the <i>Jews,</i> they set aside that day, and substituted another. Now the <i>Lord’s day</i> was made choice of, chiefly because our Lord’s <i>resurrection</i> put an end to the shadows of the law. Hence the day itself puts us in mind of our Christian liberty. We may, however, very readily infer from this passage, that believers have always had a certain day of rest from labor — not as if the worship of God consisted in idleness, but because it is of importance for the common harmony, that a certain day should be appointed for holding sacred assemblies, as they cannot be held every day. For as to Paul’s forbidding elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:10">Galatians 4:10</span>) that any distinction should be made between one day and another, <i>that</i> must be understood to be with a view to religion, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(150)</sup></span> and not with a view to polity or external order. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(151)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>Treasuring up</i> I have preferred to retain the Greek <i>participle,</i> as it appeared to me to be more emphatic. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(152)</sup></span> For although <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">θησανρίζειν</span></blu></grk> means to <i>lay up,</i> yet in my opinion, he designed to admonish the Corinthians, that whatever they might contribute for the saints would be their best and safest <i>treasure.</i> For if a heathen poet could say — “What riches you give away, those alone you shall always <i>have,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(153)</sup></span> how much more ought that consideration to have influence among us, who are not dependent on the gratitude of men, but have God to look to, who makes himself a debtor in the room of the poor man, to restore to us one day, with large interest, whatever we give away? (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="pr+19:17">Proverbs 19:17</span>.) Hence this statement of Paul corresponds with that saying of Christ — </p>
<p>Lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven, where it will not be exposed either to thieves, or to moths. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:20">Matthew 6:20</span>.) </p>
<p><i>According as he has prospered.</i> Instead of this the old translation has rendered it, <i>What may seem good to him,</i> misled, no doubt, by the resemblance between the word made use of, and another. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(154)</sup></span> Erasmus renders it, <i>What will be convenient.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(155)</sup></span> Neither the one nor the other pleased me, for this reason — that the proper signification of the word brings out a meaning that is much more suitable; for it means — to <i>go on prosperously.</i> Hence he calls every one to consider his ability — “Let every one, according as God hath blessed him, lay out upon the poor from his increase.” </p>
