<p><b>8.</b><i>I will remain.</i> From this statement I have argued above, that this epistle was sent from Ephesus, rather than from Philippi. For the probability is, that the Apostle speaks of the place in which he was at the time, and not of a place, in going to which he would require to make a long circuit; and farther, in passing through Macedonia, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(163)</sup></span> it would have been necessary to leave Corinth when already in the neighborhood of it, and cross the sea in order to reach Ephesus. He accordingly tells them beforehand that he will <i>remain at Ephesus until Pentecost,</i> adding the reason — in order that they may wait for him the more patiently. Erasmus has preferred to render it — <i>until the fiftieth day,</i> influenced by frivolous conjectures rather than by any solid argument. He objects, that there was as yet no day of Pentecost appointed among Christians, as it is now celebrated; and this I grant. He says, that it ought not to be understood as referring to the Jewish solemnity, because in various instances he annuls and condemns the superstitious observance of days. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:10">Galatians 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:5">Romans 14:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+2:16">Colossians 2:16</span>.) I do not concede to him, however, that Paul celebrated that day at Ephesus from being influenced by a superstitious regard to the day, but because there would be a larger assembly at that time, and he hoped that, in that way, an opportunity would be presented to him of propagating the gospel. Thus, when he was hastening forward to Jerusalem, he assigned as the reason of his haste, <i>that he might arrive there at Pentecost,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:16">Acts 20:16</span>;) but while others presented themselves there for the purpose of sacrificing according to the ritual of the law, he himself had another object in view — that his ministry might be the more useful in proportion to the largeness of the attendance. It were, however, an excessively poor meaning to understand Paul here as simply specifying fifty days. Besides, when he expressly says <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὴν πεντηκοστήν</span></blu></grk> <i>(the Pentecost,)</i> he cannot but be understood as speaking of a particular day. As to this festival, see <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+23:16">Leviticus 23:16</span> </p>
