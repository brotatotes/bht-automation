<p><b>9.</b><i>For a great and effectual door is opened to me.</i> He assigns two reasons for remaining for a longer time at Ephesus — 1<sup>st</sup>, Because an opportunity is afforded him there of furthering the gospel; and 2dly, Because, in consequence of the great number of <i>adversaries</i> that were there, his presence was particularly required. “I shall do much good by prolonging my stay here for a little while, and were I absent, Satan would do much injury.” In the first clause, he makes use of a metaphor that is quite in common use, when he employs the term <i>door</i> as meaning <i>an opportunity.</i> For the Lord opened up a way for him for the furtherance of the gospel. He calls this a <i>great</i> door, because he could gain many. He calls it <i>effectual,</i> inasmuch as the Lord blessed his labor, and rendered his doctrine <i>effectual</i> by the power of His Spirit. We see, then, how this holy man <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(164)</sup></span> sought everywhere Christ’s glory, and did not select a place with a view to his own convenience or his own pleasure; but simply looked to this — <i>where</i> he might do most good, and serve his Lord with most abundant fruit; and in addition to this, he did not merely not shrink back from hardships, but presented himself, of his own accord, where he saw that he would have to contend more keenly, and with greater difficulty. For the reason why he <i>remained</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(165)</sup></span> was, that <i>many adversaries</i> were at hand; and the better equipped he was for enduring their assault, he required to be so much the better prepared, and the more resolute. </p>
