<p><b>1.</b><i>And I, when I came</i> Paul having begun to speak of his own method of teaching, had straightway fallen into a discussion as to the nature of gospel preaching generally. Now again he returns to speak of himself, to show that nothing in him was despised but what belonged to the nature of the gospel itself, and did in a manner adhere to it. He allows therefore that he had not had any of the aids of human eloquence or wisdom to qualify him for producing any effect, but while he acknowledges himself to be destitute of such resources, he hints at the inference to be drawn from this — that the power of God shone the more illustriously in his ministry, from its standing in no need of such helps. This latter idea, however, he will be found bringing forward shortly afterwards. For the present he simply grants that he has nothing of human wisdom, and in the meantime reserves to himself this much — that he <i>published the testimony of God</i> Some interpreters, indeed, explain the <i>testimony of God</i> in a passive sense; but as for myself, I have no doubt that another interpretation is more in <i>accordance</i> with the Apostle’s design, so that <i>the testimony of God</i> is that which has come forth from God — the doctrine of the gospel, of which he is the author and witness. He now distinguishes between <i>speech</i> and <i>wisdom</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">λόγον ἀπὸ τὢς σοφίας</span></blu></grk>.) Hence what I noticed before <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(103)</sup></span> is here confirmed — that hitherto he has not been speaking of mere empty prattling, but has included the entire training of human learning. </p>
