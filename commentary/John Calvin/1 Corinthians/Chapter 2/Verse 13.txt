<p><b>13.</b><i>Which things also we speak, not in the learned words, etc</i>. He speaks of himself, for he is still employed in commending his ministry. Now it is a high commendation that he pronounces upon his preaching, when he says of it that it contains a secret revelation of the most important matters — the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, the sum of our salvation, and the inestimable treasures of Christ, that the Corinthians may know how highly it ought to be prized. In the meantime he returns to the concession that he had made before — that his preaching had not been adorned with any glitter of words, and had no luster of elegance, but was contented with the simple doctrine of the Holy Spirit. By <i>the learned words of human wisdom</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(122)</sup></span> he means those that savor of human learning, and are polished according to the rules of the rhetoricians, or blown up with philosophical loftiness, with a view to excite the admiration of the hearers. <i>The words taught by the Spirit,</i> on the other hand, are such as are adapted to a pure and simple style, corresponding to the dignity of the Spirit, rather than to an empty ostentation. For in order that eloquence may not be wanting, we must always take care that the wisdom of God be not polluted with any borrowed and profane luster. Paul’s manner of teaching was of such a kind, that the power of the Spirit shone forth in it single and unattired, without any foreign aid. </p>
<p><i>Spiritual things with spiritual</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Συγκρινεσθαι</span></blu></grk> is used here, I have no doubt, in the sense of <i>adapt</i> This is sometimes the meaning of the word, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(123)</sup></span> (as Budaeus shows by a quotation from Aristotle,)and hence <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">συγκριμα</span></blu></grk> is used to mean what is knit together or glued together, and certainly it suits much better with Paul’s context than <i>compare</i> or <i>liken</i>, as others have rendered it. He says then that he <i>adapts spiritual things to spiritual</i>, in accommodating the words to the subject; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(124)</sup></span> that is, he tempers that heavenly wisdom of the Spirit with a simple style of speech, and of such a nature as carries in its front the native energy of the Spirit. In the meantime he reproves others, who, by an affected elegance of expression and show of refinement, endeavor to obtain the applause of men, as persons who are either devoid of solid truth, or, by unbecoming ornaments, corrupt the spiritual doctrine of God. </p>
