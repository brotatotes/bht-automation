<p><b>16.</b><i>For who hath known</i> ? It is probable that Paul had an eye to what we read in the 40<sup>th</sup> chapter of Isaiah. The Prophet there asks, </p>
<p>Who hath been God’s counselor? Who hath weighed his Spirit, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(142)</sup></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:13">Isaiah 40:13</span>,) </p>
<p>or hath aided him both in the creation of the world and in his other works? and, in fine, who hath comprehended the reason of his works? Now, in like manner Paul, by this interrogation, designs to teach, that his secret counsel which is contained in the gospel is far removed from the understanding of men. This then is a confirmation of the preceding statement. </p>
<p><i>But we have the mind of Christ.</i> It is uncertain whether he speaks of believers universally, or of ministers exclusively. Either of these meanings will suit sufficiently well with the context, though I prefer to view it as referring more particularly to himself and other faithful ministers. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(143)</sup></span> He says, then, that the servants of the Lord are taught by the paramount authority of the Spirit, what is farthest removed from the judgment of the flesh, that they may speak fearlessly as from the mouth of the Lord, — which gift flows out afterwards by degrees to the whole Church. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(142)</span> The expression made use of by Isaiah is, Who hath <i>directed</i> the Spirit of the Lord? Our author, quoting from memory, seems to have had in his eye an expression that occurs in a preceding part of the same passage, “and <i>weighed</i> the mountains in scales.” — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(143)</span> Calvin, when alluding to this passage, as he evidently does in his Commentary on <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:34">Romans 11:34</span>, views the expression, We <i>have the mind of Christ</i>, as applicable to believers universally — “<blu>Nam et Paulus ipso alibi, postquam testatus erat onmia Dei mysteria ingenii nostri captum longe excedere, mox tamen subjicit, fideles tenere mentem Domini: quia non spiritum hujus mundi acceperint, sed a Deo sibi datum, per quem de incomprehensibili alioqui ejus bonitate edocentur</blu>;” — “For even Paul himself, in another place, after testifying that all the mysteries of God far exceed the capacity of our understanding, does nevertheless immediately add, that believers are in possession of the Lord’s mind, because they have received not the spirit of this world, but that which has been given them by God, whereby they are instructed as to his otherwise incomprehensible goodness.” — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
