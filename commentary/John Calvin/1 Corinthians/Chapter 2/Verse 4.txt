<p><b>4.</b><i>And my preaching was not in the persuasive words.</i> By the <i>persuasive words of man’s wisdom</i> he means that exquisite oratory which aims and strives rather by artifice than by truth, and also an appearance of refinement, that allures the minds of men. It is not without good reason, too, that he ascribes persuasiveness (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τό πιθάνον</span></blu></grk>) <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(109)</sup></span> to human wisdom. For the word of the Lord constrains us by its majesty, as if by a violent impulse, to yield obedience to it. Human wisdom, on the other hand, has her allurements, by which she insinuates herself <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(110)</sup></span> and her blandishments, as it were, by which she may conciliate for herself the affections of her hearers. With this he contrasts the <i>demonstration of the Spirit and of power</i>, which most interpreters consider as restricted to miracles; but I take it in a more general sense, as meaning the hand of God powerfully exercised in every way through the instrumentality of the Apostle. <i>Spirit and power</i> he seems to have made use of by hypallage, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(111)</sup></span> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καθ ᾿ ὑπαλλαγὴν</span></blu></grk>,) to denote <i>spiritual power</i>, or at least with the view of showing by signs and effects in what manner the presence of the Spirit had shown itself in his ministry. He appropriately, too, makes use of the term <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀποδείξεως</span></blu></grk>, (<i>demonstration</i>;) for such is our dullness in contemplating the works of God, that when he makes use of inferior instruments, they serve as so many veils to hide from us his influence, so that we do not clearly perceive it. On the other hand, as in the furtherance given to Paul’s ministry, there was no aid furnished from the flesh or the world, and as the hand of God was as it were made bare, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:10">Isaiah 52:10</span>,) his influence was assuredly the more apparent. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(109)</span> This passage has largely exercised the ingenuity of critics, from the circumstance that the adjective <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πειθοῖς</span></blu></grk>, occurring nowhere else in the New Testament, or in any of the writings of classical authors, it is supposed that there has been some corruption of the reading. Some suppose it to be a contraction or corruption of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πείθανοις</span></blu></grk> or <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πίθαςοις</span></blu></grk>, and Chrysostom, in one or two instances, when quoting the passage, uses the adjective <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πίθανοις</span></blu></grk>, while in other cases he has <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πειθοῖς</span></blu></grk> It is perhaps in allusion to those instances in which Chrysostom makes use of the adjective <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πίθαςοις</span></blu></grk>, that Calvin employs the phrase <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">το πίθανον</span></blu></grk> (persuasiveness.) Semler, after adducing various authorities, suggests the following reading: — <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐν πειθοῖ σοφαις</span></blu></grk> taking <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πειθοῖ</span></blu></grk>; as the dative of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἡ πειθω</span></blu></grk>, (persuasion.) Bloomfield considers <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πειθοῖ</span></blu></grk>, to be a highly probable reading, but prefers to retain <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πειθοῖς</span></blu></grk>. — <i>Ed</i> </p>
