<p><b>6.</b><i>We speak wisdom</i> Lest he should appear to despise wisdom, as <i>unlearned and ignorant men</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:13">Acts 4:13</span>) condemn learning with a sort of barbarian ferocity, he adds, that he is not devoid of <i>that</i> wisdom, which was worthy of the name, but was esteemed as such by none but competent judges. By those that were <i>perfect</i>, he means not those that had attained a wisdom that was full and complete, but those who possess a sound and unbiased judgment. For <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">תם</span></blu></heb>, which is always rendered in the Septuagint by <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τελειος</span></blu></grk> means <i>complete</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(112)</sup></span> <i>He</i> twits, however, in passing, those that had no relish for his preaching, and gives them to understand that it was owing to their own fault: “If my doctrine is disrelished by any of you, those persons give sufficient evidence from that very token, that they possess a depraved and vitiated understanding, inasmuch as it will invariably be acknowledged to be the highest wisdom among men of sound intellect and correct judgment.” While Paul’s preaching was open to the view of all, it was, nevertheless, not always estimated according to its value, and this is the reason why he appeals to sound and unbiased judges, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(113)</sup></span> who would declare that doctrine, which the world accounted insipid, to be true wisdom. Meanwhile, by the words <i>we speak</i>, he intimates that he set before them an elegant specimen of admirable wisdom, lest any one should allege that he boasted of a thing unknown. </p>
<p><i>Yet not the wisdom of this world</i> He again repeats by way of anticipation what he had already conceded — that the gospel was not human wisdom, lest any one should object that there were few supporters of that doctrine; nay more, that it was contemned by all that were most distinguished for intellect. Hence he acknowledges of his own accord what might be brought forward by way of objection, but in such a way as not at all to give up his point. </p>
<p><i>The princes of this world</i> By the <i>princes of this world</i> he means those that have distinction in the world through means of any endowment, for sometimes there are persons, who, though they are by no means distinguished by acuteness of intellect, are nevertheless held in admiration from the dignity of the station which they hold. That, however, we may not be alarmed by these imposing appearances, the Apostle adds, that they <i>come to nought</i>, or perish. For it were unbefitting, that a thing that is eternal should depend upon the authority of those who are frail, and fading, and cannot give perpetuity even to themselves: “When the kingdom of God is revealed, let the wisdom of this world retire, and what is transient give place to what is eternal; for the princes of this world have their distinction, but it is of such a nature as is in one moment extinguished. What is this in comparison with the heavenly and incorruptible kingdom of God?” </p>
