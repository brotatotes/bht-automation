<p><b>15.</b><i>If any man’s work shall be burned.</i> It is as though he had said: Let no man flatter himself on the ground that, in the opinion of men, he is reckoned among the most eminent <i>master-builders</i>, for as soon as the day breaks in, his whole work must go utterly to nothing, if it is not approved of by the Lord. This, then, is the rule to which every one’s ministry requires to be conformed. Some explain this of doctrine, so that <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ζημιουσθαι</span></blu></grk> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(181)</sup></span> means simply <i>to perish</i>, and then what immediately follows they view as referring to the foundation, because in the Greek <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">θεμελιος</span></blu></grk> (foundation) is in the masculine gender. They do not, however, sufficiently attend to the entire context. For Paul in this passage subjects to trial, not his own doctrine, but that of others. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(182)</sup></span> Hence it were out of place to make mention at present of the foundation. He has stated a little before, that <i>every man’s work will be tried by fire.</i> He comes afterwards to state an alternative, which ought not to be extended beyond that general observation. Now it is certain that Paul spoke there simply of the structure which had been <i>erected</i> upon the foundation. He has already in the first clause promised a reward to good master-builders, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(183)</sup></span> whose labor shall have been approved of. Hence the contrast in the second clause suits admirably well — that those who have mixed <i>stubble</i>, or <i>wood</i>, or <i>straw</i>, will be disappointed of the commendation which they had expected. </p>
<p>He himself will be saved, etc. It is certain that Paul speaks of those who, while always retaining the foundations, mix hay with gold, stubble with silver, and wood with precious stones — that is, those who build upon Christ, but in consequence of the weakness of the flesh, admit something that is man’s, or through ignorance turn aside to some extent from the strict purity of God’s word. Such were many of the saints, Cyprian, Ambrose, Augustine, and the like. Add to these, if you choose, from those of later times, Gregory and Bernard, and others of that stamp, who, while they had it as their object to build upon Christ, did nevertheless often deviate from the right system of building. Such persons, Paul says, could be saved, but on this condition — if the Lord wiped away their ignorance, and purged them from all dross. </p>
<p>This is the meaning of the clause so as by fire. He means, therefore, to intimate, that he does not take away from them the hope of salvation, provided they willingly submit to the loss of their labor, and are purged by the mercy of God, as gold is refined in the furnace. Farther, although God sometimes purges his own people by afflictions, yet here by the name of fire, I understand the touchstone of the Spirit, by which the Lord corrects and removes the ignorance of his people, by which they were for a time held captive. I am aware, indeed, that, many refer this to the cross, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(184)</sup></span> but I am confident that my interpretation will please all that are of sound judgment. </p>
<p>It remains, that we give an answer in passing to the Papists, who endeavor from this passage to prop up Purgatory. “The sinners <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(185)</sup></span> whom God forgives, pass through the fire, that they may be saved.” Hence they in this way suffer punishment in the presence of God, so as to afford satisfaction to his justice I pass over their endless fictions in reference to the measure of punishment, and the means of redemption from them, but I ask, who they are that pass through the fire? Paul assuredly speaks of ministers alone. “There is the same reason,” they say, “as to all.” It is not for us <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(186)</sup></span> but for God to judge as to this matter. But even granting them this, how childishly they stumble at the term fire. For to what purpose is this fire, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(187)</sup></span> but for burning up the hay and straw, and on the other hand, for proving the gold and silver. Do they mean to say that doctrines are discerned by the fire of their purgatory? Who has ever learned from that, what difference there is between truth and falsehood? Farther, when will that day come that will shine forth so as to discover every one’s work? Did it begin at the beginning of the world, and will it continue without interruption to the end? If the terms stubble, hay, gold, and silver are figurative, as they must necessarily allow, what correspondence will there be between the different clauses, if there is nothing figurative in the term fire? Away, then, with such silly trifles, which carry their absurdity in their forehead, for the Apostle’s true meaning is, I think, sufficiently manifest. </p>
