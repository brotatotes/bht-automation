<p><b>17.</b><i>If any man corrupts the temple of God.</i> He subjoins a dreadful threatening â€” that, as the <i>temple of God</i> ought to be inviolably sacred, that man, whoever he may be, that corrupts it, will not pass with impunity. The kind of profanation of which he now speaks, is, when men intrude themselves, so as to bear rule in the Church in the place of God. For as that faith, which is devoted to the pure doctrine of Christ, is called elsewhere spiritual <i>chastity</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span>,) so it also sanctifies our souls for the right and pure worship of God. For as soon as we are tinctured with the contrivances of men, the temple of God is polluted, as it were, with filth, because the sacrifice of faith, which he claims for himself alone, is in that case offered to creatures. </p>
