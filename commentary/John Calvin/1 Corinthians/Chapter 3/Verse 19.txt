<p><b>19.</b><i>For the wisdom of this world</i> This is an argument taken from things opposite. To maintain the one is to overturn the other. As, therefore, <i>the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God</i>, it follows that we cannot be wise in the sight of God, unless we are fools in the view of the world. We have already explained (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:20">1 Corinthians 1:20</span>) what he means by <i>the wisdom of this world</i>; for natural perspicacity is a gift of God, and the liberal arts, and all the sciences by which wisdom is acquired, are gifts of God. They are confined, however, within their own limits; for into God’s heavenly kingdom they cannot penetrate. Hence they must occupy the place of handmaid, not of mistress: nay more, they must be looked upon as empty and worthless, until they have become entirely subject to the word and Spirit of God. If, on the other hand, they set themselves in opposition to Christ, they must be looked upon as dangerous pests, and, if they strive to accomplish anything of themselves, as the worst of all hindrances. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(198)</sup></span> Hence <i>the wisdom of the world</i>, in Paul’s acceptation, is that which assumes to itself authority, and does not allow itself to be regulated by the word of God, or to be subdued, so as to yield itself up in entire subjection to him. Until, therefore, matters have come to this, that the individual acknowledges that he knows nothing but what he has learned from God, and, giving up his own understanding; resigns himself unreservedly to Christ’s guidance, he is wise in the world’s account, but he is foolish in the estimation of God. </p>
<p><i>For it is written, He taketh the wise</i> He confirms this from <i>two</i> Scripture proofs, the <i>first</i> of which is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="job+5:13">Job 5:13</span>, where the wisdom of God is extolled on this ground, that no wisdom of the world can stand before it. </p>
<p>Now it is certain, that the Prophet speaks there of those that are cunning and crafty; but as the wisdom of man is invariably such without God, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(199)</sup></span> it is with good reason that Paul applies it in this sense, — that whatever wisdom men have of themselves is reckoned of no account in the sight of God. The <i>second</i> is from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+94:11">Psalms 94:11</span>, where David, after claiming for God alone the office and authority of the Instructor of all, adds, that <i>He knows the thoughts of all to be vain.</i> Hence, in whatever estimation they are held by us, they are, in the judgment of God, <i>vain</i> Here we have an admirable passage for bringing down the confidence of the flesh, while God from on high declares that everything that the mind of man conceives and contrives is mere <i>vanity</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(200)</sup></span> </p>
