<p><b>23.</b><i>Christ is God’s</i> This subjection relates to Christ’s humanity, for by taking upon him our flesh, he assumed “the form” and condition “of a servant,” that he might make himself obedient to his Father in all things. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>.) And assuredly, that we may cleave to God through him, it is necessary that he have God as his <i>head</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:3">1 Corinthians 11:3</span>.) We must observe, however, with what intention Paul has added this. For he admonishes us, that the sum of our felicity consists in this, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(204)</sup></span> that we are united to God who is the chief good, and this is accomplished when we are gathered together under the <i>head</i> that our heavenly Father has set over us. In the same sense Christ said to his disciples, </p>
<p>“Ye ought to rejoice, because I go to the Father, <br/>for the Father is greater than I,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:28">John 14:28</span>,) </p>
<p>for there he set himself forth as the medium, through which believers come to the original source of every blessing. It is certain, that those are left destitute of that signal blessing, who depart from the unity of the Head. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(205)</sup></span> Hence this order of things suits the connection of the passage — that those subject themselves to Christ alone, who desire to remain under God’s jurisdiction. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(204)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Car il nous donne a entendre, et remonstre, que le comble et la perfection de nostre felicite consiste la</span></blu>;” — “For he gives us to understand, and shows, that the summit and perfection of our felicity consists in this.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(205)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Qui ne retienent ce seul Chef</span></blu>;” — “Who do not retain that sole Head.” </p>
