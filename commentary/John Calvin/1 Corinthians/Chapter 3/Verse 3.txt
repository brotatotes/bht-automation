<p><b>3.</b><i>For ye are as yet carnal</i> So long as the flesh, that is to say, natural corruption, prevails in a man, it has so completely possession of the man’s mind, that the wisdom of God finds no admittance. Hence, if we would make proficiency in the Lord’s school, we must first of all renounce our own judgment and our own will. Now, although among the Corinthians some sparks of piety were emitted, they were kept under by being choked. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(151)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>For since there are among you.</i> The proof is derived from the effects; for as <i>envying, and strifes, and divisions</i>, are the fruits of the flesh, wherever they are seen, it is certain that the root is there in its rigor. Those evils prevailed among the Corinthians; and accordingly he proves from this that they are <i>carnal</i> He makes use of the same argument, too, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:25">Galatians 5:25</span> <i>If ye live in the Spirit</i>, <i>walk also in the Spirit</i> For while they were desirous to be regarded as spiritual, he calls them to look at their <i>works</i>, by which <i>they denied</i> what with their mouth they <i>professed</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:16">Titus 1:16</span>.) Observe, however, the elegant arrangement that Paul here pursues: for from <i>envying</i> spring up <i>contentions</i>, and these, when they have once been enkindled, break out into deadly sects: but the mother of all these evils is ambition. </p>
<p><i>Walk as men</i> From this it is manifest that the term <i>flesh</i> is not restricted to the lower appetites merely, as the Sophists pretend, the seat of which they call sensuality, but is employed to describe man’s whole nature. For those that follow the guidance of nature, are not governed by the Spirit of God. These, according to the Apostle’s definition, are <i>carnal</i>, so that the flesh and man’s natural disposition are quite synonymous, and hence it is not without good reason that he elsewhere requires that we be <i>new creatures in Christ</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:17">2 Corinthians 5:17</span>.) </p>
