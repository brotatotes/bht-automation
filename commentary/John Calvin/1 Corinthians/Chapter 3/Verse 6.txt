<p><b>6.</b><i>I have planted, Apollos watered</i> He unfolds more clearly the nature of that ministry by a similitude, in which the nature of the word and the use of preaching are most appropriately depicted. That the earth may bring forth fruit, there is need of ploughing and sowing, and other means of culture; but after all this has been carefully done, the husbandman’s labor would be of no avail, did not the Lord from heaven <i>give the increase</i>, by the breaking forth of the sun, and still more by his wonderful and secret influence. Hence, although the diligence of the husbandman is not in vain, nor the seed that he throws in useless, yet it is only by the blessing of God that they are made to prosper, for what is more wonderful than that the seed, after it has rotted, springs up again! In like manner, the word of the Lord is seed that is in its own nature fruitful: ministers are as it were husbandmen, that plough and sow. Then follow other helps, as for example, irrigation. Ministers, too, act a corresponding part when, after casting the seed into the ground, they give help to the earth as much as is in their power, until it bring forth what it has conceived: but as for making their labor actually productive, <i>that</i> is a miracle of divine grace — not a work of human industry. </p>
<p>Observe, however, in this passage, how necessary the preaching of the word is, and how necessary the continuance of it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(158)</sup></span> It were, undoubtedly, as easy a thing for God to bless the earth without diligence on the part of men, so as to make it bring forth fruit of its own accord, as to draw out, or rather press out <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(159)</sup></span> its increase, at the expense of much assiduity on the part of men, and much sweat and sorrow; but as <i>the Lord hath so ordained</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:14">1 Corinthians 9:14</span>) that man should labor, and that the earth, on its part, yield a return to his culture, let us take care to act accordingly. In like manner, it were perfectly in the power of God, without the aid of men, if it so pleased him, to produce faith in persons while asleep; but he has appointed it otherwise, so that faith is produced <i>by hearing</i>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:17">Romans 10:17</span>.) That man, then, who, in the neglect of this means, expects to attain faith, acts just as if the husbandman, throwing aside the plough, taking no care to sow; and leaving off all the labor of husbandry, were to open his mouth, expecting food to drop into it from heaven. </p>
<p>As to <i>continuance</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(160)</sup></span> we see what Paul says here — that it is not enough that the seed be sown, if it is not brought forward from time to time by new helps. He, then, who has already received the seed, has still need of <i>watering</i>, nor must endeavors be left off, until full maturity has been attained, or in other words, till life is ended. Apollos, then, who succeeded Paul in the ministry of the word at Corinth, is said to have <i>watered</i> what he had sown. </p>
