<p><b>7.</b><i>Neither is he that planteth anything</i> It appears, nevertheless, from what has been already said, that their labor is of some importance. We must observe, therefore, why it is that Paul thus depreciates it; and first of all, it is proper to notice that he is accustomed to speak in two different ways of ministers, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(161)</sup></span> as well as of sacraments. For in some cases he views a minister as one that has been set apart by the Lord for, in the first instance, regenerating souls, and, afterwards, nourishing them up unto eternal life, for <i>remitting sins</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:23">John 20:23</span>,) for renewing the minds of men, for raising up the kingdom of Christ, and destroying that of Satan. Viewed in that aspect he does not merely assign to him the duty of <i>planting</i> and <i>watering</i>, but furnishes him, besides, with the efficacy of the Holy Spirit, that his labor may not be in vain. Thus <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(162)</sup></span> in another passage he calls himself a <i>minister of the Spirit</i>, and <i>not of the letter</i>, inasmuch as he writes the word of the Lord on men’s hearts. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>.) </p>
<p>In other cases he views a minister as one that is a servant, not a master — an instrument, not the hand; and in short as man, not God. Viewed in that aspect, he leaves him nothing but his labor, and that, too, dead and powerless, if the Lord does not make it efficacious by his Spirit. The reason is, that when it is simply the ministry that is treated of, we must have an eye not merely to man, but also to God, working in him by the grace of the Spirit — not as though the grace of the Spirit were invariably tied to the word of man, but because Christ puts forth his power in the ministry which he has instituted, in such a manner that it is made evident, that it was not instituted in vain. In this manner he does not take away or diminish anything that belongs to Him, with the view of transferring it to man. For He is not separated from the minister, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(163)</sup></span> but on the contrary His power is <i>declared</i> to be efficacious in the minister. But as we sometimes, in so far as our judgment is depraved, take occasion improperly from this to extol men too highly, we require to distinguish for the purpose of correcting this fault, and we must set the Lord on the one side, and the minister on the other, and then it becomes manifest, how indigent man is in himself, and how utterly devoid of efficacy. </p>
<p>Let it be known by us, therefore, that in this passage ministers are brought into comparison with the Lord, and the reason of this comparison is — that mankind, while estimating grudgingly the grace of God, are too lavish in their commendations of ministers, and in this manner they snatch away what is God’s, with the view of transferring it to themselves. At the same time he always observes a most becoming medium, for when he says, that <i>God giveth the increase,</i> he intimates by this, that the efforts of men themselves are not without success. The case is the same as to the sacraments, as we shall see elsewhere. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(164)</sup></span> Hence, although our heavenly Father does not reject our labor in cultivating his field, and does not allow it to be unproductive, yet he will have its success depend exclusively upon his blessing, that he may have the entire praise. Accordingly, if we are desirous to make any progress in laboring, in striving, in pressing forward, let it be known by us, that we will make no progress, unless he prospers our labors, our strivings, and our assiduity, in order that we may commend ourselves, and everything we do to his grace. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(161)</span> Calvin will be found adverting to the same subject at considerable length, when commenting on <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span>. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(162)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Suyuant ceste consideration</span></blu>;” — “In accordance with this view.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(163)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Car en ces facons de parler Christ n’est point separe du ministre</span></blu>;” — “In these modes of expression Christ is not separated (or viewed apart) from the minister.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(164)</span> Calvin most probably refers here to the statements afterwards made by him, when commenting on <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:27">Galatians 3:27</span>, to the following effect: “<blu>Respondeo, Paulum de Sacramentis bifariam solere loqui. Dum negotium est cum hypocritis, qui nudis signis superbiunt, tum concionatur, quam inanis ac nihili res sit externum signum: et in praeposteram fiduciam fortiter invehitur. Quare? non respicit Dei institutionem, sed impiorum corruptelam. Quum autem fideles alloquitur, qui rite utuntur signis, illa tunc conjungit cum sua veritate, quam figurant. Quare? neque enim fallacem pompam ostentat in Sacramentis, sed quae externa ceremonia figurat, exhibet simul re ipsa. Hinc fit, ut veritas, secundum Dei institutum, conjuncta sit cum signis</blu>;” — “I answer, it is customary with Paul to speak of the Sacraments in two different ways. When he has to do with hypocrites, who glory in mere symbols, he in that case proclaims aloud the emptiness and worthlessness of the outward symbol, and denounces in strong terms their absurd confidence. Why so? It is because he has in view, not the ordinance of God, but the corruption of it by wicked men. When, on the other hand, he addresses believers, who make a proper use of the symbols, he in that case views them in connection with the reality which they represent. Why so? It is because he does not make a show of any false splendor as belonging to the Sacraments, but presents before our view in reality what the outward ceremony represents. Hence it comes that, agreeably to the divine appointment, the reality is associated with the symbols.” The same subject is touched upon in the <i>Institutes</i>, volume 3. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
