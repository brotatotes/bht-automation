<p><b>1.</b><i>Let a man so account of us</i> As it was a matter of no little importance to see the Church in this manner torn by corrupt factions, from the likings or dislikings that were entertained towards individuals, he enters into a still more lengthened discussion as to the ministry of the word. Here there are <i>three</i> things to be considered in their order. In the <i>first</i> place, Paul describes the office of a pastor of the Church. <i>Secondly</i>, he shows, that it is not enough for any one to produce a title, or even to undertake the duty — a faithful administration of the office being requisite. <i>Thirdly</i>, as the judgment formed of him by the Corinthians was preposterous, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(207)</sup></span> he calls both himself and them to the judgment-seat of Christ. In the first place, then, he teaches in what estimation every teacher in the Church ought to be held. In this department he modifies his discourse in such a manner as neither, on the one hand, to lower the credit of the ministry, nor, on the other, to assign to man more than is expedient. For both of these things are exceedingly dangerous, because, when ministers are lowered, contempt of the word arises, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(208)</sup></span> while, on the other hand, if they are extolled beyond measure, they abuse liberty, and become “wanton against the Lord.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:11">1 Timothy 5:11</span>.) Now the medium observed by Paul consists in this, that he calls them <i>ministers of Christ</i>; by which he intimates, that they ought to apply themselves not to their own work but to that of the Lord, who has hired them as his servants, and that they are not appointed to bear rule in an authoritative manner in the Church, but are subject to Christ’s authority <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(209)</sup></span> — in short, that they are servants, not masters. </p>
<p>As to what he adds — <i>stewards of the mysteries of God</i>, he expresses hereby the kind of service. By this he intimates, that their office extends no farther than this, that they are <i>stewards of the mysteries of God</i> In other words, what the Lord has committed to their charge they deliver over to men from hand to hand — as the expression is <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(210)</sup></span> — not what they themselves might choose. “For this purpose has God chosen them as ministers of his Son, that he might through them communicate to men his heavenly wisdom, and hence they ought not to move a step beyond this.” He appears, at the same time, to give a stroke indirectly to the Corinthians, who, leaving in the background the heavenly mysteries, had begun to hunt with excessive eagerness after strange inventions, and hence they valued their teachers for nothing but profane learning. It is an honorable distinction that he confers upon the gospel when he terms its contents <i>the mysteries of God.</i> But as the sacraments are connected with these mysteries as appendages, it follows, that those who have the charge of administering the word are the authorized <i>stewards</i> of them also. </p>
