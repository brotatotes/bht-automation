<p><b>10.</b><i>We are fools for Christ’s sake</i> This contrast is throughout ironical, and exceedingly pointed, it being unseemly and absurd that the Corinthians should be in every respect happy and honorable, according to the flesh, while in the meantime they beheld their master and father afflicted with the lowest ignominy, and with miseries of every kind. For those who are of opinion that Paul abases himself in this manner, in order that he may in earnestness ascribe to the Corinthians those things which he acknowledges himself to be in want of, may without any difficulty be refuted from the little clause that he afterwards subjoins. In speaking, therefore, of the Corinthians as <i>wise in Christ</i>, and <i>strong</i>, and <i>honorable</i>, he makes a concession ironically, as though he had said <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(237)</sup></span> — “You desire, along with the gospel, to retain commendation for <i>wisdom</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(238)</sup></span> whereas I have not been able to preach Christ otherwise than by becoming <i>a fool</i> in this world. Now when I have willingly, on your account, submitted to be <i>a fool</i>, or to be reckoned such, consider whether it be reasonable that you should wish to be esteemed <i>wise.</i> How in these things consort — that I who have been your master, am <i>a fool for Christ’s sake</i>, and you, on the other hand, remain <i>wise</i> !” In this way, <i>being wise in Christ</i> is not taken here in a good sense, for he derides the Corinthians for wishing to mix up together Christ and the wisdom of the flesh, inasmuch as this were to endeavor to unite things directly contrary. </p>
<p>The case is the same as to the subsequent clauses — “You are <i>strong</i> says he, and <i>honorable</i>, that is, you glory in the riches and resources of the world, you cannot endure the ignominy of the cross. In the meantime, is it reasonable that I should be on your account <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(239)</sup></span> mean and contemptible, and exposed to many infirmities? Now the complaint carries with it so much the more reproach <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(240)</sup></span> on this account, that even among themselves he was <i>weak and contemptible</i>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>.) In fine, he derides their vanity in this respect, that, reversing the order of things, those who were sons and followers were desirous to be esteemed <i>honorable</i> and noble, while their father was in obscurity, and was exposed also to all the reproaches of the world. </p>
