<p><b>11.</b><i>For to this hour.</i> The Apostle here describes his condition, as if in a picture, that the Corinthians may learn, from his example, to lay aside that loftiness of spirit, and embrace, as he did, the cross of Christ with meekness of spirit. He discovers the utmost dexterity in this respect, that in making mention of those things which had rendered him contemptible, he affords clear proof of his singular fidelity and indefatigable zeal for the advancement of the gospel; and, on the other hand, he tacitly reproves his rivals, who, while they had furnished no such proof, were desirous, nevertheless, to be held in the highest esteem. In the words themselves there is no obscurity, except that we must take notice of the distinction between those two participles — <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">λοιδορουμενοι και βλασφημουμενοι</span></blu></grk> (<i>reviled</i> and <i>defamed</i>.) As <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">λοιδορια</span></blu></grk> means — that harsher sort of raillery, which does not merely give a person a slight touch, but a sharp bite, and blackens his character by open contumely, there can be no doubt that <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">λοιδορειν</span></blu></grk> means — wounding a person with reproach as with a sting. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(241)</sup></span> I have accordingly rendered it — <i>harassed with revilings</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Βλασφημια</span></blu></grk> signifies a more open reproach, when any one is severely and atrociously slandered. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(242)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(241)</span> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">λοιδορια</span></blu></grk>, is supposed by Eustathius to be derived from <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">λογος</span></blu></grk>, a <i>word</i>, and <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δορυ</span></blu></grk>,<i>a spear</i> A similar figure is employed by the Psalmist, when he speaks of words that are <i>drawn swords</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+55:21">Psalms 55:21</span>.) — <i>Ed</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(242)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Or</span></blu> <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">le premier</span></i></blu> <blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">signifie non seulement se gaudir d’vn homme, mais aussi toucher son honneur comme en le blasonnant, et le naurer en termes picquans: ce que nous disons communement, Mordre en riant.</span></blu> <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Le second</span></i></blu> <blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">signifie quand on detracte apertement de quelqu’vn sans vser de couuerture de paroles</span></blu>;” — “Now <i>the first</i> means not simply to make one’s self merry at another’s expense, but also to touch his reputation, as if with the view of blackening it, and wounding it by cutting expressions, as we commonly say — to give a good humored bite. <i>The second</i> means when persons slander any one openly, without using any disguise of words.” </p>
