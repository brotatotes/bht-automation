<p><b>12.</b>When he says that <i>while persecuted he suffers it,</i> and that he <i>prays</i> for his <i>revilers</i>, he intimates that he is not merely afflicted and abased by God, by means of the cross, but is also endowed with a disposition to abase himself willingly. In this, perhaps, he gives a stroke to the false apostles, who were so effeminate and tender, that they could not bear to be touched even with your little finger. In speaking of their <i>laboring</i> he adds — <i>with our own hands</i>, to express more fully the meanness of his employments <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(243)</sup></span> — “I do not merely gain a livelihood for myself by my own labor, but by mean labor, <i>working with my own hands</i>. ” </p>
