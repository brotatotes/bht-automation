<p><b>16.</b><i>I exhort you.</i> He now expresses also, in his own words, what he requires from them in his fatherly admonition — that, being his sons, they do not degenerate from their father. For what is more reasonable than that sons endeavor to be as like as possible to their father. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(262)</sup></span> At the same time he gives up something in respect of his own right, when he <i>exhorts</i> them to this, by way of entreaty rather than of command. But to what extent he wishes them to be <i>imitators of him</i>, he shows elsewhere, when he adds, <i>as he was of Christ</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:1">1 Corinthians 11:1</span>.) This limitation must always be observed, so as not to follow any man, except in so far as he leads us to Christ. We know what he is here treating of. The Corinthians did not merely shun the abasement of the cross, but they also regarded their <i>father</i> with contempt, on this account, that, forgetting earthly glory, he gloried rather in reproaches for Christ; and they reckoned themselves and others fortunate in having nothing contemptible according to the flesh. He accordingly admonishes them to devote themselves, after his example, to the service of Christ, so as to endure all things patiently. </p>
