<p><b>18.</b><i>As though I would not come to you</i> This is the custom of the false apostles — to take advantage of the absence of the good, that they may triumph and vaunt without any hindrance. Paul, accordingly, with the view of reproving their ill-regulated conscience, and repressing their insolence, tells them, that they cannot endure his presence. It happens sometimes, it is true, that wicked men, on finding opportunity of insulting, rise up openly with an iron front against the servants of Christ, but never do they come forward ingenuously to an equal combat, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(263)</sup></span> but on the contrary, by sinister artifices they discover their want of confidence. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(263)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Si est-ce que jamais ils ne vienent a combatre franchement, et s’ ils ne voyent leur auantage: mats plustot en vsant de ruses et circuits obliques, ils monstrent leur deffiance, et comment ils sont mal asseurez</span></blu>;” — “So it is, that they never come forward frankly to a combat, and unless they have a view to their own advantage; but on the contrary, by making use of tricks and indirect windings, they show their want of confidence, and how distrustful they are.” </p>
