<p><b>19.</b><i>But I will come shortly.</i> “They are in a mistake,” says he, “in raising their crests during my absence, as though this were to be of long duration, for they shall in a short time perceive how vain their confidence has been.” He has it not, however, so much in view to terrify them, as though he would on his arrival thunder forth against them, but rather presses and bears down upon their consciences, for, however they might disguise it, they were aware that he was furnished with divine influence. </p>
<p>The clause, <i>if the Lord will</i>, intimates, that we ought not to promise anything to others as to the future, or to determine with ourselves, without adding this limitation in so far as <i>the Lord will permit</i> Hence James with good reason derides the rashness of mankind (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:15">James 4:15</span>) in planning what they are to do ten years afterwards, while they have not security for living even a single hour. We are not, it is true, bound by a constant necessity to the use of such forms of expression, but it is the better way to accustom ourselves carefully to them, that we may exercise our minds from time to time in this consideration — that all our plans must be in subjection to the will of God. </p>
<p><i>And I will know not the speech</i> By <i>speech</i> you must understand that prating in which the false apostles delighted themselves, for they excelled in a kind of dexterity and gracefulness of speech, while they were destitute of the zeal and efficacy of the Spirit. By the term <i>power</i>, he means that spiritual efficacy, with which those are endowed who dispense the word of the Lord with earnestness. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(264)</sup></span> The meaning, therefore, is: “I shall see whether they have so much occasion for being puffed up; and I shall not judge of them by their mere outward talkativeness, in which they place the sum-total <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(265)</sup></span> of their glory, and on the ground of which they claim for themselves every honor. If they wish to have any honor from me, they must bring forward that <i>power</i> which distinguishes the true servants of Christ from the merely pretended: otherwise I shall despise them, with all their show. It is to no purpose, therefore, that they confide in their eloquence, for I shall reckon it nothing better than smoke.” </p>
