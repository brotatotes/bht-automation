<p><b>20.</b><i>For the kingdom of God is not in word</i> As the Lord governs the Church by his word, as with a scepter, the administration of the gospel is often called <i>the kingdom of God</i> Here, then, we are to understand <i>by the kingdom of God</i> whatever tends in this direction, and is appointed for this purpose — that God may reign among us. He says that this kingdom does not consist in <i>word</i>, for how small an affair is it for any one to have skill to prate eloquently, while he has nothing but empty tinkling. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(266)</sup></span> Let us know, then, a mere outward gracefulness and dexterity in teaching is like a body that is elegant and of a beautiful color, while the <i>power</i> of which Paul here speaks is like the soul. <i>We</i> have already seen that the preaching of the gospel is of such a nature, that it is inwardly replete with a kind of solid majesty. This majesty shows itself, when a minister strives by means of <i>power</i> rather than of <i>speech</i> — that is, when he does not place confidence in his own intellect, or eloquence, but, furnished with spiritual armor, consisting of zeal for maintaining the Lord’s honor — eagerness for the raising up of Christ’s kingdom — a desire to edify — the fear of the Lord — an invincible constancy — purity of conscience, and other necessary endowments, he applies himself diligently to the Lord’s work. Without this, preaching is dead, and has no strength, with whatever beauty it may be adorned. Hence in his second epistle, he says, that in Christ nothing avails but <i>a new creature</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:17">2 Corinthians 5:17</span>) — a statement which is to the same purpose. For he would have us not rest in outward masks, but depend solely on the internal <i>power</i> of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p>But while in these words he represses the ambition of the false apostles, he at the same time reproves the Corinthians for their perverted judgment, in measuring the servants of Christ by what holds the lowest place among their excellences. Here we have a remarkable statement, and one that is not less applicable to us than to them. As to our gospel, of which we are proud, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(267)</sup></span> where is it in most persons except in the tongue? Where is newness of life? Where is spiritual efficacy? Nor is it so among the people merely. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(268)</sup></span> On the contrary, how many there are, who, while endeavoring to procure favor and applause from the gospel, as though it were some profane science, aim at nothing else than to speak with elegance and refinement! I do not approve of restricting the term <i>power</i> to miracles, for from the contrast we may readily gather that it has a more extensive import. </p>
