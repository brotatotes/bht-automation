<p><b>8.</b><i>Now ye are full</i> Having in good earnest, and without the use of any figure, beat down their vain confidence, he now also ridicules it by way of irony, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(230)</sup></span> because they are so self-complacent, as if they were the happiest persons in the world. He proceeds, too, step by step, in exposing their insolence. In the first place, he says, that they were<i>full</i>: this refers to the past. He then adds, <i>Ye are rich</i>: this applies to the future. <i>Lastly</i>, he says, that they had <i>reigned as kings</i> this is much more than either of those two. It is as though he had said, “<i>What</i> will you attain to, when you appear to be not merely <i>full</i> for the present, but are also <i>rich</i> for the future — nay more, are <i>kings</i> ?<i>”</i> At the same time, he tacitly upbraids them with ingratitude, because they had the audacity to despise <i>him</i>, or rather <i>those</i>, through means of whom they had obtained everything. </p>
<p><i>Without us,</i> says he. “For Apollos and I are now esteemed nothing by you, though it is by our instrumentality that the Lord has conferred everything upon you. What inhumanity there is in resting with self-complacency in the gifts of God, while in the meantime you despise those through whose instrumentality you obtained them!” </p>
<p><i>And I would to God that ye did reign</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(231)</sup></span> Here he declares that he does not envy their felicity, (if indeed they have any,) and that from the beginning he has not sought to <i>reign</i> among them, but only to bring them to the kingdom of God. He intimates, however, on the other hand, that the kingdom in which they gloried was merely imaginary, and that their glorying was groundless and pernicious, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(232)</sup></span> there being no true glorying but that which is enjoyed by all the sons of God in common, under Christ their Head, and every one of them according to the measure of the grace that has been given him. </p>
<p>For by these words <i>that ye also may reign with us,</i> he means this — “You are so renowned in your own opinion that you do not hesitate to despise me, and those like me, but mark, how vain is your glorying. For you can have no glorying before God, in which we have not a share — for if honor redounds to you from having the gospel of God, how much more to us, by whose ministry it was conveyed to you! And assuredly, this is a madness <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(233)</sup></span> that is common to all the proud, that by drawing everything to themselves, they strip themselves of every blessing — nay more, they renounce the hope of everlasting salvation.” </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(231)</span> “A bitter taunt,” says <i>Lightfoot</i>, “chastising the boasting of the Corinthians, who had forgot from whom they had first received those evangelical privileges, concerning which they now prided themselves. They were enriched with spiritual gifts; they reigned, themselves being judges, in the very top of the dignity and happiness of the gospel; and that, ‘<i>without us</i>, ’ saith the Apostle, ‘as though ye owed nothing to us for these privileges,’ and, ‘O <i>would to God ye did reign</i>, and that it went so happily and well with you indeed, that we also might reign with you, and that we might partake of some happiness in this your promotion, and might be of some account among you!’” — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
