<p><b>9.</b><i>For I think</i>, etc. It is uncertain whether he speaks of himself exclusively, or takes in at the same time Apollos and Silvanus, for he sometimes calls such persons apostles. I prefer, however, to understand it of himself exclusively. Should any one be inclined to extend it farther, I shall have no particular objection, provided only he does not understand it as Chrysostom does, to mean that the apostles were as if for the sake of ignominy reserved to the last place. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(234)</sup></span> For there can be no doubt that by the term <i>last</i>, he means those who were admitted to the rank of apostles subsequently to the resurrection of Christ. Now, he admits that he is like those who are exhibited to the people when on the eve of being led forth to death. For such is the meaning of the word <i>exhibited</i> — <i>as</i> those who on occasion of a triumph were led round <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(235)</sup></span> for the sake of show, and were afterwards hurried away to prison to be strangled. </p>
<p>This he expresses more distinctly by adding, that they <i>were made a spectacle</i>. “This,” says he, “is my condition, that I exhibit to the world a spectacle of my miseries, like those who having been condemned to fight with wild beasts, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(236)</sup></span> or to the games of the gladiators, or to some other mode of punishment, are brought forth to the view of the people, and that not before a few spectators, but before the whole <i>world</i>. ” Observe here the admirable steadfastness of Paul, who, while he saw himself to be dealt with by God in this manner, was nevertheless not broken or dispirited. For he does not impute it to the wantonness of the wicked, that he was, as it were, led forth with ignominy to the sport of the arena, but ascribes it wholly to the providence of God. </p>
<p>The second clause <i>to angels and to men</i>, I take to be expository in this sense — “I am made a sport and spectacle, not merely to earth, but also to heaven.” This passage has been commonly explained as referring to devils, from its seeming to be absurd to refer it to good angels. Paul, however, does not mean, that all who are witnesses of this calamity are gratified with such a <i>spectacle</i> He simply means, that the Lord has so ordered his lot that he seems as though he had been appointed to furnish sport to the whole world. </p>
