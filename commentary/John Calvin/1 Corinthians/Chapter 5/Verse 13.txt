<p><b>13.</b><i>Put away that wicked person.</i> This is commonly explained as referring to the person who was guilty of an illicit connection with his mother-in-law. For as to those who understand the expression to mean — “Put away <i>evil</i> or <i>wickedness</i>, ” they are refuted by the Greek words made use of by Paul, the article (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὸν</span></blu></grk>) being in the masculine gender, But what if you should view it as referring to the devil, who, undoubtedly in the person of a wicked and unprincipled man, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(309)</sup></span> is encouraged to establish his throne among us? For <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὁ πονηρος</span></blu></grk> (the wicked one) taken simply and without any addition, denotes the prince of all crimes, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(310)</sup></span> rather than some wicked man. If this meaning is approved of, Paul shows how important it is <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(311)</sup></span> not to tolerate wicked persons, as by this means Satan is expelled from his kingdom which he keeps up among us, when indulgence is given to the wicked. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(312)</sup></span> If any one, however, prefers to understand it as referring to a <i>man</i>, I do not oppose it. Chrysostom compares the rigor of the law with the mildness of the gospel, inasmuch as Paul was satisfied with excommunication in case of an offense for which the law required the punishment of death, but for this there is no just ground. For Paul is not here addressing judges that are armed with the sword, but an unarmed multitude <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(313)</sup></span> that was allowed merely to make use of brotherly correction. </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(310)</span> It is well observed by Witsius in his Dissertations on the Lord’s Prayer, (Biblical Cabinet, No. 24,) that the appellation of <i>the evil One</i> is properly applied to Satan, “because he does nothing but what is evil — because all the evil that exists in the universe originated with him — because in doing evil, and in persuading others to do evil, he finds his only delight, the wicked and malignant solace of his desperate misery.” — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
