<p><b>13.</b><i>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats</i> Here he shows what use ought to be made of outward things — for the necessity of the present life, which passes away quickly as a shadow, agreeably to what, he says afterwards. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:29">1 Corinthians 7:29</span>.) <i>We must use this world so as not to abuse it</i> And hence, too, we infer, how improper it is for a Christian man to contend for outward things. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(350)</sup></span> When a dispute, therefore, arises respecting corruptible things, a pious mind will not anxiously dwell upon these things; for liberty is one thing — the use of it is another. This statement accords with another — that </p>
<p>The kingdom of God is not meat and drink. <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>.) </p>
<p><i>Now the body is not for fornication</i> Having mentioned the exceptions, he now states still farther, that our liberty ought not by any means to be extended to <i>fornication</i> For it was an evil that was so prevalent at that time, that it seemed in a manner as though it had been permitted; as we may see also from the decree of the Apostles, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:20">Acts 15:20</span>,) where, in prohibiting the Gentiles from fornication, they place it among things indifferent; for there can be no doubt that this was done, because it was very generally looked upon as a lawful thing. Hence Paul says now, There is a difference between <i>fornication</i> and <i>meats</i>, for the Lord has not ordained <i>the body for fornication</i>, as he has <i>the belly for meats</i> And this he confirms from things contrary or opposite, inasmuch as it is consecrated to Christ, and it is impossible that Christ should be conjoined with fornication. What he adds — <i>and the Lord for the body</i>, is not without weight, for while God the Father has united us to his Son, what wickedness there would be in tearing away our body from that sacred connection, and giving it over to things unworthy of Christ. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(351)</sup></span> </p>
