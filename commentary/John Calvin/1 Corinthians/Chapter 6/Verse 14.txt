<p><b>14.</b><i>And God hath also raised up the Lord</i> He shows from Christ’s condition how unseemly fornication is for a Christian man; for Christ having been <i>received</i> into the heavenly glory, what has he in common with the pollutions of this world? <i>Two</i> things, however, <i>are</i> contained in these words. The <i>first</i> is, that it is unseemly and unlawful, that our body, which is consecrated to Christ, should be profaned by fornication, inasmuch as Christ himself has been raised up from the dead, that he might enter on the possession of the heavenly glory. The <i>second</i> is, that it is a base thing to prostitute our body <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(352)</sup></span> to earthly pollutions, while it is destined to be a partaker <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(353)</sup></span> along with Christ of a blessed immortality and of the heavenly glory. There is a similar statement in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+3:1">Colossians 3:1</span>, <i>If we have risen with Christ</i>, etc., with this difference, that he speaks here of the <i>last</i> resurrection only, while in that passage he speaks of the <i>first</i> also, or in other words, of the grace of the Holy Spirit, by which we are fashioned again to a new life. As, however, the resurrection is a thing almost <i>incredible</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:8">Acts 26:8</span>) to the human mind, when the Scripture makes mention of it, it reminds us of <i>the power of God</i>, with the view of confirming our faith in it. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:29">Matthew 22:29</span>.) </p>
