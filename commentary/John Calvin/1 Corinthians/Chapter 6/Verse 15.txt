<p><b>15.</b><i>Know ye not that our bodies are the members</i>, etc. Here we have an explanation, or, if you prefer it, an amplification of the foregoing statement. For that expression, <i>the body is for the Lord</i>, might, owing to its brevity, be somewhat obscure.

Otherwise the hope of a resurrection were weak, if our connection were not of that nature — full and complete. </p>
