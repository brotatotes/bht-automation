18.Flee fornication Every sin, etc. Having set before us honorable conduct, he now shows how much we ought to abhor fornication, setting before us the enormity of its wickedness and baseness. Now he shows its greatness by comparison — that this sin alone, of all sins, puts a brand of disgrace upon the body. The body, it is true, is defiled also by theft, and murder, and drunkenness, in accordance with those statements — Your hands are defiled with blood. (Isaiah 1:15.) You have yielded your members instruments of iniquity unto sin, (Romans 6:19,) and the like. Hence some, in order to avoid this inconsistency, understand the words rendered against his own body, as meaning against us, as being connected with Christ; but this appears to me to be more ingenious than solid. Besides, they do not escape even in this way, because that same thing, too, might be affirmed of idolatry equally with fornication. For he who prostrates himself before an idol, sins against connection with Christ. Hence I explain it in this way, that he does not altogether deny that there are other vices, in like manner, by which our body is dishonored and disgraced, but that his meaning is simply this — that defilement does not attach itself to our body from other vices in the same way (361) as it does from fornication My hand, it is true, is defiled by theft or murder, my tongue by evil speaking, or perjury, (362) and the whole body by drunkenness; but fornication leaves a stain impressed upon the body, such as is not impressed upon it from other sins. According to this comparison, or, in other words, in the sense of less and more, other sins are said to be without the body — not, however, as though they do not at all affect the body, viewing each one by itself. (361) “N’en demeure point tellement imprimee en nostre corps;” — “Does not remain impressed upon our body in the same way.” (362) “Par mesdisance, detraction, et periure;” — “By evil-speaking, detraction, and perjury.”
