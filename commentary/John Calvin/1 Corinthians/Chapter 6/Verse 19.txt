<p><b>19.</b><i>Know ye not that your body</i> He makes use of two additional arguments, in order to deter us from this filthiness. <i>First</i>, That <i>our bodies are temples of the Spirit</i>; and, <i>secondly</i>, that <i>the Lord has bought us to himself as his property.</i> There is an emphasis implied in the term <i>temple</i>; for as the Spirit of God cannot take up his abode in a place that is profane, we do not give him a habitation otherwise than by consecrating ourselves to him as <i>temples</i> It is a great honor that God confers upon us when he <i>desires to dwell</i> in us. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+132:14">Psalms 132:14</span>.) Hence we ought so much the more to fear, lest he should depart from us, offended by our sacrilegious actings. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(363)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>And ye are not your own.</i> Here we have a <i>second</i> argument — that we are not at our own disposal, that we should live according to our own pleasure. He proves this from the fact that the Lord has purchased us for himself, by paying the price of our redemption. There is a similar statement in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:9">Romans 14:9</span> </p>
<p>To this end Christ died and rose again, that he might be Lord of the living and the dead. </p>
<p>Now the word rendered <i>price</i> may be taken in two ways; either simply, as we commonly say of anything that it has cost a price, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(364)</sup></span> when we mean that it has not been got for nothing; or, as used instead of the adverb <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τιμίως</span></blu></grk> <i>at a dear rate</i>, as we are accustomed to say of things that have cost us much. This latter view pleases me better. In the same way Peter says, </p>
<p>Ye are redeemed, not with gold and silver, but with the precious <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(365)</sup></span> blood of the Lamb, without spot. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18">1 Peter 1:18</span>.) </p>
<p>The sum is this, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(366)</sup></span> that redemption must hold us bound, and with a bridle of obedience restrain the lasciviousness of our flesh. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(363)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Par nos vilenies plenes de sacrilege</span></blu>;” — “By our defilements, full of sacrilege.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(364)</span> Thus, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐξευρίσκειν</span></blu></grk>, is employed by classical writers to mean — getting a thing <i>at a price</i>, that is, at a high price. See Herod. 7. 119. — <i>Ed</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(365)</span> Our Author has very manifestly in his eye the epithet <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τιμίος</span></blu></grk>, (precious,) as made use of by the Apostle Peter, in reference to the blood of Christ — <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τιμίῳ αἱματι, ὡς ἀμνου ἀμώμου κ. τ. λ.</span></blu></grk> — “precious blood, as of a Lamb without blemish,” etc. — <i>Ed</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(366)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Le sommaire et la substance du propos revient la</span></blu>;” — “The sum and substance of the discourse amount to this.” </p>
