<p><b>3.</b><i>Know ye not that we shall judge angels</i> ? This passage is taken in different ways. Chrysostom states that some understood it as referring to priests, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(325)</sup></span> but this is exceedingly far-fetched. Others understand it of the angels in heaven, in this sense — that the angels are subject to the judgment of God’s word, and may be judged by us, if need be, by means of that word, as it is said in the Epistle to the Galatians — </p>
<p>If an angel from heaven bring any other gospel, let him be accursed. <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span>.) </p>
<p>Nor does this exposition appear at first view unsuitable to the thread of Paul’s discourse; for if all whom God has enlightened by his word are endowed with such authority, that through means of that word they judge not only men but angels too, how much more will they be prepared to judge of small and trivial matters? As, however, Paul speaks here in the future tense, as referring to the last day, and as his words convey the idea of an actual judgment, (as the common expression is,) it were preferable, in my opinion, to understand him as speaking of apostate <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(326)</sup></span> angels. For the argument will be not less conclusive in this way: “Devils, who sprang from so illustrious an origin, and even now, when they have fallen from their high estate, are immortal creatures, and superior to this corruptible world, shall be judged by us. What then? Shall those things that are subservient to the belly be exempted from our judgment? </p>
