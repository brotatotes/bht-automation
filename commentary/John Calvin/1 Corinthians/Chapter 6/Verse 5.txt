<p><b>5.</b><i>I speak to your shame</i> The meaning is — “If other considerations do not influence you, let it at least be considered by you, how disgraceful it is to you that <i>there is not so much as one among you</i> who is qualified to settle an affair amicably among <i>brethren</i> — an honor which you assign to <i>unbelievers</i> Now this passage is not inconsistent with the declaration which we met with above, when he stated that he did not make mention of their faults with the view of <i>shaming them</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:14">1 Corinthians 4:14</span>,) for instead of this, by putting them to <i>shame</i> in this manner, he calls them back from disgrace, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(331)</sup></span> and shows that he is desirous to promote their honor. He does not wish them, then, to form so unfavorable an opinion of their society, as to take away from all their <i>brethren</i> an honor which they allow to<i>unbelievers</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(331)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Il les garde de tomber en reproche</span></blu>;” — “He guards them against falling into reproach.” </p>
