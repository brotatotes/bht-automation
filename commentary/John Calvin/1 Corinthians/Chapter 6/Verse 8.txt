<p><b>8.</b><i>But ye do injury.</i> Hence we see for what reason he has inveighed against them with so much bitterness â€” because there prevailed among them such a base desire of gain, that they did not even refrain from <i>injuring</i> one another. He premised a little before, with the view of exposing the magnitude of the evil, that those are not Christians who know not to endure injuries. There is, then, an amplification here, founded on a comparison: for if it is wrong not to <i>bear</i> injuries patiently, how much worse is it to <i>inflict</i> them? </p>
<p><i>And that your brethren</i> Here is another aggravation of the evil; for if those are doubly culpable who defraud strangers, it is monstrous for <i>brother</i> to be cheated or despoiled by <i>brother</i> Now all of us are brethren that call upon <i>one Father in heaven</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:9">Matthew 23:9</span>.) At the same time, if any one acts an unprincipled part towards strangers, Paul does not palliate the crime; but he teaches that the Corinthians were utterly blinded in making sacred brotherhood a matter of no moment. </p>
