<p><b>17.</b><i>Unless every one, according as God has dispensed his grace,</i> etc. Such is the literal meaning: only I have in my rendering made use of the nominative, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(405)</sup></span> in order that the connection may be more easy and natural. The meaning is: “What, then, is to be done, <i>unless</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(406)</sup></span> that every one walk according to the grace given to him, and according to his calling? Let every one, therefore, labor for this, and use his endeavor, that he may do good to his neighbors, and, more especially, when he ought to be excited to it by the particular duty of his calling.” He mentions two things — the <i>calling</i>, and <i>the measure of grace</i> These he desires us to look to in deliberating as to this matter; as it ought to be no small stimulus to us to duty, that God condescends to make us ministers of his grace for the salvation of our brethren; while the <i>calling</i>, on the other hand, should hold us, as it were, under God’s yoke, even where an individual feels his situation to be an unpleasant one. </p>
<p><i>And so in all the Churches.</i> I am of opinion that he added this, with the view of obviating the calumnies of some who boasted that he assumed more authority over the Corinthians than he ventured to do over others. At the same time he might have also another end in view — that this doctrine might have the more weight, when the Corinthians understood that it was already published <i>in all the Churches.</i> For we embrace the more readily what we understand that we have in common with all the pious. The Corinthians, on the other hand, would have felt it hateful to be bound more closely than others. </p>
