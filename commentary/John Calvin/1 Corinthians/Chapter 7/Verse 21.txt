<p><b>21.</b><i>Art thou called being a servant</i> ? We see here that Paul’s object <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(412)</sup></span> is to satisfy their consciences; for he exhorts servants to be of good cheer, and not be cast down, as if servitude were a hinderance in the way of their serving God. <i>Care not for it then</i>, that is to say, be not concerned how you may throw off the yoke, as if it were a condition unbecoming a Christian, but be contented in mind. And hence we infer, not merely that it is owing to the providence of God that there are different ranks and stations in the world, but also, that a regard to them is enjoined by his word. </p>
<p><i>But if thou mayest even be made free</i> The particle <i>even</i> (in my opinion) has simply this force, — “If, in place of servitude, you could attain <i>even</i> to liberty, it would be more advantageous for you.” It is uncertain, however, whether he continues his discourse to servants, or turns to address those that are free. In the latter case,<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">γενέσθαι</span></blu></grk> would here mean simply <i>to be</i> Either meaning suits sufficiently well, and they amount to the same thing. He means to intimate, that liberty is not merely good, but also more advantageous than servitude. If he is speaking to <i>servants</i>, his meaning will be this — While I exhort you to be free from anxiety, I do not hinder you from <i>even</i> availing yourselves of liberty, if an opportunity presents itself to you. If he is addressing himself to those that are <i>free</i>, it will be a kind of concession, as though he had said — I exhort servants to be of good courage, though a state of freedom is preferable, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(413)</sup></span> and more to be desired, if one has it in his choice. </p>
