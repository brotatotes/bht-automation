<p><b>28.</b><i>But if thou shouldest even marry.</i> As there was a danger of one’s thinking from the preceding statement, that he tempted God, if he knowingly and willingly bound himself to marriage, (as that would be to renounce his liberty,) he removes this scruple; for he gives liberty to widows to marry, and says, that those that marry do not sin. The word <i>even</i> also seems to be emphatic — to intimate, that even though there be no positive necessity urging to it, the unmarried are not prohibited from marrying whenever they may see fit. </p>
<p><i>And if a virgin marry</i> Whether this is an amplification, or simply an illustration, this, in the first place, is beyond all controversy, that Paul designed to extend the liberty of marriage to all. Those who think that it is an amplification, are led to think so by this, that it seems to approach nearer to a fault, and is more open to reprehension, or at least has more occasion of shame, to loose the virgin girdle (as the ancients express themselves) than, upon the death of a husband, to enter into a second marriage. The argument then would be this: “If it is lawful for a virgin to marry, much more may widows.” I am rather of opinion, that he makes both equal in this way: “As it is allowable for a virgin, so is it for widows also.” For second marriages among the ancients were not without some mark of reproach, as they adorned those matrons, who had contented themselves with one marriage during their whole life, with a chaplet of chastity <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(420)</sup></span> — an honor that tended to reflect reproach upon those that had married repeatedly. And it is a well known saying of Valerius, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(421)</sup></span> that “it betokens a legitimate excess <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(422)</sup></span> when a second marriage is desired.” The Apostle, therefore, makes virgins and widows alike as to liberty of marriage. </p>
<p><i>Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh</i>. He frequently repeats the reason why he leans more to the side of celibacy in his exhortations, lest he should seem to prefer the one condition to the other on its own account, rather than on account of its consequences. He says, that there are many troubles that are connected with the married life, and that on that account he wishes all to be free from marriage, who desire to be exempt from troubles. When he says, that they will have <i>trouble of the flesh</i>, or <i>in the flesh</i>, he means, that the anxieties and distresses in which married persons are involved arise from the affairs of the world. The <i>flesh</i>, therefore, is taken here to mean the outward man. To <i>spare</i> means to <i>indulge</i>, or to wish them to be exempted from the troubles that are connected with marriage. “I am desirous to make provision for your infirmity, that you may not have trouble: now marriage brings with it many troubles. This is the reason why I should wish you not to require to marry — that you may be exempt from all its evils.” Do not, however, infer from this that Paul reckons marriage to be a necessary evil for those troubles of which he speaks do not arise so much from the nature of marriage, as from the corruption of it, for they are the fruits of original sin. </p>
