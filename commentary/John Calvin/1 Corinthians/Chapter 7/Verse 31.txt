31.And they that use this world In the first clause there is the participle χρώμενοι (using,) in the second, there is a compound of it — καταχρώμενοι (abusing.) Now the preposition κατα in a compound state is generally taken in a bad sense, or at least denotes intensity. (426) Paul, therefore, directs us to a sober and frugal use of things, such as may not impede or retard our course, but may allow of our always hastening forward toward the goal. For the fashion of this world passeth away By the term here used, the Apostle has elegantly expressed the vanity of the world. “There is nothing,” says he, “that is firm or solid; (427) for it is a mere show or outward appearance, as they speak.” He seems, however, to have had an allusion to theatrical representations, in which, on the curtain being drawn up in a single moment, a new appearance is presented, and those things that held the eyes of the spectators in astonishment, are immediately withdrawn from their view. I do not see why it is that Erasmus has preferred the term habitus (form.) He certainly, in my opinion, obscures Paul’s doctrine; for the term fashion is tacitly opposed to substance. (428) (426) “Tellement que le mot signifie yci, Abusans, ou Vsans trop;” — “So that the word means here abusing, or using too much.” The verb καταχράομαι, is frequently made use of by classical writers to mean using to the uttermost, using up, or misusing See Dem 430, 10, and Lys 153, 46. — Ed (427) “En ce monde;” — “In this world.” (428) “Comme s’il disoit, que ce monde n’ha point vn estre, mais seulement vne monstre et vaine apparence;” — “As if he had said, that this world has not an existence, but only a show and mere appearance.”
