<p><b>31.</b><i>And they that use this world</i> In the <i>first</i> clause there is the participle <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χρώμενοι</span></blu></grk> (<i>using</i>,) in the <i>second</i>, there is a compound of it — <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καταχρώμενοι</span></blu></grk> (<i>abusing</i>.) Now the preposition <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κατα</span></blu></grk> in a compound state is generally taken in a bad sense, or at least denotes intensity. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(426)</sup></span> Paul, therefore, directs us to a sober and frugal use of things, such as may not impede or retard our course, but may allow of our always hastening forward toward the goal. </p>
<p><i>For the fashion of this world passeth away</i> By the term here used, the Apostle has elegantly expressed the vanity of the world. “There is nothing,” says he, “that is firm or solid; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(427)</sup></span> for it is a mere show or outward appearance, as they speak.” He seems, however, to have had an allusion to theatrical representations, in which, on the curtain being drawn up in a single moment, a new appearance is presented, and those things that held the eyes of the spectators in astonishment, are immediately withdrawn from their view. I do not see why it is that Erasmus has preferred the term <blu><i>habitus</i></blu> (form.) He certainly, in my opinion, obscures Paul’s doctrine; for the term <i>fashion</i> is tacitly opposed to substance. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(428)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(426)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Tellement que le mot signifie yci, Abusans, ou Vsans trop</span></blu>;” — “So that the word means here abusing, or using too much.” The verb <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καταχράομαι</span></blu></grk>, is frequently made use of by classical writers to mean <i>using to the uttermost</i>, <i>using up</i>, or <i>misusing</i> See <i>Dem</i> 430, 10, and <i>Lys</i> 153, 46. — <i>Ed</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(427)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">En ce monde</span></blu>;” — “In this world.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(428)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Comme s’il disoit, que ce monde n’ha point vn estre, mais seulement vne monstre et vaine apparence</span></blu>;” — “As if he had said, that this world has not an existence, but only a show and mere appearance.” </p>
