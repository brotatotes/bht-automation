<p><b>35.</b><i>And this for your benefit.</i> Observe the Apostle’s moderation. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(436)</sup></span> Though he knew the vexations, troubles, and difficulties of the married life, and, on the other hand, the advantages of celibacy, yet he does not venture to prescribe. On the contrary, having commended celibacy, and being afraid that some of his readers might be led away by such commendations, and might straightway say within themselves what the Apostles said in reply to Christ — <i>It is good</i>, <i>therefore</i>, <i>so to be</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:10">Matthew 19:10</span>) <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(437)</sup></span> — not in the meantime taking into view their ability, he here declares in express terms, that he points out, indeed, what is most advantageous, but does not wish to impose a necessity upon any one. </p>
<p>And here you have two things worthy of observation. The <i>first</i> is, for what purpose celibacy is to be desired — not on its own account, nor on the ground of its being a state that is nearer to perfection, but that we may cleave to God without distraction — <i>that</i> being the one thing that a Christian man ought exclusively to look to during his whole life. The <i>second</i> thing is, that no snare must be put upon men’s consciences, so as to keep back any one from marriage, but that every one must have liberty allowed him. It is well known what grievous errors have been fallen into on both these points. As to the <i>second</i> point, those assuredly have been bolder than Paul, who have not shrunk from passing a law respecting celibacy, with the view of prohibiting the whole of the clergy from matrimony. The same may be said of those who have made vows of perpetual continency, which are snares by which not a few myriads of souls have been drawn into endless ruin. Hence, if the Holy Spirit has spoken by the mouth of Paul, Papists cannot clear themselves from the crime of <i>fighting against God</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:39">Acts 5:39</span>,) while binding men’s consciences in a matter in which He designed that they should remain free unless, perhaps, He <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(438)</sup></span> has since that time adopted a new plan, so as to construct a snare, which he had previously disapproved of. </p>
