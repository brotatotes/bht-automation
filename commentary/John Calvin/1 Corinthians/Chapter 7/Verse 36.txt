<p><b>36.</b><i>But if any one thinketh that it were unseemly for his virgin.</i> He now directs his discourse to parents, who had children under their authority. For having heard the praises of celibacy, and having heard also of the inconveniences of matrimony, they might be in doubt, whether it were at all a kind thing to involve their children in so many miseries, lest it should seem as if <i>they</i> were to blame for the troubles that might befall them. For the greater their attachment to their children, so much the more anxiously do they exercise fear and caution on their account. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(439)</sup></span> Paul, then, with the view of relieving them from this difficulty, teaches that it is their duty to consult their advantage, exactly as one would do for himself when at his own disposal. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(440)</sup></span> Now he still keeps up the distinction, which he has made use of all along, so as to commend celibacy, but, at the same time, to leave marriage as a matter of choice; and not simply a matter of choice, but a needful remedy for incontinency, which ought not to be denied to any one. In <i>the first</i> part of the statement he speaks as to the giving of daughters in marriage, and he declares that those do not sin in giving away their daughters in marriage, who are of opinion that an unmarried life is not suitable for them. </p>
<p>The word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀσχημονεῖν</span></blu></grk> (to be <i>unseemly</i>) must be taken as referring to a special propriety, which depends on what is natural to the individual; for there is a <i>general</i> propriety, which philosophers make to be a part of temperance. <i>That</i> belongs equally to all. There is another, that is <i>special</i>, because one thing becomes one individual that would not be <i>seemly</i> in another. Every one therefore should consider (as Cicero observes) what is the part that nature has assigned to him. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(441)</sup></span> Celibacy will be <i>seemly</i> for one, but he must not measure all by his own foot; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(442)</sup></span> and others should not attempt to imitate him without taking into view their ability; for it is the imitation of the ape — which is at variance with nature. If, therefore, a father, having duly considered his daughter’s disposition, is of opinion that she is not prepared for celibacy, let him give her away in marriage. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(443)</sup></span> </p>
<p>By<i>the flower of her age</i> he means the marriageable age. This lawyers define to be from twelve to twenty years of age. Paul points out, in passing, what equity and humanity ought to be exercised by parents, in applying a remedy in that tender and slippery age, when the force of the disease requires it. <i>And it requires to be so.</i> In this clause I understand him as referring to the girl’s infirmity — in the event of her not having the gift of continency; for in that case, necessity constrains her to marry. As to Jerome’s making a handle of the expression <i>sinneth not</i>, for reviling marriage, with a view to its disparagement, as if it were not a praiseworthy action to dispose of a daughter in marriage, it is quite childish. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(444)</sup></span> For Paul reckoned it enough to exempt fathers from blame, that they might not reckon it a cruel thing to subject their daughters to the vexations connected with marriage. </p>
