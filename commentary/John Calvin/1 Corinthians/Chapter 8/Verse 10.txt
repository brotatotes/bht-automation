<p><b>10.</b><i>If any one see thee.</i> From this it appears more clearly, how much liberty the Corinthians allowed themselves; for when the wicked made a kind of sacred banquet for their idols, they did not hesitate <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(471)</sup></span> to go to it, to eat of the sacrifice along with them. Paul now shows what evil resulted from this. In the <i>first</i> clause, instead of the words <i>who hast knowledge</i>, I have rendered the expression thus — though<i>thou shouldest have</i>; and in the <i>second</i> clause, in the expression <i>who is weak</i>, I have introduced the word <i>notwithstanding</i>. This I found it necessary to do for the clearing up of Paul’s meaning. For he makes a concession, as if he had said: “Be it so, that thou hast knowledge; he who seeth thee, though he is not endowed with knowledge, is <i>notwithstanding</i> confirmed by thine example to venture upon the same thing, while he would never have taken such a step if he had not had one to take the lead. Now when he has one to imitate, he thinks that he has a sufficient excuse in the circumstance that he is imitating another, while in the meantime he is acting from an evil conscience.” For <i>weakness</i> here means ignorance, or scruple of conscience. I am aware, at the same time, in what way others explain it; for they understand <i>the occasion of stumbling</i> to be this — when ignorant persons, induced by example, imagine that in this way they perform some kind of religious service to God, but this idea is quite foreign to Paul’s meaning. For he reproves them, as I have said, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(472)</sup></span> because they emboldened the ignorant to hurry on, contrary to conscience, to attempt what they did not think it lawful for them to do. To be <i>built up</i> means here — to be <i>confirmed</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(473)</sup></span> Now that is a ruinous kind of <i>building</i>, that is not founded on sound doctrine. </p>
