<p><b>12.</b><i>When ye sin so against the brethren</i>, etc. For if the soul of every one that is weak is the price of Christ’s blood, that man who, for the sake of a very small portion of meat, hurries back again to death the brother who has been redeemed by Christ, shows how contemptible the blood of Christ is in his view. Hence contempt of this kind is an open insult to Christ. In what way a weak conscience may be wounded has been already explained — when it is <i>built up</i> in what is evil (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:10">1 Corinthians 8:10</span>) so as daringly and rashly to rush on farther than the individual thinks to be lawful for him. </p>
