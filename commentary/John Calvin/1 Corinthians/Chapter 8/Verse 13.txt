<p><b>13.</b><i>Wherefore if meat make my brother to offend</i> With the view of reproving more severely their disdainful liberty, he declares, that we ought not merely to refrain from a single banquet rather than injure a <i>brother</i>, but ought to give up the eating of meats during our whole life. Nor does he merely prescribe what ought to be done, but declares that he would himself act in this way. The expression, it is true, is hyperbolical, as it is scarcely possible that one should refrain from eating flesh during his whole life, if he remain in common life; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(475)</sup></span> but his meaning is, that he would rather make no use of his liberty in any instance, than be an <i>occasion of offense</i> to the weak. For participation is in no case lawful, unless it be regulated by the rule of love. Would that this were duly pondered by those who make everything subservient to their own advantage, so that they cannot endure to give up so much as a hair’s-breadth of their own right for the sake of their brethren; and that they would attend not merely to what Paul teaches, but also to what he marks out by his own example! How greatly superior he is to us! When <i>he</i>, then, makes no hesitation in subjecting himself thus far to his brethren, which of us would not submit to the same condition? </p>
<p>But, however difficult it is to act up to this doctrine, so far as the meaning is concerned, is easy, were it not that some have corrupted it by foolish glosses, and others by wicked calumnies. Both classes err as to the meaning of the word <i>offend</i> For they understand the word <i>offend</i> to mean, <i>incurring the hatred or displeasure of men</i>, or what is nearly the same thing,<i>doing what displeases them, or is not altogether agreeable to them</i> But it appears very manifestly from the context, that it means simply to hinder a brother by bad example (as an obstacle thrown in his way) from the right course, or to give him occasion of falling. Paul, therefore, is not here treating of the retaining of the favor of men, but of the assisting of the weak, so as to prevent their falling, and prudently directing them, that they may not turn aside from the right path. But (as I have said) the former class are <i>foolish</i>, while the latter are also <i>wicked</i> and impudent. </p>
<p>Those are <i>foolish</i>, who allow Christians scarcely any use of things indifferent, lest they should <i>offend</i> superstitious persons. “Paul,” say they, “prohibits here everything that may give occasion of <i>offense</i> Now to eat flesh on Friday will not fail to give <i>offense</i>, and hence we must abstain from it, not merely when there are some weak persons present, but in every case without exception, for it is possible that they may come to know of it.” Not to speak of their misinterpretation of the word rendered <i>occasion of offense</i>, they fall into a grievous blunder in not considering that Paul here inveighs against those who impudently abuse their knowledge in the presence of the weak, whom they take no pains to instruct. </p>
<p>Hence there will be no occasion for reproof, if instruction has been previously given. Farther, Paul does not command us to calculate, whether there may be an occasion of offense in what we do, except when the danger is present to our view. </p>
<p>I come now to the other class. These are pretended followers of Nicodemus, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(476)</sup></span> who under this pretext conform themselves to the wicked by participating in their idolatry, and not contented with justifying what they do amiss, are desirous also to bind others to the same necessity. Nothing could be said with greater plainness to condemn their perverse dissimulation than what Paul here teaches — that all who by their example allure the weak to idolatry, commit a grievous outrage against God as well as men. Yet they eagerly shield themselves from this by endeavoring to show that superstitions ought to be cherished in the hearts of the ignorant, and that we ought to lead the way before them to idolatry, lest a free condemnation of idolatry should <i>offend</i> them. Hence I will not do them the honor of dwelling upon a refutation of their impudence. I simply admonish my readers to compare Paul’s times with ours, and judge from this whether it is allowable to be present at mass, and other abominations, giving so much <i>occasion of offense</i> to the weak </p>
