<p><b>10.</b><i>Because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope.</i> There is a twofold reading in this passage, even in the Greek manuscripts, but the one that is more generally received is — <i>He that thrasheth</i>, <i>in hope of partaking of his hope</i> At the same time, the one that does not repeat the term <i>hope</i> twice in the second clause appears simpler, and more natural. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(485)</sup></span> Hence, if I were at liberty to choose, I would prefer to read it thus: <i>He that ploweth should plow in hope</i>, <i>and he that thrasheth in hope of participating</i> As, however, the most of the Greek manuscripts agree in the former reading, and as the meaning remains the same, I have not ventured to make change upon it. Now he expounds the preceding injunction, and hence he says, that it is an unjust thing that the husbandman should lay out his pains to no purpose in plowing and thrashing, but that the end of his labor is the hope of receiving the fruits. As it is so, we may infer, that this belongs to oxen also, but Paul’s intention was to extend it farther, and apply it principally to men. Now, the husbandman is said to be <i>a partaker of his hope</i>, when he enjoys the produce which he has obtained when reaping, but hoped for when plowing. </p>
