<p><b>12.</b><i>If others assume this power over you</i> Again he establishes his own right from the example of others. For why should he alone be denied what others assumed as their due? For as no one labored more than he among the Corinthians, no one was more deserving of a reward. He does not, however, make mention of what he has done, but of what he would have done in accordance with his right, if he had not of his own accord refrained from using it. </p>
<p><i>But we have not used this power.</i> He returns now to the point on which the matter hinges — that he had of his own accord given up that power which no one could refuse him, and that he was prepared rather <i>to suffer all things,</i> than by the use of his liberty throw any impediment in the way of the progress of the gospel. He wishes, therefore, that the Corinthians should, after his example, keep this end in view — to do nothing that would hinder or retard the progress of the gospel; for what he declares respecting himself it was their duty to perform according to their station; and he confirms here what he had said previously — that we must consider what is <i>expedient</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:12">1 Corinthians 6:12</span>.) </p>
