This <i>second</i> thing he now sets before them by a comparison taken from pugilists; not indeed in every particular, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(513)</sup></span> but in so far as was required by the subject in hand, within which he confines himself — how far they ought to yield to the weakness of the brethren. Now he argues from the less to the greater, that it is an unseemly thing if we grudge to give up our right, inasmuch as the pugilists eating their coliphium, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(514)</sup></span> and that sparingly and not to the full, voluntarily deny themselves every delicacy, in order that they may have more agility for the combat, and they do this, too, for the sake of <i>a corruptible crown</i> But if they value so highly a crown of leaves that quickly fades, what value ought we to set upon a crown of immortality? Let us not, therefore, think it hard to give up a little of our right. It is well known that wrestlers were contented with the most frugal diet, so that their simple fare has become proverbial. </p>
