<p><b>26.</b><i>I therefore so run</i> He returns to speak of himself, that his doctrine may have the more weight, on his setting himself forward by way of pattern. What. he says here some refer to <i>assurance of hope</i> — (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:11">Hebrews 6:11</span>) — “I do not run in vain, nor do I run the risk of losing my labor, for I have the Lord’s promise, which never deceives.” It rather appears to me, however, that his object is to direct the course of believers straight forward toward the goal, that it may not be wavering and devious. “The Lord exercises us here in the way of running and wrestling, but he sets before us the object at which we ought to aim, and prescribes a sure rule for our wrestling, that we may not weary ourselves in vain.” Now he takes in both the similitudes that he had employed. “I know,” says he, “<i>whither</i> I am running, and, like a skillful wrestler, I am anxious that I may not miss my aim.” Those things ought to kindle up and confirm the Christian breast, so as to devote itself with greater alacrity to all the duties of piety; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(515)</sup></span> for it is a great matter not to wander in ignorance through uncertain windings. </p>
