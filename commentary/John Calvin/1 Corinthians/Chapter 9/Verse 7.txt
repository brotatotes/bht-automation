<p><b>7.</b><i>Who hath gone a warfare at his own charges?</i> It is the present tense that is used <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(483)</sup></span> as meaning — is <i>accustomed to go</i> a warfare. I have, however, with the view of taking off somewhat of the harshness, rendered it in the preterite. Now, by <i>three</i> comparisons, and these, too, taken from common life, he makes it out that it was allowable for him to live, if he chose, at the public expense of the Church, to show that he assumes nothing to himself but what human nature itself teaches us is reasonable. The <i>first</i> is taken from military law, for soldiers are wont to have their provisions furnished to them at the public expense. The <i>second</i> is taken from vine-dressers, for the husbandman plants a vine — not to throw away his pains, but to gather the fruit. The <i>third</i> is taken from keepers of cattle, for the shepherd does not lay out his labor for nothing, but <i>eats of the milk of the flock</i> — that is, he is supported from the produce. As natural equity points out this as reasonable, who will be so unjust as to refuse sustenance to the pastors of the Church? While it may happen, that some serve as soldiers at their own expense, as, for example, the Romans in ancient times, when no tribute was as yet paid, and there were no taxes, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(484)</sup></span> this does not militate against Paul’s statement, for he simply takes his argument from common and everywhere received practice. </p>
