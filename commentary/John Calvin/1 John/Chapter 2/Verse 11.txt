<p><b>11.</b><i>But he that hateth his brother.</i> He again reminds us, that whatever specious appearance of excellency thou shewest, there is yet nothing but what is sinful if love be absent. This passage may be compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:1">1 Corinthians 13:1</span>, and no long explanation is needed. But this doctrine is not understood by the world, because the greater part are dazzled by all sorts of masks or disguises. Thus, fictitious sanctity dazzles the eyes of almost all men, while love is neglected, or, at least, driven to the farthest corner. </p>
