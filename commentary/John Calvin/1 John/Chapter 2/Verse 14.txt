<p><b>14</b><i>I have written unto you, fathers</i> These repetitions I deem superfluous; and it is probable that when unskillful readers falsely thought that he spoke twice of little children, they rashly introduced the other two clauses. It might at the same time be that John himself, for the sake of amplifying, inserted the second time the sentence respecting the young men, (for he adds, that they were strong, which he had not said before;) but that the copyists presumptuously filled up the number. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(67)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(67)</span> There are no different readings that can justify the supposition of an interpolation. The only reading that <i>Griesbach</i> considers probable is <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἔγραψα</span></blu></grk> for <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">γράφω</span></blu></grk> at the end of the 13th verse. If that be adopted, then the three characters are twice mentioned, and in regular order. The objection that <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τεκνία</span></blu></grk> in ver. 12, is <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">παιδία</span></blu></grk> in ver. 13, is not valid, for he uses the latter in the same sense as the former in ver. 18, as denoting Christians in general; while here, in connection with “fathers” and “young men,” they must mean those young in years or in the profession of the gospel. The repetition is for the sake of emphasis. — <i>Ed</i> </p>
