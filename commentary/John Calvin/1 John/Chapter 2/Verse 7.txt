<p><b>7</b><i>Brethren, I write no new commandment</i> This is an explanation of the preceding doctrine, that to love God is to keep his commandments. And not without reason did he largely dwell on this point. First, we know that novelty is disliked or suspected. Secondly, we do not easily undertake an unwonted yoke. In addition to these things, when we have embraced any kind of doctrine, we dislike to have anything changed or made new in it. For these reasons John reminds us, that he taught nothing respecting love but what had been heard by the faithful from the beginning, and had by long usage become old. </p>
<p>Some explain oldness differently, even that Christ now prescribes no other rule of life under the Gospel than what God did formerly under the Law. This is indeed most true; nor do I object but that he afterwards calls in this sense the word of the gospel <i>the old commandment</i> But I think that he now means only, that these were the first elements of the gospel, that they had been thus taught from the beginning, that there was no reason why they should refuse that as unusual by which they ought to have been long ago imbued. For the relative seems to be used in a causative sense. He calls it then <i>old</i>, not because it was taught the fathers many ages before, but because it had been taught them on their new entrance into a religious life. And it served much to claim their faith, that it had <i>proceeded</i> from Christ himself from whom they had received the gospel. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(64)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>The old commandment</i> The word <i>old</i>, in this place, probably extends further; for the sentence is fuller, when he says, <i>the word which ye have heard from the beginning is the old commandment</i> And as I, indeed, think, he means that the gospel ought not to be received as a doctrine lately born, but what has proceeded from God, and is his eternal truth; as though he had said, “Ye ought not to measure the antiquity of the gospel which is brought to you, by time; since therein is revealed to you the eternal will of God: not only then has God delivered to you this rule of a holy life, when ye were first called to the faith of Christ, but the same has always been prescribed and approved by him.” And, doubtless, this only ought to be deemed antiquity, and deserves faith and reverence, which has its origin from God. For the fictions of men, whatever long prescription of years they may have, cannot acquire so much authority as to subvert the truth of God. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(64)</span> That this view is correct, appears evident from the words, “which<i>ye</i> had from the beginning;” he calls it “old,” because they had been taught it from “the beginning,” that is, of the gospel. Then “new” can mean no other thing than what <i>Calvin</i> states, that it continues still in force, it being, as it were, always new. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
