<p><b>4</b><i>This is the victory</i> As he had said that all who are born of God overcome the world, he also sets forth the way of overcoming it. For it might be still asked, whence comes this victory? He then makes the victory over the world to depend on faith. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(93)</sup></span> </p>
<p>This passage is remarkable, for though Satan continually repeats his dreadful and horrible onsets, yet the Spirit of God, declaring that we are beyond the reach of danger, removes fear, and animates us to fight with courage. And the past time is more emphatical than the present or the future; for he says, <i>that has overcome</i>, in order that we might feel certain, as though the enemy had been already put to flight. It is, indeed, true, that our warfare continues through life, that our conflicts are daily, nay, that new and various battles are every moment on every side stirred up against us by the enemy; but as God does not arm us only for one day, and as faith is not that of one day, but is the perpetual work of the Holy Spirit, we are already partakers of victory, as though we had already conquered. </p>
<p>This confidence does not, however, introduce indifference, but renders us always anxiously intent on fighting. For the Lord thus bids his people to be certain, while yet he would not have them to be secure; but on the contrary, he declares that they have already overcome, in order that they may fight more courageously and more strenuously. </p>
<p>The term <i>world</i> has here a wide meaning, for it includes whatever is adverse to the Spirit of God: thus, the corruption of our nature is a part of the world; all lusts, all the crafts of Satan, in short, whatever leads us away from God. Having such a force to contend with, we have an immense war to carry on, and we should have been already conquered before coming to the contest, and we should be conquered a hundred times daily, had not God promised to us the victory. But God encourages us to fight by promising us the victory. But as this promise secures to us perpetually the invincible power of God, so, on the other hand, it annihilates all the strength of men. For the Apostle does not teach us here that God only brings some help to us, so that being aided by him, we may be sufficiently able to resist; but he makes victory to depend on faith alone; and faith receives from another that by which it overcomes. They then take away from God what is his own, who sing triumph to their own power. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(93)</span> The words literally are, — </p>
<p>“For every thing begotten by God overcomes the world,” etc. The neuter gender is used for the masculine, “every thing” for “every one,” as in the first verse; or according to <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">כל</span></blu></heb> in Hebrew, it is used in a plural sense, for <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πάντες</span></blu></grk> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span>, “that all (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πᾶν</span></blu></grk>) which thou hast given him, he should give them (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">αὐτοῖς</span></blu></grk>) eternal life.” </p>
<p><i>Macknight</i> and others have said that the neuter gender is used in order to comprehend all sorts of persons, males and females, young and old, Jews and Gentiles, bond or free. Why, then, was not the neuter gender used in the first verse? It is clearly a peculiarity of style, and nothing else, and ought not to be retained in a translation. </p>
<p>“Victory” stands for that which brings victory, the effect for the cause; or it may designate the person, as <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">νίκη</span></blu></grk> means sometimes the goddess of victory. — “And this the conqueress who conquers the world, even our faith.” — <i>Ed</i> </p>
