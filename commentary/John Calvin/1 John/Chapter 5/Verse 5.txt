<p><b>5</b><i>Who is he that overcometh the world</i> This is a reason for the previous sentence; that is, we conquer by faith, because we derive strength from Christ; as Paul also says, </p>
<p>“I can do all things through him that strengtheneth me,” <br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+4:13">Philippians 4:13</span>.) </br></p>
<p>He only then can conquer Satan and the world, and not succumb to his own flesh, who, diffident as to himself, recumbs on Christ’s power alone. For by<i>faith</i> he means a real apprehension of Christ, or an effectual laying hold on him, by which we apply his power to ourselves. </p>
