<p><b>17</b><i>And if ye call on the Father</i> They are said here to call on God the Father, who professed themselves to be his children, as Moses says, that the name of Jacob was called on Ephraim and Manasseh, that they might be counted his children. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:16">Genesis 48:16</span>.) According to this meaning also, we say in French <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">reclamer</span></i></blu> But he had a regard to what he had said before, “as obedient children.” And from the character of the Father himself, he shews what sort of obedience ought to be rendered. He <i>judges,</i> he says, <i>without looking on the person,</i> that is, no outward mask is of any account with him, as the case is with men, but he sees the heart, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1sa+16:7">1 Samuel 16:7</span>;) and his eyes look on faithfulness. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+5:3">Jeremiah 5:3</span>.) This also is what Paul means when he says that God’s judgment is according to truth, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:2">Romans 2:2</span>;) for he there inveighs against hypocrites, who think that they deceive God by a vain pretense. The meaning is, that we by no means discharge our duty towards God, when we obey him only in appearance; for he is not a mortal man, whom the outward appearance pleases, but he reads what we are inwardly in our hearts. He not only prescribes laws for our feet and hands, but he also requires what is just and right as to the mind and spirit. </p>
<p>By saying, <i>According to every man’s work,</i> he does not refer to merit or to reward; for Peter does not speak here of the merits of works, nor of the cause of salvation, but he only reminds us, that there will be no looking to the person before the tribunal of God, but that what will be regarded will be the real sincerity of the heart. In this place faith also is included in the work. It hence appears evident how foolish and puerile is the inference that is drawn, — “God is such that he judges every one of us by the integrity of his conscience, not by the outward appearance; then we obtain salvation by works.” </p>
<p>The <i>fear</i> that is mentioned, stands opposed to heedless security, such as is wont to creep in, when there is a hope of deceiving with impunity. For, as God’s eyes are such that they penetrate into the hidden recesses of the heart, we ought to walk with him carefully and not negligently. He calls the present life a <i>sojourning,</i> not in the sense in which he called the Jews to whom he was writing sojourners, at the beginning of the Epistle, but because all the godly are in this world pilgrims. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>.) </p>
