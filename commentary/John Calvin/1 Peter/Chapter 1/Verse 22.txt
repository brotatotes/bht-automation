<p><b>22</b><i>Seeing ye have purified your souls,</i> or, <i>Purifying your souls</i>. Erasmus badly renders the words, “Who have purified,” <i>etc</i>. For Peter does not declare what they had done, but reminds them of what they ought to do. The participle is indeed in the past tense, but it may be rendered as a gerund, “By purifying, <i>etc</i>. ” The meaning is, that their souls would not be capable of receiving grace until they were purified, and by this our uncleanness is proved. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(17)</sup></span> But that he might not seem to ascribe to us the power of purifying our souls, he immediately adds, <i>through the Spirit;</i> as though he had said, “Your souls are to be purified, but as ye cannot do this, offer them to God, that he may take away your filth by his Spirit.” He only mentions souls, though they needed to be cleansed also from the defilements of the flesh, as Paul bids the Corinthians, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:1">2 Corinthians 7:1</span>;) but as the principal uncleanness is within, and necessarily draws with it that which is outward, Peter was satisfied with mentioning only the former, as though he had said, that not outward actions only ought to be corrected, but the very hearts ought to be thoroughly reformed. </p>
<p>He afterwards points out the manner, for purity of soul consists in obedience to God. <i>Truth</i> is to be taken for the rule which God prescribes to us in the Gospel. Nor does he speak only of works, but rather faith holds here the primacy. Hence Paul specially teaches us in the first and last chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, that faith is that by which we obey God; and Peter in Acts, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:9">Acts 15:9</span>, bestows on it this eulogy, that God by it purifies the heart. </p>
<p><i>Unto love of the brethren,</i> or, <i>Unto brotherly love</i>. He briefly reminds us what God especially requires in our life, and the mark to which all our endeavors should be directed. So Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span> the Epistle to the Ephesians, when speaking of the perfection of the faithful, makes it to consist in love. And this is what we ought the more carefully to notice, because the world makes its own sanctity to consist of the veriest trifles, and almost overlooks this the chief thing. We see how the Papists weary themselves beyond measure with thousand invented superstitions: in the meantime, the last thing is that love which God especially commends. This, then, is the reason why Peter calls our attention to it, when speaking of a life rightly formed. </p>
<p>He had before spoken of the mortification of the flesh, and of our conformity with the will of God; but he now reminds us of what God would have us to cultivate through life, that is, mutual love towards one another; for by that we testify also that we love God; and by this evidence God proves who they are who really love him. </p>
<p>He calls it <i>unfeigned,</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">(ἀνυπόκριτον)</span></blu></grk>, as Paul calls faith in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:5">1 Timothy 1:5</span>; for nothing is more difficult than to love our neighbors in sincerity. For the love of ourselves rules, which is full of hypocrisy; and besides, every one measures his love, which he shews to others, by his own advantage, and not by the rule of doing good. He adds, <i>fervently;</i> for the more slothful we are by nature, the more ought every one to stimulate himself to fervor and earnestness, and that not only once, but more and more daily. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(17)</span> It is better to keep the tense of the participle, — “Having purified (or, since ye have purified) your souls by obeying the truth through the Spirit to an unfeigned love of the brethren, love ye one another fervently from a pure heart; having been born again,” etc. </p>
<p>The order here is similar to what is often found in Scripture; purification is mentioned before regeneration, as being the most visible and the effect; then what goes before it as being in a manner the cause. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
