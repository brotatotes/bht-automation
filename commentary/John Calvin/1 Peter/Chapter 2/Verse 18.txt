<p><b>18</b><i>Servants, be subject</i> Though this is a particular admonition, yet it is connected with what is gone before, as well as the other things which follow; for the obedience of servants to masters, and of wives also to their husbands, forms a part of civil or social subjection. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(30)</sup></span> </p>
<p>He first would have servants to be subject <i>with all fear;</i> by which expression he means that sincere and willing reverence, which they acknowledge by their office to be due. He then sets this fear in opposition to dissimulation as well as to forced subjection; for an eye-service (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὀφθαλμοδουλεία</span></blu></grk>, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+3:22">Colossians 3:22</span>,) as Paul calls it, is the opposite of this fear; and further, if servants clamor against severe treatment, being ready to throw off the yoke if they could, they cannot be said properly to fear. In short, fear arises from a right knowledge of duty. And though no exception is added in this place, yet, according to other places, it is to be understood. For subjection due to men is not to be so far extended as to lessen the authority of God. Then servants are to be subject to their masters, only as far as God permits, or as far as the altars, as they say. But as the word here is not <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δοῦλοι</span></blu></grk>, <i>slaves</i>, but <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">οἰκέται</span></blu></grk> <i>, domestics</i>, we may understand the free as well as the bond servants to be meant, though it be a difference of little moment. </p>
<p><i>Not only to the good</i> Though as to the duty of servants to obey their masters, it is wholly a matter of conscience; if, however, they are unjustly treated, as to themselves, they ought not to resist authority. Whatever, then, masters may be, there is no excuse for servants for not faithfully obeying them. For when a superior abuses his power, he must indeed hereafter render an account to God, yet he does not for the present lose his right. For this law is laid on servants, that they are to serve their masters, though they may be unworthy. For <i>the froward</i> he sets in opposition to the equitable or humane; and by this word he refers to the cruel and the perverse, or those who have no humanity and kindness. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(31)</sup></span> </p>
<p>It is a wonder what could have induced an interpreter to change one Greek word for another, and render it “wayward.” I should say nothing of the gross ignorance of the Sorbons, who commonly understand by wayward, (<blu><i>dyscolos</i></blu> ,) the dissolute or dissipated, were it not that they seek by this absurd rendering to build up for us an article of faith, that we ought to obey the Pope and his horned wild beasts, however grievous and intolerable a tyranny they may exercise. This passage, then, shews how boldly they trifle with the Word of God. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(30)</span> The word for “servants,” <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">οἰκέται</span></blu></grk> properly means “domestics,” or household servants. They are mentioned as they came more in contact with their masters, and were more liable to be ill-treated. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(31)</span> ”Good,” <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀγαθοῖς</span></blu></grk>, the kind, benevolent; “gentle,” <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐπιεικέσιν</span></blu></grk>, the yielding, mild, patient; “froward,” <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">σκολιο̑ις</span></blu></grk> the crooked, perverse, untoward, those of a cross disposition, self-willed, and hence cruel, being neither kind nor meek. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
