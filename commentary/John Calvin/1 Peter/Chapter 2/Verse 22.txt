<p><b>22</b><i>Who did no sin</i> This belongs to the present subject; for, if any one boasts of his own innocence, he must know that Christ did not suffer as a malefactor. He, at the same time, shews how far we come short of what Christ was, when he says, that there was <i>no guile found in his mouth;</i> for he who offends not by his tongue, says James, is a perfect man. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:2">James 3:2</span>.) He then declares that there was in Christ the highest perfection of innocency, such as no one of us can dare claim for himself. It hence appears more fully how unjustly he suffered beyond all others. There is, therefore, no reason why any one of us should refuse to suffer after his example, since no one is so conscious of having acted rightly, as not to know that he is imperfect. </p>
