<p><b>25</b><i>For ye were as sheep</i> This also has Peter borrowed from Isaiah, except that the Prophet makes it a universal statement, </p>
<p>“All we like sheep have gone astray.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:6">Isaiah 53:6</span>.) </p>
<p>But on the word <i>sheep</i> there is no particular stress; he indeed compares us to sheep, but the emphasis is on what the Prophet adds, when he says that every one had turned to his own way. The meaning then is, that we are all going astray from the way of salvation, and proceeding in the way of ruin, until Christ brings us back from this wandering. </p>
<p>And this appears still more evident from the clause which follows, <i>but are now returned to the Shepherd, etc.</i>; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(35)</sup></span> for all who are not ruled by Christ, are wandering like lost sheep in the ways of error. Thus, then, is condemned the whole wisdom of the world, which does not submit to the government of Christ. But the two titles given here to Christ are remarkable, that he is <i>the Shepherd and Bishop of souls</i> There is then no cause to fear, but that he will faithfully watch over the safety of those who are in his fold and under his care. And it is his office to keep us safe both in body and soul; yet Peter mentions only souls, because this celestial Shepherd keeps us under his own spiritual protection unto eternal life. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(35)</span> I would render the clause thus, “But you have been now restored,” that is, from your wandering, “to the shepherd and the bishop (or, overseer) of your souls.” <i>Macknight</i> thinks, that our Lord took the title of shepherd in order to shew that he is the person foretold in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:23">Ezekiel 34:23</span>, and that Peter alludes, in calling him bishop or overseer, to <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:11">Ezekiel 34:11</span> of that chapter, the latter clause of which, according to the <i>Sept.</i> is, “I will oversee them,” (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐπισκέψομαι</span></blu></grk>.) — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
