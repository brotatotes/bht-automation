<p>Now follow general precepts which indiscriminately belong to all. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(39)</sup></span> Moreover he summarily mentions some things which are especially necessary to foster friendship and love. The first is, <i>Be ye all of one mind,</i> or, <i>think ye all the same thing</i>. For though friends are at liberty to think differently, yet to do so is a cloud which obscures love; yea, from this seed easily arises hatred. Sympathy (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">συμπάθεια</span></blu></grk>) extends to all our faculties, when concord exists between us; so that every one condoles with us in adversity as well as rejoices with us in prosperity, so that every one not only cares for himself, but also regards the benefit of others. </p>
<p>What next follows, <i>Love as brethren,</i> belongs peculiarly to the faithful; for where God is known as a Father, there only brotherhood really exists. Be <i>pitiful,</i> or <i>merciful</i>, which is added, means that we are not only to help our brethren and relieve their miseries, but also to bear with their infirmities. In what follows there are two readings in Greek; but what seems to me the most probable is the one I have put as the text; for we know that it is the chief bond to preserve friendship, when every one thinks modestly and humbly of himself; as there is nothing on the other hand which produces more discords than when we think too highly of ourselves. Wisely then does Peter bid us to be humble-minded (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ταπεινόφρονες</span></blu></grk>,) lest pride and haughtiness should lead us to despise our neighbors. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(40)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(39)</span> In the previous statements of particular duties belonging to various relations in life, the duty of masters towards their servants is omitted. Some have hence inferred that there were no masters who were Christians among those to whom Peter wrote. But this could not have been the ease, and for this reason, because Paul, in his Epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians, expressly specifies the duty of masters towards their servants; and Ephesus and Colosse were included in Asia Minor, and it was to Christians scattered throughout that country that Peter wrote his Epistle. </p>
<p>But this omission is somewhat singular. At the same time, though the master’s duty is not specifically mentioned, we may yet consider this verse as having a special reference to masters, as sympathy, brotherly love, and compassion or commiseration, are here inculcated. </p>
<p>The construction of the whole passage, beginning at the 17<sup>th</sup> verse of the last chapter, and ending at the 12th of this (for at the 13th of this, he resumes the subject he left off at the end of the 16<sup>th</sup> of the last) deserves to be noticed. “Honour all,” is the injunction which he afterwards exemplifies as to servants, wives, and husbands; for the construction is “Honour all — the servants being subject, etc. — in like manner, the wives being subject, etc. — in like manner, the husbands, cohabiting according to knowledge, giving honor, etc.” Then follows this verse in the same form, “And finally, all being of one mind, sympathizing, loving the brethren, compassionate, friendly-minded (or humble-minded,) not rendering, etc.” And thus he proceeds to the end of the 12th verse. Afterwards he resumes the subject respecting the treatment the Christians met with from the world. </p>
<p>May we not then conclude, that as the duty of masters does not come under the idea of <i>honoring,</i> he did not specifically mention them, but referred only to the spirit and temper they ought to have exhibited? — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
