<p><b>1</b><i>Forasmuch then as Christ</i> When he had before set forth Christ before us, he only spoke of the suffering of the cross; for sometimes the cross means mortification, because the outward man is wasted by afflictions, and our flesh is also subdued. But he now ascends higher; for he speaks of the reformation of the whole man. The Scripture recommends to us a twofold likeness to the death of Christ, that we are to be conformed to him in reproaches and troubles, and also that the old man being dead and extinct in us, we are to be renewed to a spiritual life. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+3:10">Philippians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>.) Yet Christ is not simply to be viewed as our example, when we speak of the mortificaion of the flesh; but it is by his Spirit that we are really made conformable to his death, so that it becomes effectual to the crucifying of our flesh. In short, as Peter at the end of the last chapter exhorted us to patience after the example of Christ, because death was to him a passage to life; so now from the same death he deduces a higher doctrine, that we ought to die to the flesh and to the world, as Paul teaches us more at large in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1">Romans 6:1</span>. He therefore says, <i>arm yourselves,</i> or <i>be ye armed,</i> intimating that we are really and effectually supplied with invincible weapons to subdue the flesh, if we partake as we ought of the efficacy of Christ’s death. </p>
<p><i>For he that hath suffered</i> The particle <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὅτι</span></blu></grk> does not, I think, denote here the cause, but is to be taken as explanatory; for Peter sets forth what that thought or mind is with which Christ’s death arms us, even that the dominion of sin ought to be abolished in us, so that God may reign in our life. Erasmus has incorrectly, as I think, rendered the word “he who did suffer,” (<blu><i>patiebatur</i></blu> ) applying it to Christ. For it is an indefinite sentence, which generally extends to all the godly, and has the same meaning with the words of Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:7">Romans 6:7</span>, </p>
<p>“He who is dead is justified or freed from sin;” </p>
<p>for both the Apostles intimate, that when we become dead to the flesh, we have no more to do with sin, that it should reign in us, and exercise its power in our life. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(44)</sup></span> </p>
<p>It may, however, be objected, that Peter here speaks unsuitably in making us to be conformable to Christ in this respect, that we suffer in the flesh; for it is certain that there was nothing sinful in Christ which required to be corrected. But the answer is obvious, that it is not necessary that a comparison should correspond in all its parts. It is then enough that we should in a measure be made conformable to the death of Christ. In the same way is also explained, not unfitly, what Paul says, that we are planted in the likeness of his death, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:5">Romans 6:5</span>;) for the manner is not altogether the same, but that his death is become in a manner the type and pattern of our mortification. </p>
<p>We must also notice that the word <i>flesh</i> is put here twice, but in a different sense; for when he says that Christ suffered in the flesh, he means that the human nature which Christ had taken from us was made subject to death, that is, that Christ as a man naturally died. In the second clause, which refers to us, <i>flesh</i> means the corruption, and the sinfulness of our nature; and thus suffering in the flesh signifies the denying of ourselves. We now see what is the likeness between Christ and us, and what is the difference; that as he suffered in the flesh taken from us, so the whole of our flesh ought to be crucified. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(44)</span> The subject of this passage, from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:14">1 Peter 3:14</span>, is suffering unjustly, or for righteousness’ sake, and Christ is brought as an example, he being just, suffered for the unjust. After a digression at the 19<sup>th</sup> verse of the third chapter, the Apostle returns here to his former subject, the example of Christ suffering in the flesh or in his body and in order to retain still the idea that he was just when he suffered, this clause seems to have been put in parenthetically, “For he who suffered ceased from sin,” that is, had no sin, but was just. And hence in the following verses he exhorts them to lead a holy life whatever might be the opposition from the world, so that they might be like their Savior, suffering unjustly, they themselves being innocent. </p>
<p><b>1.</b>“Christ then having suffered for us in the flesh, arm ye also yourselves with the same mind, (for he who suffered in the flesh ceased from sin;) </p>
<p><b>2.</b>so as to live no longer the remaining time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.” </p>
<p>They were exhorted to resolve to follow the example of Christ, but in such a way as not to suffer for their sins, but for righteousness’ sake. It is implied that they had been evil-doers, but they were no longer to be so, otherwise their suffering in the flesh would not be like that of Christ. To suffer as well-doers, and not as evil-doers, was to suffer as Christ did. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
