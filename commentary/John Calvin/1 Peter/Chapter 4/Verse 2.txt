<p><b>2</b><i>That he no longer</i> Here he sets forth the way of ceasing from sin, that renouncing the covetings of men we should study to form our life according to the will of God. And thus he includes here the two things in which renovation consists, the destruction of the flesh and the vivification of the spirit. The course of good living is thus to begin with the former, but we are to advance to the latter. </p>
<p>Moreover, Peter defines here what is the rule of right living, even when man depends on the will of God. It hence follows, that nothing is right and well ordered in man’s life as soon as he wanders from this rule. We ought further to notice the contrast between <i>God’s will</i> and the <i>covetings</i> or <i>lusts of men</i> We hence understand how great is our depravity, and how we ought to strive to become obedient to God. When he says, <i>the rest of time in the flesh,</i> the word <i>flesh</i> means the present life, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span> </p>
