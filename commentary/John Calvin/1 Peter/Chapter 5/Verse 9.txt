<p><b>9</b><i>Whom resist</i> As the power of an enemy ought to stimulate us and make us more careful, so there would be danger lest our hearts failed through immoderate fear, except the hope of victory were given us. This then is what the Apostle speaks of; he shows that the issue of the war will be prosperous, if we indeed fight under the banner of Christ; for whosoever comes to this contest, endued with faith, he declares that he will certainly be a conqueror. </p>
<p><i>Resist,</i> he says; but some one may ask, how? To this he answers, there is sufficient strength in faith. Paul, in the passage which I have already quoted, enumerates the various parts of our armor, but the meaning is the same, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span>,) for John testifies that faith alone is our victory over the world. </p>
<p><i>Knowing that the same afflictions,</i> or <i>sufferings</i>. It is another consolation, that we have a contest in common with all the children of God; for Satan dangerously tries us, when he separates us from the body of Christ. We have heard how he attempted to storm the courage of Job, </p>
<p>“Look to the saints, has any one of them suffered such a thing?”<br>— <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="job+5:1">Job 5:1</span>. </br></p>
<p>The Apostle on the other hand, reminds us here that nothing happens to us but what we see does happen to other members of the Church. Moreover a fellowship, or a similar condition, with all the saints, ought by no means to be refused by us. </p>
<p>By saying that the same sufferings are <i>accomplished,</i> he means what Paul declares in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>, that what remains of the sufferings of Christ is daily fulfilled in the faithful. </p>
<p>The words,<i>that are in the world,</i> may be explained in two ways, either that God proves his faithful people indiscriminately everywhere in the world, or that the necessity of fighting awaits us as long as we are in the world. But we must observe that having said before that we are assailed by Satan, he then immediately refers to every kind of afflictions. We hence gather that we have always to do with our spiritual enemy, however adversities may come, or whatever they may be, whether diseases oppress us, or the barrenness of the land threatens us with famine, or men persecute us. </p>
