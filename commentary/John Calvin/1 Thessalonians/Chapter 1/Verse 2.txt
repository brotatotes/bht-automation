<p><b>2</b><i>We give thanks to God</i>. He praises, as he is wont, their faith and other virtues, not so much, however, for the purpose of praising them, as to exhort them to perseverance. For it is no small excitement to eagerness of pursuit, when we reflect that God has adorned us with signal endowments, that he may finish what he has begun, and that we have, under his guidance and direction, advanced in the right course, in order that we may reach the goal. For as a vain confidence in those virtues, which mankind foolishly arrogate to themselves, puffs them up with pride, and makes them careless and indolent for the time to come, so a recognition of the gifts of God humbles pious minds, and stirs them up to anxious concern. Hence, instead of congratulations, he makes use of <i>thanksgivings</i>, that he may put them in mind, that everything in them that he declares to be worthy of praise, is a kindness from God. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(491)</sup></span> He also turns immediately to the future, in making mention of his <i>prayers</i>. We thus see for what purpose he commends their previous life. </p>
