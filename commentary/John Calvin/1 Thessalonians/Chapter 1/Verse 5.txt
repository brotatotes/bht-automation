For it had been the design of God, in honoring Paul’s ministry, that he might manifest to them their adoption. Accordingly, having said that they <i>know what manner of persons they had been</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(504)</sup></span> he immediately adds that he was such<i>for their sake</i>, by which he means that all this had been given them, in order that they might be fully persuaded that they were loved by God, and that their election was beyond all controversy. </p>
