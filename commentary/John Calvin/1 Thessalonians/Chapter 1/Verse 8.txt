8For from you sounded forth. Here we have an elegant metaphor, by which he intimates that their faith was so lively, (507) that it did, as it were, by its sound, arouse other nations. For he says that the word of God sounded forth from them, inasmuch as their faith was sonorous (508) for procuring credit for the gospel. He says that this had not only occurred in neighboring places, but this sound had also extended far and wide, and had been distinctly heard, so that the matter did not require to be published by him. (509) (507) “Si viue et vertueuse;” — “So lively and virtuous.” (508) “Auoit resonné haut et clair;” — “Had resounded loud and clear.” (509) “Tellement que la chose n’ha point besoin d’estre par luy diuulgee et magnifiee d’auantage;” — “So that the matter does not need to be farther published and extolled by him.”
