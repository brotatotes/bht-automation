<p>He says that the report of their conversion had obtained great renown everywhere. What he mentions as to his <i>entering in among them</i>, refers to that power of the Spirit, by which God had signalized his gospel. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(510)</sup></span> He says, however, that both things are freely reported among other nations, as things worthy of being made mention of. In the detail which follows, he shews, first, what the condition of mankind is, before the Lord enlightens them by the doctrine of his gospel; and farther, for what end he would have us instructed, and what is the fruit of the gospel. For although all do not worship idols, all are nevertheless addicted to idolatry, and are immersed in blindness and madness. Hence, it is owing to the kindness of God, that we are exempted from the impostures of the devil, and every kind of superstition. Some, indeed, he converts earlier, others later, but as alienation is common to all, it is necessary that we be converted to God, before we can serve God. From this, also, we gather the essence and nature of true faith, inasmuch as no one gives due credit to God but the man, who renouncing the vanity of his own understanding, embraces and receives the pure worship of God. </p>
<p><b>9</b><i>To the living God</i>. This is the end of genuine conversion. We see, indeed, that many leave off superstitions, who, nevertheless, after taking this step, are so far from making progress in piety, that they fall into what is worse. For having thrown off all regard to God, they give themselves up to a profane and brutal contempt. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(511)</sup></span> Thus, in ancient times, the superstitions of the vulgar were derided by Epicurus, Diogenes the Cynic, and the like, but in such a way that they mixed up the worship of God so as to make no difference between it and absurd trifles. Hence we must take care, lest the pulling down of errors be followed by the overthrow of the building of faith. Farther, the Apostle, in ascribing to God the epithets <i>true and living</i>, indirectly censures idols as being dead and worthless inventions, and as being falsely called gods. He makes the end of conversion to be what I have noticed — that they might <i>serve God</i>. Hence the doctrine of the gospel tends to this, that it may induce us to serve and obey God. For so long as we are the <i>servants of sin</i>, we are <i>free from righteousness</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:20">Romans 6:20</span>) inasmuch as we sport ourselves, and wander up and down, exempt from any yoke. No one, therefore, is properly converted to God, but the man who has learned to place himself wholly under subjection to him. </p>
<p>As, however, it is a thing that is more than simply difficult, in so great a corruption of our nature, he shews at the same time, what it is that retains and confirms us in the fear of God and obedience to him — <i>waiting for Christ.</i> For unless we are stirred up to the hope of eternal life, the world will quickly draw us to itself. For as it is only confidence in the Divine goodness that induces us to serve God, so it is only the expectation of final redemption that keeps us from giving way. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(512)</sup></span> Let every one, therefore, that would persevere in a course of holy life, apply his whole mind to a expectation of Christ’s coming. It is also worthy of notice, that he uses the expression <i>waiting for Christ</i>, instead of the hope of everlasting salvation. For, unquestionably, without Christ we are ruined and thrown into despair, but when Christ shews himself, life and prosperity do at the same time shine forth upon us. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(513)</sup></span> Let us bear in mind, however, that this is said to believers exclusively, for as for the wicked, as he will come to be their Judge, so they can do nothing but tremble in looking for him. </p>
<p>This is what he afterwards subjoins — that Christ <i>delivereth us from the wrath to come</i>. For this is felt by none but those who, being reconciled to God by faith, have conscience already pacified; otherwise, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(514)</sup></span> his name is dreadful. Christ, it is true, delivered us by his death from the anger of God, but the import of that deliverance will become apparent on the last day. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(515)</sup></span> This statement, however, consists of two departments. The <i>first</i> is, that the wrath of God and everlasting destruction are impending over the human race, inasmuch as <i>all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God</i>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:23">Romans 3:23</span>) The <i>second</i> is, that there is no way of escape but through the grace of Christ; for it is not without good grounds that Paul assigns to him this office. It is, however, an inestimable gift, that the pious, whenever mention is made of judgment, know that Christ will come as a Redeemer to them. </p>
<p>In addition to this, he says emphatically, <i>the wrath to come</i>, that he may rouse up pious minds, lest they should fail from looking at the present life. For as faith is a <i>looking at things that do not appear</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span>) nothing is less befitting than that we should estimate the wrath of God, according as any one is afflicted in the world; as nothing is more absurd than to take hold of the transient blessings which we enjoy, that we may from them form an estimate of God’s favor. While, therefore, on the one hand, the wicked sport themselves at their ease, and we, on the other hand, languish in misery, let us learn to fear the vengeance of God, which is hid from the eyes of flesh, and take our satisfaction in the secret delights of the spiritual life. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(516)</sup></span> </p>
