<p><b>10</b><i>Ye are witnesses</i>. He again calls God and them to witness, with the view of affirming his integrity, and cites, on the one hand, God as a witness of his conscience, and them, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(532)</sup></span> on the other hand, as witnesses of what they had known by experience. <i>How holily</i>, says he, <i>and justly</i>, that is, with how sincere a fear of God, and with what fidelity and blamelessness towards men; and thirdly, <i>unreproachably</i>, by which he means that he had given no occasion of complaint or obloquy. For the servants of Christ cannot avoid calumnies, and unfavorable reports; for being hated by the world, they must of necessity be evil-spoken of among the wicked. Hence he restricts this to <i>believers</i>, who judge uprightly and sincerely, and do not revile malignantly and groundlessly. </p>
