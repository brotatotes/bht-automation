<p><b>4</b><i>As we have been approved</i>. He goes even a step higher, for he appeals to God as the Author of his apostleship, and he reasons in this manner: “God, when he assigned me this office, bore witness to me as a faithful servant; there is no reason, therefore, why men should have doubts as to my fidelity, which they know to have been <i>approved of by God</i>. Paul, however, does not glory in having been <i>approved of</i>, as though he were such of himself; for he does not dispute here as to what he had by nature, nor does he place his own power in collision with the grace of God, but simply says that the Gospel had been committed to him as a faithful and <i>approved</i> servant. Now, God approves of those whom he has formed for himself according to his own pleasure. </p>
<p><i>Not as pleasing men</i>. What is meant by <i>pleasing men</i> has been explained in the Epistle to the Galatians, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:10">Galatians 1:10</span>) and this passage, also, shews it admirably. For Paul contrasts <i>pleasing</i> men, and <i>pleasing</i> God, as things that are opposed to each other. Farther, when he says — <i>God, who trieth our hearts</i>, he intimates, that those who endeavor to obtain the favor of men, are not influenced by an upright conscience, and do nothing from the heart. Let us know, therefore, that true ministers of the gospel ought to make it their aim to devote to God their endeavors, and to do it from the heart, not from any outward regard to the world, but because conscience tells them that it is right and proper. Thus it will be secured that they will not make it their aim to <i>please men</i>, that is, that they will not act under the influence of ambition, with a view to the favor of men. </p>
