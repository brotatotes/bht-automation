<p><b>10</b><i>Praying beyond measure</i>. He returns to an expression of his <i>desire</i>. For it is never allowable for us to congratulate men, while they live in this world, in such unqualified terms as not always to desire something better for them. For they are as yet in the way: they may fall back, or go astray, or even go back. Hence Paul is desirous to have opportunity given him of <i>supplying what is wanting in the faith</i> of the Thessalonians, or, which is the same thing, completing in all its parts their faith, which was as yet imperfect. Yet this is the faith which he had previously extolled marvelously. But from this we infer, that those who far surpass others are still far distant from the goal. Hence, whatever progress we may have made, let us always keep in view our <i>deficiencies</i>, (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑστερήματα</span></blu></grk>,) <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(559)</sup></span> that we may not be reluctant to aim at something farther. </p>
<p>From this also it appears how necessary it is for us to give careful attention to doctrine, for teachers <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(560)</sup></span> were not appointed merely with the view of leading men, in the course of a single day or month, to the faith of Christ, but for the purpose of perfecting the faith which has been begun. But as to Paul’s claiming for himself what he elsewhere declares belongs peculiarly to the Holy Spirit, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:14">1 Corinthians 14:14</span>) this must be restricted to the ministry. Now, as the ministry of a man is inferior to the efficacy of the Spirit, and to use the common expression, is subordinate to it, nothing is detracted from it. When he says that he prayed <i>night and day beyond all ordinary measure</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(561)</sup></span> we may gather from these words how assiduous he was in praying to God, and with what ardor and earnestness he discharged that duty. </p>
