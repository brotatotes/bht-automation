<p><b>2</b><i>Our brother</i>. He assigns to him these marks of commendation, that he may shew the more clearly how much inclined he was to consult their welfare: for if he had sent them some common person, it could not have afforded them much assistance; and inasmuch as Paul would have done this without inconvenience to himself, he would have given no remarkable proof of his fatherly concern in regard to them. It is, on the other hand, a great thing that he deprives himself of a <i>brother</i> and <i>fellow-laborer</i>, and one to whom, as he declares in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+2:20">Philippians 2:20</span>, he found no equal, inasmuch as all aimed at the promotion of their own interests. In the mean time, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(555)</sup></span> he procures authority for the doctrine which they had received from Timothy, that it may remain the more deeply impressed upon their memory. </p>
<p>It is, however, with good reason that he says that he had <i>sent Timothy</i> with this view — that they might receive a <i>confirmation of their faith</i> from his example. They might be intimidated by unpleasant reports as to persecutions; but Paul’s undaunted constancy was fitted so much the more to animate them, so as to keep them from giving way. And, assuredly, the fellowship which ought to subsist between the saints and members of Christ extends even thus far — that the faith of one is the consolation of others. Thus, when the Thessalonians heard that Paul was going on with indefatigable zeal, and was by strength of faith surmounting all dangers and all difficulties, and that his faith continued everywhere victorious against Satan and the world, this brought them no small consolation. More especially we are, or at least ought to be, stimulated by the examples of those by whom we were instructed in the faith, as is stated in the end of the Epistle to the Hebrews. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7">Hebrews 13:7</span>) Paul, accordingly, means that they ought to be fortified by his example, so as not to give way under their afflictions. As, however, they might have been offended if Paul had entertained a fear lest they should all give way under persecutions, (inasmuch as this would have been an evidence of excessive distrust,) he mitigates this harshness by saying — <i>lest any one</i>, or, <i>that no one</i>. There was, however, good reason to fear this, as there are always some weak persons in every society. </p>
