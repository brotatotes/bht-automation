<p><b>3</b><i>For ye yourselves know</i>. As all would gladly exempt themselves from the necessity of bearing the cross, Paul teaches that there is no reason why believers should feel dismayed on occasion of persecutions, as though it were a thing that was new and unusual, inasmuch as this is our condition, which the Lord has assigned to us. For this manner of expression — <i>we are appointed to it</i> — is as though he had said, that we are Christians on this condition. He says, however, that they <i>know</i> it, because it became them to fight the more bravely, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(556)</sup></span> inasmuch as they had been forewarned in time. In addition to this, incessant afflictions made Paul contemptible among rude and ignorant persons. On this account he states that nothing had befallen him but what he had long before, in the manner of a prophet, foretold. </p>
