<p>He shews here, by another argument, by what an extraordinary affection he was actuated towards them, inasmuch as he was transported almost out of his senses by the joyful intelligence of their being in a prosperous condition. For we must take notice of the circumstances which he relates. He was in <i>affliction</i> and <i>necessity:</i> there might have seemed, therefore, no room for cheerfulness. But when he hears what was much desired by him respecting the Thessalonians, as though all feeling of his distresses had been extinguished, he is carried forward to joy and congratulation. At the same time he proceeds, by degrees, in expressing the greatness of his joy, for he says, in the <i>first</i> place, <i>we received consolation:</i> afterwards he speaks of a joy that was plentifully poured forth. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(557)</sup></span> This congratulation, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(558)</sup></span> however, has the force of an exhortation; and Paul’s intention was to stir up the Thessalonians to perseverance. And, assuredly, this must have been a most powerful excitement, when they learned that the holy Apostle felt so great consolation and joy from the advancement of their piety. </p>
<p><b>6</b><i>Faith and love</i>. This form of expression should be the more carefully observed by us in proportion to the frequency with which it is made use of by Paul, for in these two words he comprehends briefly the entire sum of true piety. Hence all that aim at this twofold mark during their whole life are beyond all risk of erring: all others, however much they may torture themselves, wander miserably. The third thing that he adds as to their <i>good remembrance</i> of him, refers to respect entertained for the Gospel. For it was on no other account that they held Paul in such affection and esteem. </p>
