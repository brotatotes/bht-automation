<p><b>14</b><i>For if we believe</i>. He assumes this axiom of our faith, that Christ was raised up from the dead, that we might be partakers of the same resurrection: from this he infers, that we shall live with him eternally. This doctrine, however, as has been stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:13">1 Corinthians 15:13</span>, depends on another principle — that it was not for himself, but for us that Christ died and rose again. Hence those who have doubts as to the resurrection, do great injury to Christ: nay more, they do in a manner draw him down from heaven, as is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:6">Romans 10:6</span> </p>
<p>To <i>sleep in Christ</i>, is to retain in death the connection that we have with Christ, for those that are by faith ingrafted into Christ, have death in common with him, that they may be partakers with him of life. It is asked, however, whether unbelievers will not also rise again, for Paul does not affirm that there will be a resurrection, except in the case of Christ’s members. I answer, that Paul does not here touch upon anything but what suited his present design. For he did not design to terrify the wicked, but to correct <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(578)</sup></span> the immoderate grief of the pious, and to cure it, as he does, by the medicine of consolation. </p>
