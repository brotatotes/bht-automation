<p><b>16</b><i>For the Lord himself</i>. He employs the term <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κελεύσματος</span></blu></grk>, (<i>shout</i>,) and afterwards adds, <i>the voice of the archangel</i>, by way of exposition, intimating what is to be the nature of that arousing shout — that the archangel will discharge the office of a herald to summon the living and the dead to the tribunal of Christ. For though this will be common to all the angels, yet, as is customary among different ranks, he appoints one in the foremost place to take the lead of the others. As to the <i>trumpet</i>, however, I leave to others to dispute with greater subtlety, for I have nothing to say in addition to what I briefly noticed in the First Epistle to the Corinthians. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(583)</sup></span> The Apostle unquestionably had nothing farther in view here than to give some taste of the magnificence and venerable appearance of the Judge, until we shall behold it fully. With this taste it becomes us in the mean time to rest satisfied. </p>
<p><i>The dead who are in Christ</i>. He again says that the <i>dead who are in Christ</i>, that is, who are included in Christ’s body, will <i>rise first</i>, that we may know that the hope of life is laid up in heaven for them no less than for the living. He says nothing as to the reprobate, because this did not tend to the consolation of the pious, of which he is now treating. </p>
<p>He says that those that survive will be <i>carried up together with them</i>. As to these, he makes no mention of death: hence it appears as if he meant to say that they would be exempted from death. Here Augustine gives himself much distress, both in the twentieth book on the City of God and in his Answer to Dulcitius, because Paul seems to contradict himself, inasmuch as he says elsewhere, that <i>seed cannot spring up again unless it die</i>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:36">1 Corinthians 15:36</span>) The solution, however, is easy, inasmuch as a sudden change will be like death. Ordinary death, it is true, is the separation of the soul from the body; but this does not hinder that the Lord may in a moment destroy this corruptible nature, so as to create it anew by his power, for thus is accomplished what Paul himself teaches must take place — that <i>mortality shall be swallowed up of life</i>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:4">2 Corinthians 5:4</span>) What is stated in our Confession, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(584)</sup></span> that “Christ will be the Judge of the dead and of the living,” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(585)</sup></span> Augustine acknowledges to be true without a figure. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(586)</sup></span> He is only at a loss as to this — how those that have not died will rise again. But, as I have said, that is a kind of death, when this flesh is reduced to nothing, as it is now liable to corruption. The only difference is this — that those who <i>sleep</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(587)</sup></span> put off the <i>substance</i> of the body for some space of time, but those that will be suddenly changed will put off nothing but the <i>quality</i> </p>
