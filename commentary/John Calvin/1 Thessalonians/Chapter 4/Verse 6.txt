<p><b>6</b><i>Let no man oppress.</i> Here we have another exhortation, which flows, like a stream, from the doctrine of sanctification. “God,” says he, “has it in view to sanctify us, <i>that no man may do injury to his brother</i>. ” For as to Chrysostom’s connecting this statement with the preceding one, and explaining <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑπερβαίνειν καὶ πλεονεκτεῖν</span></blu></grk> to mean — neighing after the wives of others, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+5:8">Jeremiah 5:8</span>) and eagerly desiring them, is too forced an exposition. Paul, accordingly, having adduced one instance of unchastity in respect of lasciviousness and lust, teaches that this also is a department of holiness — that we conduct ourselves righteously and harmlessly towards our neighbors. The <i>former</i> verb refers to violent oppressions — where the man that has more power emboldens himself to inflict injury. The <i>latter</i> includes in it all immoderate and unrighteous desires. As, however, mankind, for the most part, indulge themselves in lust and avarice, he reminds them of what he had formerly taught — that <i>God would be the avenger of all such things</i>. We must observe, however, what he says — we have <i>solemnly testified;</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(569)</sup></span> for such is the sluggishness of mankind, that, unless they are wounded to the quick, they are touched with no apprehension of God’s judgment. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(569)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Nous vous auons testifié et comme adjuré</span></blu>;” — “We have testified to you, and, as it were, adjured.” </p>
