<p><b>12</b><i>And we beseech you</i>. Here we have an admonition that is very necessary. For as the kingdom of God is lightly esteemed, or at least is not esteemed suitably to its dignity, there follows also from this, contempt of pious teachers. Now, the most of them, offended with this ingratitude, not so much because they see themselves despised, as because they infer from this, that honor is not rendered to their Lord, are rendered thereby more indifferent, and God also, on just grounds, inflicts vengeance upon the world, inasmuch as he deprives it of good ministers, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(602)</sup></span> to whom it is ungrateful. Hence, it is not so much for the advantage of ministers as of the whole Church, that those who faithfully preside over it should be held in esteem. And it is for this reason that Paul is so careful to recommend them. To <i>acknowledge</i> means here to <i>have regard</i> or respect; but Paul intimates that the reason why less honor is shewn to teachers themselves than is befitting, is because their labor is not ordinarily taken into consideration. </p>
<p>We must observe, however, with what titles of distinction he honors pastors. In the <i>first</i> place, he says that they <i>labor</i>. From this it follows, that all idle bellies are excluded from the number of pastors. Farther, he expresses the kind of labor when he adds, <i>those that admonish</i>, or instruct, <i>you</i>. It is to no purpose, therefore, that any, that do not discharge the office of an instructor, glory in the name of pastors. The Pope, it is true, readily admits such persons into his catalogue, but the Spirit of God expunges them from <i>his</i>. As, however, they are held in contempt in the world, as has been said, he honors them at the same time, with the distinction of presidency. </p>
<p>Paul would have such as devote themselves to teaching, and preside with no other end in view than that of serving the Church, be held in no ordinary esteem. For he says literally — <i>let them be more than abundantly honored,</i> and not without good ground, for we must observe the reason that he adds immediately afterwards — <i>on account of their work</i>. Now, this <i>work</i> is the edification of the Church, the everlasting salvation of souls, the restoration of the world, and, in fine, the kingdom of God and Christ. The excellence and dignity of this work are inestimable: hence those whom God makes ministers in connection with so great a matter, ought to be held by us in great esteem. We may, however, infer from Paul’s words, that judgment is committed to the Church, that it may distinguish true pastors. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(603)</sup></span> For to no purpose were these marks pointed out, if he did not mean that they should be taken notice of by believers. And while he commands that honor be given to those that <i>labor</i>, and to those that by teaching <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(604)</sup></span> govern properly and faithfully, he assuredly does not bestow any honor upon those that are idle and wicked, nor does he mark them out as deserving of it. </p>
<p><i>Preside in the Lord.</i> This seems to be added to denote spiritual government. For although kings and magistrates also preside by the appointment of God, yet as the Lord would have the government of the Church to be specially recognized as <i>his</i>, those that govern the Church in the name and by the commandment of Christ, are for this reason spoken of particularly as <i>presiding in the Lord.</i> We may, however, infer from this, how very remote those are from the rank of pastors and prelates who exercise a tyranny altogether opposed to Christ. Unquestionably, in order that any one may be ranked among lawful pastors, it is necessary that he should shew that he <i>presides</i> in the Lord, and has nothing apart from him. And what else is this, but that by pure doctrine he puts Christ in his own seat, that he may be the only Lord and Master? </p>
