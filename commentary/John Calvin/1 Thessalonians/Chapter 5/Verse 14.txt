<p><b>14</b><i>Admonish the unruly.</i> It is a common doctrine — that the welfare of our brethren should be the object of our concern. This is done by <i>teaching</i>, admonishing, correcting, and arousing; but, as the dispositions of men are various, it is not without good reason that the Apostle commands that believers accommodate themselves to this variety. He commands, therefore, that the <i>unruly</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(607)</sup></span> be admonished, that is, those who <i>live dissolutely</i>. The term <i>admonition</i>, also, is employed to mean sharp reproof, such as may bring them back into the right way, for they are deserving of greater severity, and they cannot be brought to repentance by any other remedy. </p>
<p>Towards the <i>faint-hearted</i> another system of conduct must be pursued, for they have need of consolation. The <i>weak</i> must also be assisted. By <i>faint-hearted,</i> however, he means those that are of a broken and afflicted spirit. He accordingly favors them, and the <i>weak</i>, in such a way as to desire that the <i>unruly</i> should be restrained with some degree of sternness. On the other hand, he commands that the <i>unruly</i> should be admonished sharply, in order that the weak may be treated with kindness and humanity, and that the <i>faint-hearted</i> may receive consolation. It is therefore to no purpose that those that are obstinate and intractable demand that they be soothingly caressed, inasmuch as remedies must be adapted to diseases. </p>
<p>He recommends, however, <i>patience towards all</i>, for severity must be tempered with some degree of lenity, even in dealing with the <i>unruly</i>. This <i>patience</i>, however, is, properly speaking, contrasted with a feeling of irksomeness, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(608)</sup></span> for nothing are we more prone to than to feel wearied out when we set ourselves to cure the diseases of our brethren. The man who has once and again comforted a person who is <i>faint-hearted</i>, if he is called to do the same thing a third time, will feel I know not what vexation, nay, even indignation, that will not permit him to persevere in discharging his duty. Thus, if by admonishing or reproving, we do not immediately do the good that is to be desired, we lose all hope of future success. Paul had in view to bridle impatience of this nature, by recommending to us moderation towards all. </p>
