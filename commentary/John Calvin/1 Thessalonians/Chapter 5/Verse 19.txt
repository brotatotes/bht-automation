<p><b>19</b><i>Quench not the Spirit</i>. This metaphor is derived from the power and nature of the Spirit; for as it is the proper office of the Spirit to illuminate the understandings of men, and as he is on this account called our light, it is with propriety that we are said to <i>quench</i> him, when we make void his grace. There are some that think that it is the same thing that is said in this clause and the succeeding one. Hence, according to them, to <i>quench the Spirit</i> is precisely the same as to <i>despise prophesyings</i>. As, however, the Spirit is <i>quenched</i> in various ways, I make a distinction between these two things—that of a <i>general</i> statement, and a <i>particular</i>. For although <i>contempt of prophesying</i> is a <i>quenching of the Spirit</i>, yet those also <i>quench the Spirit</i> who, instead of stirring up, as they ought, more and more, by daily progress, the sparks that God has kindled in them, do, by their negligence, make void the gifts of God. This admonition, therefore, as to not <i>quenching the Spirit</i>, has a wider extent of meaning than the one that follows as to not <i>despising prophesyings</i>. The meaning of the <i>former</i> is: “Be enlightened by the Spirit of God. See that you do not lose that light through your ingratitude.” This is an exceedingly useful admonition, for we see that those who have been <i>once enlightened</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:4">Hebrews 6:4</span>) when they reject so precious a gift of God, or, shutting their eves, allow themselves to be hurried away after the vanity of the world, are struck with a dreadful blindness, so as to be an example to others. We must, therefore, be on our guard against indolence, by which the light of God is choked in us. </p>
<p>Those, however, who infer from this that it is in man’s option either to <i>quench</i> or to <i>cherish</i> the light that is presented to him, so that they detract from the efficacy of grace, and extol the powers of free will, reason on false grounds. For although God works efficaciously in his elect, and does not merely present the light to them, but causes them to see, opens the eyes of their heart, and keeps them open, yet as the flesh is always inclined to indolence, it has need of being stirred up by exhortations. But what God commands by Paul’s mouth, He himself accomplishes inwardly. In the mean time, it is our part to ask from the Lord, that he would furnish oil to the lamps which he has lighted up, that he may keep the wick pure, and may even increase it. </p>
