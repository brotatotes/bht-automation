<p><b>20</b><i>Despise not prophesyings</i>. This sentence is appropriately added to the preceding one, for as the Spirit of God illuminates us chiefly by doctrine, those who give not teaching its proper place, do, so far as in them lies, <i>quench the Spirit</i>, for we must always consider in what manner or by what means God designs to communicate himself to us. Let every one, therefore, who is desirous to make progress under the direction of the Holy Spirit, allow himself to be taught by the ministry of prophets. </p>
<p>By the term <i>prophecy</i>, however, I do not understand the gift of foretelling the future, but as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span>, the science of interpreting Scripture, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(611)</sup></span> so that a <i>prophet</i> is an interpreter of the will of God. For Paul, in the passage which I have quoted, assigns to <i>prophets teaching for edification, exhortation</i>, and <i>consolation</i>, and enumerates, as it were, these departments. Let, therefore, prophecy in this passage be understood as meaning — interpretation made suitable to present use. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(612)</sup></span> Paul prohibits us from <i>despising</i> it, if we would not choose of our own accord to wander in darkness. </p>
<p>The statement, however, is a remarkable one, for the commendation of external preaching. It is the dream of fanatics, that those are children who continue to employ themselves in the reading of the Scripture, or the hearing of the word, as if no one were spiritual, unless he is a despiser of doctrine. They proudly, therefore, despise the ministry of man, nay, even Scripture itself, that they may attain the Spirit. Farther, whatever delusions Satan suggests to them, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(613)</sup></span> they presumptuously set forth as secret revelations of the Spirit. Such are the Libertines, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(614)</sup></span> and other furies of that stamp. And the more ignorant that any one is, he is puffed up and swollen out with so much the greater arrogance. Let us, however, learn from the example of Paul, to conjoin the Spirit with the voice of men, which is nothing else than his organ. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(615)</sup></span> </p>
