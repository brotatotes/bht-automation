<p><b>3</b><i>For when they shall say</i>. Here we have an explanation of the similitude, <i>the day of the Lord will be like a thief in the night</i>. Why so? because it will come suddenly to unbelievers, when not looked for, so that it will take them by surprise, as though they were asleep. But whence comes that sleep? Assuredly from deep contempt of God. The prophets frequently reprove the wicked on account of this supine negligence, and assuredly they await in a spirit of carelessness not merely that last judgment, but also such as are of daily occurrence. Though the Lord threatens destruction, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(592)</sup></span> they do not hesitate to promise themselves peace and every kind of prosperity. And the reason why they fall into this destructive indolence <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(593)</sup></span> is, because they do not see those things immediately accomplished, which the Lord declares will take place, for they reckon that to be fabulous that does not immediately present itself before their eyes. For this reason the Lord, in order that he may avenge this carelessness, which is full of obstinacy, comes all on a sudden, and contrary to the expectation of all, precipitates the wicked from the summit of felicity. He sometimes furnishes tokens of this nature of a sudden advent, but that will be the principal one, when Christ will come down to judge the world, as he himself testifies, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:37">Matthew 24:37</span>) comparing that time to the age of Noe, inasmuch as all will give way to excess, as if in the profoundest repose. </p>
<p><i>As the pains of child-bearing.</i> Here we have a most apt similitude, inasmuch as there is no evil that seizes more suddenly, and that presses more keenly and more violently on the very first attack; besides this, a woman that is with child carries in her womb occasion of grief without feeling it, until she is seized amidst feasting and laughter, or in the midst of sleep. </p>
