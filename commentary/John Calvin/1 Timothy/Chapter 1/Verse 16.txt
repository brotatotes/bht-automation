<p><b>16</b><i>That in me the first Jesus Christ might shew</i> When he calls himself <i>the first,</i> he alludes to what he had said a little before, that he was the first <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(26)</sup></span> among sinners and, therefore, this word means “chiefly,” or, “above all.” The Apostle’s meaning is, that, from the very beginning, God held out such a pattern as might be visible from a conspicuous and lofty platform, that no one might doubt that he would obtain pardon, provided that he approached to Christ by faith. And, indeed, the distrust entertained by all of us is counteracted, when we thus behold in Paul a visible model of that grace which we desire to see. </p>
