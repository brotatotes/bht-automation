<p><b>8</b><i>Likewise the deacons</i> There is no reason why the diversity of interpretations should lead us to entertain any doubt. It is certain that time Apostle speaks of those who hold a public office in the Church; and this refutes the opinion of those who think that domestic servants are here meant. As to the view given by others, that it denotes presbyters who are inferior to the bishop, that is without foundation; for it is manifest from other passages, that the term bishop belongs alike to all presbyters. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(63)</sup></span> All are constrained to acknowledge this; and more especially a passage in the first chapter of the Epistle to Titus proves clearly that this is the meaning. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</span>.) It remains to be stated that we understand “the deacons” to be those who are mentioned by Luke, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:3">Acts 6:3</span>,) and who had the charge of the poor. But those who wish to have a more full account of the duties of deacons may consult the Institutes. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(64)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>Grave, not double-tongued</i> The first four virtues, with which he wishes them to be endowed, are of themselves sufficiently well known. Yet it ought to be carefully observed that he advises them not to be <i>double-tongued;</i> because it is a vice which it is difficult to avoid in the discharge of that office, and yet ought, more than anything else, to be kept at a distance from it. </p>
