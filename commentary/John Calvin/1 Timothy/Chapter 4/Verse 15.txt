<p><b>15</b><i>Take heed to these things</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(81)</sup></span> The greater the difficulty in faithfully discharging the ministry of the Church, so much the more ought a pastor to apply himself earnestly, and with his whole might; and that not only for a short time, but with unfailing perseverance. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(82)</sup></span> Paul therefore reminds Timothy that this work leaves no room for indolence, or for slackening his labors, but demands the utmost industry and constant application. </p>
<p><i>That thy profiting may be manifest</i> By adding these words, he means, that he ought to labor to this purpose, that by his agency the edification of the Church may be more and more advanced, and that corresponding results may be visible; for it is not the work of a single day, and therefore he should strive to make daily progress. Some refer this to Timothy, that he may profit more and more; but I choose rather to interpret it as referring to the effect of his ministry. </p>
<p>The Greek words<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, ἐν πᾶσιν,</span></blu></grk> may either be translated, <i>to all men,</i> or, in <i>all things.</i> There will thus be a twofold meaning; either, “that all may see the progress which springs from his labors”, or, “that in all respects, or in every possible way, (which is the same thing,) they may be visible.” I prefer the latter view. </p>
