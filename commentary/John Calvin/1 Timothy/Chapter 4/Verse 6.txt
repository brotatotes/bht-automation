<p><b>6</b><i>Exhibiting these things to the brethren</i> By this expression he exhorts Timothy to mention those things frequently; and he afterwards repeats this a second and a third time; for they are things of such a nature as it is proper to call frequently to remembrance. And we ought to make the contrast which is implied; for the doctrine which he commends is here contrasted by him not with false or wicked doctrines, but with useless trifles which do not edify. He wishes that those trifles may be entirely buried in forgetfulness, when he enjoins Timothy to be earnest in exhibiting other things. </p>
<p><i>Thou shalt be a good minister</i> Men frequently aim at something else than to approve themselves to Christ; and consequently many are desirous of being applauded for genius, eloquence, and profound knowledge. And that is the very reason why they pay less attention to necessary things, which do not tend to procure the admiration of the common people. But Paul enjoins Timothy to be satisfied with this alone, to be a faithful minister of Christ. And certainly we ought to look on this as a far more honorable title than to be a thousand times called seraphic and subtle doctors. Let us, therefore, remember, that as it is the highest honor of a godly pastor to be reckoned a good servant of Christ, so he ought to aim at nothing else during his whole ministry; for whoever has any other object in view, will have it in his power to obtain applause from men, but will not please God. Accordingly, that we may not be deprived of so great a blessing, let us learn to seek nothing else, and to account nothing so valuable, and to treat everything as worthless in comparison of this single object. </p>
<p><i>Nourished</i> The Greek word<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐντρεφόμενος</span></blu></grk> being a participle in the Middle Voice, might also have been translated in an active signification, <i>nourishing;</i> but as there is no noun governed by the verb, I think that this would be rather a forced construction; and, therefore, I prefer to take it in a passive sense, as confirming the preceding exhortation by the education of Timothy. As if he had said, “As thou hast been, from thy infancy, properly instructed in the faith, and, so to speak, hast sucked along with the milk sound doctrine, and hast made continual progress in it hitherto, endeavor, by faithful ministration, to prove that thou art such.” This meaning agrees also with the composition of the word<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐντρεφόμενος</span></blu></grk> </p>
<p><i>In the words of faith and of good doctrine. Faith</i> is here taken for the sum of Christian doctrine; and what he immediately adds, about <i>good doctrine,</i> is for the sake of explanation; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(73)</sup></span> for he means, that all other doctrines, how plausible so ever they may be, are not at all profitable. </p>
<p><i>Which thou hast followed</i> This clause denotes perseverance; for many who, from their childhood, had purely learned Christ, afterwards degenerate in process of time; and the Apostle says, that Timothy was very unlike these persons. </p>
