<p><b>12.</b><i>For our glorying is this.</i> He assigns a reason why his preservation should be a subject of interest to all — that he had conducted himself <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(258)</sup></span> among them all in<i>simplicity and sincerity</i> He deserved, therefore, to be dear to them, and it would have been very unfeeling not to be concerned in reference to such a servant of the Lord, that he might be long preserved for the benefit of the Church. “I have conducted myself before all in such a manner, that it is no wonder if I have the approbation and love of all good men.” He takes occasion from this, however, for the sake of those to whom he was writing, to make a digression for the purpose of declaring his own integrity. As, however, it is not enough to be approved of by man’s judgment, and as Paul himself was harassed by the unjust and malignant judgments of some, or rather by corrupt and blind attachments, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(259)</sup></span> he adduces his own conscience as his witness — which is all one as though he had cited God as a witness, or had made what he says matter of appeal to his tribunal. </p>
<p>But how does Paul’s glorying in his integrity comport with that statement, </p>
<p>He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord?<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:17">2 Corinthians 10:17</span>.) </p>
<p>Besides, who is so upright <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(260)</sup></span> as to dare to boast in the presence of God? In the first place, Paul does not oppose himself to God, as though he had anything that was his own, or that was from himself. Farther, he does not place the foundation of his salvation in that integrity to which he lays claim, nor does he make confidence in <i>that</i> the ground of his dependence. Lastly, he does not glory in God’s gifts in such a way as not at the same time to render all the glory to him as their sole Author, and ascribe everything to him. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(261)</sup></span> These three exceptions lay a foundation for every godly person glorying on good grounds in all God’s benefits; while the wicked, on the other hand, cannot glory even in God, except on false and improper grounds. Let us therefore, first of all, acknowledge ourselves to be indebted to God for everything good that we possess, claiming no merit to ourselves. Secondly, let us hold fast this foundation — that our dependence for salvation be grounded exclusively on the mercy of God. Lastly, let us repose ourselves <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(262)</sup></span> in the sole author of every blessing. Then in that there will be a pious <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(263)</sup></span> glorying in every kind of blessing. </p>
<p><i>That in the simplicity</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(264)</sup></span> <i>of God.</i> He employs the expression <i>simplicity of God</i> here, in the same way as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:23">Romans 3:23</span>, <i>the glory of God;</i> and in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:43">John 12:43</span>, <i>the glory of God and of men.</i> Those who love the <i>glory of men,</i> wish to appear something before men, or to stand well in the opinion of men. The <i>glory of God</i> is what a man has in the sight of God. Hence Paul does not reckon it enough to declare that his sincerity was perceived by men, but adds, that he was such in the sight of God. <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Εἰλικρινείᾳ</span></blu></grk> (which I have rendered <i>purity</i>) is closely connected with <i>simplicity;</i> for it is an open and upright way of acting, such as makes a man’s heart as it were transparent. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(265)</sup></span> Both terms stand opposed to craft, deception, and all underhand schemes. </p>
<p><i>Not in fleshly wisdom.</i> There is here a sort of anticipation; for what might be felt to be wanting in him he readily acknowledges, nay more, he openly proclaims, that he is destitute of, but adds, that he is endowed with what is incomparably more excellent — the <i>grace of God</i> “I acknowledge,” says he, “that I am destitute of <i>fleshly wisdom,</i> but I have been furnished with divine influence, and if any one is not satisfied with <i>that,</i> he is at liberty to depreciate my Apostleship. If, on the other hand, <i>fleshly wisdom</i> is of no value, then I want nothing that is not fitted to secure well-grounded praise.” He gives the name of <i>fleshly wisdom</i> to everything apart from Christ, that procures for us the reputation of <i>wisdom.</i> See the <i>first and second</i> chapters of the former epistle. Hence, by the grace of God, which is contrasted with it, we must understand everything that transcends man’s nature and capacity, and the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which openly manifested the power of God in the weakness of the flesh. </p>
<p><i>More abundantly towards you</i> Not that he had been less upright elsewhere, but that he had remained longer at Corinth, in order that he might (not to mention other purposes) afford a fuller and clearer proof of his integrity. He has, however, expressed himself intentionally in such a way as to intimate that he did not require evidences that were far-fetched, inasmuch as they were themselves the best witnesses of all that he had said. </p>

Thus acted Paul: thus acted the primitive Christians; and thus must every Christian act who expects to see God in his glory.” — <i>Dr. Adam Clarke</i>. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>

It is most probable that the <i>phrase</i> here denotes that sincerity which God produces and approves; and the sentiment is, that pure religion, the religion of God, produces entire sincerity in the heart. Its purposes and aims are open and manifest, <i>as if seen in the sunshine</i>. The plans of the world are obscure, deceitful, and dark, <i>as if in the night</i>. ” — <i>Barnes</i>.
