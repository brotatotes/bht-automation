<p><b>13.</b><i>For we write no other things</i> Here he indirectly reproves the false apostles, who recommended themselves by immoderate boastings, while they had little or no ground for it; and at the same time he obviates calumnies, in order that no one may object, that he claims for himself more than is his due. He says, therefore, that he does not in words boast of anything that he is not prepared to make good by deeds, and that, too, from the testimony of the Corinthians. </p>
<p>The ambiguity, however, of the words, has given occasion for this passage being misinterpreted. <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Αναγινώσκειν,</span></blu></grk> among the Greeks, signifies sometimes <i>to read,</i> and at other times <i>to recognize.</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Επιγινώσκειν</span></blu></grk> sometimes signifies <i>to discover,</i> while at other times it means what the Latins properly express by the verb <blu><i>agnoscere</i></blu> <i>,</i> to <i>own,</i> as among lawyers the phrase is used to <i>own a child</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(266)</sup></span> as Budaeus also has observed. In this way <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐπιγινώσκειν</span></blu></grk> means more than <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀναγινώσκειν</span></blu></grk> For we say that a person <i>recognises</i> a thing, that is, that being silently convinced of it in his judgment, he perceives it to be true, while at the same time he does not <i>acknowledge</i> it, or, in other words, cordially intimate his assent to it. </p>
<p>Let us now examine Paul’s words. Some read thus — <i>We write no other things than what ye read and acknowledge,</i> which it is very manifest is exceedingly lifeless, not to say senseless. For as to Ambrose’s qualifying the statement in this way — <i>You not only read, but also acknowledge,</i> there is no one that does not perceive that it is quite foreign to the import of the words. And the meaning that I have stated is plain, and hangs together naturally, and, up to this point, there is nothing to prevent readers from understanding it, were it not that they have had their eyes shut, from being misled by the different meanings of the word. The sum is this — that Paul declares, that he brings forward no other things than what were known and perceived by the Corinthians — nay more, things as to which they would bear him witness. The first term employed is <blu><i>recognoscere</i></blu> <i>,</i> (to <i>recognize,)</i> which is applicable, when persons are convinced from experience that matters are so. The second is <blu><i>agnoscere</i></blu> <i>,</i> (to <i>acknowledge,)</i> meaning that they give their assent to the truth. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(267)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>And, I hope, will acknowledge even to the end.</i> As the Corinthians had not yet perfectly returned to a sound mind, so as to be prepared to weigh his fidelity in a just and even balance, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(268)</sup></span> but at the same time had begun to abate somewhat of their perverse and malignant judgment respecting him, he intimates, that he hopes better as to the future. “You have already,” says he, “to some extent acknowledged me. I hope that you will acknowledge more and more what I have been among you, and in what manner I have conducted myself.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(269)</sup></span> From this it appears more clearly what he meant by the word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐπιγινώσκειν</span></blu></grk>. (<i>acknowledge</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(270)</sup></span>) Now this relates to a season of repentance, for they had at the beginning acknowledged him fully and thoroughly; afterwards their right judgment had been beclouded <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(271)</sup></span> by unfair statements, but they had at length begun to return in part to a sound mind. </p>
