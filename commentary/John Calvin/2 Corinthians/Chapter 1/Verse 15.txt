<p><b>15.</b><i>In this confidence.</i> After having given them reason to expect that he would come, he had subsequently changed his intention. This was made an occasion of calumny against him, as appears from the excuse that he brings forward. When he says that it was from relying on<i>this confidence</i> that he formed the purpose of coming to them, he indirectly throws the blame upon the Corinthians, inasmuch as they had, by their ingratitude, hindered, to some extent, his coming to them, by depriving him of <i>that confidence.</i> </p>
<p><i>That ye might have a second benefit</i> The first benefit had been this — that he had devoted himself for the entire period of <i>a year and six months</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:11">Acts 18:11</span>) to the work of gaining them to the Lord; the <i>second</i> was their being confirmed, by means of his coming to them, in the faith which they had once received, and being stirred up by his sacred admonitions to make farther progress. Of this latter benefit the Corinthians had deprived themselves, inasmuch as they had not allowed the apostle to come to them. They were paying, therefore, the penalty of their own fault, and they had no ground for imputing any blame to Paul. If any one, however, prefers, with Chrysostom, to take <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χάριν</span></blu></grk> <i>(benefit)</i> as used instead of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καράν</span></blu></grk> <i>, (joy,)</i> I do not much object to it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(275)</sup></span> The former interpretation, however, is more simple. </p>

It should seem to mean <i>benefit</i> generally, every spiritual advantage, or gratification from his society, imparted by his presence.” — <i>Bloomfield One</i> MS. reads <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χαράν</span></blu></grk> <i>Kypke</i>, who renders <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χάριν</span></blu></grk>, joy adduces instances in support of this meaning of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χάρι</span></blu></grk> ”, though acknowledged to be unusual, from <i>Plutarch</i>, <i>Polybius</i>, and <i>Euripides</i>.
