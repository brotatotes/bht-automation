<p><b>18.</b><i>God is faithful.</i> By the term <i>word</i> he means doctrine, as is manifest from the reason that he adds, when he says, that the <i>Son of God, who is preached by him, is not variable, etc.</i> As to his being always consistent with himself in point of doctrine, and not differing from himself, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(280)</sup></span> he intends that by this they shall form a judgment as to his integrity, and in this way he removes every unfavorable suspicion of fickleness or unfaithfulness. It does not, however, necessarily follow, that the man who is faithful in doctrine, is also observant of truth in all his <i>words.</i> But as Paul did not reckon it of much importance in what estimation he was held, provided only the majesty of his doctrine remained safe and sound, he, on that account, calls the attention of the Corinthians chiefly to that matter. He intimates, it is true, that he observed in his whole life the same course of fidelity, as the Corinthians had seen in his ministry. He seems, however, as if intentionally, in repelling the calumny, to transfer it from his person to his doctrine, because he was unwilling that his apostleship should be indirectly defamed, while he was not greatly concerned as to himself in other respects. </p>
<p>But observe, with what zeal he applies himself to this. For he calls God to witness, how simple and pure his preaching was — not ambiguous, not variable, not temporizing. In his oath, too, he connects the truth of God with the truth of his doctrine. “The truth of my preaching is as sure and stable as God is faithful and true.” Nor is this to be wondered at, for the word of God, which Isaiah says <i>endureth for ever,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:8">Isaiah 40:8</span>,) is no other than what prophets and apostles published to the world, as Peter explains it. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:25">1 Peter 1:25</span>.) Hence, too, his confidence <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(281)</sup></span> in denouncing a curse upon angels, if they dared to bring another gospel, one that was at variance with his. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span>.) Who would dare to make the angels of heaven subject to his doctrine, if he had not God as his authority and defense? With such an assurance of a good conscience does it become ministers <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(282)</sup></span> to be endowed, who mount the pulpit to speak the word in Christ’s name — so as to feel assured that their doctrine can no more be overthrown than God himself. </p>
