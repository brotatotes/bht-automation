<p><b>24.</b><i>Not that we exercise dominion</i> He anticipates an objection that might be brought forward. “What! Do you then act so tyrannically <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(305)</sup></span> as to be formidable in your very look? Such were not the gravity of a Christian pastor, but the cruelty of a savage tyrant.” He answers this objection first <i>indirectly,</i> by declaring that matters are not so; and afterwards <i>directly,</i> by showing that the very circumstance, that he had been constrained to treat them more harshly, was owing to his fatherly affection. When he says that he does not <i>exercise dominion over their faith,</i> he intimates, that such a power is unjust and intolerable — nay more, is tyranny in the Church. For faith ought to be altogether exempt, and to the utmost extent free, from the yoke of men. We must, however, observe, who it is that speaks, for if ever there was a single individual of mortals, that had authority to claim for himself such a <i>dominion,</i> Paul assuredly was worthy of such a privilege. Yet he acknowledges, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(306)</sup></span> that it does not belong to him. Hence we infer, that faith owns no subjection except to the word of God, and that it is not at all in subjection to human control. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(307)</sup></span> Erasmus has observed in his Annotations, that by supplying the Greek particle <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἕνεκα</span></blu></grk>, it may be understood in this way — <i>Not that we exercise dominion over you</i> — <i>with respect to your faith</i> — <i>a</i> rendering which amounts almost to the same thing. For he intimates, that there is no spiritual dominion, except that of God only. This always remains a settled point — pastors have no peculiar <i>dominion</i> over men’s consciences, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(308)</sup></span> inasmuch as they are ministers, <i>not lords.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:3">1 Peter 5:3</span>.) </p>
<p>What then does he leave to himself and others? He calls them<i>helpers of their joy</i> — by which term I understand <i>happiness.</i> At the same time he employs the term <i>joy</i> as opposed to the terror which tyrants awaken through means of their cruelty, and also false prophets, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(309)</sup></span> resembling tyrants, that <i>rule with rigor and authority,</i> as we read in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:4">Ezekiel 34:4</span>. He argues from contraries, that he did by no means usurp dominion over the Corinthians, inasmuch as he endeavored rather to maintain them in the possession of a peace that was free, and full of joy. </p>
<p><i>For by faith ye stand.</i> As to the reason why he adds this, others either pass it over altogether in silence, or they do not explain it with sufficient distinctness. For my part, I am of opinion that he here again argues from contraries. For if the nature and effect of faith be such that we lean, in order that we may <i>stand</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(310)</sup></span> it is absurd to speak of faith as being subject to men. Thus he removes that unjust dominion, with which, he had a little before declared, he was not chargeable. </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(307)</span> The views here expressed by Calvin are severely animadverted upon in the following terms by the Romanists, in the Annotations appended to the Rheims version of the New Testament: “Calvin and his seditious sectaries with other like which <i>despise dominion</i>, as St. Jude describeth such, would by this place deliver themselves from all yoke of spiritual Magistrates and Rulers: namely, that they be subject to no man touching their faith, or for the examination and trial of their doctrine, but to God and his word only. And no marvel that the malefactors and rebels of the Church would come to no tribunal but God’s, that so they may remain unpunished at least during this life. For though the Scriptures plainely condemne their heresies, yet they could writhe themselves out by false glosses, constructions, corruptions, and denials of the bookes to be canonical, if there were no lawes or judicial sentences of men to rule and represse them.” To these statements Dr. Fulke in his elaborate work in refutation of the errors of Popery, (Lond. 1601,) p. 559, appropriately replies as follows: “This is nothing els but a lewd and senselesse slander of Calvin and vs, that we despise lordship, because we will not be subject to the tyranny of Antichrist, that would be Lord of our faith, and arrogateth vnto himselfe auctoritie to make new articles of fayth, which have no ground or warrant in the word of God. But CALVIN did willingly acknowledge all auctoritie of the ministers of the Church, which the Scripture doth allow unto them, and both practiced, and submitted himselfe to the discipline of the Church, and the lawful gouernours thereof, although he would not yield unto the tyrannicall yoke of the Pope, who is neither soueraigne of the Church, nor any true member of the same. Yea, Calvin and we submit ourselves, not only to the auctoritie of the Church, but also of the Ciuile Magistrates to be punished, if we shall be found to teach or doe any thing contrary to the doctrine of faith, receyued and approved by the Church, whereas the Popish clergy, in causes of religion, will not be subject to the temporal gouernors, judgement, and correction.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
