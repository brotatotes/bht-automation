<p><b>3</b><i>Blessed be God</i> He begins (as has been observed) with this thanksgiving — partly for the purpose of extolling the goodness of God — partly, with the view of animating the Corinthians by his example to the resolute endurance of persecutions; and partly, that he may magnify himself in a strain of pious glorying, in opposition to the malignant slanderings of the false apostles. For such is the depravity of the world, that it treats with derision martyrdoms, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(217)</sup></span> which it ought to have held in admiration, and endeavours to find matter of reproach in the splendid trophies of the pious. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(218)</sup></span> <i>Blessed be God,</i> says he. On what account? <i>who comforteth</i> us <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(219)</sup></span> — the relative being used instead of the causal particle. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(220)</sup></span> He had endured his tribulations with fortitude and alacrity: this fortitude he ascribes to God, because it was owing to support derived from his consolation that he had not fainted. </p>
<p>He calls him the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ<i>,</i> and not without good reason, where blessings are treated of; for where Christ is not, <i>there</i> the beneficence of God is not. On the other hand, where Christ intervenes, </p>
<p>by whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,<br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:15">Ephesians 3:15</span>,) </br></p>
<p><i>there</i> are all mercies and all consolations of God — nay, more, <i>there</i> is fatherly love, the fountain from which everything else flows. </p>
