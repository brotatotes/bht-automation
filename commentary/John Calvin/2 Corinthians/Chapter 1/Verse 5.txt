<p><b>5.</b><i>For as the sufferings of Christ abound</i> — <i>This</i> statement may be explained in two ways — actively and passively. If you take it <i>actively,</i> the meaning will be this: “The more I am tried with various afflictions, so much the more resources have I for comforting others.” I am, however, more inclined to take it in a <i>passive</i> sense, as meaning that God multiplied his consolations according to the measure of his tribulations. David also acknowledges that it had been thus with him: </p>
<p>According to the multitude, says he, of my anxieties within me,<br/>thy consolations have delighted my soul. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+94:19">Psalms 94:19</span>.) </p>
<p>In Paul’s words, however, there is a fuller statement of doctrine; for the afflictions of the pious he calls the <i>sufferings of Christ,</i> as he says elsewhere, </p>
<p>that he fills up in his body what is wanting in the<br/>sufferings of Christ. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>.) </p>
<p>The miseries and vexations, it is true, of the present life are common to good and bad alike, but when they befall the wicked, they are tokens of the curse of God, because they arise from sin, and nothing appears in them except the anger of God and participation with Adam, which cannot but depress the mind. But in the mean time believers are conformed to Christ, and </p>
<p>bear about with them in their body his dying, that the life of Christ may one day be manifested in them. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:10">2 Corinthians 4:10</span>.) </p>
<p>I speak of the afflictions which they endure <i>for the testimony of Christ,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span>,) for although the Lord’s chastisements, with which he chastises their sins, are beneficial to them, they are, nevertheless, not partakers, properly speaking, of Christ’s sufferings, except in those cases in which they <i>suffer on his account,</i> as we find in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:13">1 Peter 4:13</span>. Paul’s meaning then is, that God is always present with him in his tribulations, and that his infirmity is sustained by the consolations of Christ, so as to prevent him from being overwhelmed with calamities. </p>
