<p><b>8.</b><i>For I would not have you ignorant</i> He makes mention of the greatness and difficulty of his conflicts, that the glory of victory may thereby the more abundantly appear. Since the time of his sending them the former epistle, he had been exposed to great dangers, and had endured violent assaults. The probability, however, is that he refers here to the history, which Luke relates in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:23">Acts 19:23</span>, though in that passage he does not so distinctly intimate the extent of the danger. As, however, he states that <i>the whole city was in a tumult,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span>,) it is easy from this to infer the rest. For we know what is the usual effect of a popular tumult, when it has been once kindled. By this persecution Paul declares he had been oppressed <i>beyond measure,</i> nay more, <i>above strength,</i> that is, so as not to be able to endure the burden. For it is a metaphor taken from persons who give way under the pressure of a heavy load, or from ships that sink from being overladen — not that he had actually fainted, but that he felt that his strength would have failed him, if the Lord had not imparted fresh strength. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(238)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>So that we were in anxiety even as to life itself</i> — that is, “So that I thought life was gone, or at least I had very little hope of it remaining, as those are wont to feel who are shut up so as to see no way of escape.” Was then so valiant a soldier of Christ, so brave a wrestler, left without strength, so as to look for nothing but death? <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(239)</sup></span> For he mentions it as the reason of what he had stated — that he <i>despaired of life.</i> I have already observed, that Paul does not measure his strength in connection with help from God, but according to his own personal feeling of his ability. Now there can be no doubt, that all human strength must give way before the fear of death. Farther, it is necessary that even saints themselves should be in danger of an entire failure of strength, that, being put in mind of their own weakness, they may learn, agreeably to what follows, to place their entire dependence on God alone. At the same time I have preferred to explain the word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐξαπορεῖσθαι</span></blu></grk>, which is made use of by Paul, as denoting a <i>trembling anxiety,</i> rather than render it, as Erasmus has done by the word <i>despair;</i> because he simply means, that he was hemmed in by the greatest difficulties, so that no means of preserving life seemed to remain. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(240)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(238)</span> “<i>Pressed above measure</i>. (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καθ ᾿ ὑπερβολὴν ἐβαρήςθημεν</span></blu></grk>.) The words <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">βάρος</span></blu></grk> and <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">βάρουμαι</span></blu></grk>, are applied sometimes to the enduring of a burden, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:12">Matthew 20:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:2">Galatians 6:2</span>,) whether it be a temporal burden or spiritual [...] In this place it seemeth to be taken from porters, who have a burden imposed upon them, more than they are able to stand under; or as Chrysostom, from ships which are over much burdened, and so are in danger of being lost. And as if there were not emphasis enough in the word pressed, he addeth another to aggravate it — (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καθ ᾿ ὑπερβολήν</span></blu></grk>) — <i>above measure</i> — <i>Above strength</i>. (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑπὲρ δύναμιν</span></blu></grk>.) Chrysostom observeth this differeth from the other. For a burden may be exceeding heavy, yet to some mighty man it may not be above his strength. When <i>Samson</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jdg+16:3">Judges 16:3</span>) carried away the gates of the city Gaza, with the posts and barre upon his shoulders, here was a burden out of measure heavy; no ordinary man could do so; but yet to <i>Samson</i> it was not above his strength. Thus it was with Paul, who may be called a <i>spiritual Samson</i>, for that heavenly might and power which God had endowed him with; he is assaulted with a trouble that was not only <i>hyperbolically weighty</i>, but also <i>above his strength</i>. Paul had no more power to stand under it.” — Burgesse on <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:0">2 Corinthians 1:0</span>, pp. 269, 270, 278. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(240)</span> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Εξαπορεῖσθαι</span></blu></grk> properly signifies to be utterly at a stand, not knowing how to proceed. — In <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+88:8">Psalms 88:8</span>, where David says — <i>I am shut up, and I cannot come forth</i>, the Hebrew words <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">ולא</span></blu> <blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">אצא</span></blu></heb> (<i>velo etse</i>,) are rendered in the Septuagint — <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καὶ οὐκ ἐξεπορευόμην</span></blu></grk> — <i>and I could not come forth</i>. It is worthy of notice that, in the metre version, the idea expressed by Calvin, as implied in the verb <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐξαπορεῖσθαι</span></blu></grk>, is fully brought out — “find no evasion for me.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
