<p><b>9.</b><i>Nay more, we had the sentence of death</i> This is as though we should say — “I had already laid my account with dying, or had regarded it as a thing fixed.” He borrows, however, a similitude from those who are under sentence of death, and look for nothing but the hour when they are to die. At the same time he says, that this sentence had been pronounced by him upon himself, by which he intimates, that it was in his own view that he had been sentenced to death — that he might not seem to have had it from any revelation from God. In this <i>sentence,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(241)</sup></span> therefore, there is something more implied than in the feeling of <i>anxiety</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐξαπορεῖσθαι)</span></blu></grk> that he had made mention of, because in the former case there was despair of life, but in this case there is certain death. We must, however, take notice, chiefly, of what he adds as to the design — that he had been reduced to this extremity, <i>that he might not trust in himself</i> For I do not agree with what Chrysostom says — that the Apostle did not stand in need of such a remedy, but set himself forth to others as a pattern merely in appearance. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(242)</sup></span> For he was a man that was <i>subject,</i> in other respects, <i>to like passions</i> as other men — (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:17">James 5:17</span>) — not merely to cold and heat, but also to misdirected confidence, rashness, and the like. I do not say that he was addicted to these vices, but this I say, that he was capable of being tempted to them, and that this was the remedy that God seasonably interposed, that they might not make their way into his mind. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(243)</sup></span> </p>
<p>There are, accordingly, two things to be observed here. In the <i>first</i> place — that the fleshly confidence with which we are puffed up, is so obstinate, that it cannot be overthrown in any other way than by our falling into utter despair. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(244)</sup></span> For as the flesh is proud, it does not willingly give way, and never ceases to be insolent until it has been constrained; nor are we brought to true submission, until we have been brought down by the <i>mighty hand of God.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:6">1 Peter 5:6</span>.) <i>Secondly,</i> it is to be observed, that the saints themselves have some remains of this disease adhering to them, and that for this reason they are often reduced to an extremity, that, stript of all self-confidence, they may learn humility: nay more, that this malady is so deeply rooted in the minds of men, that even the most advanced are not thoroughly purged from it, until God sets death before their eyes. And hence we may infer, how displeasing to God confidence in ourselves must be, when for the purpose of correcting it, it is necessary that we should be condemned to death. </p>
<p><i>But in God that raiseth the dead</i> As we must first die, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(245)</sup></span> in order that, renouncing confidence in ourselves, and conscious of our own weakness, we may claim no honor to ourselves, so even that were not sufficient, if we did not proceed a step farther. Let us begin, therefore, with despairing of ourselves, but with the view of placing our hope in God. Let us be brought low in ourselves, but in order that we may be raised up by his power. Paul, accordingly, having brought to nothing the pride of the flesh, immediately substitutes in its place a confidence that rests upon God.<i>Not in ourselves,</i> says he,<i>but in God</i> </p>
<p>The epithet that follows, Paul has adapted to the connection of the subject, as he does in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:17">Romans 4:17</span>, where he speaks of Abraham. For to </p>
<p>believe in God, who calleth those things that are not, as though they were, and to hope in God who raiseth the dead, </p>
<p>are equivalent to his setting before him as an object of contemplation, the power of God in creating his elect out of nothing, and raising up the dead. Hence Paul says, that death had been set before his eyes, that he might, in consequence of this, recognize the more distinctly the power of God, by which he had been raised up from the dead. The first thing in order, it is true, is this — that, by means of the strength with which God furnishes us, we should acknowledge him as the Author of life; but as in consequence of our dulness the light of life often dazzles our eyes, it is necessary that we should be brought to God by having death presented to our view. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(246)</sup></span> </p>

[...] The most genuine translation is <i>sentence</i>; for so Hesychius expounds the word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κατακριςμα</span></blu></grk> — <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ψὢφο</span></blu></grk> ”, whom <i>Favorinus</i> followeth <i>verbatim</i> in this, as in many other particulars. [...] The word then doth signifie a <i>sentence</i> passing upon him, <i>that he must die</i>. This he had received, but from whom? Not from God, for God delivered him; nor from the magistrate; there was no such decree that we read of against him. Therefore it was onely from his own feares, his own thoughts, which maketh him say — <i>he had received it in himself</i>. [...] God’s thoughts were other than Paul’s. Paul absolutely concluded he should die, but God had purposed the contrary.” — <i>Burgesse</i>. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
