<p><b>14.</b><i>For we do not overstretch.</i> He alludes to persons who either forcibly stretch out their arms, or raise themselves up on their feet, when wishing to catch hold of what is not at their hand, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(784)</sup></span> for of this nature is a greedy thirst for glory, nay more, it is often more disgusting. For ambitious persons do not merely stretch out their arms and lift up their feet, but are even carried headlong with the view of obtaining some pretext for glorying. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(785)</sup></span> He tacitly intimates that his rivals were of this stamp. He afterwards declares on what ground he had come to the Corinthians — because he had founded their church by his ministry. Hence he says, <i>in the gospel of Christ;</i> for he had not come to them empty, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(786)</sup></span> but had been the first to bring the gospel to them. The preposition <i>in</i> is taken by some in another way; for they render it, <i>by</i> the gospel, and this meaning does not suit ill. At the same time, Paul seems to set off to advantage his coming to the Corinthians, on the ground of his having been furnished with so precious a gift. </p>
