<p><b>17.</b><i>But he that glorieth</i> This statement is made by way of correction, as his glorying might be looked upon as having the appearance of empty boasting. Hence he cites himself and others before the judgment-seat of God, saying, that those glory on good grounds, who are approved by God. To <i>glory in the Lord,</i> however, is used here in a different sense from what it bears in the first chapter of the former Epistle, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:31">1 Corinthians 1:31</span>,) and in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+9:24">Jeremiah 9:24</span>. For in those passages it means — to recognize God as the author of all blessings, in such a way that every blessing is ascribed to his grace, while men do not extol themselves, but glorify him alone. Here, however, it means — to place our glory at the disposal of God alone, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(789)</sup></span> and reckon every thing else as of no value. For while some are dependent on the estimation of men, and weigh themselves in the false balance of public opinion, and others are deceived by their own arrogance, Paul exhorts us to be emulous of this glow — that we may please the Lord, by whose judgment we all stand or fall. </p>
<p>Even heathens say, that true glory consists in an upright <i>conscience.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(790)</sup></span> Now that is so much, but it is not all; for, as almost all are blind through excessive self-love, we cannot safely place confidence in the estimate that we form of ourselves. For we must keep in mind what he says elsewhere, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:4">1 Corinthians 4:4</span>,) that he is not conscious to himself of anything wrong, and yet is <i>not thereby justified.</i> What then? Let us know, that to God alone must be reserved the right of passing judgment upon us; for we are not competent judges in our own cause. This meaning is confirmed by what follows — </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(789)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Eta ce qu’il en iugera</span></blu>;” — “And according as he will judge of it.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(790)</span> “The heathens, though they could never attain to a true, spiritually sanctified, conscience, yet to live according to the natural dictates thereof, they accounted the only happiness, <blu><i>Nil conscire sibi</i></blu> (<i>To be conscious to one’s self of no crime,</i> Hor. <b>Ep. 1:1, 61</b>,) was the only thing that made happy Pindar called it, <i>the good nurse in our old age.</i> So great a matter is it to have the testimony of a good conscience, void of offense, for that is <blu><i>mille testes</i></blu> — <i>more</i> than all the testimonies in the <i>world.</i> ” — <i>Burgesse</i> on <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:0">2 Corinthians 1:0</span>. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
