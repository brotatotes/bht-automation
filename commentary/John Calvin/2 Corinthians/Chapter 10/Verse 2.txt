<p><b>2.</b><i>I beseech you, that I may not be bold, when I am present.</i> Some think, that the discourse is incomplete, and that he does not express the matter of his request. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(746)</sup></span> I am rather of opinion, however, that what was wanting in the former clause is here completed, so that it is a general exhortation. “Show yourselves docile and tractable towards me, that I may not be constrained to be more severe.” It is the duty of a good pastor to allure his sheep peacefully and kindly, that they may allow themselves to be governed, rather than to constrain them by violence. Severity, it is true, is, I acknowledge, sometimes necessary, but we must always set out with <i>gentleness,</i> and persevere in it, so long as the hearer shews himself tractable. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(747)</sup></span> Severity must be the last resource. “We must,” says he, “try all methods, before having recourse to rigor; nay more, let us never be rigorous, unless we are constrained to it.” In the mean time, as to their reckoning themselves pusillanimous and timid, when he had to come to close quarters, he intimates that they were mistaken as to this, when he declares that he will stoutly resist face to face the contumacious <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(748)</sup></span> “They despise me,” says he, “as if I were a pusillanimous person, but they will find that I am braver and more courageous than they could have wished, when they come to contend in good earnest.” From this we see, <i>when</i> it is time to act with severity — after we have found, on trial being made, that allurements and mildness have no good effect. “I shall do it with reluctance,” says Paul, “but still I have determined to do it.” Here is an admirable medium; for as we must, in so far as is in our power, <i>draw</i> men rather than <i>drive</i> them, so, when mildness has no effect, in dealing with those that are stern and refractory, rigor must of necessity be resorted to: otherwise it will not be moderation, nor equableness of temper, but criminal cowardice. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(749)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>Who account of us.</i> Erasmus renders it — “Those who think that we walk, as it were, according to the flesh.” The Old Interpreter came nearer, in my opinion, to Paul’s true meaning — “<blu>Qui nos arbitrantur, tanquam secundum carnem ambulemus</blu>;” — (“Those who think of us as though we walked according to the flesh;” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(750)</sup></span>) though, at the same time, the phrase is not exactly in accordance with the Latin idiom, nor does it altogether bring out the Apostle’s full meaning. For <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">λογιζεσθαι</span></blu></grk> is taken here to mean — <i>reckoning</i> or <i>esteeming.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(751)</sup></span> “They think of us,” says Paul, “or they take this view of us, as though we walked according to the flesh.” </p>
<p><i>To walk according to the flesh,</i> Chrysostom explains to mean — acting unfaithfully, or conducting one’s self improperly in his office; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(752)</sup></span> and, certainly, it is taken in this sense in various instances in Paul’s writings. The term <i>flesh,</i> however, I rather understand to mean — outward pomp or show, by which alone the false Apostles are accustomed to recommend themselves. Paul, therefore, complains of the unreasonableness of those who looked for nothing in him except the <i>flesh,</i> that is, visible appearance, as they speak, or in the usual manner of persons who devote all their efforts to ambition. For as Paul did not by any means excel in such endowments, as ordinarily procure praise or reputation among the <i>children of this world,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:8">Luke 16:8</span>,) he was despised as though he had been one of the common herd. But by whom? <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(753)</sup></span> Certainly, by the ambitious, who estimated him from mere appearance, while they paid no regard to what lay concealed within. </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(750)</span> Wiclif (1380) renders it: “that demen” (i.e., <i>judge</i>) “<i>us</i> as if we wandren aftir the fleisch.” Tyndale (1534,) Cranmer (1539,) and Geneva (1557,) read as follows: “which repute us as though we walked carnally.” Rheims (1582) — “which thinke us as though we walke according to the flesh.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(751)</span> “The sense is, ‘I entreat, I say, that I may not have to be bold when I am <i>present,</i> with that confidence, wherewith I intend to be bold against certain, who regard me as <i>walking after the flesh,’ i.e.,</i> guided by worldly principles. There seems to be a <i>paraniomasia</i> in <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">λογίζομαι</span></blu></grk> and <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">λογιζομένους,</span></blu></grk> which, if introduced into English, may perhaps be best expressed by <i>reckon.</i> ” — <i>Bloomfield.</i> — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
