<p><b>9</b><i>That I may not seem to terrify</i>. Again he touches on the calumny which he had formerly refuted, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:2">2 Corinthians 10:2</span>,) that he was bold in his writings, while in their presence his courage failed him. On this pretext they disparaged his writings. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(769)</sup></span> “What!” Said they, “will he terrify us by letters when at a distance, while, if present with us, he would scarcely venture to mutter a word!” Lest, therefore, his letters should have less weight, he answers, that no objection is advanced against him, that should either destroy or weaken his credit, and that of his doctrine, for <i>deeds</i> were not to be less valued than <i>words</i>. He was not less powerful in actions when present, than he was by words when absent. Hence it was unfair, that his bodily presence should be looked upon as contemptible. By <i>deed</i>, here, he means, in my opinion, the efficacy and success of his preaching, as well as the excellences that were worthy of an Apostle, and his whole manner of life. <i>Speech</i>, on the other hand, denotes — not the very substance of doctrine, but simply the form of it, and the bark, so to speak: for he would have contended for doctrine with greater keeness. The contempt, however, proceeded from this — that he was deficient in that ornament and splendor of eloquence, which secures favor. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(770)</sup></span> </p>
