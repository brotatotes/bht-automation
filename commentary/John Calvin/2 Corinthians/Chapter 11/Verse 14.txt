<p><b>14.</b><i>And no marvel</i> It is an argument from the greater to the less. “If Satan, who is the basest of all beings, nay, the head and chief of all wicked persons, transforms himself, what will his ministers do?<i>”</i> We have experience of both every day, for when Satan tempts us to evil, he does not profess to be what he really is. For he would lose his object, if we were made aware of his being a mortal enemy, and opposer of our salvation. Hence he always makes use of some cloak for the purpose of insnaring us, and does not immediately <i>show his horns,</i> (as the common expression is,) but rather makes it his endeavor to appear as an<i>angel</i> Even when he tempts us to gross crimes, he makes use, nevertheless, of some pretext that he may draw us, when we are off our guard, into his nets. What then, if he attacks us under the appearance of good, nay, under the very title of God? His life-guards imitate, as I have said, the same artifice. These are golden preambles — “Vicar of Christ” — “Successor of Peter” — “Servant of God’s servants,” but let the masks be pulled off, and who and what will the Pope be discovered to be? Scarcely will Satan himself, his master, surpass so accomplished a scholar in any kind of abomination. It is a well known saying as to Babylon, that she gives poison to drink in a golden cup. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:7">Jeremiah 51:7</span>.) Hence we must be on our guard against masks. </p>
<p>Should any one now ask, “Shall we then regard all with suspicion?” I answer, that the Apostle did not by any means intend this; for there are marks of discrimination, which it were the part of stupidity, not of prudence, to overlook. He was simply desirous to arouse our attention, that we may not straightway judge of the lion from the skin <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(835)</sup></span> For if we are not hasty in forming a judgment, the Lord will order it so that the ears of the animal will be discovered ere long. Farther, he was desirous in like manner to admonish us, in forming an estimate of Christ’s servants, not to regard masks, but to seek after what is of more importance. <i>Ministers of righteousness</i> is a Hebraism for <i>faithful and upright persons.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(836)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(835)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Comme porte le prouerbe des Latins</span></blu>;” — “As the proverb in use among the Latins runs.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(836)</span> <i>Beza</i> takes the same view of this expression: “<blu>Nec enim illi dicuntur sese transfigurare in Satanam, sed in ministros propos et integros, quibus opponuntur</blu> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δόλιοι</span></blu></grk> <i>.</i> <blu>Hoc enim declarat epitheton</blu> <blu><i>justitiae</i></blu> <blu>ex Hebraeorum idiotismo</blu>;” — “For they are not said to transform themselves into Satan, but into ministers, who are honest and upright, as contrasted with those who are (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δόλιοι)</span></blu></grk> <i>deceitful.</i> For this is the import of the epithet, <i>of righteousness,</i> according to the Hebrew idiom.” Another instance of the same Hebrew idiom is noticed by Calvin in p. 196. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
