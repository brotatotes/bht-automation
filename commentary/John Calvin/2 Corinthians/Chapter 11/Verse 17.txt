<p><b>17.</b><i>What I speak, I speak not after the Lord</i> His disposition, it is true, had an eye to God, but the outward appearance <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(838)</sup></span> might seem unsuitable to a servant of the Lord. At the same time, the things that Paul confesses respecting himself, he, on the other hand, condemns in the false Apostles. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(839)</sup></span> For it was not his intention to praise himself, but simply to contrast himself with them, with the view of humbling them. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(840)</sup></span> Hence he transfers to his own person what belonged to them, that he may thus open the eyes of the Corinthians. What I have rendered <i>boldness,</i> is in the Greek <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑπόστασις</span></blu></grk> <i>,</i> as to the meaning of which term we have spoken in the ninth chapter. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:4">2 Corinthians 9:4</span>.) <i>Subject-matter</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(841)</sup></span> or <i>substance,</i> unquestionably, would not be at all suitable here. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(842)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(838)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">La facon exterieure en laquelle il procede</span></blu>;” — “The outward manner in which he goes to work.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(839)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">C’est plustos afin de lea condemner es faux-Apostres</span></blu>;” — “It is rather with the view of condemning them in the false Apostles.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(840)</span> <sup>“</sup><blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Afin de leur abbaisser le coquet</span></blu> :” — “With the view of bringing down their talk.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(841)</span> Calvin refers here to the rendering of Erasmus, and of the Vulgate. The term employed by Erasmus is <blu><i>argumenturm</i></blu> (<i>subject-matter.</i>) In accordance with this, Cranmer’s version (1539) reads, “in this <i>matter</i> of boastinge.” The Vulgate makes use of the term <blu><i>substantia</i></blu> <i>,</i> (<i>substance.</i>) Wiclif (1380) reads, “in this substance of glorie” The Rheims version (1582), “in this substance of glorying.” — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(842)</span> <sup>“</sup><blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Certes il ne conueniendroit pas bien yci de traduire</span></blu> <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">matiere</span></i></blu> <blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">ou</span></blu> <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">substance,</span></i></blu> <blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">combien que le mot signifie quelque fois cela</span></blu>;” — “Certainly it would not be suitable here to render it <i>subject-matter</i> or <i>substance,</i> though the word sometimes bears that meaning.” </p>
