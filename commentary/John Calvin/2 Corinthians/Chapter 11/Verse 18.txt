<p><b>18.</b><i>Since many glory.</i> The meaning <i>is</i> — Should any one say to me, by way of objection, that what I do is faulty, what then as to others? Are not they my leaders? Am I alone, or am I the first, in <i>glorying according to the flesh?</i> Why should that be reckoned praiseworthy in <i>them,</i> that is imputed to me as a fault?” So far then is Paul from ambition in recounting his own praises, that he is contented to be blamed on that account, provided he exposes the vanity of the false apostles. </p>
<p><i>To glory after the flesh,</i> is to boast one’s self, rather in what has a tendency towards show, than in a good conscience. For the term <i>flesh,</i> here, has a reference to the world — when we seek after praise from outward masks, which have a showy appearance before the world, and are regarded as excellent. In place of this term he had a little before made use of the expression — <i>in appearance.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:7">2 Corinthians 10:7</span>.) </p>
