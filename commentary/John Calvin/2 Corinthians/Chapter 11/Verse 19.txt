<p><b>19.</b><i>For ye bear with fools willingly.</i> He calls them <i>wise</i> — in my opinion, <i>ironically.</i> He was despised by them, which could not have been, had they not been puffed up with the greatest arrogance <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(843)</sup></span> He says, therefore — “Since you are so wise, act the part of wise men in bearing with me, whom you treat with contempt, as you would a <i>fool.”</i> Hence I infer, that this discourse is not addressed to all indiscriminately, but some particular persons are reproved, who conducted themselves in an unkind manner. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(844)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(843)</span> <sup>“</sup><blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">D’vne merueilleuse arrogance</span></blu>;” — “With an amazing arrogance.” </p>
