<p><b>22.</b>He now, by enumerating particular instances, lets them see more distinctly, that he would not by any means be found inferior, if matters came to a contest. And in the first place, he makes mention of the glory of his <i>descent,</i> of which his rivals chiefly vaunted. “If,” says he, “they boast of illustrious <i>descent,</i> I shall be on a level with them, for I also am an <i>Israelite,</i> of the <i>seed of Abraham.”</i> This is a silly and empty boast, and yet Paul makes use of <i>three</i> terms to express it; nay more, he specifies, as it were, <i>three</i> different marks of excellence. By this repetition, in my opinion, he indirectly reproves their folly, inasmuch as they placed the sum-total <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(852)</sup></span> of their excellence in a thing that was so trivial, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(853)</sup></span> and this boasting was incessantly in their mouth, so as to be absolutely disgusting, as vain men are accustomed to pour forth empty bravadoes as to a mere nothing. </p>
<p>As to the term <i>Hebrews,</i> it appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:15">Genesis 11:15</span>, that it denotes descent, and is derived from <i>Heber;</i> and farther, it is probable, that Abraham himself is so called in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:13">Genesis 14:13</span>, in no other sense than this — that he was descended from that ancestor. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(854)</sup></span> Not altogether without some appearance of truth is the conjecture of those, who explain the term to mean <i>those dwelling beyond the river.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(855)</sup></span> We do not read, it is true, that any one was called so before Abraham, who had <i>passed over the river,</i> when he quitted his native country, and afterwards the appellation came to be a customary one among his posterity, as appears from the history of Joseph. The termination, however, shows that it is expressive of descent, and the passage, that I have quoted, abundantly confirms it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(856)</sup></span> </p>

The name Israelite denoted properly one descended from Israel or Jacob, and the difference between them was, that the name Israelite, being a patronymic derived from one of the founders of their nation, was in use among themselves; the name <i>Hebrew</i> was applied by the Canaanite to them, as having come from <i>beyond</i> the river, and was the current name among foreign tribes and nations.” — <i>Barnes.</i> — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
