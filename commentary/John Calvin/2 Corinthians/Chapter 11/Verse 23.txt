<p><b>23.</b><i>Are they ministers of Christ?</i> Now when he is treating of matters truly praiseworthy, he is no longer satisfied with being on an equality with them, but exalts himself above them. For their carnal glories he has previously been scattering like smoke by a breath of wind, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(857)</sup></span> by placing in opposition to them those which he had of a similar kind; but as they had nothing of solid worth, he on good grounds separates himself from their society, when he has occasion to glory in good earnest. For to be a <i>servant of Christ</i> is a thing that is much more honorable and illustrious, than to be the first-born among all the first-born of Abraham’s posterity. Again, however, with the view of providing against calumnies, he premises that he <i>speaks as a fool</i> “Imagine this,” says he, “to be foolish boasting: it is, nevertheless, true.” </p>
<p><i>In labors.</i> By these things he proves that he is a more eminent servant of Christ, and <i>then</i> truly we have a proof that may be relied upon, when <i>deeds</i> instead of <i>words</i> are brought forward. He uses the term <i>labors</i> here in the plural number, and afterwards <i>labor</i> What difference there is between the former and the latter I do not see, unless perhaps it be, that he speaks here in a more general way, including those things that he afterwards enumerates in detail. In the same way we may also understand the term <i>deaths</i> to mean any kind of <i>perils</i> that in a manner threatened present death, instances of which he afterwards specifies. “I have given proof of myself in <i>deaths often,</i> in <i>labors</i> oftener still.” He had made use of the term <i>deaths</i> in the same sense in the first chapter.
