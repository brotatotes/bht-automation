<p><b>25.</b><i>Thrice was I beaten with rods</i> Hence it appears, that the Apostle suffered many things, of which no mention is made by Luke; for he makes mention of only <i>one</i> stoning, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(861)</sup></span> one scourging, and <i>one</i> shipwreck. We have not, however, a complete narrative, nor is there mention made in it of every particular that occurred, but only of the principal things. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(861)</span> “<i>Once</i> was I stoned.” Paley remarks in his “Horae Paulinae,” that this clause, “when confronted with the history,” (contained in the Acts of the Apostles,) “furnishes the nearest approach to a contradiction, without a contradiction being actually incurred, of any that he remembers to have met with.” While the narrative contained in the Acts of the Apostles gives an account of only one instance in which Paul was actually stoned, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:19">Acts 14:19</span>,) there was, previously to that, “an assault” made upon Paul and Barnabas at Iconium, “both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews, with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, but they were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:5">Acts 14:5</span>.) “Now had the ‘assault,’” says Paley, “been completed; had the history related that a stone was thrown, as it relates that preparations were made both by Jews and Gentiles to stone Paul and his companions; or even had the account of this transaction stopped, without going on to inform us that Paul and his companions were <i>aware of their danger and fled, a</i> contradiction between the history and the Apostle would have ensued. Truth is necessarily consistent; but it is scarcely possible that independent accounts, not having truth to guide them, should thus advance to the very brink of contradiction without falling into <i>it.</i> ” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
