<p>By fastings I understand those that are voluntary, as he has spoken previously of <i>hunger</i> and <i>want.</i> Such were the tokens by which he showed himself, and on good grounds, to be an eminent servant of Christ. For how may we better distinguish Christ’s servants than by proofs so numerous, so various, and so important? On the other hand, while those effeminate boasters <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(862)</sup></span> had done nothing for Christ, and had suffered nothing for him, they, nevertheless, impudently vaunted. </p>
<p>It is asked, however, whether any one can be a servant of Christ, that has not been tried with so many evils, perils, and vexations? I answer, that all these things are not indispensably requisite on the part of all; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(863)</sup></span> but where these things are seen, there is, undoubtedly, a greater and more illustrious testimony afforded. That man, therefore, who will be signalized by so many marks of distinction, will not despise those that are less illustrious, and less thoroughly tried, nor will he on that account be elated with pride; but still, whenever there is occasion for it, he will be prepared, after Paul’s example, to exult with a holy triumph, in opposition to pretenders <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(864)</sup></span> and worthless persons, provided he has an eye to Christ, not to himself — for nothing but pride or ambition could corrupt and tarnish all these praises. For the main thing is — that we serve Christ with a pure <i>conscience.</i> All other things are, as it were, additional. </p>
