<p><b>28.</b><i>Besides those things that are without</i> “<i>Besides those things,</i> ” says he, “which come upon me from all sides, and are as it were extraordinary, what estimate must be formed of that ordinary burden that constantly presses upon me — the care that I have of all the Churches.” <i>The care of all the Churches</i> he appropriately calls his <i>ordinary burden.</i> For I have taken the liberty of rendering <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐπισύστασιν</span></blu></grk> in this way, as it sometimes means — whatever <i>presses upon</i> us. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(865)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Whoever is concerned in good earnest as to the Church of God, stirs up himself and bears a heavy burden, which <i>presses upon</i> his shoulders. What a picture we have here of a complete minister, embracing in his anxieties and aims not one Church merely, or ten, or thirty, but all of them together, so that he instructs some, confirms others, exhorts others, gives counsel to some, and applies a remedy to the diseases of others! Now from Paul’s words we may infer, that no one can have a heartfelt concern for the Churches, without being harassed with many difficulties; for the government of the Church is no pleasant occupation, in which we may exercise ourselves agreeably and with delight of heart, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(866)</sup></span> but a hard and severe warfare, as has been previously mentioned, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:4">2 Corinthians 10:4</span>,) — Satan from time to time giving us as much trouble as he can, and leaving no stone unturned to annoy us. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(865)</span> The word (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐπισύστασις)</span></blu></grk> is <i>translated</i> or rather <i>paraphrased</i> by Beza as follows: “<blu>Agmen illud in me consurgens</blu>;” — “That troop which rises up together against me.” He adds by way of explanation: “<blu>Certum est enim</blu> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐπισύστασιν</span></blu></grk> <blu>dici multitudinem quae adversus aliquem coierit, idque non semel, sed repetitis vicibus. Quia igitur multiplices erant curae, quarum tanquam agmine magis ac magis veluti obruebatur, Apostolus usus est translatitie hoc vocabulo, admodum significanter</blu>;” — “For it is certain that <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐπισύστασιν</span></blu></grk> denotes a multitude that has come together against any one, and that not once merely, but in repeated instances. As, therefore, there were manifold cares, by which rushing upon him like a troop, more and more, he was in a manner overwhelmed, the Apostle, by way of metaphor, made use of this term very significantly.” <i>Raphelius</i> considers the term to be synonymous with an expression made use of by Cicero: “<blu>concursus occupationum</blu>;” — “a crowding together of engagements.” — (Cic. Fam. 7:33.) — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(866)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Car le gouernement de l’Eglise n’est pas vne occupation ioyeuse pour nous exercer tout doucement, et par manicrc de passe-temps et exercice gracieux pour recreer nos esprits</span></blu>;” — “For the government of the Church is not a pleasant occupation for exercising ourselves quite agreeably, and by way of pass-time, and an agreeable exercise for refreshing our minds.” </p>
