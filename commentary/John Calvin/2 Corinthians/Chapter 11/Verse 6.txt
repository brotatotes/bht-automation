<p><b>6.</b><i>But though I am rude</i> There was one thing <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(814)</sup></span> in which he might appear, at first view, to be inferior — that he was devoid of eloquence. This judgment, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(815)</sup></span> therefore, he anticipates and corrects, while he <i>acknowledges</i> himself, indeed, to be <i>rude</i> and unpolished <i>in speech,</i> while at the same time he maintains that he has <i>knowledge</i> By <i>speech</i> here he means, elegance of expression; and by <i>knowledge</i> he means, the very substance of doctrine. For as man has both a soul and a body, so also in doctrine, there is the thing itself that is taught, and the ornament of expression with which it is clothed. Paul, therefore, maintains that he understands, what should be taught, and what is necessary to be known, though he is not an eloquent orator, so as to know how to set off his doctrine by a polished and eloquent manner of expression. </p>
<p>It is asked, however, whether elegance of <i>speech</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(816)</sup></span> is not also necessary for Apostles; for how will they otherwise be prepared for teaching? <i>Knowledge</i> might perhaps suffice for others, but how could a teacher be dumb? I answer, that, while Paul acknowledges himself to be <i>rude in speech,</i> it is not as though he were a mere infant, but as meaning, that he was not distinguished by such splendid eloquence as others, to whom he yields the palm as to this, retaining for himself what was the principal thing — the reality itself, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(817)</sup></span> while he leaves them talkativeness without gravity. If, however, any one should inquire, why it is that the Lord, <i>who made men’s tongues,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:11">Exodus 4:11</span>,) did not also endow so eminent an apostle with eloquence, that nothing might be wanting to him, I answer, that he was furnished with a <i>sufficiency</i> for supplying the want of eloquence. For we see and feel, what majesty there is in his writings, what elevation appears in them, what a weight of meaning is couched under them, what power is discovered in them. In fine, they are thunderbolts, not mere words. Does not the efficacy of the Spirit appear more clearly in a naked rusticity of words, (so to speak,) than under the disguise of elegance and ornament? Of this matter, however, we have treated more largely in the former Epistle. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(818)</sup></span> In short, he admits, as far as words are concerned, what his adversaries allege by way of objection, while he denies in reality what they hold forth. Let us also learn, from his example, to prefer deeds to words, and, to use a barbarous but common proverb — “<blu>Teneant alii quid</blu> <blu><i>nominis,</i></blu> <blu>nos autem quid</blu> <blu><i>rei</i></blu> ;” — “Let others know something of the <i>name,</i> but let us know something of the <i>reality.</i> ” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(819)</sup></span> If eloquence is superadded, let it be regarded by us as something over and above; and farther, let it not be made use of for disguising doctrine, or adulterating it, but for unfolding it in its genuine simplicity. </p>
<p><i>But everywhere.</i> As there was something magnificent in placing himself on a level with the chief Apostles, that this may not be ascribed to arrogance, he makes the Corinthians judges, provided they judge from what they have themselves experienced; for they had known sufficiently well, from many proofs, that he did not boast needlessly, or without good reason. He means, therefore, that he needs not make use of words, inasmuch as reality and experience afford clear evidence of every thing that he was about to say <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(820)</sup></span> </p>
