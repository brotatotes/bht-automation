<p><b>1.</b><i>It is not expedient for me to glory</i> Now, when as it were in the middle of the course, he restrains himself from proceeding farther, and in this way he most appropriately reproves the impudence of his rivals and declares that it is with reluctance, that he engages in this sort of contest with them. For what a shame it was to scrape together from every quarter commendations, or rather to go a-begging for them, that they might be on a level with so distinguished a man! As to the latter, he admonishes them by his own example, that the more numerous and the more excellent the graces by which any one of us is distinguished, so much the less ought he to think of his own excellence. For such a thought is exceedingly dangerous, because, like one entering into a labyrinth, the person is immediately dazzled, so as to be too quick-sighted in discerning his gifts, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(877)</sup></span> while in the mean time he is ignorant of himself. Paul is afraid, lest this should befall him. The graces conferred by God are, indeed, to be acknowledged, that we may be aroused, — <i>first</i>, to gratitude for them, and <i>secondly,</i> to the right improvement of them; but to take occasion from them to boast — <i>that</i> is what cannot be done without great danger. </p>
<p><i>For I will come</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(878)</sup></span> <i>to visions.</i> “I shall not creep on the ground, but will be constrained to mount aloft. Hence I am afraid, lest the height of my gifts should hurry me on, so as to lead me to forget myself.” And certainly, if Paul had gloried ambitiously, he would have fallen headlong from a lofty eminence; for it is humility alone that can give stability to our greatness in the sight of God. </p>
<p>Between <i>visions</i> and <i>revelations</i> there is this distinction — that a <i>revelation</i> is often made either in a dream, or by an oracle, without any thing being presented to the eye, while a<i>vision</i> is scarcely ever afforded without a <i>revelation,</i> or in other words, without the Lord’s discovering what is meant by it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(879)</sup></span> </p>

Doddridge renders it ‘nevertheless.’ But it seems to me that it contains an important sense, and that it should be rendered by <i>then.</i> ‘Since it is not fit that I should glory, <i>then</i> I will refer to visions, etc. I will turn away, <i>then,</i> from that subject, and come to another.’ Thus the word (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">γὰρ)</span></blu></grk>, <i>for</i>, is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:41">John 7:41</span>, ‘Shall <i>then</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">μὴ γὰρ)</span></blu></grk> Christ come out of Galilee?’ <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:31">Acts 8:31</span>, ‘How can I <i>then</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τῶς γὰρ)</span></blu></grk> except some man should guide me?’” — <i>Barnes.
