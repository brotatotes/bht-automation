<p><b>12.</b><i>The signs of an Apostle</i> By the <i>signs of an Apostle</i> he means — the seals, that tend to confirm the evidence of his Apostleship, or, at least, for the proofs and evidences of it. “God has confirmed my Apostleship among you to such a degree, that it stands in no need of proof being adduced.” The <i>first sign</i> he makes mention of is <i>patience</i> — either because he had remained invincible, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(925)</sup></span> by nobly withstanding all the assaults of Satan and his enemies, and on no occasion giving way; or because, regardless of his own distinction, he suffered all injuries patiently, endured in silence countless grievances, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(926)</sup></span> and, by patience, overcame indignities. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(927)</sup></span> For a virtue so heroic is, as it were, a heavenly seal, by which the Lord marks out his Apostles. </p>
<p>He assigns the <i>second</i> place to <i>miracles,</i> for while he makes mention of <i>signs</i> and <i>wonders</i> and <i>mighty deeds,</i> he makes use of <i>three</i> terms, as he does elsewhere, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:9">2 Thessalonians 2:9</span>,) for expressing one and the same thing. Now he calls them <i>signs,</i> because they are not empty shows, but are appointed for the instruction of <i>mankind</i> — <i>wonders,</i> because they ought, by their novelty, to arouse men, and strike them with astonishment — and <i>powers</i> or <i>mighty deeds,</i> because they are more signal tokens of Divine power, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(928)</sup></span> than what we behold in the ordinary course of nature. Farther, we know that this was the main design of miracles, when the gospel began to be preached — that its doctrine might have greater authority given to it. Hence, the more that any one was endowed with the power of working miracles, so much the more was his ministry confirmed, as has been stated in the fifteenth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(929)</sup></span> </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(927)</span> <sup>“</sup><blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Beaucoup de lasches tours</span></blu>;” — “Many base tricks.” </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(929)</span> Calvin seems to refer here more particularly to the observations made by him, when commenting on <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:18">Romans 15:18</span>. “<blu><i>Hie</i></blu> <blu>nobilis est locus de miraculorum usu: nempe ut reverentiam obedientiamque Deo apud homines comparent. Sic apud Marcum</blu> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:20">Mark 16:20</span>,) <blu>legis, Dominum</blu> <blu><i>confirmasse doetrinam subsequentibus signis.</i></blu> <blu>Sic Lucas in Actis</blu> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:3">Acts 14:3</span>,) <blu>narrat, Dominum</blu> <blu><i>per miracula testimonium reddidisse sermoni gratiae suoe</i></blu> <i>;</i> ” — “This is an admirable passage in reference to the use of miracles — that they may secure among men reverence and obedience towards God. Thus you read in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:20">Mark 16:20</span>, that the Lord <i>confirmed their doctrine by signs following.</i> So also Luke, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:3">Acts 14:3</span>, relates that the Lord <i>by miracles gave testimony to the word.of his grace.</i> ” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
