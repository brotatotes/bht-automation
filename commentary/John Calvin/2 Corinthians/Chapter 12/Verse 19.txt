<p><b>19.</b><i>Do you again think.</i> As those that are conscious to themselves of something wrong are sometimes more anxious than others to clear themselves, it is probable, that this, also, was turned into a ground of calumny â€” that Paul had in the former Epistle applied himself to a defense of his ministry. Farther, it is a fault in the servants of Christ, to be too much concerned as to their own reputation. With the view, therefore, of repelling those calumnies, he declares in the <i>first</i> place, that he speaks in the presence of God, whom evil consciences always dread. In the <i>second</i> place, he maintains, that he has not so much a <i>view</i> to himself, as to them. He was prepared to go through <i>good report and bad report,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:8">2 Corinthians 6:8</span>,) nay, even to be reduced to nothing; but it was of advantage to the Corinthians, that he should retain the reputation that he deserved, that his ministry might not be brought into contempt. </p>
