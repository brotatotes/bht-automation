<p><b>5.</b><i>Of such a man</i> It is as though he had said â€œI have just ground for glorying, but I do not willingly avail myself of it. For it is more in accordance with my design, to <i>glory in my infirmities</i> If, however, those malicious persons harass me any farther, and constrain me to boast more than I am inclined to do, they shall feel that they have to do with a man, whom God has illustriously honored, and raised up on high, with a view to his exposing their follies. </p>
