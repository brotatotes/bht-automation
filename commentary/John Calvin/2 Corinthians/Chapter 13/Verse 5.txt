<p><b>5.</b><i>Try yourselves.</i> He confirms, what he had stated previously — that Christ’s power showed itself openly in his ministry. For he makes them the judges of this matter, provided they descend, as it were, into themselves, and acknowledge what they had received from him. In the first place, as there is but one Christ, it must be of necessity, that the same Christ must dwell alike in minister and people. Now, dwelling in the people, how will he deny himself in the minister. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(955)</sup></span> Farther, he had shown his power in Paul’s preaching, in such a manner that it could be no longer doubtful or obscure to the Corinthians, if they were not altogether stupid. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(956)</sup></span> For, whence had they faith? whence had they Christ? whence, in fine, had they every thing? It is with good reason, therefore, that they are called to look into themselves, that they may discover there, what they despise as a thing unknown. <i>Then</i> only has a minister a true and well grounded assurance for the approbation of his doctrine, when he can appeal to the consciences of those whom he has taught, that, if they have any thing of Christ, and of sincere piety, they may be constrained to acknowledge his fidelity. We are now in possession of Paul’s object. </p>
<p>This passage, however, is deserving of particular observation on two accounts. For, in the <i>first</i> place, it shows the relation, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(957)</sup></span> which subsists between the faith of the people, and the preaching of the minister — that the one is the mother, that produces and brings forth, and the other is the daughter, that ought not to forget her origin. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(958)</sup></span> In the <i>second</i> place, it serves to prove the assurance of faith, as to which the Sorbonnic sophists have made us stagger, nay more, have altogether rooted out from the minds of men. They charge with rashness all that are persuaded that they are the members of Christ, and have Him remaining in them, for they bid us be satisfied with a “moral conjecture,” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(959)</sup></span> as they call it — that is, with a mere opinion <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(960)</sup></span> so that our consciences remain constantly in suspense, and in a state of perplexity. But what does Paul say here? He declares, that all are <i>reprobates,</i> who doubt whether they profess Christ and are a part of His body. Let us, therefore, reckon <i>that</i> alone to be right faith, which leads us to repose in safety in the favor of God, with no wavering opinion, but with a firm and steadfast assurance. </p>
<p><i>Unless by any means you are reprobates.</i> He gives them in a manner their choice, whether they would rather be <i>reprobates,</i> than give due testimony to his ministry; for he leaves them no alternative, but either to show <i>respect</i> to his Apostleship, or to allow that they are <i>reprobates.</i> For, unquestionably, their faith had been founded upon his doctrine, and they had no other Christ, than they had received from him, and no other gospel than what they had embraced, as delivered to them by him, so that it were vain for them to attempt to separate any part of their salvation from his praise. </p>
