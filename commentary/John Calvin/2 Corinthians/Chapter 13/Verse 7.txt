<p><b>7.</b><i>I desire before God.</i> Again he <i>declares,</i> that he cares nothing for his own honor, but is simply desirous of promoting their advantage. For nothing was so undesirable for them, as to deprive themselves of advantage from his doctrine — as they had begun to do, through their pride and contempt. “As to myself,” says he, “for my reputation among men, I am not concerned. My only fear is, lest you should offend God. Nay more, I am prepared to be as a <i>reprobate,</i> provided you are free from all blame.” “I am a <i>reprobate,”</i> says he, “in the judgment of mankind, who very frequently reject those who are deserving of the highest honor.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(961)</sup></span> At the same time, the particle <i>as</i> is not superfluous. For it corresponds with what he says elsewhere — <i>as deceivers and yet true.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:8">2 Corinthians 6:8</span>.) And this, certainly, is the true rule — that the Pastor, having no regard to himself, should be devoted exclusively to the edification of the Church. Let him be concerned as to his own reputation, in so far as he sees it to be conducive to the public advantage. Let him be prepared to feel indifferent to it, whenever he may do so, without public disadvantage. </p>
