<p><b>10.</b><i>To whom ye forgive</i>. That he might the more readily appease them, he added his vote in support of the pardon extended by them. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(326)</sup></span> “Do not hesitate to forgive: I promise that I shall confirm whatever you may have done, and I already subscribe your sentence of forgiveness.” <i>Secondly</i>, he says that he does this <i>for their sake;</i> and that too, sincerely and cordially. He had already shown how desirous he was, that the man’s welfare should be consulted: he now declares, that he grants this willingly to the Corinthians. </p>
<p>Instead of the expression <i>in the sight of Christ</i>, some prefer <i>person</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(327)</sup></span> because Paul in that reconciliation was in the room of Christ, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(328)</sup></span> and did in a manner represent his person. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(329)</sup></span> I am, however, more inclined to understand him as declaring, that he forgives sincerely and without any pretence. For he is accustomed to employ this phrase to express pure and undisguised rectitude. If, however, any one prefers the former interpretation, it is to be observed that the <i>person of Christ</i> is interposed, because there is nothing that ought to incline us more to the exercise of mercy. </p>
