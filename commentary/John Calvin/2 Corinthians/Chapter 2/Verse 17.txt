<p><b>17.</b><i>For we are not.</i> He now contrasts himself more openly with the false apostles, and that by way of amplifying, and at the same time, with the view of excluding them from the praise that he had claimed to himself. “It is on good grounds,” says he, “that I speak in honorable terms of my apostleship, for I am not afraid of being convicted of vanity, if proof is demanded. But many on false grounds arrogate the same thing to themselves, who will be found to have nothing in common with me. For they <i>adulterate the word of the Lord,</i> which I dispense with the greatest faithfulness and sincerity for the edification of the Church.” I do not think it likely, however, that those, who are here reproved, preached openly wicked or false doctrines; but am rather of opinion, that they corrupted the right use of doctrine, for the sake either of gain or of ambition, so as utterly to deprive it of energy. This he terms <i>adulterating.</i> Erasmus prefers to render <i>it</i> — <blu><i>cauponari</i></blu> — <i>huckstering</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(352)</sup></span> The Greek word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καπηλεύειν</span></blu></grk> <i>,</i> is taken from retailers, or tavern-keepers, who are accustomed to adulterate their commodities, that they may fetch a higher price. I do not know whether the word <blu><i>cauponari</i></blu> is used in that sense among the Latins. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(353)</sup></span> </p>
<p>It is, indeed, certain from the corresponding clause, that Paul intended to express here — corruption of doctrine — not as though they had revolted from the truth, but because they presented it under disguise, and not in its genuine purity. For the doctrine of God is corrupted in two ways. It is corrupted in a <i>direct</i> way, when it is mixed up with falsehood and lies, so as to be no longer the pure and genuine doctrine of God, but is falsely commended under that title. It is corrupted <i>indirectly,</i> when, although retaining its purity, it is turned hither and thither to please men, and is disfigured by unseemly disguises, by way of hunting after favor. Thus there will be found some, in whose doctrine there will be no impiety detected, but as they hunt after the applauses of the world by making a display of their acuteness and eloquence, or are ambitious of some place, or gape for <i>filthy lucre,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8">1 Timothy 3:8</span>,) or are desirous by some means or other to rise, they, nevertheless, corrupt the doctrine itself by wrongfully abusing it, or making it subservient to their depraved inclinations. I am, therefore, inclined to retain the word <i>adulterate,</i> as it expresses better what ordinarily happens in the case of all that play with the sacred word of God, as with a ball, and transform it according to their own convenience. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(354)</sup></span> For it must necessarily be, that they degenerate from the truth, and preach a sort of artificial and spurious Gospel. </p>
<p><i>But as of sincerity.</i> The word <i>as</i> here is superfluous, as in many other places. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(355)</sup></span> In contrast with the corruption that he had made mention of, he makes use, <i>first of all</i>, of the term <i>sincerity,</i> which may be taken as referring to the manner of preaching, as well as to the disposition of the mind. I approve rather of the latter. <i>Secondly,</i> he places in contrast with it a faithful and conscientious dispensation of it, inasmuch as he faithfully delivers to the Church from hand to hand, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(356)</sup></span> as they say, the Gospel which God had committed to him, and had given him in charge. <i>Thirdly,</i> he subjoins to this a regard to the Divine presence. For whoever has the three following things, is in no danger of forming the purpose of corrupting the word of God. The <i>first</i> is — that we be actuated by a true zeal for God. The <i>second</i> is — that we bear in mind that it is his business that we are transacting, and bring forward nothing but what has come from him. The <i>third</i> is — that we consider, that we do nothing of which he is not the witness and spectator, and thus learn to refer every thing to his judgment. </p>
