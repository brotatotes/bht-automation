<p><b>4.</b><i>For out of much affliction</i> Here he brings forward another reason with the view of softening the harshness which he had employed. For those who smilingly take delight in seeing others weep, inasmuch as they discover thereby their cruelty, cannot and ought not to be borne with. Paul, however, declares that his feeling was very different. “Intensity of grief,” says he, “has extorted from me every thing that I have written.” Who would not excuse, and take in good part what springs from such a temper of mind, more especially as it was not on his own account or through his own fault, that he suffered grief, and farther, he does not give vent to his grief, with the view of lightning himself by burdening them, but rather, for the purpose of shewing his affection for them? On these accounts, it did not become the Corinthians to be offended at this somewhat severe reproof. </p>
<p>He adds, <i>tears</i> — which, in a man that is brave and magnanimous are a token of intense grief. Hence we see, from what emotions of mind pious and holy admonitions and reproofs must of necessity proceed. For there are many noisy reprovers, who, by declaiming, or rather, fulminating against vices, display a surprising ardour of zeal, while in the mean time they are at ease in their mind, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(316)</sup></span> so that it might seem as if they exercised their throat and sides <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(317)</sup></span> by way of sport. It is, however, the part of a pious pastor, to weep within himself, before he calls upon others to weep: <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(318)</sup></span> to feel tortured in silent musings, before he shows any token of displeasure; and to keep within his own breast more grief, than he causes to others. We must, also, take notice of Paul’s tears, which, by their abundance, shew tenderness of heart, but it is of a more heroical character than was the iron-hearted hardness of the Stoics. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(319)</sup></span> For the more tender the affections of love are, they are so much the more praiseworthy. </p>
<p>The adverb <i>more abundantly</i> may be explained in a comparative sense; and, in that case, it would be a tacit complaint — that the Corinthians do not make an equal return in respect of affection, inasmuch as they love but coldly one by whom they are ardently loved. I take it, however, in a more simple way, as meaning that Paul commends his affection towards them, in order that this assurance may soften down every thing of harshness that might be in his words. </p>
