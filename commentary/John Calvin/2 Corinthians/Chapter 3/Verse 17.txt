<p><b>17.</b><i>The Lord is the Spirit.</i> This passage, also, has been misinterpreted, as if Paul had meant to say, that Christ is of a spiritual essence, for they connect it with that statement in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:24">John 4:24</span>, <i>God is a Spirit</i>. The statement before us, however, has nothing to do with Christ’s essence, but simply points out his office, for it is connected with what goes before, where we found it stated, that the doctrine of the law is literal, and not merely dead, but even an occasion of death. He now, on the other hand, calls <i>Christ its spirit</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(411)</sup></span> meaning by this, that it will be living and life-giving, only if it is breathed into by Christ. Let the soul be connected with the body, and then there is a living man, endowed with intelligence and perception, fit for all vital functions. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(412)</sup></span> Let the soul be removed from the body, and there will remain nothing but a useless carcase, totally devoid of feeling. </p>
<p>The passage is deserving of particular notice, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(413)</sup></span> as teaching us, in what way we are to reconcile those encomiums which David pronounces upon the law — (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+19:7">Psalms 19:7</span>) — “the law of the Lord converteth souls, enlighteneth the eyes, imparteth wisdom to babes,” and passages of a like nature, with those statements of Paul, which at first view are at variance with them — that it is the ministry of sin and death — the letter that does nothing but kill. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>.) For when it is animated by Christ, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(414)</sup></span> those things that David makes mention of are justly applicable to it. If Christ is taken away, it is altogether such as Paul describes. Hence Christ is the life of the law. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(415)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>Where the Spirit of the Lord.</i> He now describes the manner, in which Christ gives life to the law — by giving us his Spirit. The term Spirit here has a different signification from what it had in the preceding verse. There, it denoted the soul, and was ascribed metaphorically to Christ. Here, on the other hand, it means the Holy Spirit, that Christ himself confers upon his people. Christ, however, by regenerating us, gives life to the law, and shows himself to be the fountain of life, as all vital functions proceed from man’s soul. Christ, then, is to all (so to speak) the universal soul, not in respect of essence, but in respect of grace. Or, if you prefer it, Christ is <i>the Spirit</i>, because he quickens us by the life-giving influence of his Spirit. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(416)</sup></span> </p>
<p>He makes mention, also, of the blessing that we obtain from that source. “<i>There</i>, ” says he, “<i>is liberty</i>. ” By the term <i>liberty</i> I do not understand merely emancipation from the servitude of sin, and of the flesh, but also that confidence, which we acquire from His bearing witness as to our adoption. For it is in accordance with that statement — </p>
<p>We have not again received the spirit of bondage, to fear, etc. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>.) </p>
<p>In that passage, the Apostle makes mention of two things — <i>bondage,</i> and <i>fear</i>. The opposites of these are <i>liberty</i> and <i>confidence.</i> Thus I acknowledge, that the inference drawn from this passage by Augustine is correct — that we are by nature the slaves of sin, and are made free by the grace of regeneration. For, where there is nothing but the bare letter of the law, <i>there</i> will be only the dominion of sin, but the term <i>Liberty,</i> as I have said, I take in a more extensive sense. The grace of the Spirit might, also, be restricted more particularly to ministers, so as to make this statement correspond with the commencement of the chapter, for ministers require to have another grace of the Spirit, and another liberty from what others have. The former signification, however, pleases me better, though at the same time I have no objection, that this should be applied to every one according to the measure of his gift. It is enough, if we observe, that Paul here points out the efficacy of the Spirit, which we experience for our salvation — as many of us, as have been regenerated by his grace. </p>
