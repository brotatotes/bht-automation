<p><b>2.</b><i>Ye are our Epistle.</i> There is no little ingenuity in his making his own glory hinge upon the welfare of the Corinthians. “So long as you shall remain Christians, I shall have recommendation enough. For your faith speaks my praise, as being <i>the seal of my apostleship.</i> ” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:2">1 Corinthians 9:2</span>.) </p>
<p>When he says — <i>written in our hearts</i>, this may be understood in reference to Silvanus and Timotheus, and in that case the meaning will be: “We are not contented with this praise, that we derive from the thing itself. The recommendations, that others have, fly about before the eyes of men, but this, that <i>we</i> have, has its seat in men’s consciences.” It may also be viewed as referring in part to the Corinthians, in this sense: “Those that obtain recommendations by dint of entreaty, have not in the conscience what they carry about written upon paper, and those that recommend others often do so rather by way of favor than from judgment. We, on the other hand, have the testimony of our apostleship, on this side and on that, engraven on men’s hearts.” </p>
<p><i>Which is known and read</i> It might also be read — “Which is known and <i>acknowledged,”</i> owing to the ambiguity of the word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀναγινωσκεσαι</span></blu></grk>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(363)</sup></span> and I do not know but that the latter might be more suitable. I was unwilling, however, to depart from the common rendering, when not constrained to do so. Only let the reader have this brought before his view, that he may consider which of the two renderings is the preferable one. If we render it <i>acknowledged,</i> there will be an implied contrast between an epistle that is sure and of unquestionable authority, and such as are counterfeit. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(364)</sup></span> And, unquestionably, what immediately follows, is rather on the side of the latter rendering, for he brings forward the <i>Epistle of Christ,</i> in contrast with those that are forged and pretended. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(363)</span> Calvin has had occasion to notice the double signification of this word when commenting on <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:13">2 Corinthians 1:13</span>. An instance of the ambiguity of the word occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:15">Matthew 24:15</span>, where the words <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὁ ἀναγινώσκων νοείτω</span></blu></grk> are understood by <i>Kypke</i> as the words, not of the evangelist, but of Christ, and as meaning — “He who <i>recognises</i> this, (that is, the completion of Daniel’s prophecy by the ‘abomination of desolation standing where it ought not,’) let him take notice and reflect, while most other interpreters consider the words in question as an admonition of the evangelist to the reader — “Let him that readeth <i>understand</i> or <i>take notice</i>. ” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(364)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Celles qui sont attitrees et faites à plaisir</span></blu>;” — “Such as are procured by unfair means, and are made to suit convenience.” </p>
