<p><b>4.</b><i>And such confidence</i> As it was a magnificent commendation, that Paul had pronounced to the honor of himself and his Apostleship, lest he should seem to speak of himself more confidently than was befitting, he transfers the entire glory to God, from whom he acknowledges that he has received everything that he has. “By this boasting,” says he, “I extol God rather than myself, <i>by whose grace I am what I am.”</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:10">1 Corinthians 15:10</span>.) He adds, as he is accustomed to do <i>by Christ,</i> because he is, as it were, the channel, through which all God’s benefits flow forth to us. </p>
