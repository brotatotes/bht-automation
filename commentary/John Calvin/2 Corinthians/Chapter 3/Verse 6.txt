<p><b>6.</b><i>Who hath made us competent.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(376)</sup></span> He had acknowledged himself to be altogether useless. Now he declares, that, by the grace of God, he has been qualified <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(377)</sup></span> for an office, for which he was previously unqualified. From this we infer its magnitude and difficulty, as it can be undertaken by no one, that has not been previously prepared and fashioned for it by God. It is the Apostle’s intention, also, to extol the dignity of the gospel. There is, at the same time, no doubt, that he indirectly exposes the poverty of those, who boasted in lofty terms of their endowments, while they were not furnished with so much as a single drop of heavenly grace. </p>
<p><i>Not of the letter but of the spirit</i> He now follows out the comparison between the law and the gospel, which he had previously touched upon. It is uncertain, however, whether he was led into this discussion, from seeing that there were at Corinth certain perverse <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(378)</sup></span> devotees of the law, or whether he took occasion from something else to enter upon it. For my part, as I see no evidence that the false apostles had there confounded the law and the gospel, I am rather of opinion, that, as he had to do with lifeless declaimers, who endeavored to obtain applause through mere prating, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(379)</sup></span> and as he saw, that the ears of the Corinthians were captivated with such glitter, he was desirous to show them what was the chief excellence of the gospel, and what was the chief praise of its ministers. Now this he makes to consist in the efficacy of the Spirit. A comparison between the law and the gospel was fitted in no ordinary degree to show this. This appears to me to be the reason why he came to enter upon it. </p>
<p>There is, however, no doubt, that by the term <i>letter,</i> he means the Old Testament, as by the term <i>spirit</i> he means the gospel; for, after having called himself a <i>minister of the New Testament,</i> he immediately adds, by way of exposition, that he is a <i>minister of the spirit,</i> and contrasts the <i>letter</i> with the <i>spirit.</i> We must now enquire into the reason of this designation. The exposition contrived by Origen has got into general circulation — that by the <i>letter</i> we ought to understand the grammatical and genuine meaning of Scripture, or the <i>literal</i> sense, (as they call it,) and that by the <i>spirit</i> is meant the allegorical meaning, which is commonly reckoned to be the <i>spiritual</i> meaning. Accordingly, during several centuries, nothing was more commonly said, or more generally received, than this — that Paul here furnishes us with a key for expounding Scripture by allegories, while nothing is farther from his intention. For by the term <i>letter</i> he means outward preaching, of such a kind as does not reach the heart; and, on the other hand, by <i>spirit</i> he means living doctrine, of such a nature as <i>worketh effectually</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:13">1 Thessalonians 2:13</span>) on the minds of men, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(380)</sup></span> through the grace of the Spirit. By the term <i>letter,</i> therefore, is meant <i>literal</i> preaching — that is, <i>dead</i> and <i>ineffectual,</i> perceived only by the ear. By the term <i>spirit,</i> on the other hand, is meant <i>spiritual</i> doctrine, that is, what is not merely uttered with the mouth, but effectually makes its way to the souls of men with a lively feeling. For Paul had an eye to the passage in Jeremiah, that I quoted a little ago, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:31">Jeremiah 31:31</span>,) where the Lord says, that his law had been proclaimed merely with the mouth, and that it had, therefore, been of short duration, because the people did not embrace it in their heart, and he promises the Spirit of regeneration under the reign of Christ, to write his gospel, that is, the new covenant, upon their hearts. Paul now makes it his boast, that the accomplishment of that prophecy is to be seen in his preaching, that the Corinthians may perceive, how worthless is the loquacity of those vain boasters, who make incessant noise <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(381)</sup></span> while devoid of the efficacy of the Spirit. </p>
<p>It is asked, however, whether God, under the Old Testament, merely sounded forth in the way of an external voice, and did not also speak inwardly to the hearts of the pious by his Spirit. I answer in the <i>first</i> place, that Paul here takes into view what belonged peculiarly to the law; for although God then wrought by his Spirit, yet that did not take its rise from the ministry of Moses, but from the grace of Christ, as it is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span> — </p>
<p>The law was given by Moses;<br/>but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>True, indeed, the grace of God did not, during all that time, lie dormant, but it is enough that it was not a benefit that belonged to the law. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(382)</sup></span> For Moses had discharged his office, when he had delivered to the people the doctrine of life, adding threatenings and promises. For this reason he gives to the law the name of the <i>letter,</i> because it is in itself a dead preaching; but the gospel he calls <i>spirit,</i> because the ministry of the gospel is <i>living,</i> nay, <i>lifegiving.</i> </p>
<p>I answer secondly, that these things are not affirmed absolutely in reference either to the law or to the gospel, but in respect of the contrast between the one and the other; for even the gospel is not always spirit. When, however, we come to compare the two, it is truly and properly affirmed, that the nature of the law is to teach men literally, in such a way that it does not reach farther than the ear; and that, on the other hand, the nature of the gospel is to teach spiritually, because it is the instrument of Christ’s grace. This depends on the appointment of God, who has seen it meet to manifest the efficacy of his Spirit more clearly in the gospel than in the law, for it is his work exclusively to teach effectually the minds of men. </p>
<p>When Paul, however, calls himself a <i>Minister of the Spirit</i>, he does not mean by this, that the grace of the Holy Spirit and his influence, were tied to his preaching, so that he could, whenever he pleased, breathe forth the Spirit along with the utterance of the voice. He simply means, that Christ blessed his ministry, and thus accomplished what was predicted respecting the gospel. It is one thing for Christ to connect his influence with a man’s doctrine. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(383)</sup></span> and quite another for the man’s doctrine <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(384)</sup></span> to have such efficacy of itself. We are, then, Ministers of the Spirit, not as if we held him inclosed within us, or as it were captive — not as if we could at our pleasure confer his grace upon all, or upon whom we pleased — but because Christ, through our instrumentality, illuminates the minds of men, renews their hearts, and, in short, regenerates them wholly. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(385)</sup></span> It is in consequence of there being such a connection and bond of union between Christ’s grace and man’s effort, that in many cases that is ascribed to the minister which belongs exclusively to the Lord. For in that case it is not the mere individual that is looked to, but the entire dispensation of the gospel, which consists, on the one hand, in the secret influence of Christ, and, on the other, in man’s outward efforts. </p>
<p><i>For the letter killeth</i>. This passage was mistakingly perverted, first by Origen, and afterwards by others, to a spurious signification. From this arose a very pernicious error — that of imagining that the perusal of Scripture would be not merely useless, but even injurious, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(386)</sup></span> unless it were drawn out into allegories. This error was the source of many evils. For there was not merely a liberty allowed of adulterating the genuine meaning of Scripture, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(387)</sup></span> but the more of audacity any one had in this manner of acting, so much the more eminent an interpreter of Scripture was he accounted. Thus many of the ancients recklessly played with the sacred word of God, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(388)</sup></span> as if it had been a ball to be tossed to and fro. In consequence of this, too, heretics had it more in their power to trouble the Church; for as it had become general practice to make any passage whatever <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(389)</sup></span> mean anything that one might choose, there was no frenzy so absurd or monstrous, as not to admit of being brought forward under some pretext of allegory. Even good men themselves were carried headlong, so as to contrive very many mistaken opinions, led astray through a fondness for allegory. </p>
<p>The meaning of this passage, however, is as follows — that, if the word of God is simply uttered with the mouth, it is an occasion of death, and that it is lifegiving, only when it is received with the heart. The terms <i>letter</i> and <i>spirit</i>, therefore, do not refer to the exposition of the word, but to its influence and fruit. Why it is that the doctrine merely strikes upon the ear, without reaching the heart, we shall see presently. </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(377)</span> It is justly observed by <i>Barnes</i>, that the rendering in our authorized version — “Who hath made us <i>able</i> ministers” — “does not <i>quite</i> meet the force of the original,” as it “would seem to imply that Paul regarded himself and his fellow — laborers as men of talents, and of signal ability; and that he was inclined to boast of it,” while instead of this “he did not esteem himself <i>sufficient</i> for this work in his own strength, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:16">2 Corinthians 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:5">2 Corinthians 3:5</span>); and he here says, that God had made him <i>sufficient</i>: not able, talented, learned, but <i>sufficient</i>, (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἱκάνωσεν ἡμᾶς</span></blu></grk>); he has supplied our deficiency; he has rendered us competent or fit; — if a word may be coined after the manner of the Greek here, ‘he has <i>sufficienced</i> us for this work.’” The unhappy rendering referred to had originated (as is shown by <i>Granville Penn</i>) in the circumstance, that the Vulgate having rendered the expression — <blu><i>qui idoneos nos fecit ministros</i></blu> , Wiclif translated it as follows: <i>which made us also able mynystris</i>, and that, while Erasmus suggested that it should be rendered — <blu><i>qui idoneos nos fecit ut essemus ministri, quasi dicas, idoneavit</i></blu> — who <i>fitted</i> or <i>qualified</i> us to be ministers — and while, besides, in the first translation from the original Greek, in 1526, Tyndale rendered — made us able to minister, Wiclif’s original version from the Latin was <i>recalled</i>, and is now the reading of our authorized version. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
