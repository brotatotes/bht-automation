<p><b>16.</b><i>For which cause we faint not</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(491)</sup></span> He now, as having carried his point, rises to a higher confidence than before. “There is no cause,” says he, <i>“</i> why we should lose heart, or sink down under the burden of the cross, the issue of which is not merely so desirable to myself, but is also salutary to others.” Thus he exhorts the Corinthians to fortitude by his own example, should they happen at any time to be similarly afflicted. Farther, he beats down that insolence, in which they in no ordinary degree erred, inasmuch as under the influence of ambition, they held a man in higher estimation, the farther he was from the cross of Christ. </p>
<p><i>Though our outward man.</i> The <i>outward man,</i> some improperly and ignorantly confound with the <i>old man,</i> for widely different from this is the <i>old man,</i> of which we have spoken in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:6">Romans 4:6</span>. Chrysostom, too, and others restrict it entirely to the body; but it is a mistake, for the Apostle intended to comprehend, under this term, everything that relates to the present life. As he here sets before us <i>two men,</i> so you must place before your view <i>two kinds of life</i> — <i>the earthly</i> and the <i>heavenly.</i> The <i>outward man</i> is the maintenance of the <i>earthly</i> life, which consists not merely in the <i>flower of one’s age,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:36">1 Corinthians 7:36</span>,) and in good health, but also in riches, honors, friendships, and other resources. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(492)</sup></span> Hence, according as we suffer a diminution or loss of these blessings, which are requisite for keeping up the condition of the present life, is our <i>outward man</i> in that proportion corrupted. For as we are too much taken up with the present life, so long as everything goes on to our mind, the Lord, on that account, by taking away from us, by little and little, the things that we are engrossed with, calls us back to meditate on a better life. Thus, therefore, it is necessary, that the condition of the present life should decay, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(493)</sup></span> in order that the <i>inward man</i> may be in a flourishing state; because, in proportion as the <i>earthly</i> life declines, does the <i>heavenly</i> life advance, at least in believers. For in the reprobate, too, the <i>outward man</i> decays, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(494)</sup></span> but without anything to compensate for it. In the sons of God, on the other hand, a decay of this nature is the beginning, and, as it were, the cause of production. He says that this takes place <i>daily,</i> because God continually stirs us up to such meditation. Would that this were deeply seated in our minds, that we might uninterruptedly make progress amidst the decay of the <i>outward man!</i> </p>
