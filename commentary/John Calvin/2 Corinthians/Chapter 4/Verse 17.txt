<p><b>17.</b><i>Momentary lightness.</i> As our flesh always shrinks back from its own destruction, whatever reward may be presented to our view, and as we are influenced much more by present feeling than by the hope of heavenly blessings, Paul on that account admonishes us, that the afflictions and vexations of the pious have little or nothing of bitterness, if compared with the boundless blessings of everlasting glory. He had said, that the decay of the <i>outward man</i> ought to occasion us no grief, inasmuch as the renovation of the <i>inward man</i> springs out of it. As, however, the <i>decay</i> is visible, and the <i>renovation</i> is invisible, Paul, with the view of shaking us off from a carnal attachment to the present life, draws a comparison between present miseries and future felicity. Now this comparison is of itself abundantly sufficient for imbuing the minds of the pious with patience and moderation, that they may not give way, borne down by the burden of the cross. For whence comes it, that patience is so difficult a matter but from this, — that we are confounded on having experience of evils for a brief period, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(495)</sup></span> and do not raise our thoughts higher? Paul, therefore, prescribes the best antidote against your sinking down under the pressure of afflictions, when he places in opposition to them that future blessedness which is <i>laid up for thee in heaven.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>.) For this comparison makes that <i>light</i> which previously seemed <i>heavy,</i> and makes that <i>brief</i> and <i>momentary</i> which seemed of boundless duration. </p>
<p>There is some degree of obscurity in Paul’s words, for as he says, <i>With hyperbole unto hyperbole,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(496)</sup></span> so the Old Interpreter, and Erasmus <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(497)</sup></span> have thought that in both terms the magnitude of the heavenly glory, that awaits believers is extolled; or, at least, they have connected them with the verb <i>worketh out.</i> To this I have no objection, but as the distinction that I have made is also not unsuitable, I leave it to my readers to make their choice. </p>
<p><i>Worketh out an eternal weight</i> Paul does not mean, that this is the invariable effect of afflictions; for the great majority are most miserably weighed down here with evils of every kind, and yet that very circumstance is an occasion of their heavier destruction, rather than a help to their salvation. As, however, he is speaking of believers, we must restrict exclusively to them what is here stated; for this is a blessing from God that is peculiar to them — that they are prepared for a blessed resurrection by the common miseries of mankind. </p>
<p>As to the circumstance, however, that Papists abuse this passage, to prove that afflictions are the causes of our salvation, it is exceedingly silly; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(498)</sup></span> unless, perhaps, you choose to take <i>causes</i> in the sense of <i>means,</i> (as they commonly speak.) We, at least, cheerfully acknowledge, that </p>
<p>we must through many tribulations <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(499)</sup></span> <br/>enter into the kingdom of heaven, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:22">Acts 14:22</span>,) </p>
<p>and as to this there is no controversy. While, however, our doctrine is, that the momentary lightness of afflictions worketh out in us an <i>eternal weight</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(500)</sup></span> <i>of life,</i> for this reason, that all the sons of God are </p>
<p>predestinated to be conformed to Christ, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>,) </p>
<p>in the endurance of the cross, and in this manner are prepared for the enjoyment of the heavenly inheritance, which they have through means of God’s gracious adoption; Papists, on the other hand, imagine that they are meritorious works, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(501)</sup></span> by which the heavenly kingdom is acquired. </p>
<p>I shall repeat it again in a few words. We do not deny that afflictions are the path by which the heavenly kingdom is arrived at, but we deny that by afflictions we merit the inheritance, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(502)</sup></span> which comes to us in no other way than through means of God’s gracious adoption. Papists, without consideration, seize hold of one little word, with the view of building upon it a tower of Babel, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:9">Genesis 11:9</span>,) — that the kingdom of God is not an inheritance procured for us by Christ, but a reward that is due to our works. For a fuller solution, however, of this question, consult my Institutes. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(503)</sup></span> </p>

The expression is the Hebrew form of denoting the highest superlative, and it means, that all hyperboles fail of expressing that external glory which remains for the just. It is infinite and boundless. You may pass from one degree to another; from one sublime height to another; but still an infinity remains beyond. Nothing can describe the uppermost height of that glory, nothing can express its infinitude.” — <i>Barnes</i>. Chrysostom explains the words <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καθ ᾿ ὑπερβολὴν εἰς ὑπερβολὴν</span></blu></grk> to be equivalent to <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">μέγεθος ὑπερβολικῶς ὑπερβολικόν</span></blu></grk> — a greatness <i>exceedingly exceeding</i>. “The repetition having an intensitive force, (like the Hebrew <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">מאד</span></blu> <blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">מאד</span></blu></heb>) it may be rendered infinitely exceeding.” — Bloomfield. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
