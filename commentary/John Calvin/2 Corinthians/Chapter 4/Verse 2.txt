<p><b>2.</b><i>But renounce the hidden things.</i> While he commends his own sincerity, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(425)</sup></span> he, on the other hand, indirectly reproves the false Apostles, who, while they corrupted by their ambition the genuine excellence of the gospel, were, nevertheless, desirous of exclusive distinction. Hence the faults, from which he declares himself to be exempt, he indirectly imputes to them. By the <i>hidden things of disgrace,</i> or <i>concealments,</i> some understand the shadows of the Mosaic law. Chrysostom understands the expression to mean the vain show, by which they endeavored to recommend themselves. I understand by it — all the disguises, with which they adulterated the pure and native beauty of the gospel. For as chaste and virtuous women, satisfied with the gracefulness of natural beauty, do not resort to artificial adornings, while harlots never think themselves sufficiently adorned, unless they have corrupted nature, so Paul glories in having set forth the pure gospel, while others set forth one that was disguised, and covered over with unseemly additions. For as they were ashamed of the simplicity of Christ, or at least could not have distinction <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(426)</sup></span> from true excellencies of Apostles, they framed a new gospel, not unlike a profane philosophy, swelled up with empty bombast, while altogether devoid of the efficacy of the Spirit. Spurious ornaments of this nature, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(427)</sup></span> by which the gospel is disfigured, he calls the <i>concealments of disgrace,</i> because the nakedness of those, who have recourse to concealments and disguises, must of necessity be dishonorable and disgraceful. </p>
<p>As to himself, he says that he rejects or disdains disguises, because Christ’s face, the more that it is seen opened up to view in his preaching, shines forth so much the more gloriously. I do not, however, deny, that he alludes at the same time to the veil of Moses, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:33">Exodus 34:33</span>,) of which he had made mention, but he ascribes a quite different veil to the false Apostles. For Moses covered his face, because the excessive brightness of the glory of the law could not be endured by tender and blear eyes. They, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(428)</sup></span> on the other hand, put on a veil by way of ornament. Besides, as they would be despicable, nay, infamous, if the simplicity of the gospel shone forth, they, on this account, hide their shame under ever so many cloaks and masks. </p>
<p><i>Not walking in craftiness.</i> There can be no doubt, that the false Apostles delighted themselves greatly in the <i>craftiness</i> that Paul reproves, as though it had been a distinguished excellence, as we see even at this day some, even of those who profess the gospel, who would rather be esteemed subtile than sincere, and sublime rather than solid, while in the mean time all their refinement is mere childishness. But what would you do? It delights them to have a name for acuteness, and they have, under that pretext, applause among the ignorant. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(429)</sup></span> We learn, however, in what estimation Paul holds this appearance of excellence. <i>Craftiness</i> he declares to be unworthy of Christ’s servants. </p>
<p>As to what follows — <i>nor handling deceitfully</i> — I am not sure that this sufficiently brings out Paul’s meaning; for the verb <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δολοῦν</span></blu></grk> does not so properly mean <i>acting fraudulently,</i> as what is called falsifying <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(430)</sup></span> as horse-jockeys <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(431)</sup></span> are wont to do. In this passage, at least, it is placed in contrast with upright preaching, agreeably to what follows. </p>
<p><i>But by manifestation of the truth</i> He claims to himself this praise — that he had proclaimed the pure doctrine of the gospel in simplicity and without disguise, and has the <i>consciences of all</i> as witnesses of this<i>in the sight of God.</i> As he has placed the <i>manifestation of the truth</i> in contrast with the disguised <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(432)</sup></span> doctrine of the sophists, so he appeals the decision to their consciences, and to the judgment-seat of God, whereas they abused the mistaken judgment of men, or their corrupt affection, and were not so desirous to be in reality worthy of praise as they were eager to appear so. Hence we infer, that there is a contrast here between the <i>consciences</i> of men and their <i>ears.</i> Let the servants of Christ, therefore, reckon it enough to have approved their integrity to the <i>consciences of men in the sight of God,</i> and pay no regard to the corrupt inclinations of men, or to popular applause. </p>
