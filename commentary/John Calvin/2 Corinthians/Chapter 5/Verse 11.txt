<p><b>11.</b><i>Knowing therefore.</i> He now returns to speak of himself, or he again applies the general doctrine to himself personally. “I am not ignorant,” says he, “nor devoid of the fear of God, which ought to reign in the hearts of all the pious.” To <i>know the terror of the Lord,</i> then, is to be influenced by this consideration — that an account must one day be rendered before the judgment-seat of Christ; for the man who seriously considers this must of necessity be touched with fear, and shake off all negligence. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(536)</sup></span> He declares, therefore, that he discharges his apostleship faithfully and with a <i>pure conscience,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:3">2 Timothy 1:3</span>,) as one that <i>walks in the fear of the Lord,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:31">Acts 9:31</span>,) thinking of the account to be rendered by him. As, however, his enemies might object: “You extol yourself, it is true, in magnificent terms, but who is there that sees what you affirm?” He says, in reply to this, that he discharges indeed the work of a teacher in the sight of men, but that it is known to God with what sincerity of mind he acts. “As my mouth speaks to men, so does my heart to God.” </p>
<p><i>And I trust</i> This is a kind of correction of what he had said, for he now boasts that he has not merely God as the witness of his integrity, but also the Corinthians themselves, to whom he had given proof of himself. Two things, therefore, are to be observed here: in the <i>first</i> place, that it is not enough that an individual conducts himself honorably and assiduously <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(537)</sup></span> among men, if his <i>heart is not right in the sight of God,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:21">Acts 8:21</span>;) and <i>secondly,</i> that boasting is vain, where evidence of the reality itself is wanting. For none are more bold in arrogating everything to themselves, than those that have nothing. Let, therefore, the man who would have credit given him, bring forward such works as may afford confirmation to his statements. To be <i>made manifest in their consciences</i> is more than to be known by proofs; for conscience reaches farther than carnal judgment. </p>
