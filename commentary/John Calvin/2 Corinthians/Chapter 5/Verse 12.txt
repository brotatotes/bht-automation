<p><b>12.</b><i>For we commend not ourselves.</i> He confirms what he had said immediately before, and at the same time anticipates a calumny that might be brought against him. For it might seem as if he were too careful as to his own praise, inasmuch as he spoke so frequently respecting himself. Nay, it is probable that this reproach had been cast upon him by the wicked. For when he says — <i>We commend not ourselves again,</i> he says this as if speaking in his own person. To <i>commend</i> is taken in a bad sense, as meaning to <i>boast,</i> or to <i>brag.</i> </p>
<p>When he adds — that he <i>gives them occasion of glorying,</i> he intimates in the <i>first</i> place, that he pleads <i>their</i> cause rather than his own, inasmuch as he gives up all with a view to their glory, and he again indirectly reproves their ingratitude, because they had not perceived it to be their duty to magnify, of their own accord, his Apostleship, so as not to impose upon him this necessity; and farther, because they had not perceived, that it was <i>their</i> interest rather than that of Paul himself, that his Apostleship should be accounted honorable. We are here taught, that Christ’s servants ought to be concerned as to their own reputation, only in so far as is for the advantage of the Church. Paul affirms with truth, that he is actuated by this disposition. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(538)</sup></span> Let others see that they do not on false grounds pretend to follow his example. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(539)</sup></span> We are taught farther, that <i>that</i> alone is a minister’s true praise, that is common to him with the whole Church, rather than peculiar to himself exclusively — in other words, that redounds to the advantage of all. </p>
<p><i>That ye may have something in opposition to those</i> He intimates, in passing, that it is necessary to repress the vanity of those that make empty boasts, and that it is the duty of the Church to do so. For as ambition of this nature is a peculiarly destructive pestilence, it is dangerous to encourage it by dissimulation. As the Corinthians had not taken care to do this, Paul instructs them how they should act for the future. </p>
<p>To <i>glory in appearance, not in heart,</i> is to disguise one’s self by outward show, and to regard sincerity of heart as of no value; for those that will be truly wise <i>will never glory but in God.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:31">1 Corinthians 1:31</span>.) But wherever there is empty show, <i>there</i> is no sincerity, and no integrity of heart. </p>
