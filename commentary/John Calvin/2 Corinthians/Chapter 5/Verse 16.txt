<p><b>16.</b><i>Therefore we henceforth know no man.</i> To <i>know,</i> here, is taken as meaning to <i>reckon.</i> “We do not judge according to external appearance, so as to reckon that man to be the most illustrious who seems so in appearance.” Under the term <i>flesh,</i> he includes all external endowments which mankind are accustomed to hold in estimation; and, in short, every thing which, apart from regeneration, is reckoned worthy of praise. At the same time, he speaks more particularly of outward disguise, or <i>appearance,</i> as it is termed. He alludes, also, without doubt, to the death of which he had made mention. “Since we ought, all of us, to be dead to the present life, nay more, to be nothing in ourselves, no one must be reckoned a servant of Christ on the ground of carnal excellence.” </p>
<p><i>Nay, though we have known Christ.</i> The meaning is — “Though Christ lived for a time in this world, and was known by mankind in those things that have to do with the condition of the present life, he must now be known in another way — <i>spiritually,</i> so that we may have no worldly thoughts respecting him.” This passage is perverted by some fanatics, such as Servetus, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(546)</sup></span> for the purpose of proving, that Christ’s human nature is now absorbed by the Divinity. But how very far removed such a frenzy is from the Apostle’s intention, it is not difficult to perceive; for he speaks here, not of the substance of his body, but of external appearance, nor does he affirm that the flesh is no longer perceived by us in Christ, but says, that Christ is not <i>judged</i> of from that. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(547)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Scripture proclaims throughout, that Christ does now as certainly lead a glorious life in our flesh, as he once suffered in it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(548)</sup></span> Nay more, take away this foundation, and our whole faith falls to the ground; for whence comes the hope of immortality, except from this, that we have already a pattern <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(549)</sup></span> of it in the person of Christ? For as righteousness is restored to us on this ground, that Christ, by fulfilling the law in our nature, has abolished Adam’s disobedience, so also life has been restored to us by this means, that he has opened up for our nature the kingdom of God, from which it had been banished, and has given it a place in the heavenly dwelling. Hence, if we do not now recognize Christ’s flesh, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(550)</sup></span> we lose the whole of that confidence and consolation that we ought to have in him. But we acknowledge Christ as man, and as our brother in his flesh — not in a fleshly manner; because we rest solely in the consideration of his spiritual gifts. Hence he is spiritual to us, not as if he laid aside the body, and became a spirit, but because he regenerates and governs his own people by the influence of his Spirit. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(546)</span> The views held by Servetus respecting the Supreme Being, and a Trinity of persons in the Godhead, “were obscure and chimerical beyond all measure, and amounted, in general, to the following propositions: — That the Deity, before the creation of the world, had produced within himself two personal representations, or manners of existence, which were to be the medium of intercourse between him and mortals, and by whom, consequently, he was to reveal his will, and to display his mercy and beneficence to the children of men; [...] and that these two representations were to cease after the destruction of this terrestrial globe, and to be <i>absorbed into the substance of the Deity</i>, from whence they had been formed.” — <i>Moshem’s Ecclesiastical History</i>, volume 4, pp. 475, 476. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(547)</span> “He (Paul) remembered the words of his Divine Master — ’Whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother;’ and he was taught by them, that though Christianity does not burst asunder the ties of kindred, it requires of all its followers that they be guided by higher considerations in advancing its interests. This may throw light on the bold expression which we find him elsewhere using, when he is speaking of the obligations which believers are under, ‘not to live to themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.’ ‘Henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.’“ — <i>M’Crie’s Sermons</i>, p. 21. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(549)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Comme vne image et gage certain en la personne de Christ</span></blu>;” — “As it were an image and sure pledge in the person of Christ.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(550)</span> Calvin’s meaning plainly is — “If we do not recognize the fact, that Christ is still a partaker of our nature.“ — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
