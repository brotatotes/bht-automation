<p><b>17.</b><i>Therefore if any man is in Christ.</i> As there is something wanting in this expression, it must be supplied in this way — “<i>If any one</i> is desirous to hold some place <i>in Christ,</i> that is, in the kingdom of Christ, or in the Church <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(551)</sup></span> let him be a <i>new creature</i> ” By this expression he condemns every kind of excellence that is wont to be in much esteem among men, if renovation of heart is wanting. “Learning<i>,</i> it is true, and eloquence, and other endowments, are valuable, and worthy to be honored; but, where the fear of the Lord and an upright conscience are wanting, all the honor of them goes for nothing. Let no one, therefore, glory in any distinction, inasmuch as the chief praise of Christians is self-renunciation.” </p>
<p>Nor is this said merely for the purpose of repressing the vanity of the false apostles, but also with the view of correcting the ambitious judgments of the Corinthians, in which outward disguises were of more value than real sincerity — though this is a fault that is common to almost all ages. For where shall we find the man that does not attach much more importance to show, than to true holiness? Let us, therefore, keep in view this admonition — that all that are not renewed by the Spirit of God, should be looked upon as nothing in the Church, by whatever ornaments they may in other respects be distinguished. </p>
<p><i>Old things are passed away.</i> When the Prophets speak of the kingdom of Christ, they foretell that there will be <i>new heavens and a new earth,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:17">Isaiah 65:17</span>,) meaning thereby, that all things will be changed for the better, until the happiness of the pious is completed. As, however, Christ’s kingdom is spiritual, this change must take place chiefly in the Spirit, and hence it is with propriety that he begins with this. There is, therefore, an elegant and appropriate allusion, when Paul makes use of a commendation of this kind, for the purpose of setting forth the value of regeneration. Now by <i>old things</i> he means, the things that are not formed anew by the Spirit of God. Hence this term is placed in contrast with renewing grace. The expression <i>passed away,</i> he uses in the sense of <i>fading away,</i> as things that are of short duration are wont to fall off, when they have passed their proper season. Hence it is only the <i>new man,</i> that flourishes and is vigorous <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(552)</sup></span> in the kingdom of Christ. </p>
