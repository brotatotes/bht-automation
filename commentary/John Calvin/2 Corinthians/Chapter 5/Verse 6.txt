<p><b>6.</b><i>Therefore we are always confident</i> That is, as exercising dependence on the <i>earnest of the Spirit;</i> for, otherwise, we always tremble, or, at least, are courageous or alarmed by turns, and do not retain a uniform and even tenor of mind. Hence, that good courage of which Paul speaks has no place in us, unless it is maintained by the Spirit of God. The connecting particle <i>and,</i> which immediately follows, ought to be understood as meaning <i>because,</i> in this way: We are of good courage, <i>Because we know that we are absent,</i> etc. For this knowledge is the cause of our calmness and confidence; for the reason, why unbelievers are constantly in a ferment of anxiety, or obstinately murmur against God, is, that they think they will ere long cease to exist, and they place in this life the highest and uppermost summit of their felicity. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(517)</sup></span> We, on the other hand, live in the exercise of contentment, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(518)</sup></span> and go forward to death with alacrity, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(519)</sup></span> because a better hope is laid up for us. </p>
<p><i>We are absent from the Lord</i> Scripture everywhere proclaims, that God is <i>present</i> with us: Paul here teaches, that we are <i>absent</i> from him. This is seemingly a contradiction; but this difficulty is easily solved, when we take into view the different respects, in which he is said to be <i>present</i> or <i>absent.</i> He is, then, <i>present</i> with all men, inasmuch as he upholds them by his power. He dwells in them, because </p>
<p>in him they live and move and have their being.<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:28">Acts 17:28</span>.) </p>
<p>He is <i>present</i> with his believing people by the energy of his Spirit; he lives in them, resides in the midst of them, nay more, <i>within</i> them. But in the mean time he is <i>absent</i> from us, inasmuch as he does not present himself to be seen face to face, because we are as yet in a state of exile from his kingdom, and have not as yet attained that blessed immortality, which the angels that are <i>with</i> him enjoy. At the same time, to be <i>absent,</i> in this passage, refers merely to knowledge, as is manifest from the reason that is afterwards added. </p>
