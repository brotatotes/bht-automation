<p><b>15.</b><i>What concord has Christ with Belial?</i> As to the etymology of the word <i>Belial,</i> even the Hebrews themselves are not agreed <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(612)</sup></span> The meaning, however, is not doubtful. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(613)</sup></span> For Moses takes a word or thought of <i>Belial</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(614)</sup></span> to mean a wicked and base thought, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(615)</sup></span> and in various instances <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(616)</sup></span> those who are wicked and abandoned to iniquity, are called <i>men,</i> or <i>sons of Belial.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+13:13">Deuteronomy 13:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jdg+19:22">Judges 19:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1sa+2:12">1 Samuel 2:12</span>.) Hence it is, that Paul has employed the word here to mean the devil, the head of all wicked persons. For from what holds good as to the two heads, he comes down without delay to the members: “As there is an irreconcilable variance between Christ and Satan, so we also must keep aloof from partnership with the wicked.” When, however, Paul says that a Christian has no participation with an unbeliever, he does not mean as to food, clothing, estates, the sun, the air, as I have mentioned above, but as to those things that are peculiar to unbelievers, from which the Lord has separated us. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(612)</span> <i>Beza</i>, when mentioning the different views which have been taken of the etymology of the term <i>Belial</i>, remarks, that some derive it from <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">בלי</span></blu> <blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">יעל</span></blu></heb> <i>beli jahal</i>, (<i>not profitable</i>,) or from <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">בלי</span></blu> <blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">מועיל</span></blu></heb> <i>beli mohil</i>, (<i>worthless</i>,) and that the term, viewed as having this derivation, is peculiarly appropriate to Satan, as being diametrically opposed to Christ, the Greatest and Best; while Jerome derives it from <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">בלי</span></blu></heb> <i>beli</i>, (<i>not</i>) and <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">עיל</span></blu></heb> <i>hol</i>, (<i>a yoke</i>,) as though you should say — <i>without a yoke, not subject to the yoke</i>. Beza gives the preference to the <i>former</i> etymology, while he observes that the <i>latter</i> is also most appropriate to Satan as an <i>apostate</i> spirit. — The original term <i>Belial</i> is rendered in various instances in the Septuagint <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">παράνομος</span></blu></grk>, <i>lawless</i>. — There is here a slight variation in reading.
