<p><b>16.</b><i>What agreement hath the temple of God with idols?</i> Hitherto he has in general terms prohibited believers from associating with the wicked. He now lets them know what was the chief reason, why he had prohibited them from such an association — because they had ceased to reckon the profession of idolatry to be a sin. He had censured that liberty, and had exposed it at great length in the former Epistle. It is probable, however, that all had not yet been gained over, so as to receive the counsel which he had given. Hence it was that he complained of their being <i>straitened in their own bowels</i> — the only thing that hindered their proficiency. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(617)</sup></span> He does not, however, resume that subject anew, but contents himself with a short admonition, as we are accustomed to do, when we treat of things that are well known. At the same time his brevity does not prevent his giving sharp cuts. For how much emphasis there is in that single word, where he teaches that there is no agreement between the <i>temple of God</i> and <i>idols!</i> “It is a sacrilegious profanation, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(618)</sup></span> when an<i>idol</i> or any <i>idolatrous</i> service is introduced into the <i>temple of God</i> Now we are the true <i>temples of God.</i> Hence it is sacrilege to defile ourselves with any contamination of idols. This one consideration, I say, should be to you as good as a thousand. If you are a Christian, <i>what have you to do with idols,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ho+14:8">Hosea 14:8</span>,) for you are the <i>temple of God?”</i> Paul, however, as I have already in part noticed, contends rather by way of exhortation than of doctrine, inasmuch as it would have been superfluous to be still treating of it, as if it were a thing doubtful or obscure. </p>
<p><i>As God saith, I will walk.</i> He proves that we are the <i>temples of God</i> from this, that God of old promised to the people of Israel that he would dwell in the midst of them. In the first place, God cannot dwell <i>among</i> us, without dwelling in each one of us, for he promises this as a singular privilege — <i>I will dwell in the midst of you</i> Nor does this <i>dwelling</i> or presence consist merely in earthly blessings, but must be understood chiefly of spiritual grace. Hence it does not mean simply that God is near us, as though he were in the air, flying round about us, but it means rather that he has his abode in our hearts. If, then, any one objects, that the particle <i>in</i> simply means <i>among,</i> I grant it; but I affirm that, from the circumstance that God promises that he will dwell <i>among</i> us, we may infer that he also remains <i>in</i> us. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(619)</sup></span> And such was the type of the ark, of which mention is made by Moses in that passage, from which Paul appears to have borrowed this quotation. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+26:12">Leviticus 26:12</span>.) If, however, any one thinks that Paul had rather in his eye <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:27">Ezekiel 37:27</span>, the argument will be the same. For the Prophet, when describing the restoration of the Church, mentions as the chief good, the presence of God, which he had himself in the beginning promised by Moses. Now what was prefigured by the ark, was manifested to us more fully in Christ, when he became to us Immanuel <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(620)</sup></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:23">Matthew 1:23</span>.) On this account, I am of opinion that it is Ezekiel, rather than Moses, that is here quoted, because Ezekiel alludes at the same time to the type of the ark, and declares that it will have its fulfillment under the reign of Christ. Now the Apostle takes it for granted, that God dwells nowhere but in a sacred place. If we say of a man, “he dwells here,” that will not make the place a <i>temple;</i> but as to God there is this peculiarity, that whatever place he honors with his presence, he at the same time sanctifies. </p>
