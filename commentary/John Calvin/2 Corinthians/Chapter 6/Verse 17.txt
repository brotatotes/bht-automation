<p><b>17.</b><i>Wherefore come out from the midst of them.</i> This exhortation is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:11">Isaiah 52:11</span>, where the Prophet, when foretelling the deliverance, at length addresses the priests in these terms. For he makes use of a circumlocution to describe the priests, when he says, <i>Ye that bear the vessels of the Lord,</i> inasmuch as they had the charge of the <i>vessels,</i> by means of which the sacrifices, and other parts of divine worship, were performed. There can be no doubt that his design is to admonish them, that, while eagerly desirous to come forth, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(621)</sup></span> they should be on their guard against any contamination from the many pollutions with which the country <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(622)</sup></span> was overrun. Now this is no less applicable to us, than to the ancient Levites, for if so much purity is required on the part of the <i>keepers of the vessels,</i> how much more in the <i>vessels</i> themselves! <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(623)</sup></span> Now all our members are <i>vessels,</i> set apart for the spiritual worship of God; we are also a <i>royal priesthood.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>.) Hence, as we are redeemed by the grace of God, it is befitting that we keep ourselves undefiled in respect of all uncleanness, that we may not pollute the sanctuary of God. As, however, while remaining in this world, we are nevertheless redeemed, and rescued, from the pollutions of the world, so we are not to quit life with the view of departing from all uncleanness, but must simply avoid all participation. The sum is this. “If with a true affection of the heart, we aim at the benefit of redemption, we must beware of defiling ourselves by any contamination from its pollutions.” </p>
