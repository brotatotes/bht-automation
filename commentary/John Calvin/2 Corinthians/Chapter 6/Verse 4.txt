<p><b>4.</b><i>In much patience.</i> The whole of the enumeration that follows is intended to show, that all the tests by which the Lord is accustomed to try his servants were to be found in Paul, and that there was no kind of test to which he had not been subjected, in order that the faithfulness of his ministry might be more fully established. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(584)</sup></span> Among other things that he enumerates, there are some that are under all circumstances required for all the servants of Christ. Of this nature are <i>labors, sincerity, knowledge, watchings, gentleness, love, the word of truth, the Spirit, the power of God, the armor of righteousness.</i> There are other things that are not necessary in all cases; for in order that any one may be a servant of Christ, it is not absolutely necessary, that he be put to the test by means of <i>stripes</i> and <i>imprisonments</i> Hence these things will in some cases be wanting in the experience of the best. It becomes all, however, to be of such a disposition as to present themselves to be tried, as Paul was, with <i>stripes</i> and <i>imprisonments,</i> if the Lord shall see meet. </p>
<p><i>Patience</i> is the regulation of the mind in adversity, which is an excellence that ought invariably to distinguish a good minister. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(585)</sup></span> <i>Afflictions</i> include more than <i>necessities;</i> for by the term <i>necessity</i> here I understand <i>poverty.</i> Now this is common to many ministers, there being few of them that are not in poor circumstances; but at the same time not to all. For why should a moderate amount of riches prevent a man from being reckoned a servant of Christ, who, in other respects, is pious, is of upright mind and honorable deportment, and is distinguished by other excellences. As the man that is poor is not on that account to be straightway accounted a good minister, so the man that is rich is not on that account to be rejected. Nay more, Paul in another passage glories not less in his <i>knowing how to abound,</i> than in <i>knowing how to be in want.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+4:12">Philippians 4:12</span>.) Hence we must observe the distinction that I have mentioned, between <i>occasional</i> and <i>invariable</i> grounds of commendation. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(586)</sup></span> </p>
