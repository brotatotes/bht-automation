<p><b>11.</b><i>What earnest desire it produced in you</i> I shall not enter into any dispute as to whether the things that Paul enumerates are effects of repentance, or belong to it, or are preparatory to it, as all this is unnecessary for understanding Paul’s design, for he simply proves the repentance of the Corinthians from its signs, or accompaniments. At the same time he makes <i>sorrow according to God</i> to be the source of all these things, inasmuch as they spring from it — which is assuredly the case; for when we have begun to feel self-dissatisfaction, we are afterwards stirred up to seek after the other things. </p>
<p>What is meant by <i>earnest desire,</i> we may understand from what is opposed to it; for so long as there is no apprehension of sin, we lie drowsy and inactive. Hence drowsiness or carelessness, or unconcern, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(646)</sup></span> stands opposed to that <i>earnest desire,</i> that he makes mention of. Accordingly, <i>earnest desire</i> means simply an eager and active assiduity in the correcting of what is amiss, and in the amendment of life. </p>
<p><i>Yea, what clearing of yourselves</i> Erasmus having rendered it <i>satisfaction,</i> ignorant persons, misled by the ambiguity of the term, have applied it to popish <i>satisfactions,</i> whereas Paul employs the term <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀπολογίαν</span></blu></grk> <i>,</i> (<i>defense.</i>) It is on this account that I have preferred to retain the word <blu><i>defensionem</i></blu> <i>,</i> which the Old Interpreter had made use of. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(647)</sup></span> It is, however, to be observed, that it is a kind of <i>defense</i> that consists rather in supplication for pardon, than in extenuation of sin. As a son, who is desirous to clear himself to his father, does not enter upon a regular pleading of his cause, but by acknowledging his fault excuses himself, rather in the spirit of a suppliant, than in a tone of confidence, hypocrites, also, excuse themselves — nay more, they haughtily defend themselves, but it is rather in the way of disputing with God, than of returning to favor with him; and should any one prefer the word <blu><i>excusationem</i></blu> <i>,</i> (<i>excuse,</i>) I do not object to it; because the meaning will amount to the same thing, that the Corinthians were prompted to clear themselves, whereas previously they cared not what Paul thought of them. </p>
<p><i>Yea, what indignation</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(648)</sup></span> This disposition, also, is attendant on sacred sorrow — that the sinner is indignant against his vices, and even against himself, as also all that are actuated by a right zeal <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(649)</sup></span> are indignant, as often as they see that God is offended. This disposition, however, is more intense than sorrow. For the <i>first</i> step is, that evil be displeasing to us. The <i>second</i> is, that, being inflamed with anger, we press hard upon ourselves, so that our consciences may be touched to the quick. It may, however, be taken here to mean the<i>indignation,</i> with which the Corinthians had been inflamed against the sins of one or a few, whom they had previously spared. Thus they repented of their concurrence or connivance. </p>
<p><i>Fear</i> is what arises from an apprehension of divine judgment, while the offender thinks — “Mark it well, an account must be rendered by thee, and what wilt thou advance in the presence of so great a judge?” For, alarmed by such a consideration, he begins to tremble. </p>
<p>As, however, the wicked themselves are sometimes touched with an alarm of this nature, he adds <i>desire</i> This disposition we know to be more of a voluntary nature than <i>fear,</i> for we are often afraid against our will, but we never desire but from inclination. Hence, as they had dreaded punishment on receiving Paul’s admonition, so they eagerly aimed at amendment. </p>
<p>But what are we to understand by <i>zeal?</i> There can be no doubt that he intended a climax. Hence it means more than <i>desire</i> Now we may understand by it, that they stirred up each other in a spirit of mutual rivalry. It is simpler, however, to understand it as meaning, that every one, with great fervor of zeal, aimed to give evidence of his repentance. Thus zeal is intensity of desire. </p>
<p><i>Yea, what revenge</i> What we have said as to <i>indignation,</i> must be applied also to <i>revenge;</i> for the wickedness which they had countenanced by their connivance and indulgence, they had afterwards shown themselves rigorous in avenging. They had for some time tolerated incest; but, on being admonished by Paul, they had not merely ceased to countenance him, but had been strict reprovers in chastening him, — this was the<i>revenge</i> that was meant. As, however, we ought to punish sins wherever they are, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(650)</sup></span> and not only so, but should begin more especially with ourselves, there is something farther meant in what the Apostle says here, for he speaks of the signs of repentance. There is, among others, this more particularly — that, by punishing sins, we anticipate, in a manner, the judgment of God, as he teaches elsewhere, If we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged by the Lord. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:31">1 Corinthians 11:31</span>.) We are not, however, to infer from this, that mankind, by taking vengeance upon themselves, compensate to God for the punishment due to him, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(651)</sup></span> so that they redeem themselves from his hand. The case stands thus — that, as it is the design of God by chastising us, to arouse us from our carelessness, that, being reminded of his displeasure, we may be on our guard for the future, when the sinner himself is beforehand in inflicting punishment of his own accord, the effect is, that he no longer stands in need of such an admonition from God. </p>
<p>But it is asked, whether the Corinthians had an eye to Paul, or to God, in this <i>revenge,</i> as well as in the <i>zeal,</i> and <i>desire,</i> and the rest. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(652)</sup></span> I answer, that all these things are, under all <i>circumstances,</i> attendant upon repentance, but there is a difference in the case of an individual sinning <i>secretly</i> before God, or openly before the world. If a person’s sin is secret, it is enough if he has this disposition in the sight of God; on the other hand, where the sin is open, there is required besides an open manifestation of repentance. Thus the Corinthians, who had sinned openly and to the great offense of the good, required to give evidence of their repentance by these tokens. </p>
