<p><b>2.</b><i>Make room for us.</i> Again he returns from a statement of doctrine to treat of what more especially concerns himself, but simply with this intention — that he may not lose his pains in admonishing the Corinthians. Nay more, he closes the preceding admonition with the same statement, which he had made use of by way of preface. For what is meant by the expressions<i>Receive us,</i> or <i>Make room for us?</i> It is equivalent to, <i>Be ye enlarged,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:13">2 Corinthians 6:13</span>;) that is, “Do not allow corrupt affections, or unfavorable apprehensions, to prevent this doctrine from making its way into your minds, and obtaining a place within you. For as I lay myself out for your salvation with a fatherly zeal, it were unseemly that you should turn a deaf ear <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(630)</sup></span> upon me.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(631)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>We have done injury to no man.</i> He <i>declares</i> that there is no reason why they should have their minds alienated, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(632)</sup></span> inasmuch as he had not given them occasion of offense in any thing. Now he mentions <i>three</i> kinds of offenses, as to which he declares himself to be guiltless. The <i>first</i> is, manifest hurt or injury. The <i>second</i> is, the corruption that springs from false doctrine. The <i>third</i> is, defrauding or cheating in worldly goods. These are <i>three</i> things by which, for the most part, pastors <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(633)</sup></span> are wont to alienate the minds of the people from them — when they conduct themselves in an overbearing manner, and, making their authority their pretext, break forth into tyrannical cruelty or <i>unreasonableness,</i> — <i>or</i> when they draw aside from the right path those to whom they ought to have been guides, and infect them with the corruption of false doctrine, — or when they manifest an insatiable covetousness, by eagerly desiring what belongs to another. Should any one wish to have it in shorter compass-the <i>first</i> is, fierceness and an abuse of power by excessive <i>insolence</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(634)</sup></span> the <i>second,</i> unfaithfulness in teaching. the <i>third,</i> avarice. </p>
