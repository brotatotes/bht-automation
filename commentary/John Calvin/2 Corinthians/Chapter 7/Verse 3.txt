<p><b>3.</b><i>I say not this to condemn you.</i> As the foregoing apology was a sort of expostulation, and we can scarcely avoid reproaching when we expostulate, he softens on this account what he had said. “I clear myself,” says he, <i>“</i> in such a way as to be desirous to avoid, what would tend to your dishonor.” The Corinthians, it is true, were unkind, and they deserved that, on Paul’s being acquitted from blame, <i>they</i> should be substituted in his place as the guilty party; nay more, that they should be held guilty in two respects — in respect of ingratitude, and on the ground of their having calumniated the innocent. Such, however, is the Apostle’s moderation, that he refrains from recrimination, contenting himself with standing simply on the defensive. </p>
<p><i>For I have before said.</i> Those that love do not assail; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(635)</sup></span> nay more, if any fault has been committed, they either cover it over by taking no notice of it, or soften it by kindness. For a disposition to reproach is a sign of hatred. Hence Paul, with the view of showing that he has no inclination to distress the Corinthians, declares his affection towards them. At the same time, he undoubtedly in a manner <i>condemns</i> them, while he says that he does not do so. As, however, there is a great difference between gall and vinegar, so there is also between that condemnation, by which we harass a man in a spirit of hatred, with the view of blasting him with infamy, and, on the other hand, that, by which we endeavor to bring back an offender into the right way, that, along with safety, he may in addition to this regain his honors unimpaired. </p>
<p><i>Ye are in our hearts</i> — that is, “I carry you about with me inclosed in my heart.” <i>To die and live with you</i> — that is, “So that no change can loosen our attachment, for I am prepared not merely to <i>live with you,</i> but also to be associated with you in death, if necessary, and to endure anything rather than renounce your friendship.” Mark well, in what manner all pastors. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(636)</sup></span> ought to be affected. </p>
