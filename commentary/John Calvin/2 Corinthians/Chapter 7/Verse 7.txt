<p><b>7.</b><i>And not by his coming only.</i> Lest the Corinthians should object in these terms — “What is it to us if Titus has cheered you by his coming? No doubt, as you loved him, you would feel delighted to see him;” he declares, that the occasion of his joy was, that Titus had, on returning from them, communicated the most joyful intelligence. Accordingly he declares, that it was not so much the presence of one individual, as the prosperous condition of the Corinthians, that had cheered him. </p>
<p><i>Your desire</i> Mark, what joyful tidings were communicated to Paul respecting the Corinthians. Their <i>desire</i> originated in the circumstance, that they held Paul’s doctrine in high estimation. Their <i>tears</i> were a token of respect; because, being affected with his reproof, they mourned over their sins. Their <i>zeal</i> was an evidence of good will. From these <i>three</i> things he inferred that they were penitent. This afforded him full satisfaction, because he had no other intention or anxiety, than the consulting of their welfare. </p>
<p><i>So that I rejoiced the more</i> — that is, “So that all my griefs and distresses gave way to joy.” Hence we see, not merely with what fervor of mind he desired the public good of the Church, but also how mild and gentle a disposition he possessed, as being one that could suddenly bury in oblivion offenses of so serious a nature. At the same time, this may rather be taken in another way, so as to be viewed in connection with what follows, and I am not sure but that this meaning would correspond better with Paul’s intention. As, however, it is a matter of no great moment, I pass over it slightly. </p>
