<p><b>13.</b><i>Not that others.</i> This is a confirmation of the preceding statement — that a readiness of will is well-pleasing to God alike in poverty and in wealth, inasmuch as God does not mean that we should be reduced to straits, in order that others may be at ease through our liberality. True, indeed, it is certain, that we owe to God, not merely a part, but all that we are, and all that we have, but in His kindness He spares us thus far, that He is satisfied with that participation of which the Apostle here speaks, What he teaches here you must understand to mean an abatement from the rigor of law. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(673)</sup></span> In the mean time, it is our part to stir ourselves up from time to time to liberality, because we must not be so much afraid of going to excess in this department. The danger is on the side of excessive niggardliness. </p>
<p>This doctrine, however, is needful in opposition to fanatics, who think that you have done nothing, unless you have stripped yourself of every thing, so as to make every thing common; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(674)</sup></span> and, certainly, they gain this much by their frenzy, that no one can give alms with a quiet conscience. Hence we must carefully observe Paul’s (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐπιείκεια)</span></blu></grk> <i>mildness,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(675)</sup></span> and moderation, in stating that our alms are well-pleasing to God, when we relieve the necessity of our brethren from our abundance — not in such a way that they are at ease, and we are in want, but so that we may, from what belongs to us, distribute, so far as our resources allow, and that with a cheerful mind. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(676)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>By an equality Equality</i> may be taken in two senses, either as meaning a mutual compensation, when like is given for like, or, as meaning a proper adjustment. I understand <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἰσότητα</span></blu></grk> simply as meaning — an <i>equality of proportional right,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(677)</sup></span> as Aristotle terms it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(678)</sup></span> In this signification it is made use of, also, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+4:1">Colossians 4:1</span>, where he exhorts “masters to give to their servants what is <i>equal.</i> ” He certainly does not mean, that they should be equal in condition and station, but by this term he expresses that humanity and clemency, and kind treatment, which masters, in their turn, owe to their servants. Thus the Lord recommends to us a proportion of this nature, that we may, in so far as every one’s resources admit, afford help to the indigent, that there may not be some in affluence, and others in indigence. Hence he adds — at <i>the present time.</i> At that time, indeed, necessity pressed upon them. Hence we are admonished that, in exercising beneficence, we must provide for the present necessity, if we would observe the true rule of equity. </p>
