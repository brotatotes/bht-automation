<p><b>18.</b><i>We have sent with him the brother.</i> The circumstance that <i>three</i> persons are sent, is an evidence, that great expectations were entertained respecting the Corinthians, and it became them to be so much the more attentive to duty, that they might not disappoint the hopes of the Churches. It is uncertain, however, who this <i>second</i> person was; only that some conjecture that it was Luke, others that it was Barnabas. Chrysostom prefers to consider it to have been Barnabas. I agree with him, because it appears that, by the suffrages of the Churches, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(690)</sup></span> he was associated with Paul as a companion. As, however, it is almost universally agreed, that Luke was one of those who were the bearers of this Epistle, I have no objection that he be reckoned to be the <i>third</i> that is made mention of. </p>
<p>Now the second person, whoever he may be, he honors with a signal commendation, that he had conducted himself as to the gospel in a praiseworthy manner, that is, he had earned applause by promoting the gospel. For, although Barnabas gave place to Paul in the department of <i>speaking,</i> yet in <i>acting</i> they both concurred. He adds farther, that he had received praise, not from one individual, or even from one Church merely, but from all the Churches. To this general testimony he subjoins a particular one, that is suitable to the subject in hand — that he had been chosen for this department by the concurrence of the Churches. Now it was likely, that this honor would not have been conferred upon him, had he not been long before known to be qualified for it. We must observe, however, the mode of election — that which was customary among the Greeks — <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χειροτονία</span></blu></grk>, (<i>a show of hands</i>,) <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(691)</sup></span> in which the leaders <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(692)</sup></span> took the precedence by authority and counsel, and regulated the whole proceeding, while the common people intimated their approval. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(693)</sup></span> </p>
