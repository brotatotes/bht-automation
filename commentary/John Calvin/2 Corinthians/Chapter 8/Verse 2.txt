<p><b>2.</b><i>In much trial</i> — In other words, while they were tried with adversity, they, nevertheless, did not cease to rejoice in the Lord: nay, this disposition rose so high, as to swallow up sorrow; for the minds of the Macedonians, which must otherwise have been straitened, required to be set free from their restraints, that they might liberally <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(661)</sup></span> furnish aid to the brethren. </p>
<p>By the term <i>joy</i> he means that spiritual consolation by which believers are sustained under their afflictions; for the wicked either delude themselves with empty consolations, by avoiding a perception of the evil, and drawing off the mind to rambling thoughts, or else they wholly give way to grief, and allow themselves to be overwhelmed with it. Believers, on the other hand, seek occasions of <i>joy</i> in the affliction itself, as we see in the 8<sup>th</sup> chapter of the Romans. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(662)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>And their deep poverty.</i> Here we have a metaphor taken from exhausted vessels, as though he had said, that the Macedonians had been emptied, so that they had now reached the bottom. He says, that even in such straits they had abounded in liberality, and had been rich, so as to have enough — not merely for their own use, but also for giving assistance to others. Mark the way, in which we shall always be liberal even in the most straitened poverty — if by liberality of mind we make up for what is deficient in our coffers. </p>
<p><i>Liberality</i> is opposed to niggardliness, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span>, where Paul requires this on the part of deacons. For what makes us more close-handed than we ought to be is — when we look too carefully, and too far forward, in contemplating the dangers that may occur — when we are excessively cautious and careful — when we calculate too narrowly what we will require during our whole life, or, in fine, how much we lose when the smallest portion is taken away. The man, that depends upon the blessing of the Lord, has his mind set free from these trammels, and has, at the same time, his hands opened for beneficence. Let us now draw an argument from the less to the greater. “Slender means, nay poverty, did not prevent the Macedonians from doing good to their brethren: What excuse, then, will the Corinthians have, if they keep back, while opulent and affluent in comparison of them?” </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(662)</span> Calvin refers, it is probable, more particularly to Paul’s statement in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>, And we know that all things shall work together for good, etc.; in commenting upon which passage, our author observes: “<blu>Ex supradictis nunc concludit, tantum abesse, quin salutem nostram remorentur hujus vitae aerumnae, ut sint potius eius adminicula</blu>;” — “From what has been said previously, he now draws this conclusion, that the distresses of this life are so far from being hinderances to our salvation, that they are rather helps to it.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
