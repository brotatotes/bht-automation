<p><b>20.</b><i>Avoiding this,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(694)</sup></span> <i>that no one</i> Lest any one should think, that the Churches had an unfavorable opinion of Paul, as if it had been from distrusting his integrity that they had associated partners with him, as persons that are suspected are wont to have guards set over them, he declares that he had been the adviser of this measure, with the view of providing against calumnies. Here some one will ask, “Would any one have been so impudent, as to venture to defame with even the slightest suspicion the man, whose fidelity must have been, in all quarters, beyond every surmise?” I answer, Who is there that will be exempt from Satan’s bite, when even Christ himself was not spared by them? Behold, Christ is exposed to the reproaches <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(695)</sup></span> of the wicked, and shall his servants be in safety? (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:25">Matthew 10:25</span>.) Nay rather, the more upright a person is, in that proportion does Satan assail him by every kind of contrivance, if he can by any means shake his credit, for there would arise from this a much greater occasion of stumbling. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(696)</sup></span> Hence the higher the station in which we are placed, we must so much the more carefully imitate Paul’s circumspection and modesty. He was not so lifted up, as not to be under control equally with any individual of the flock. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(697)</sup></span> He was not so self-complacent, as to think it beneath his station to provide against calumnies. Hence he prudently shunned dangers, and used great care not to furnish any wicked person with a handle against him. And, certainly, nothing is more apt to give rise to unfavorable surmises, than the management of public money. </p>

Here it is used in a metaphorical sense for <i>taking care,</i> that no one should find fault with the Apostle, as unfaithful in the management of the collections.” — <i>M’Knight.</i> The verb is employed in substantially the same sense by Plutarch: <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">οἱ κατὰ ψυχὴν χειμῶνες βαρύτεροι στείλασθαι τὸν ἄνθρωπον οὐκ ἐω̑ντες οὐδὲ ἐπιστὢσαι τεταραγμένον τὸν λογισμὸν</span></blu></grk> —”The tempests of the mind are more severe — not allowing a man to shift his course, or to calm down troubled reason.” — (Plut. tom. 2 p. 501.) — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
