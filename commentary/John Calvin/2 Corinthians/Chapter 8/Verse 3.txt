<p><b>3.</b><i>To their power, and even beyond their power.</i> When he says that they were <i>willing of themselves,</i> he means that they were, of their own accord, so well prepared for the duty, that they needed no exhortation. It was a great thing — to strive up to the measure of their ability; and hence, to exert themselves <i>beyond</i> their ability, showed a rare, and truly admirable excellence. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(663)</sup></span> Now he speaks according to the common custom of men, for the common rule of doing good is that which Solomon prescribes, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="pr+5:15">Proverbs 5:15</span>) — </p>
<p>to drink water out of our own fountains, and let the rivulets go past, that they may flow onwards to others. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(664)</sup></span> </p>
<p>The Macedonians, on the other hand, making no account of themselves, and almost losing sight of themselves, concerned themselves rather as to providing for others. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(665)</sup></span> In fine, those that are in straitened circumstances are willing beyond their ability, if they lay out any thing upon others from their slender means. </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(664)</span> <i>Poole,</i> in his Annotations, observes that “the metaphor” made use of in the passage referred to, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="pr+5:15">Proverbs 5:15</span>,) “is to be understood either 1, of the free and lawful use of a man’s estate, both for his own comfort and for the good of others, or 2, of the honest use of matrimony.” “The latter meaning,” he remarks, “better suits with the whole context, both foregoing and following, and thus it is explained in the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="pr+5:18">Proverbs 5:18</span>.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
