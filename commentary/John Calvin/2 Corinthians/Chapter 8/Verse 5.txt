<p><b>5.</b><i>And not as</i> He expected from them an ordinary degree of willingness, such as any Christian should manifest; but they went beyond his expectation, inasmuch as they not only had their worldly substance in readiness, but were prepared to devote even <i>themselves. They gave themselves,</i> says he, <i>first to God, then to us.</i> </p>
<p>It may be asked, whether their giving themselves to God, and to Paul, were two different things. It is quite a common thing, that when God charges or commands through means of any one, he associates the person whom he employs as his minister, both in authority to enjoin, and in the obedience that is rendered. </p>
<p>It seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us; </p>
<p>say the Apostles, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:28">Acts 15:28</span>,) while at the same time they merely, as instruments, declared what had been revealed and enjoined by the Spirit. Again, </p>
<p>The people believed the Lord and his servant Moses,<br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:31">Exodus 14:31</span>,) </br></p>
<p>while at the same time Moses had nothing apart from God. This, too, is what is meant by the clause that follows — <i>by the will of God</i> For, as they were obedient to God, who had committed themselves to his ministry, to be regulated by his counsel, they were influenced by this consideration in listening to Paul, as speaking from God’s mouth. </p>
