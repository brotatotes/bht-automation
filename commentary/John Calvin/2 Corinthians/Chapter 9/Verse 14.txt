Nay more, he has said that this would be a confession, which would manifest to all their unanimous concurrence in faith, and in pious obedience. He now adds the reward that the Corinthians would receive from the saints — good-will springing from gratitude, (736) and earnest prayers. “They will have,” says he, “the means of requiting you in return; for they will regard you with the love with which they ought, and they will be careful to commend you to God in their prayers.” At length, as though he had obtained his desire, he prepares himself (737) to celebrate the praises of God, by which he was desirous to testify the confidence felt by him, as though the matter were already accomplished. (735) “Qui puisse seruir a esmouuoir et encourager les Corinthtens.” — “That may serve to stir up and encourage the Corinthians.” (736) “Procedante de la recognoissance du benefice qu’ils auoyent receu des Corinthtens;” — “Proceeding from an acknowledgment of the kindness that they had received from the Corinthians.” (737) “D’vne grande affection;” — “With great ardour.”
