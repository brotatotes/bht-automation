<p><b>4.</b><i>In this confidence</i> The Greek term being <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑπόστασις</span></blu></grk> the Old Interpreter has rendered it <blu><i>substantiam</i></blu> <i>,</i> (<i>substance.</i>) <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(708)</sup></span> Erasmus renders it <blu><i>argumentum</i></blu> <i>,</i> (<i>subject-matter,</i>) but neither is suitable. Budaeus, however, observes, that this term is sometimes taken to mean <i>boldness,</i> or <i>confidence,</i> as it is used by Polybius when he says, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὀυχ οὑτω την δύναμιν ὡς τὴν ὑπόστασιν καὶ τόλμαν αὐτοῦ καταπεπληγμένον τῶν εναντίων</span></blu></grk> — “It was not so much his bodily strength, as his <i>boldness</i> and intrepidity, that proved confounding to the enemy.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(709)</sup></span> Hence <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑποτατικός</span></blu></grk> sometimes means one that is <i>bold</i> and <i>confident.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(710)</sup></span> Now <i>every</i> one must see, how well this meaning accords with Paul’s thread of discourse. Hence it appears, that other interpreters have, through inadvertency, fallen into a mistake. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(708)</span> In Wiclif’s version, (1380,) the rendering is, “in this substaunce;” Rheims (1582) has, “in this substance.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(709)</span> The expression here quoted from Polybius, (lib. 6: cap. 53, p. 691,) is made use of by the historian in relating a heroic exploit of Publius Horatius Cocles, who, on occasion of a sudden attempt being made upon the city of Rome by Porsena, king of Clusium, the most powerful prince at that time in Italy, having stationed himself, with singular intrepidity, on the Sublician bridge, along with two others, withstood the attack of the enemy, and effectually obstructed their progress, until the bridge was cut down from behind, after which he leaped into the river, and swam across to his friends in safety, amidst the darts of the enemy. In honor of this daring adventure, a statue of Cocles, as is stated by Livy, (2:10,) was placed in the <i>Comitium,</i> and a grant of land was made to him, as much as he could plow round in one day. <i>Raphelius</i> adduces another instance in which Polybius employs <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑπόστασις</span></blu></grk> in the same sense — “When the Rhodians,” says he, “perceive <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὴν τῶν Βυζαντιῶν ὑποστασαι</span></blu></grk> — the <i>intrepidity</i> of the Byzantians.” (Pol. lib. 6: p. 440.) — <i>Ed</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(710)</span> The adjective <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑποστατικός</span></blu></grk> is used in this sense by Aristotle, Eth. End. ii. 5, 5, and the adverb derived from it, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑποστατικῶς,</span></blu></grk> has a corresponding signification in Polybius, (lib. 5: cap. 16, p. 508, line 1,) <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Τοῦ δὲ βασιλέως ὑποστατικῶς φήσαντος</span></blu></grk> “the king having spoken <i>with firmness.</i> ” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
