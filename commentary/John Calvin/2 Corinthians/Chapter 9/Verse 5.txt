<p><b>5.</b><i>As a blessing, not in the way of niggardliness</i> In place of <i>blessing,</i> some render it <i>collection.</i> I have preferred, however, to render it literally, as the Greeks employed the term <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εὐλογίας</span></blu></grk> to express the Hebrew word <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">ברכה</span></blu></heb>, (<i>beracah,</i>) which is used in the sense of <i>a blessing,</i> that is, an invoking of prosperity, as well as in the sense of <i>beneficence.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(711)</sup></span> The reason I reckon to be this, that it is in the first instance ascribed to God. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(712)</sup></span> Now we know how God blesses us efficiently by his simple nod. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(713)</sup></span> When it is from this transferred to men, it retains the same meaning, — improperly, indeed, inasmuch as men have not the same efficacy in blessing, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(714)</sup></span> but yet not unsuitably by transference. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(715)</sup></span> </p>
<p>To <i>blessing</i> Paul opposes <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πλεονεξίαν</span></blu></grk> <i>,</i> (<i>grudging,</i>) which term the Greeks employ to denote excessive greediness, as well as fraud and niggardliness. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(716)</sup></span> I have rather preferred the term <i>niggardliness</i> in this contrast; for Paul would have them give, not grudgingly, but. with a liberal spirit, as will appear still more clearly from what follows. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(711)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Qui signifie tant benediction, c’est a dire vn souhait ou priere pour la prosperite d’autruy, que beneficence ou liberalite</span></blu>;” — “Which denotes blessing — that is to say, a desire or prayer for the prosperity of another, as well as beneficence, or liberality.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(712)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Ie pense que la raison de ceste derniere signification est, pource que ce mot est en premier lieu et proprement attribue a Dieu</span></blu>;” — “I think that the reason of this last signification is — because it is in the first place and properly ascribed to God.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(713)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Par la seule et simple volonte</span></blu>;” — “By a mere simple exercise of the will.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(714)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Que Dieu ha</span></blu>;” — “That God has.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(715)</span> “God’s blessing of us, and our blessing of God, differ exceedingly. For God blesseth us efficiently, by exhibiting his mercies to us. We bless God, not by adding any good to him, but declaratively only. God’s <blu><i>betedicere</i></blu> is <blu><i>benefacere</i></blu> — <i>his words</i> are <i>works,</i> but our blessing (as Aquinas says) is only <blu><i>recognoscitium</i></blu> <i>,</i> and <blu><i>expressivum</i></blu> — <i>an acknowledgment only and celebration of that goodness.which God hath.</i> ” — <i>Burgesse</i> on <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:0">2 Corinthians 1:0</span>. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(716)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Qui signifie tant couuoitise exccssiue, ou auarice, que chichete, et quand on rogne quelque chose de ce qu’il faudroit donner</span></blu>;” — “Which denotes excessive covetousness or avarice, as well as niggardliness, and when one pares off something from what he should give.” </p>
