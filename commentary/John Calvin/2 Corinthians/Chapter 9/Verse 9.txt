<p><b>9.</b><i>As it is written, He hath dispersed</i> He brings forward a proof from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+112:9">Psalms 112:9</span>, where, along with other excellencies of the pious man, the Prophet mentions this, too, — that he will not be wanting in doing good, but as water flows forth incessantly from a perennial fountain, so the gushing forth of his liberality will be unceasing. Paul has an eye to this — that we be not <i>weary in well doing,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:9">Galatians 6:9</span>,) and this is also what the Prophet’s words mean. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(722)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(722)</span> “Our author, when commenting on the passage here referred to, remarks: “This passage is quoted by Paul, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:9">2 Corinthians 9:9</span>,) in which he informs us, that it is an easy matter for God to bless us with plenty, so that we may exercise our bounty freely, deliberately, and impartially, and this accords best with the design of the Prophet.” — Calvin on the Psalms, vol. 4, p. 329. — Ed. </p>
