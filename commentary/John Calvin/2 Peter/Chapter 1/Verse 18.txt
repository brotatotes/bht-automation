<p><b>18.</b><i>In the holy mount.</i> He calls it <i>the holy mount</i>, for the same reason that the ground was called holy where God appeared to Moses. For wherever the Lord comes, as he is the fountain of all holiness, he makes holy all things by the odor of his presence. And by this mode of speaking we are taught, not only to receive God reverently wherever he shews himself, but also to prepare ourselves for holiness, as soon as he comes nigh us, as it was commanded the people when the law was proclaimed on Mount Sinai. And it is a general truth, </p>
<p>“Be ye holy, for I am holy, who dwell in the midst of you.” <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+11:44">Leviticus 11:44</span>.) </p>
