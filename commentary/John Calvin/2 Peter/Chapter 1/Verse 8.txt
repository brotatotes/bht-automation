<p><b>8.</b><i>For if these things be in you.</i> Then, he says, you will at length prove that Christ is really known by you, if ye be endued with virtue, temperance, and the other endowments. For the knowledge of Christ is an efficacious thing and a living root, which brings forth fruit. For by saying that these things would make them <i>neither barren nor unfruitful,</i> he shews that all those glory, in vain and falsely, that they have the knowledge of Christ, who boast of it without love, patience, and the like gifts, as Paul also says in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:20">Ephesians 4:20</span>, </p>
<p>“Ye have not so learned Christ, if so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus, that ye put off the old man,” etc. </p>
<p>For he means that those who possess Christ without newness of life, have never been rightly taught his doctrine. </p>
<p>But he would not have the faithful to be only taught patience, godliness, temperance, love; but he requires a continual progress to be made as to these endowments, and that justly, for we are as yet far off from the goal. We ought, therefore, always to make advances, so that God’s gifts may continually increase in us. </p>
