<p><b>12.</b><i>But these.</i> He proceeds with what he had begun to say respecting impious and wicked corrupters. And, first, he condemns their loose manners and the obscene wickedness of their whole life; and then he says that they were audacious and perverse, so that by their scurrilous garrulity they insinuated themselves into the favor of many. </p>
<p>He especially compares them to those <i>brute animals,</i> which seem to have come to existence to be ensnared, and to be driven to their own ruin by their own instinct; as though he had said, that being induced by no allurements, they of themselves hasten to throw themselves into the snares of Satan and of death. For what we render, <i>naturally born,</i> Peter has literally, “natural born.” But there is not much difference in the sense, whether one of the two has been by somebody else supplied, or by putting down both he meant more fully to express his meaning. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(170)</sup></span> </p>
<p>What he adds, <i>speaking evil of the things that they understand not,</i> refers to the pride and presumption he mentioned in the preceding verse. He then says that all excellency was insolently despised by them, because they were become wholly stupefied, so that they differed nothing from beasts. But the word I have rendered for destruction, and afterwards in corruption, is the same, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">φθορὰ</span></blu></grk>; but it is variously taken: but when he says that they would perish in their own corruption, he shews that their corruptions would be ruinous or destructive. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(170)</span> The words may be thus rendered, — </p>
<p>“But these, as natural unreasoning animals, born for capture and destruction, speaking evil of things which they understand not, shall utterly perish through their own corruption.” </p>
<p>They are compared to animals which are by nature without reason, and such as live on prey, wild and rapacious, which seem to have been made to be taken and destroyed; and they are often taken and destroyed while committing plunder. So these men, their wickedness would be the means of ensnaring and destroying them. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
