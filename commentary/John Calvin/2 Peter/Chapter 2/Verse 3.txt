<p><b>3.</b><i>With feigned words.</i> Peter endeavors by all means to render the faithful displeased with ungodly teachers, that they might resist them more resolutely and more constantly. It is especially an odious thing that we should be exposed to sale like vile slaves. But he testifies that this is done, when any one seduces us from the redemption of Christ. He calls those <i>feigned words</i> which are artfully formed for the purpose of deceiving. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(166)</sup></span> Unless then one is so mad as to sell the salvation of his soul to false teachers, let him close up every avenue that may lead to their wicked inventions. For the same purpose as before he repeats again, that their destruction delayed not, that is, that he might frighten the good from their society. For since they were given up to a sudden destruction, every one who connected himself with them, must have perished with them. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(166)</span> Either “feigned” or “invented” may be meant by <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πλαστοῖς</span></blu></grk> : if “feigned,” then they were words used not conveying their real sentiments, but adopted for the purpose of alluring others, as is the case with those who pretend great zeal for truth and great love for souls, when their object is to gain adherents for filthy lucre’s sake. But if “invented” be adopted, then <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">λόγοι</span></blu></grk> must mean narratives or fables, — “invented (or fictitious) fables,” or tales. And this is the rendering of <i>Macknight.</i> And he says, that the Apostle had probably in view the fables concerning the visions of angels and the miracles performed at the sepulchres of departed saints, which the false teachers in the early ages, and the monks in latter times, fabricated, to draw money from the people. Similar are the devices of superstitious men, greedy of gain, in every age. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
