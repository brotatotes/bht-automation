<p>Heaven and earth, he says, shall pass away for our sakes; is it meet, then, for us to be engrossed with the things of earth, and not, on the contrary, to attend to a holy and godly life? The corruptions of heaven and earth will be purged by fire, while yet as the creatures of God they are pure; what then ought to be done by us who are full of so many pollutions? As to the word <i>godlinesses</i> (<blu><i>pietatibus</i></blu> ,) the plural number is used for the singular, except you take it as meaning the duties of godliness. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(180)</sup></span> Of the elements of the world I shall only say this one thing, that they are to be consumed, only that they may be renovated, their substance still remaining the same, as it may be easily gathered from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21">Romans 8:21</span>, and from other passages. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(181)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(180)</span> The previous word is also in the plural number, “in holy conversations.” What seems to be meant is, that every part of the conduct should be holy, and that every part of godliness should be attended to: “In every part of a holy life, and every act of godliness;” that is, we are not to be holy in part or pious in part, but attend to every branch of duty towards man, and every branch of duty towards God. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(181)</span> All that is said here is, that there will be new heavens and a new earth, and not that the present heavens and the present earth will be renovated. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="re+20:11">Revelation 20:11</span>. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
