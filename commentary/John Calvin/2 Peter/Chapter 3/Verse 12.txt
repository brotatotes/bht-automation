<p><b>12</b><i>Looking for and hasting unto,</i> or, <i>waiting for by hastening</i>; so I render the words, though they are two participles; for what we had before separately he gathers now into one sentence, that is, that we ought hastily to wait. Now this contrarious hope possesses no small elegance, like the proverb, “Hasten slowly,” (<blu><i>festina lente</i></blu> .) When he says, “Waiting for,” he refers to the endurance of hope; and he sets hastening in opposition to topor; and both are very apposite. For as quietness and waiting are the peculiarities of hope, so we must always take heed lest the security of the flesh should creep in; we ought, therefore, strenuously to labor in good works, and run quickly in the race of our calling. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(182)</sup></span> What he before called the day of Christ (as it is everywhere called in Scripture) he now calls the day of God, and that rightly, for Christ will then restore the kingdom to the Father, that God may be all in all. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(182)</span> The first meaning of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">σπεύδω</span></blu></grk> is to hasten, and it is often used, when connected with another verb, adverbially as proposed by Calvin; but when followed as here by an accusative case, it has often the secondary meaning of earnestly desiring a thing. It is so taken here by <i>Schleusner</i>, <i>Parkhurst</i>, and <i>Macknight</i>; “Expecting and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God.” — <i>Ed</i> </p>
