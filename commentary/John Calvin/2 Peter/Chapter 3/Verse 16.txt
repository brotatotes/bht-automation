<p><b>16.</b><i>In which are some things.</i> The relative <i>which</i> does not refer to <i>epistles,</i> for it is in the neuter gender. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(185)</sup></span> The meaning is, that in the things which he wrote there was sometimes an obscurity, which gave occasion to the unlearned to go astray to their own ruin. We are reminded by these words, to reason soberly on things so high and obscure; and further, we are here strengthened against this kind of offense, lest the foolish or absurd speculations of men should disturb us, by which they entangle and distort simple truth, which ought to serve for edification. </p>
<p>But we must observe, that we are not forbidden to read Paul’s Epistles, because they contain some things hard and difficult to be understood, but that, on the contrary, they are commended to us, provided we bring a calm and teachable mind. For Peter condemns men who are trifling and volatile, who strangely turn to their own ruin what is useful to all. Nay, he says that this is commonly done as to all the Scripture: and yet he does not hence conclude, that we are not to read it, but only shews, that those vices ought to be corrected which prevent improvement, and not only so, but render deadly to us what God has appointed for our salvation. </p>
<p>It may, however, be asked, Whence is this obscurity, for the Scripture shines to us like a lamp, and guides our steps? To this I reply, that it is nothing to be wondered at, if Peter ascribed obscurity to the mysteries of Christ’s kingdom, and especially if we consider how hidden they are to the perception of the flesh. However the mode of teaching which God has adopted, has been so regulated, that all who refuse not to follow the Holy Spirit as their guide, find in the Scripture a clear light. At the same time, many are blind who stumble at mid-day; others are proud, who, wandering through devious paths, and flying over the roughest places, rush headlong into ruin. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(185)</span> It is in the feminine gender in some MSS. The authority as to the copies and versions is nearly equal. The difference is not much as to the sense, only “in which epistles,” reads better. So thought <i>Beza, Mill</i>, and others. </p>
<p>It has been a question as to the particular epistle referred to by Peter; for that he alludes to some particular epistle is evident from the manner in which he writes. The difficulty has arisen from connecting the reference made to Paul, only with the former part of the 15<sup>th</sup> verse, while that part ought to be viewed only as an addition to the former verse; and the former verse stands connected with the new heavens and the new earth. So that the subjects in hand are the day of judgment, the future state, and the necessity of being prepared for it; and that these are the things referred to is evident from this, that he says, that Paul speaks of them in all his epistles, which is not true, as to what is said at the beginning of the 15<sup>th</sup> verse. The passage then ought to be thus rendered: — </p>
<p><b>14.</b>Therefore, beloved, since ye expect these things, <br/>diligently strive to be found by him in peace, <br/>unspotted and unblamable; <br/><b>15.</b>and deem the long-suffering of our Lord <i>to be for</i> salvation: <br/>even as Paul, our beloved brother, has, according to the wisdom given <br/><b>16.</b>to him, written to you; as also in all his epistles, <br/>when speaking in them of these things; <br/>in which (epistles) there are some things difficult to be understood,” <br/><i>etc.</i> </p>
<p>Now the special epistle referred to was most probably the epistle to the Hebrews, one particular design of which was to direct the attention of the Jews to the country promised to their fathers. Some, indeed, hold that that epistle was written to the Jews in Judea; but others maintain that it was written to converted Hebrews generally, whether in Judea or elsewhere; and this passage seems to favor the latter opinion. </p>
<p>If the view given here is right, that is, that the subjects on which reference is made to Paul, are those mentioned in the 12<sup>th</sup>, the 13<sup>th</sup>, and 14<sup>th</sup> verses, then there is no epistle of Paul which could be more appropriately referred to than that to the Hebrews, as the new heavens and the new earth answer exactly to “the better and heavenly country,” mentioned in the Epistle to the Hebrews. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:16">Hebrews 11:16</span>. Besides, the exhortations and warnings of that epistle wholly coincide with the exhortation given here by Peter. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
