<p><b>18.</b><i>But grow in grace.</i> He also exhorts us to make progress; for it is the only way of persevering, to make continual advances, and not to stand still in the middle of our journey; as though he had said, that they only would be safe who labored to make progress daily. </p>
<p>The word <i>grace,</i> I take in a general sense, as meaning those spiritual gifts we obtain through Christ. But as we become partakers of these blessings according to the measure of our faith, <i>knowledge</i> is added to grace; as though he had said, that as faith increases, so would follow the increase of grace. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(186)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>To him be glory.</i> This is a remarkable passage to prove the divinity of Christ; for what is said cannot belong to any but to God alone. The adverb of the present time, now, is designed for this end, that we may not rob Christ of his glory, during our warfare in the world. He then adds,<i>for ever,</i> that we may now form some idea of his eternal kingdom, which will make known to us his full and perfect glory. </p>
<p>END OF THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(186)</span> “Grace” is the attainment, and “the knowledge” of Christ is the way and means. The chief thing is often mentioned first in Scripture, then that which leads to it: or the cause of it. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
