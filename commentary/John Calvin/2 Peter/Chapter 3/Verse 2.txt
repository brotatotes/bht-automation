<p><b>2.</b><i>That ye may be mindful.</i> By these words he intimates that we have enough in the writings of the prophets, and in the gospel, to stir us up, provided we be as diligent as it behoves us, in meditating on them; and that our minds sometimes contract a rust, or become bedimmed through darkness, is owing to our sloth. That God may then continually shine upon us, we must devote ourselves to that study: let our faith at the same time acquiesce in witnesses so certain and credible. For when we have the prophets and apostles agreeing with us, nay, as the ministers of our faith, and God as the author, and angels as approvers, there is no reason that the ungodly, all united, should move us from our position. By the <i>commandment of the apostles</i> he means the whole doctrine in which they had instructed the faithful. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(176)</sup></span> </p>
