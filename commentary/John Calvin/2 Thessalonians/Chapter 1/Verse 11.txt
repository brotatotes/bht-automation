<p><b>11</b><i>On which account we pray always</i>. That they may know that they need continual help from God, he declares that he prays in their behalf. When he says <i>on this account</i>, he means, in order that they may reach that final goal of their course, as appears from the succeeding context, <i>that he would fulfill all the good pleasure</i>, etc. It may seem, however, as if what he has mentioned first were unnecessary, for God had already <i>accounted them worthy of his calling</i>. He speaks, however, as to the end or completion, which depends on perseverance. For as we are liable to give way, our <i>calling</i> would not fail, so far as we are concerned, to prove sooner or later vain, if God did not confirm it. Hence he is said to <i>account us worthy</i>, when he conducts us to the point at which we aimed. </p>
<p><i>And fulfill</i>. Paul goes to an amazing height in extolling the grace of God, for not contenting himself with the term <i>good pleasure</i>, he says that it flows from his goodness, unless perhaps any one should prefer to consider the beneficence <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(635)</sup></span> as arising from this <i>good pleasure</i>, which amounts to the same thing. When, however, we are instructed that the <i>gracious purpose</i> of God is the cause of our salvation, and that <i>that</i> has its foundation in the <i>goodness</i> of the same God, are we not worse than mad, if we venture to ascribe anything, however small, to our own merits? For the words are in no small degree emphatic. He might have said in one word, <i>that your faith may be fulfilled</i>, but he terms it <i>good pleasure</i>. Farther, he expresses the idea still more distinctly by saying, that God was prompted by nothing else than his own goodness, for he finds nothing in us but misery. </p>
<p>Nor does Paul ascribe to the grace of God merely the beginning of our salvation, but all departments of it. Thus that contrivance of the Sophists is set aside, that we are, indeed, anticipated by the grace of God, but that it is helped by subsequent merits. Paul, on the other hand, recognizes in the whole progress of our salvation nothing but the pure grace of God. As, however, the <i>good pleasure</i> of God has been already accomplished in him, referring in the term subsequently employed by him to the effect which appears in us, he explains his meaning when he says — <i>and work of faith</i>. And he calls it a <i>work</i>, with regard to God, who works or produces faith in us, as though he had said — “that he may complete the building of faith which he has begun.” </p>
<p>It is, also, not without good reason, that he says <i>with power</i>, for he intimates that the perfecting of faith is an arduous matter, and one of the greatest difficulty. This, also, we know but too well from experience; and the reason, too, is not far to seek, if we consider how great our weakness is, how various are the hindrances that obstruct us on every side, and how severe are the assaults of Satan. Hence, unless the power of God afford us help in no ordinary degree, faith will never rise to its full height. For it is no easier task to bring faith to perfection in an individual, than to rear upon water a tower that may by its firmness withstand all storms and fury of tempests, and may surmount the clouds in height, for we are not less fluid than water, and it is necessary that the height of faith reach as high as heaven. </p>
