<p><b>7</b><i>When the Lord shall be manifested</i>. Here we have a confirmation of the foregoing statement. For as it is one of the articles of our faith, that Christ will come from heaven, and will not come in vain, faith ought to seek the end of his coming. Now this is — that he may come as a Redeemer to his own people; nay more, that he may judge the whole world. The description which follows has a view to this — that the pious may understand that God is so much the more concerned as to their afflictions in proportion to the dreadfulness of the judgment that awaits his enemies. For the chief occasion of grief and distress is this — that we think that God is but lightly affected with our calamities. We see into what complaints David from time to time breaks forth, while he is consumed by the pride and insolence of his enemies. Hence he has brought forward all this for the consolation of believers, while he represents the tribunal of Christ as full of horror, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(631)</sup></span> that they may not be disheartened by their present oppressed condition, while they see themselves proudly and disdainfully trampled upon by the wicked. </p>
<p>What is to be the nature of that <i>fire</i>, and of what materials, I leave to the disputations of persons of foolish curiosity. I am contented with holding what Paul had it in view to teach — that Christ will be a most strict avenger of the injuries which the wicked inflict upon us. The metaphor, however, of <i>flame</i> and <i>fire</i>, is abundantly common in Scripture, when the anger of God is treated of. </p>
<p>By the <i>angels of his power</i>, he means those in whom he will exercise his power; for he will bring the angels with him for the purpose of displaying the glory of his kingdom. Hence, too, they are elsewhere called the <i>angels of his majesty</i> </p>
