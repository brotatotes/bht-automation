<p><b>10</b><i>In those that perish</i>. He limits the power of Satan, as not being able to injure the elect of God, just as Christ, also, exempts them from this danger. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>.) From this it appears, that Antichrist has not so great power otherwise than by his permission. Now, this consolation was necessary. For all the pious, but for this, would of necessity be overpowered with fear, if they saw a yawning gulf pervading the whole path, along which they must pass. Hence Paul, however he may wish them to be in a state of anxiety, that they may be on their guard, lest by excessive carelessness they should fall back, nay, even throw themselves into ruin, does, nevertheless, bid them cherish good hope, inasmuch as Satan’s power is bridled, that he may not be able to involve any but the wicked in ruin. </p>
<p><i>Because they received not the love</i>. Lest the wicked should complain that they perish innocently, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(675)</sup></span> and that they have been appointed to death rather from cruelty on the part of God, than from any fault on their part, Paul shews on what good grounds it is that so severe vengeance from God is to come upon them — because they have not received in the temper of mind with which they ought the truth which was presented to them, nay more, of their own accord refused salvation. And from this appears more clearly what I have already stated — that the gospel required to be preached to the world before God would give Satan so much permission, for he would never have allowed his temple to be so basely profaned, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(676)</sup></span> had he not been provoked by extreme ingratitude on the part of men. In short, Paul declares that Antichrist will be the minister of God’s righteous vengeance against those who, being called to salvation, have rejected the gospel, and have preferred to apply their mind to impiety and errors. Hence there is no reason why Papists should now object, that it is at variance with the clemency of Christ to cast off his Church in this manner. For though the domination of Antichrist has been cruel, none have perished but those who were deserving of it, nay more, did of their own accord <i>choose death</i>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="pr+8:36">Proverbs 8:36</span>.) And unquestionably, while the voice of the Son of God has sounded forth everywhere, it finds the ears of men deaf, nay obstinate, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(677)</sup></span> and while a profession of Christianity is common, there are, nevertheless, few that have truly and heartily given themselves to Christ. Hence it is not to be wondered, if similar vengeance quickly follows such a criminal <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(678)</sup></span> contempt. </p>
<p>It is asked whether the punishment of blindness does not fall on any but those who have on set purpose rebelled against the gospel. I answer, that this special judgment by which God has avenged open contumacy, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(679)</sup></span> does not stand in the way of his striking down with stupidity, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(680)</sup></span> as often as seems good to him, those that have never heard a single word respecting Christ, for Paul does not discourse in a general way as to the reasons why God has from the beginning permitted Satan to go at large with his falsehoods, but as to what a horrible vengeance impends over gross despisers of new and previously unwonted grace. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(681)</sup></span> </p>
<p>He uses the expression — <i>receiving the love of the truth</i>, to mean — applying the mind to the love of it. Hence we learn that faith is always conjoined with a sweet and voluntary reverence for God, because we do not properly believe the word of God, unless it is lovely and pleasant to us. </p>
