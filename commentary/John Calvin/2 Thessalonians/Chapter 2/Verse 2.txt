<p><b>2</b><i>That ye be not soon shaken in judgment</i>. He employs the term <i>judgment</i> to denote that settled faith which rests on sound doctrine. Now, by means of that fancy which he rejects, they would have been carried away as it were into ecstasy. He notices, also, three kinds of imposture, as to which they must be on their guard — <i>spirit, word</i>, and <i>spurious epistle</i>. By the term <i>spirit</i> he means pretended prophecies, and it appears that this mode of speaking was common among the pious, so that they applied the term <i>spirit</i> to prophesyings, with the view of putting honor upon them. For, in order that prophecies may have due authority, we must look to the Spirit of God rather than to men. But as the devil is wont to <i>transform himself into an angel of light</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:14">2 Corinthians 11:14</span>,) impostors stole this title, in order that they might impose upon the simple. But although Paul could have stripped them of this mask, he, nevertheless, preferred to speak in this manner, by way of concession, as though he had said, “However they may pretend to have the spirit of revelation, believe them not.” John, in like manner, says: </p>
<p>“Try the spirits, whether they are of God.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span>.) </p>
<p><i>Speech</i>, in my opinion, includes every kind of doctrine, while false teachers insist in the way of reasons or conjectures, or other pretexts. What he adds as to <i>epistle</i>, is an evidence that this impudence is ancient — that of feigning the names of others. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(638)</sup></span> So much the more wonderful is the mercy of God towards us, in that while Paul’s name was on false grounds made use of in spurious writings, his writings have, nevertheless, been preserved entire even to our times. This, unquestionably, could not have taken place accidentally, or as the effect of mere human industry, if God himself had not by his power restrained Satan and all his ministers. </p>
<p><i>As if the day of Christ were at hand</i>. This may seem to be at variance with many passages of Scripture, in which the Spirit declares that that day is at hand. But the solution is easy, for it is <i>at hand</i> with regard to God, with whom <i>one day is as a thousand years</i>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:8">2 Peter 3:8</span>.) In the mean time, the Lord would have us be constantly waiting for him in such a way as not to limit him to a certain time. </p>
<p>Watch, says he, for ye know neither the day nor the hour. <br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:36">Matthew 24:36</span>.) </br></p>
<p>On the other hand, those false prophets whom Paul exposes, while they ought to have kept men’s minds in suspense, bid them feel assured of his speedy advent, that they might not be wearied out with the irksomeness of delay. </p>
