<p><b>5</b><i>Do ye not remember?</i> This added no small weight to the doctrine, that they had previously heard it from the mouth of Paul, that they might not think that it had been contrived by him at the instant. And as he had given them early warning as to the reign of Antichrist, and the devastation that was coming upon the Church, when no question had as yet been raised as to such things, he saw beyond all doubt that the doctrine was specially useful to be known. And, unquestionably, it is really so. Those whom he addressed were destined to see many things that would trouble them; and when posterity would see a large proportion of those who had made profession of the faith of Christ revolt from piety, maddened, as it were, by a gad-fly, or rather by a fury, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(650)</sup></span> what could they do but waver? This, however, was as a <i>brazen</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(651)</sup></span> <i>wall</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(652)</sup></span> — that matters were so appointed by God, because the ingratitude of men <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(653)</sup></span> was worthy of such vengeance. Here we may see how forgetful men are in matters affecting their everlasting salvation. We must also observe Paul’s mildness; for while he might have been vehemently incensed, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(654)</sup></span> he does but mildly reprove them; for it is a fatherly way of reproving them to say to them, that they had allowed forgetfulness of a matter so important and so useful to steal in upon their minds. </p>
