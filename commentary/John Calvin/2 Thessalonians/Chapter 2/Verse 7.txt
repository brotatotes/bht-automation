<p><b>7</b><i>. The mystery of iniquity</i>. This is opposed to <i>revelation;</i> for as Satan had not yet gathered so much strength, as that Antichrist could openly oppress the Church, he says that he is carrying on secretly and clandestinely <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(658)</sup></span> what he would do openly in his own time. He was therefore at that time secretly laying the foundations on which he would afterwards rear the edifice, as actually took place. And this tends to confirm more fully what I have already stated, that it is not one individual that is represented under the term Antichrist, but one kingdom, which extends itself through many ages. In the same sense, John says that Antichrist will come, but that there were already many in his time. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span>.) For he admonishes those who were then living to be on their guard against that deadly pestilence, which was at that time shooting up in various forms. For sects were rising up which were the seeds, as it were, of that unhappy weed which has well-nigh choked and destroyed God’s entire tillage. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(659)</sup></span> But although Paul conveys the idea of a secret manner of working, yet he has made use of the term <i>mystery</i> rather than any other, alluding to the mystery of salvation, of which he speaks elsewhere, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+1:26">Colossians 1:26</span>,) for he carefully insists on the struggle of repugnancy between the Son of God and this <i>son of perdition</i> </p>
<p><i>Only now withholding</i>. While he makes both statements in reference to one person — that he will hold supremacy for a time, and that he will shortly be taken out of the way, I have no doubt that he refers to Antichrist; and the participle <i>withholding</i> must be explained in the future tense. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(660)</sup></span> For he has, in my opinion, added this for the consolation of believers — that the reign of Antichrist will be temporary, the limits of it having been assigned to it by God; for believers might object — “Of what avail is it that the gospel is preached, if Satan is now hatching a tyranny that he is to exercise for ever?” He accordingly exhorts to patience, because God afflicts his Church only for a time, that he may one day afford it deliverance; and, on the other hand, the perpetuity of Christ’s reign must be considered, in order that believers may repose in it. </p>
