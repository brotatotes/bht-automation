<p><b>10</b><i>He that will not labor</i>. From its being written in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+128:2">Psalms 128:2</span> — </p>
<p>Thou art blessed, eating of the labor of thy hands, </p>
<p>also in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="pr+10:4">Proverbs 10:4</span>, </p>
<p>The blessing of the Lord is upon the hands of him that laboreth, </p>
<p>it is certain that indolence and idleness are accursed of God. Besides, we know that man was created with this view, that he might do something. Not only does Scripture testify this to us, but nature itself taught it to the heathen. Hence it is reasonable, that those, who wish to exempt themselves from the common law, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(710)</sup></span> should also be deprived of food, the reward of labor. When, however, the Apostle commanded that such persons should not eat, he does not mean that he gave commandment to those persons, but forbade that the Thessalonians should encourage their indolence by supplying them with food. </p>
<p>It is also to be observed, that there are different ways of laboring. For whoever aids <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(711)</sup></span> the society of men by his industry, either by ruling his family, or by administering public or private affairs, or by counseling, or by teaching, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(712)</sup></span> or in any other way, is not to be reckoned among the idle. For Paul censures those lazy drones who lived by the sweat of others, while they contribute no service in common for aiding the human race. Of this sort are our monks and priests who are largely pampered by doing nothing, excepting that they chant in the temples, for the sake of preventing weariness. This truly is, (as Plautus speaks,) <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(713)</sup></span> to “live musically.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(714)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(710)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">De la loy et regle commune</span></blu>;” — “From the common law and rule.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(711)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Aide et porte proufit</span></blu>;” — “Aids and brings advantage.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(712)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">En enseignant les autres</span></blu>;” — “By instructing others.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(713)</span> The passage alluded to is as follows: “<blu>Musice, Hercle, agitis aetatem</blu> “ —(“By Hercules, you pass life musically”) <i>Plaut. Mostellariae</i>, Act in. <i>Sc</i>. 2, 40. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(714)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Plaute poete Latin ancien, quand il vent parler de gens qui viuent a leur aise, il dit qu’ils viuent musicalement, c’est a dire, en chantres. Mais a la verite on pent bien dire de ceux-ci, en tout sens qu’on le voudra prendre, qu’ils viuent musicalement</span></blu>;” — “Plautus, the ancient Latin poet, when he has it in view to speak of persons who live at their ease, says that they live musically, that is to say, like singers. But truly it may be well said of those persons, in every sense in which one might choose to take it, that they live musically.” </p>
