<p><b>11</b><i>We hear that there are some among you</i>. It is probable that this kind of drones were, as it were, the seed of idle monkhood. For, from the very beginning, there were some who, under pretext of religion, either made free with the tables of others, or craftily drew to themselves the substance of the simple. They had also, even in the time of Augustine, come to prevail so much, that he was constrained to write a book expressly against idle monks, where he complains with good reason of their pride, because, despising the admonition of the Apostle, they not only excuse themselves on the ground of infirmity, but they wish to appear holier than all others, on the ground that they are exempt from labors. He inveighs, with good reason, against this unseemliness, that, while the senators are laborious, the workman, or person in humble life, does not merely live in idleness, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(716)</sup></span> but would fain have his indolence pass for sanctity. Such are his views. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(717)</sup></span> In the mean time, however, the evil has increased to such an extent, that idle bellies occupy nearly the tenth part of the world, whose only religion is to be well stuffed, and to have exemption from all annoyance <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(718)</sup></span> of labor. And this manner of life they dignify, sometimes with the name of the Order, sometimes with that of the Rule, of this or that personage. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(719)</sup></span> </p>
<p>But what does the Spirit say, on the other hand, by the mouth of Paul? He pronounces them all to be irregular and <i>disorderly</i>, by whatever name of distinction they may be dignified. It is not necessary to relate here how much the idle life of monks has invariably displeased persons of sounder judgment. That is a memorable saying of an old monk, which is recorded by Socrates in the Eighth Book of the Tripartite History — that he who does not labor with his hands is like a plunderer. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(720)</sup></span> I do not mention other instances, nor is it necessary. Let this statement of the Apostle suffice us, in which he declares that they are dissolute, and in a manner lawless. </p>
<p><i>Doing nothing</i>. In the Greek participles there is, an elegant (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">προσωνομασία</span></blu></grk>) <i>play upon words</i>, which I have attempted in some manner to imitate, by rendering it as meaning that they <i>do</i> nothing, but have <i>enough to do</i> in the way of curiosity. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(721)</sup></span> He censures, however, a fault with which idle persons are, for the most part, chargeable, that, by unseasonably bustling about, they give trouble to themselves and to others. For we see, that those who have nothing to do are much more fatigued by doing nothing, than if they were employing themselves in some very important work; they run hither and thither; wherever they go, they have the appearance of great fatigue; they gather all sorts of reports, and they put them in a confused way into circulation. You would say that they bore the weight of a kingdom upon their shoulders. Could there be a more remarkable exemplification of this than there is in the monks? For what class of men have less repose? Where does curiosity reign more extensively? Now, as this disease has a ruinous effect upon the public, Paul admonishes that it ought not to be encouraged by idleness. </p>
