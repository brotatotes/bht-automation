<p><b>12</b><i>Now we command such</i>. He corrects both of the faults of which he had made mention — a blustering restlessness, and retirement from useful employment. He accordingly exhorts them, in the first place, to cultivate repose — that is, to keep themselves <i>quietly</i> within the limits of their calling, or, as we commonly say, “<blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">sans faire bruit</span></i></blu> ,” (<i>without making a noise</i>.) For the truth is this: those are the most peaceable of all, that exercise themselves in lawful employments; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(722)</sup></span> while those that have nothing to do give trouble both to themselves and to others. Further, he subjoins another precept — that they should <i>labor</i>, that is, that they should be intent upon their calling, and devote themselves to lawful and honorable employments, without which the life of man is of a wandering nature. Hence, also, there follows this third injunction — that they should <i>eat their own bread;</i> by which he means, that they should be satisfied with what belongs to them, that they may not be oppressive or unreasonable to others. </p>
<p>Drink water, <i>says Solomon</i>, from thine own fountains, and let the streams flow down to neighbors. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="pr+5:15">Proverbs 5:15</span>.) </p>
<p>This is the <i>first</i> law of equity, that no one make use of what belongs to another, but only use what he can properly call his own. The <i>second</i> is, that no one swallow up, like some abyss, what belongs to him, but that he be beneficent to neighbors, and that he may relieve their indigence by his abundance. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(723)</sup></span> In the same manner, the Apostle exhorts those who had been formerly idle to <i>labor</i>, not merely that they may gain for themselves a livelihood, but that they may also be helpful to the necessities of their brethren, as he also teaches elsewhere. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:28">Ephesians 4:28</span>.) </p>
