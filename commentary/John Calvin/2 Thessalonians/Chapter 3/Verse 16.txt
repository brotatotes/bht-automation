16Now the Lord of peace. This prayer seems to be connected with the preceding sentence, with the view of recommending endeavors after concord and mildness. He had forbidden them to treat even the contumacious (731) as enemies, but rather with a view to their being brought back to a sound mind (732) by brotherly admonitions. He could appropriately, after this, subjoin an injunction as to the cultivation of peace; but as this is a work that is truly Divine, he betakes himself to prayer, which, nevertheless, has also the force of a precept. At the same time, he may also have another thing in view — that God may restrain unruly persons, (733) that they may not disturb the peace of the Church. (731) “Mesme les rebelles et obstinez;” — “Even the rebellious and obstinate.” (732) “A repentance et amendment;” — “To repentance and amendment.” (733) “Ceux qui sont desobeissans;” — “Those that are disobedient.”
