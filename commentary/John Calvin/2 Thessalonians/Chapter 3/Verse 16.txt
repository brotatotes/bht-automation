<p><b>16</b><i>Now the Lord of peace</i>. This prayer seems to be connected with the preceding sentence, with the view of recommending endeavors after concord and mildness. He had forbidden them to treat even the contumacious <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(731)</sup></span> as <i>enemies</i>, but rather with a view to their being brought back to a sound mind <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(732)</sup></span> by brotherly admonitions. He could appropriately, after this, subjoin an injunction as to the cultivation of peace; but as this is a work that is truly Divine, he betakes himself to prayer, which, nevertheless, has also the force of a precept. At the same time, he may also have another thing in view — that God may restrain unruly persons, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(733)</sup></span> that they may not disturb the peace of the Church. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(731)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Mesme les rebelles et obstinez</span></blu>;” — “Even the rebellious and obstinate.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(732)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">A repentance et amendment</span></blu>;” — “To repentance and amendment.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(733)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Ceux qui sont desobeissans</span></blu>;” — “Those that are disobedient.” </p>
