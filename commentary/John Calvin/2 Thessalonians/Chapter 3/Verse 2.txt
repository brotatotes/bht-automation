<p><b>2</b><i>That we may be delivered</i>. The old interpreter has rendered it, not unhappily, in my opinion — <i>unreasonable</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(693)</sup></span> Now, by this term, as also by that which immediately follows, (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τῶν πονηρῶν</span></blu></grk>,) <i>evil</i>, Paul means wicked and treacherous men, who lurked in the Church, under the name of Christians, or at least Jews, who with a mad zeal for the law furiously persecuted the gospel. He knew, however, how much danger impended over them from both these classes. Chrysostom, however, thinks that those only are meant who maliciously oppose the gospel by base doctrines, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(694)</sup></span> — not by weapons of violence, as for example, Alexander, Hymeneus, and the like; but for my part, I extend it generally to all kinds of dangers and enemies. He was at that time proceeding towards Jerusalem, and wrote in the midst of his journeyings. Now, he had already been divinely forewarned that <i>imprisonments and persecutions awaited him there</i>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:23">Acts 20:23</span>.) He means, however, <i>deliverance</i>, so that he may come off victorious, whether by life or by death. </p>
<p><i>All have not faith</i>. This might be explained to mean, “Faith is not in all.” This expression, however, were both ambiguous and more obscure. Let us therefore retain Paul’s words, by which he intimates that faith is a gift of God that is too rare to be found in all. God, therefore, calls many who do not come to him by faith. Many pretend to come to him, who have their heart at the farthest distance from him. Farther, he does not speak of all indiscriminately, but merely animadverts upon those that belong to the Church: for the Thessalonians saw that very many held faith in abhorrence; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(695)</sup></span> nay, they saw how small was the number of believers. Hence it would have been unnecessary to say this as to strangers; but Paul simply says that all that make a profession of faith are not such in reality. Should you take in all Jews, they appeared to have nearness to Christ, for they ought to have recognized him by means of the law and the prophets. Paul, there can be no question specially marks out those with whom he would have to do. Now, it is probable that they were those who, while they had the appearance and honorary title of piety, were nevertheless very far from the reality. From this came the conflict. </p>
<p>With the view of shewing, therefore, that it was not groundlessly, or without good reason, that he dreaded contests with wicked and perverse men, he says that faith is not common to all, because the wicked and reprobate are always mixed with the good, as <i>tares</i> are with the <i>good wheat</i>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:25">Matthew 13:25</span>.) And this ought to be remembered by us whenever we have annoyance given us by wicked persons, who nevertheless desire to be reckoned as belonging to the society of Christians — that <i>all men have not faith</i>. Nay more, when we hear in some instances that the Church is disturbed by base factions, let this be a shield to us against offenses of this nature; for we shall not merely inflict injury upon pious teachers, if we have doubts as to their fidelity, whenever domestic enemies do them harm, but our faith will from time to time waver, unless we keep in mind that among those who boast of the name of Christians there are many that are treacherous. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(696)</sup></span> </p>
