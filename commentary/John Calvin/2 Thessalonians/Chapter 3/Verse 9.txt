9Not because we have not. As Paul wished by his laboring to set an example, that idle persons might not like drones (707) eat the bread of others, so he was not willing that this very thing (708) should do injury to the ministers of the word, so that the Churches should defraud them of their proper livelihood. In this we may see his singular moderation and humanity, and how far removed he was from the ambition of those who abuse their powers, so as to infringe upon the rights of their brethren. There was a danger, lest the Thessalonians, having had from the beginning the preaching of the gospel from Paul’s mouth gratuitously,(709) should lay it down as a law for the future as to other ministers; the disposition of mankind being so niggardly. Paul, accordingly, anticipates this danger, and teaches that he had a right to more than he had made use of, that others may retain their liberty unimpaired. He designed by this means to inflict the greater disgrace, as I have already noticed above, on those that do nothing, for it is an argument from, the greater to the less. (707) “Ainsi que les bourdons entre abeilles ne font point de miel, et neantmoins viuent de celuy des autres;” — “As drones among bees do not make any honey, and yet live on that of others.” (708) “Son exemple;” — “His example.” (709) “Gratuitement et sans luy bailler aucuns gages;” — “Gratuitously, and without giving him any remuneration.”
