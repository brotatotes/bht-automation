<p><b>11</b><i>To which I have been appointed</i> Not without good reason does he so highly commend the gospel along with his apostleship. Satan labors, beyond all things else, to banish from our hearts, by every possible method, the faith of sound doctrine; and as it is not always easy for him to do this if he attack us in open war, he steals upon us by secret and indirect methods; for, in order to destroy the credibility of doctrine, he holds up to suspicion the calling of godly teachers. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(146)</sup></span> Paul, therefore, having death before his eyes, and knowing well the ancient and ordinary snares of Satan, determined to assert not only the doctrine of the gospel in general, but his own calling. Both were necessary; for, although there be uttered long discourses concerning the dignity of the gospel, they will not be of much avail to us, unless we understand what is the gospel. Many will agree as to the general principle of the undoubted authority of the gospel, who afterwards will have nothing certain that they can follow. This is the reason why Paul expressly wishes to be acknowledged to be a faithful and lawful minister of that life-giving doctrine which he had mentioned. </p>
<p><i>A herald, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles</i> For the reasons now stated, he adorns himself with various titles for expressing one and the same thing. He calls himself a <i>herald,</i> whose duty it is, to publish the commands of princes and magistrates. The word <i>apostle</i> is here used in its ordinary and restricted meaning. Moreover, because there is a natural relation between a <i>teacher</i> and his disciples, he takes to himself also this third name, that they who learn from him may know that they have a master who has been appointed to them by God. And to whom does he declare that he was appointed? To the <i>Gentiles;</i> for the main hinge of the controversy was about them, because the Jews denied that the promises of life belonged to any others than to the fleshly children of Abraham. In order, therefore, that the salvation of the Gentiles may not be called in question, he affirms that to them he has been especially sent by God. </p>
