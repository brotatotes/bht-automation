<p><b>16</b><i>May the Lord grant mercy</i> From this prayer we infer, that the good offices done to the saints are not thrown away, even though they cannot recompense them; for, when he prays to God to reward them, this carries in it the force of a promise. At the same time, Paul testifies his gratitude, by desiring that God will grant the remuneration, because he is unable to pay. What if he had possessed abundant means of remuneration? Undoubtedly he would have manifested that he was not ungrateful. </p>
<p><i>To the family of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me</i> It is worthy of attention, that although he praises the kindness of <i>Onesiphorus</i> alone, yet, on his account, he prays for mercy to the whole <i>family</i> Hence we infer, that “the blessing of God rests, not only on the head of the righteous man,” but on all his house. So great is the love of God toward his people, that it diffuses itself over all who are connected with them. </p>
<p><i>And was not ashamed of my chain</i> This is a proof, not only of his liberality, but likewise of his zeal; seeing that he cheerfully exposed himself to danger and to the reproach of men, in order to assist Paul. </p>
