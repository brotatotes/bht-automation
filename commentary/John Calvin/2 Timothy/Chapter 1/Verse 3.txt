<p><b>3</b><i>I give thanks</i> The meaning usually assigned to these words is, that Paul “gives thanks to God,” and next assigns the cause or ground of thanksgiving; namely, that he is unceasingly mindful of Timothy. But let my readers consider whether the following sense do not suit equally well and even better: “Whenever I remember thee in my prayers, (and I do so continually,) I also give thanks concerning thee;” for the particle<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὡς</span></blu></grk> most frequently has that meaning; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(138)</sup></span> and, indeed, any meaning that can be drawn from a different translation is exceedingly meager. According to this exposition, prayer will be a sign of carefulness, and thanksgiving a sign of joy; that is, he never thought of Timothy without calling to remembrance the eminent virtues with which he was adorned. Hence arises ground of thanksgiving; for the recollection of the gifts of God is always pleasant and delightful to believers. Both are proofs of real friendship. He calls the <i>mention</i> of him (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀδιάλειπτον</span></blu></grk>) <i>unceasing,</i> because he never forgets him when he prays. </p>
<p><i>Whom I worship from my ancestors</i> This declaration he made in opposition to those well-known calumnies with which the Jews everywhere loaded him, as if he had forsaken the religion of his country, and apostatized from the law of Moses. On the contrary, he declares that he worships God, concerning whom he had been taught by his ancestors, that is, the God of Abraham, who revealed himself to the Jews, who delivered his law by the hand of Moses; and not some pretended God, whom he had lately made for himself. </p>
<p>But here it may be asked, “Since Paul glories in following the religion handed down from his ancestors, is this a sufficiently solid foundation? For hence it follows, that this will be a plausible presence for excusing all superstitions, and that it will be a crime, if any one depart, in the smallest degree, from the institutions of his ancestors, whatever these are.” The answer is easy. He does not here lay down a fixed rule, that every person who follows the religion that he received from his fathers is believed to worship God aright, and, on the other hand, that he who departs from the custom of his ancestors is at all to blame for it. For this circumstance must always be taken into account, that Paul was not descended from idolaters, but from the children of Abraham, who worshipped the true God. We know what Christ says, in disapproving of all the false worship of the Gentiles, that the Jews alone maintained the true method of worship. Paul, therefore, does not rest solely on the authority of the fathers, nor does he speak indiscriminately of all his ancestors; but he removes that false opinion, with which he knew that he was unjustly loaded, that he had forsaken the God of Israel, and framed for himself a strange god. </p>
<p><i>In a pure conscience</i> It is certain that Paul’s conscience was not always pure; for he acknowledges that he was deceived by hypocrisy, while he gave loose reins to sinful desire. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(139)</sup></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8">Romans 7:8</span>.) The excuse which Chrysostom offers for what Paul did while he was a Pharisee, on the ground that he opposed the gospel, not through malice, but through ignorance, is not a satisfactory reply to the objection; for “a pure conscience” is no ordinary commendation, and cannot be separated from the sincere and hearty fear of God. I, therefore, limit it to the present time, in this manner, that he worships the same God as was worshipped by his ancestors, but that now he worships him with pure affection of the heart, since the time when he was enlightened by the gospel. </p>
<p>This statement has the same object with the numerous protestations of the apostles, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles: </p>
<p>“I serve the God of my fathers, believing all things that are written in the law and in the prophets.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:14">Acts 24:14</span>.) </p>
<p>Again, </p>
<p>“And now I stand to be judged concerning the hope of the promise which was made to our fathers, to which hope our twelve tribes hope to come.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:6">Acts 26:6</span>.) </p>
<p>Again, </p>
<p>“On account of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:20">Acts 28:20</span>.) </p>
<p><i>In my prayers night and day</i> Hence we see how great was his constancy in prayer; and yet he affirms nothing about himself but what Christ recommends to all his followers. We ought, therefore, to be moved and inflamed by such examples to imitate them, so far, at least, that an exercise so necessary may be more frequent among us. If any one understand this to mean the daily and nightly prayers which Paul was wont to offer at stated hours, there will be no impropriety in that view; though I give a more simple interpretation, that there was no time when he was not employed in prayer. </p>
