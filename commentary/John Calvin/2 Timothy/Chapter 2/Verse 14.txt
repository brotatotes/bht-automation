<p><b>14</b><i>Remind them of these things.</i> The expression (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ταῦτα</span></blu></grk>) <i>these things</i>, is highly emphatic. It means that the summary of the gospel which he gave, and the exhortations which he added to it, are of so great importance, that a good minister ought never to be weary of exhibiting them; for they are things that deserve to be continually handled, and that cannot be too frequently repeated. “They are things” (he says) “which I wish you not only to teach once, but to take great pains to impress on the hearts of men by frequent repetition.” A good teacher ought to look at nothing else than edification, and to give his whole attention to that alone. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(170)</sup></span> On the contrary, he enjoins him not only to abstain from useless questions, but likewise to forbid others to follow them. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(171)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>Solemnly charging them before the Lord, not to dispute about words.</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Λογομαχεῖν</span></blu></grk> means to engage earnestly in contentious disputes, which are commonly produced by a foolish desire of being ingenious. <i>Solemn charging before the Lord</i> is intended to strike terror; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(172)</sup></span> and from this severity we learn how dangerous to the Church is that knowledge which leads to debates, that is, which disregards piety, and tends to ostentation; of this nature is the whole of that speculative theology, as it is called, that is found among the Papists. </p>
<p><i>For no use,</i> On two grounds<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, λογομαχία,</span></blu></grk> or “disputing about words,” is condemned by him. It is of no advantage, and it is exceedingly hurtful, by disturbing weak minds. Although in the version I have followed Erasmus, because it did not disagree with Paul’s meaning, yet I wish to inform my readers that Paul’s words may be explained in this manner, “That which is useful for nothing.” The Greek words are<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, εἰς οὐδὲν χρήσιμον,</span></blu></grk> and I read <grk><blu><i><span lang="el-GR" style="">χρήσιμον</span></i></blu></grk> in the accusative case, and not in the nominative. The style will thus flow more agreeably; as if he had said, “Of what use is it, when no good comes from it, but much evil? for the faith of many is subverted.” </p>
<p>Let us remark, first, that, when a manner of teaching does no good, for that single reason it is justly disapproved; for God does not wish to indulge our curiosity, but to instruct us in a useful manner. Away with all speculations, therefore, which produce no edification! </p>
<p>But the second is much worse, when questions are raised, which are not only unprofitable, but tend <i>to the subversion of the hearers</i> I wish that this were attended to by those who are always armed for fighting with the tongue, and who, in every question are looking for grounds of quarreling, and who go so far as to lay snares around every word or syllable. But they are carried in a wrong direction by ambition, and sometimes by an almost fatal disease; which I have experienced in some. What the Apostle says about <i>subverting</i> is shown, every day, by actual observation, to be perfectly true; for it is natural, amidst disputes, to lose sight of the truth; and Satan avails himself of quarrels as a presence for disturbing weak persons, and overthrowing their faith. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(170)</span> “When any person comes to the sermon, let it not be to hear something that tickles the ears, or that gives pleasure; but let it be to make progress in the fear of God, and in humility, and to excite to prayer, and to confirm him in patience. If we have heard an exhortation today, and if tomorrow it is repeated to us, let us not think that this is superfluous, let us not be annoyed at it; for every person who carefully examines this subject will find it to be highly necessary for him to be reminded of the lesson which he had learned, that he may practice it well. If, therefore, God refreshes our memory with it, he has conferred on us a great favor. That is what we have to remark on this passage, when Paul says, ‘Remind them of these things.’ For undoubtedly he intended to prevent what we frequently meet with, when it is said, ‘We have heard this before. Is not that a very common remark? Where is the little child that does not know it?” Such things are said by those who would wish to be fed with useless questions. But here the Holy Spirit desires that what is useful should be brought forward every day, because we have not sufficiently understood it, and because it must be put in practice.” — <i>Fr. Ser.</i> </p>
