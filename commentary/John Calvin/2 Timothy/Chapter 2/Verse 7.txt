<p><b>7</b><i>Understand what I say</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(163)</sup></span> He added this, not on account of the obscurity of the comparisons which he has set forth, but that Timothy himself might ponder, how much more excellent is the warfare under the direction of Christ, and how much more abundant the reward; for, when we have studied it incessantly, we scarcely arrive at a full knowledge of it. </p>
<p><i>The Lord give thee understanding in all things</i> The prayer, which now follows, is added by way of correction. Because our minds do not easily rise to that “incorruptible crown” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:25">1 Corinthians 9:25</span>) of the life to come, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(164)</sup></span> Paul betakes himself to God, to “give understanding” to Timothy. And hence we infer, that not less are we taught in vain, if the Lord do not open our understandings, than the commandments would be given in vain, if he did not impart strength to perform them. For who could have taught better than Paul? And yet, in order that he may teach with any advantage, he prays that God may train his disciple. </p>
