<p><b>14.</b><i>With their wives</i> Some translate it <i>women;</i> and they think that he speaketh of those which accompanied Christ. As I will not contend with any man concerning this matter, so have I not doubted to prefer that which I thought was more probable. I grant that the word which Luke useth may be interpreted both ways. But this is my reason, why I do think that he speaketh rather of wives, because, seeing that they used afterward to carry their wives about with them, as Paul doth testify, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:5">1 Corinthians 9:5</span>,) it is not likely that they were then asunder. For they might more easily rest together in one place, than by wandering to and fro oftentimes to change their abiding; and, secondly, seeing that they did look for the coming of the Holy Ghost, which was even then at hand, what reason was there why they should deprive their wives of so great goodness? Peter’s wife was about to be a helper unto him shortly after, which we must also think of the rest of the wives. These women had need of heroical fortitude and constancy, lest they should faint. Who would, therefore, think that they were excluded from their husbands whilst they look for the coming of the Spirit? But if they will stick to the general word, it standeth with reason that there were married women in the company. Howsoever it be, it is Luke’s mind to tell us by the way how greatly they had changed their minds. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(51)</sup></span> For whereas before the men, being afraid, had fled away, the women are gathered together with them now, neither do they fear any danger. He doth reckon up the mother of Jesus with the other women, whom, notwithstanding, John is said to have kept at his own house. But, as I have said before, they met altogether now only for a short season; for it is not to be doubted but that they departed one from another afterwards. It is well known that amongst the Hebrews all kinsfolk are comprehended under this word <i>brethren.</i> </p>
<p><i>All these did continue.</i> Here he showeth that they did diligently look for the coming of the Holy Spirit.; For this was the cause of their prayer, that Christ would send his Spirit, as he had promised. Whereupon we may gather that this is the true faith which stirreth us up to call upon God. For the security of faith doth much differ from sluggishness. Neither doth God, therefore, assure us of this grace, that our minds may straightway become careless, but that he may rather sharpen our desire to pray. Neither is prayer any sign of doubting, but rather a testimony of our (sure hope and) confidence, because we ask those things at the Lord’s hands which we know he hath promised. So it becometh us also (after their example) to be instant in prayer, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(52)</sup></span> and to beg at God’s hands that he will increase in us his Holy Spirit: <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(53)</sup></span> increase, (I say,) because before we can conceive any prayer we must needs have the first-fruits of the Spirit. For as much as he is the only Master which teacheth us to pray aright, who doth not only give us utterance, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:25">Romans 2:25</span>,) but also governs our inward affections. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Luke doth express two things which are proper to true prayer, namely, that they did persist, and that they were all of one mind. This was art exercise of their patience, in that Christ did make them stay a while, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(54)</sup></span> when as he could straightway have sent the Holy Spirit; so God doth oftentimes drive off, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(55)</sup></span> and, as it were, suffer us to languish, that he may accustom us to persevere. The hastiness of our petitions is a corrupt, yea a hurtful plague; wherefore it is no marvel if God do sometimes correct the same. In the mean season (as I have said) he doth exercise us to be constant in prayer. Therefore, if we will not pray in vain, let us not be wearied with the delay of time. As touching the unity of their minds, it is set against that scattering abroad, which fear had caused before. Yet, notwithstanding, we may easily gather, even by this, how needful a thing it is to pray generally, in that Christ commandeth every one to pray for the whole body, and generally for all men, as it were, in the person of all men: Our Father, Give us this day, etc., (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:9">Matthew 6:9</span>.) Whence cometh this unity of their tongues but from one Spirit? Wherefore, when Paul would prescribe unto the Jews and Gentiles a right form of prayer, he removeth far away all division and dissension. That we <i>may,</i> (saith he,) being all of one mind, with one mouth glorify God, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:6">Romans 15:6</span>.) And truly it is needful that we be brethren, and agree together like brethren, that we rightly call God Father. </p>
