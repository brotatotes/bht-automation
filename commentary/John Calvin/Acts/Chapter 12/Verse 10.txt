<p><b>10.</b><i>When they were past.</i> God was able to have carried Peter away in the turning of an hand; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(758)</sup></span> but he overcometh diverse straits one after another, that the glory of the miracle might be the greater. So he created the world in six days, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:0">Genesis 1:0</span>.) not because he had any need of space of thee, but that he might the better stay us in the meditating upon his works, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:11">Exodus 20:11</span>,) for he applieth the manner of doing unto our capacity, and unto the increase of faith. If Peter had at a sudden been carried unto the house where the brethren were assembled, then should one only deliverance have been acknowledged, but now we see, as it were with our eyes, that he was delivered more than ten times. </p>
