<p><b>24.</b><i>And the word of God.</i> When the tyrant was once taken out of the way the Church was suddenly delivered, as it were, out of the jaws of the wolf. Therefore, though the faithful be accounted as sheep appointed to be slain, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+44:23">Psalms 44:23</span>,) yet the Church doth always overlive her enemies; and though the word of God seem oftentimes to be oppressed with the wicked tyranny of men, yet it getteth up the head again by and by, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:37">Romans 8:37</span>.) For Luke determined <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(771)</sup></span> not only what had happened after that Herod was dead, but also by this example to encourage us, that we may be assured that God will do that, in all ages, which he then did, to the end the gospel may at length break through all impediments of the enemies, and that the more the Church is diminished, it may the more increase through the heavenly blessing. </p>
