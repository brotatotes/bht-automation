<p><b>13.</b>Here is set down another of Paul’s stations; for, being departed from Paphos, when he came to Antioch of Pisidia, he made there a worthy <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(791)</sup></span> sermon, which Luke will recite, together with the success; but before he come to that, he doth by the way speak of the departure of John, because it was afterwards a cause of doleful disagreement. When he saith, <i>Paul’s companions loosed from Paphos,</i> he doth, in the first place, mean Paul himself; secondly, the other, one excepted. So that by noting his softness, he praiseth others which followed Paul with great <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(792)</sup></span> constancy. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(791)</span> “<blu>Memorabilem</blu>,” memorable. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(792)</span> “<blu>Indefatigabili</blu>,” indefatigable. </p>
