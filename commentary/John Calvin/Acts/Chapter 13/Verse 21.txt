<p><b>21.</b><i>Afterward they desire.</i> And this change was all one as if they would quite and manifestly overthrow the government which he had appointed, whereof God himself complaineth in Samuel, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1sa+8:5">1 Samuel 8:5</span>.) But the stability of the election saved them from being punished as such madness did deserve; yea, the wicked and unlawful desire of the people was to God a new and incredible occasion to erect the kingdom whence Christ should afterward come. For how is it that the scepter came to the tribe of Judah, save only because the people were desirous to have a king? And assuredly the people dealt wickedly; but God, who knoweth how to use evil things well, turned that offense into safety. Whereas Saul was thrown down from the kingdom, it served to reprove the fault of the people, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:28">1 Samuel 15:28</span>,) but immediately when the kingdom is established in Davidâ€™s family the prophecy of Jacob was verified, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span>.) </p>
