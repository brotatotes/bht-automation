<p><b>26.</b><i>Men and brethren.</i> Paul doth again prick forward the Jews to embrace Christ; for this ought to have raised no small study and attentiveness in their minds, when as they saw [heard] their salvation handled, and that the message of salvation was appointed properly for them. He calleth them <i>children of Abraham</i> not only for honor’s sake, but that they may know that they be heirs of eternal life; and he speaketh them so fair that it might not grieve them to depart from the scribes and priests whom they worshipped, because they must needs receive Christ. Furthermore, we must remember that which I said before, though the gate of the kingdom of heaven were set open to the Gentiles, yet were not the Jews thrown down from their estate; but were counted the first-begotten in God’s family; therefore is it that he saith, that salvation was sent to them, because they were first in order; yet because the carnal kindred was of itself of no great importance, and the ungodliness of many brake out, Paul speaketh specially unto the true worshippers of God, signifying that words were but vain, unless the fear of God reign in their hearts, which may receive them, and, receiving them, may foster them. We must note this title of the gospel, that it is called the <i>word of salvation.</i> Wherefore, their hardness must needs be great <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(801)</sup></span> whom it doth not allure with the sweetness that is in it; but though it be such naturally, yet is it made accidentally “the savor of death unto death” to the reprobate, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:16">2 Corinthians 2:16</span>.) </p>
