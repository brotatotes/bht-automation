<p><b>30.</b><i>God hath raised him up.</i> The death of Christ was the salvation of the godly, yet joined with the resurrection; therefore doth Paul stand longer upon this second point. For he should never have persuaded his hearers that they were to seek salvation in Christâ€™s death, unless the power of Almighty God had appeared in raising Christ from death. </p>
