<p><b>31.</b>After that he hath said that Christ came out of the grave, which was beset with the hired ministers of the adversaries, he addeth now that he appeared to many of the disciples, which bare faithful witness to the people. And he calleth them <i>witnesses,</i> either in respect of their office; because they were chosen for this purpose, as we have already said in the first chapter, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:8">Acts 1:8</span>;) or else declaring simply that they professed openly and freely that which they knew concerning Christ. Whereupon it followeth that the matter was made known openly <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(810)</sup></span> at Jerusalem. And the proof was not so light; because, in the fearful power of the enemies, who were ready and bent to resist, and did omit nothing, there were, notwithstanding, such as did openly affirm that Christ rose again, and were also such as saw that thing with their eyes; for if there had been any refutation in readiness, the scribes would not have neglected it. </p>
