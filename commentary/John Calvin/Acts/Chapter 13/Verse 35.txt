<p><b>35.</b><i>Thou shalt not suffer thy Holy One.</i> This place was likewise cited by Peter in the first sermon, set down by Luke in the second chapter, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:27">Acts 2:27</span>,) where I expounded the same; therefore, let the readers repair thither. Only I will touch this briefly, that David putteth two Hebrew words for <i>the grave,</i> as he useth repetitions commonly; the former whereof is derived of <i>desiring</i> or <i>lusting,</i> because the grave devoureth all things as an insatiable gulf; and the other of <i>corruption.</i> According to this etymology Davidâ€™s meaning is faithfully expressed in Greek; for the quality of the grave is noted, when as it receiveth the corpse, and doth, as it were, swallow it up, that it may rot there, and may at length perish when it is consumed. Paul affirmeth that that belongeth to Christ alone, that he was free and saved from corruption; for though his body was laid in the grave, corruption had, notwithstanding, no title to it, seeing that it lay there whole, as in a bed, until the day of the resurrection. </p>
