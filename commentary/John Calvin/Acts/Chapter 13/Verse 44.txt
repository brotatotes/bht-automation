For we may guess that though they were allured with some sweet taste, yet were they not as yet thoroughly persuaded to receive the doctrine of the gospel without doubting, (829) but that they came into the synagogue in a quandary, (830) between hope and desire. (829) “Sine controversia,” without controversy. (830) “Suspensi,” suspended.
