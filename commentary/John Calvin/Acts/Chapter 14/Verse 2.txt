<p><b>2.</b><i>And those Jews which believed not</i> Lo, they are persecuted now afresh, and that by the Jews, for they were like firebrands to inflame the minds of the Gentiles; for it is to be thought that the Gentiles could abide to hear the gospel preached, unless they had been incensed to resist by these fans. − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(5)</sup></span> I interpret <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κακωσαι</span></blu></grk> in this place for to resist − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(6)</sup></span> with a malicious affection, or to enforce to do hurt. Under the name brethren, Luke comprehendeth, in my judgment, all the godly; to wit, that they were vexed and troubled whosoever embraced the gospel, as if some pernicious sect had risen to spread discord, to trouble the peace of the city, to shake the public state; yet if any had rather restrain it unto Paul and Barnabas I am not greatly against him. − </p>
