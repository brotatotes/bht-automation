<p><b>23.</b><i>When they had ordained elders.</i> By this it appeareth sufficiently, that it is not enough if men have been once taught the doctrine of godliness, and to have [hold] the sum of faith, unless they go forward continually; therefore, Christ did not only send his apostles to preach the gospel, but he commanded also that there should be pastors appointed, that the preaching of the gospel might be perpetual and in daily use. Paul and Barnabas do mark that this order was set down by Christ, when they assigned pastors to every church, lest, after their departure, doctrine should cease and be whisht, (silent.) Furthermore, this place teacheth, that the Church cannot want an ordinary ministry, neither can any be counted Christians before God but those who, during their whole life, are willing to learn. I take it that those are called elders, in this place, who had the office of teaching enjoined them; for it appeareth by Paul that some were only censors of manners, and such as had authority to punish enormities, ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17">1 Timothy 5:17</span>.) Now, forasmuch as Luke saith, that they were set over every church, the difference between their office and the office of the apostles is gathered hence. For the apostles had no certain place of abode, but they went to and fro to found new churches; but pastors were set and appointed, every man to his own church, and were, as it were, placed to watch − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(55)</sup></span> over their congregations. − </p>
<p><i>Had ordained by election.</i> The Greek word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χειροτονειν</span></blu></grk> doth signify to decree, or ordain a thing, by lifting up the hands, as they used to do in the assemblies of the people. Notwithstanding, the ecclesiastical writers do often use the word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χειροτονεια</span></blu></grk> <i>,</i> in another sense; to wit, for their [the] solemn rite of ordaining, which is called in Scripture <i>laying on of hands.</i> Furthermore, by this manner of speech is very excellently expressed the right way to ordain pastors. Paul and Barnabas are said to choose − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(56)</sup></span> elders. Do they this alone by their private office? − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(57)</sup></span> Nay, rather they suffer the matter to be decided by the consent of them all. − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(58)</sup></span> Therefore, in ordaining pastors the people had their free election, but lest there should any tumult arise, Paul and Barnabas sit as chief moderators. Thus must the decree of the council of Laodicea be understood, which forbiddeth that the people have liberty granted them to elect. − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(59)</sup></span> − </p>
<p><i>They having prayed with fasting.</i> They had a double end and reason of their prayer; the first, that God would direct them with the spirit of wisdom and discretion to choose the best and most meet men, for they knew that they were not furnished with so great wisdom but they might be deceived; neither did they so much trust to their diligence, but that they knew that the principal point did consist in the blessing of God, as we see men’s judgments err daily where the heavenly government is not, and that all their labor is nothing worth where the hand of God is not. These be the true signs and tokens − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(60)</sup></span> of the godly to call upon the Spirit of God, that he may govern their counsels. And if so be it this rule be to be observed in all businesses so often as the government of the Church is in hand, which dependeth wholly upon his will and pleasure, we must − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(61)</sup></span> beware that we attempt nothing unless we have him for our guide and governor. And the second end of their prayer was, that God would furnish with necessary gifts those pastors which were chosen. For it is a harder matter to fulfill such a function faithfully as a man ought, than that man’s strength is sufficient for it. Therefore, they crave God’s help even in this part also, having Paul and Barnabas for their authors. − </p>
<p>They fast likewise, that even that may be a help − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(62)</sup></span> to stir up the ferventness of their prayers; for we know how great our coldness is otherwise. Not because it is always necessary that we should pray fasting, seeing that God doth invite even those who are full to give thanks; but when we are urged by any necessity to pray more fervently than we used commonly to do, this is a very profitable provokement. And now we have already declared what a weighty matter the choosing of pastors is, wherein the soundness of the Church is handled. Wherefore, no marvel if Luke write that they used extraordinary prayers. And it is profitable for us to mark this use, and other [uses] of fasting, lest we imagine with the Papists that it is a meritorious work, or lest we place the worship of God in it, seeing it is of itself nothing, neither is it of any importance with God, save only inasmuch as it is referred unto another end. − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(63)</sup></span> − </p>
<p><i>They committed themselves to the Lord.</i> We gather hereby, first, what great care Paul and Barnabas had for the salvation of those who, by their industry, − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(64)</sup></span> were turned unto the Lord; for they testify, that in this infirmity of the flesh men be subject to more dangers, than that their faith can continue steadfast through his [its] own strength. Therefore, this is the only refuge and aid, if the Lord keep them continually whom he hath once received. And when Luke saith, that they were commended to God in whom they believed, there cometh no small confidence hence unto us; because he assigneth this office to God as proper to him, to save and defend all those who by true faith have embraced his word. − </p>
