<p><b>16.</b><i>After these things I will return.</i> Because the place is not cited word for word as it is in the prophet, we must see what difference there is, though it be not necessary to examine straitly what diversity there is in the words, so it appear that the prophecy doth fitly agree with the matter which is in hand. After that God hath promised the restoring of the tabernacle of David, he saith also, that he will bring to pass that the Jews shall possess the remnants of Edom. In all that text, there appeareth nothing as yet whence the calling of the Gentiles can be fet − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(122)</sup></span> or gathered; but that which followeth immediately after in the prophet, concerning the remnant of the Gentiles which shall call upon the name of the Lord, doth plainly show that the Jews and Gentiles shall make one Church, because that which was then proper to the Jews alone is given to both in general. For God placeth the Gentiles in like degree of honor with the Jews, when he will have them to call upon his name. Those of Idumea, and the people thereabout, were in times past under David subject to the Jews; but though they were tributaries to the people of God, yet were they nevertheless strangers from the Church. Therefore, this was news and a strange thing, in that God reckoneth them up with the holy people, that he may be called − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(123)</sup></span> the God of them all; seeing that it is certain that they are all made equal in honor among themselves by this means. Whereby it doth plainly appear how well the testimony of the prophet agreeth with the present purpose. For God promiseth to restore the decayed tabernacle, wherein the Gentiles shall obey the kingdom of David, not only that they may pay tribute, or take [to arms] weapon at the king’s commandment, but that they may have one God, and that they may be one family to him. − </p>
<p>Yet there may a question be moved, why he had rather cite this prophecy, than many other which contain more plentiful proof of the matter which he hath in hand, of which sort Paul citeth many? ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:9">Romans 15:9</span>.) I answer, first, that the apostles were not ambitious in heaping up places of Scripture; but they did simply aim at this, which was sufficient for them, to wit, that they might prove that their doctrine was taken out of the word of God; secondly, I say that this prophecy of Amos is more plain than it is commonly taken to be. The prophet intreateth of the restoring of an house which was decayed; − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(124)</sup></span> he describeth the miserable ruin thereof. Therefore, the promise, which is added immediately, that the seat and throne shall be set up again, from of which kings of the posterity of David shall rule over the Gentiles, doth properly appertain unto Christ. Therefore, so soon as the kingdom of Christ is set up, that must needs follow which the prophet saith also, that the Gentiles shall call upon the name of God. Now, we see that James did not unadvisedly make choice of this place; for if the kingdom of Christ cannot be otherwise established, unless God be called upon everywhere throughout the whole world, and the Gentiles grow together to be one with his holy people, it is an absurd thing that they should be driven from hope of salvation, and the middle wall must fall to the ground, wherewith the one was separate from the other under the law, − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(125)</sup></span> ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:14">Ephesians 2:14</span>.) The first word, <i>I will return,</i> is not in the prophet, but the change of the state which he denounceth is very well expressed by this means. − </p>
<p><i>The tabernacle of David, which was decayed.</i> It is not without cause that that evil-favored wasteness and ruin of the king’s house is set before our eyes by the prophet; for unless the godly should have been persuaded that Christ should notwithstanding come, though the kingdom of David were brought to nought, who should not only restore to their old order things which were decayed, but should exalt even unto the heavens the glory of his kingdom with incomparable success, they should have despaired a hundred times in a day. After they were returned from the exile wherein they lived at Babylon, they were brought by continual destructions almost unto utter destruction. Afterward that which remained was consumed by little and little with civil − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(126)</sup></span> discord, yea, when God did relieve their miseries, that kind of help which they had was a certain matter of despair; − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(127)</sup></span> for that rule which the Maccabees took upon them was then taken away from the tribe of Juda. For these causes the Spirit of God doth diligently beat in [inculcate] this by the prophet, that Christ shall not come until the kingdom of David shall perish, that they may not despair of salvation even amidst greatest miseries. So Isaiah saith, that there shall a branch arise out of the contemptible and base stock, − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(128)</sup></span> ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:1">Isaiah 11:1</span>;) and let us also remember, that God doth observe this wonderful way in restoring the Church, that he doth build it up, − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(129)</sup></span> when it is decayed. − </p>
<p>Furthermore, this place teachers when the Church is best ordered, and what is the true and right constitution thereof, to wit, when the throne of David is set up, and Christ alone hath the preeminence, that all may meet together in his obedience. − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(130)</sup></span> − </p>
<p>Though the Pope have oppressed the Church with his sacrilegious tyranny, yet doth he make boast of the title of the Church; yea, he deceiveth men under the vain title of the Church, that he may put out the clear light of sound doctrine. But if we shall come thoroughly to examine the matter, we may easily refute such a gross mock, because he alone beareth rule, having deposed Christ. He doth in word confess that he is Christ’s vicar; but in very deed after that he hath by a beautiful banishment − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(131)</sup></span> sent Christ into the heavens, he taketh to himself all his power; for Christ reigneth by the doctrine of his gospel alone, which is wickedly trodden under foot by this abominable idol. But let us remember that this shall be the lawful estate of the Church among us, if we do all in general − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(132)</sup></span> obey Christ, the King of kings, that there may be one sheepfold and one Shepherd, ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:16">John 10:16</span>.) − </p>
