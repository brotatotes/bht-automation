<p><b>20.</b><i>These men trouble our city.</i> This accusation was craftily composed to burden the servants of Christ. For on the one side they pretend the name of the Romans, than which nothing was more favorable; on the other, they purchase hatred, and bring them in contempt, by naming the Jews, which name was at that time infamous; for, as touching religion, the Romans were more like to any than to the Jewish nation. For it was lawful for a man which was a Roman to do sacrifice either in Asia or in Grecia, or in any other country where were idols and superstitions. I warrant you Satan did agree with himself very well, though he put on divers shapes, but that which was religion only, than which there was no other in the world, was counted among the Romans detestable. They frame a third accusation out of the crime of sedition; − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(203)</sup></span> for they pretend that the public peace is troubled by Paul and his company. In like sort was Christ brought in contempt, − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(204)</sup></span> ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:5">Luke 23:5</span>) and even at this day the Papists have no more plausible thing wherewith they may bring us to be hated, than when they cry that our doctrine tendeth to no other end but to confusion of all things. But we must valiantly contemn this filthy and false infamy as did Christ and Paul, until the Lord bring to light the malice of our enemies, and refute their impudence. − </p>
