<p><b>30.</b><i>Sirs, what must I do?</i> He doth so ask counsel, that he showeth therewith that he will be obedient. By this we see that he was thoroughly − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(219)</sup></span> touched, so that he was ready to do what they should command him, whom not many hours before he had bound uncourteously. The wicked oftentimes when they see wonders, though they tremble for a time, yet are they straightway made more obstinate, as it befell Pharaoh, ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+8:8">Exodus 8:8</span>;) at least they are not so tamed that they give over themselves to God. But in this place the keeper (acknowledging the power of God) was not only a little afraid, so that he returned straightway unto his former cruelty, but he showeth himself obedient to God, and desirous of sound and wholesome doctrine. He demandeth how he may obtain salvation; whereby it appeareth more plainly that he was not suddenly taken with some light − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(220)</sup></span> fear of God only, but truly humbled to offer himself to be a scholar to his ministers. He knew that they were cast in prison for no other cause, save only because they did overthrow the common estate of religion. Now he is ready to hear their doctrine which he had before contemned. − </p>
