<p><b>17.</b><i>All the Grecians having taken Sosthenes.</i> This is that Sosthenes whom Paul doth honorably couple with himself as his companion in the beginning of the former Epistle to the Corinthians. And though there be no mention made of him before among the faithful, yet it is to be thought that he was then one of Paul’s companions and advocates. And what fury did enforce the Grecians to run headlong upon him, save only because it is allotted to all the children of God to have the world set against them, and offended with them and their cause, though unknown? Wherefore, there is no cause why such unjust dealing should trouble us at this day when we see the miserable Church oppugned on every side. Moreover, the frowardness of man’s nature is depainted out unto us as in a table, [picture.] Admit we grant that the Jews were hated everywhere for good causes, yet why are the Grecians rather displeased with Sosthenes, a modest man, than with the authors of the tumult, who troubled Paul without any cause? Namely, this is the reason, because, when men are not governed with the Spirit of God, they are carried headlong unto evil, as it were, by the secret inspiration of nature, notwithstanding it may be that they bare Sosthenes such hatred, thinking he had lodged wicked men to raise sedition. − </p>
<p><i>Neither did Gallio care for any of these things.</i> This looseness − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(329)</sup></span> must be imputed not so much to the sluggishness of the deputy as to the hatred of the Jewish religion. The Romans could have wished that the remembrance of the true God had been buried. And, therefore, when as it was lawful for them to vow their vows, and to pay them to all the idols of Asia and Greece, it was a deadly fact − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(330)</sup></span> to do sacrifice to the God of Israel. Finally, in the common liberty − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(331)</sup></span> of all manner [of] superstition, only true religion was accepted. This is the cause that Gallio winketh at the injury done to Sosthenes. He professed of late that he would punish injuries if any were done; now he suffereth a guiltless man to be beaten before the judgment-seat. Whence cometh this sufferance, save only because he did in heart desire that the Jews might one slay another, that their religion might be put out − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(332)</sup></span> with them? But forasmuch as, by the mouth of Luke, the Spirit condemneth Gallio’s carelessness, because he did not aid a man who was unjustly punished, − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(333)</sup></span> let our magistrates know that they be far more inexcusable if they wink at injuries and wicked facts, if they bridle not the wantonness of the wicked, if they reach not forth their hand to the oppressed. But and if the sluggish are to look for just damnation, what terrible judgment hangeth over the heads of those who are unfaithful and wicked, − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(334)</sup></span> who, by favoring evil causes, and bearing with wicked facts, set up, as it were, a banner of want of punishment, − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(335)</sup></span> and are fans to kindle boldness to do hurt? </p>
