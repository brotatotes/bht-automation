<p><b>33.</b><i>They drew out Alexander.</i> It is to be thought that the Jews did not send forth this Alexander to plead the common cause of the nation, but that they were desirous to bring him before the people that he might be murdered. Nevertheless, the name Jew made him to be so hated, that they did outrageously refuse whatsoever he was about to speak in the matter and cause; yea, he did hardly escape with his life in such an uproar. Moreover, it is uncertain whether this be that Alexander of whom Paul maketh mention elsewhere, ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:20">Titus 1:20</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:14">2 Timothy 4:14</span>) yet the conjecture seemeth to me allowable. But and if we believe that it is he, let us learn by this fearful example to walk circumspectly, lest Satan carry us away into like falling away [defection]. For we see that he who was at the point to suffer martyrdom, became a treacherous and wicked revolt [apostate]. − </p>
