<p><b>11.</b><i>The wonderful works of God.</i> Luke noteth two things which caused the hearers to wonder; first, because the apostles being before ignorant and private persons, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(87)</sup></span> born in a base corner, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(88)</sup></span> did, notwithstanding, intreat profoundly of divine matters, and of heavenly wisdom. The other is, because they have new tongues given them suddenly. Both things are worth the noting, because to huddle out [utter] words unadvisedly and foolishly, should not so much have served to move their minds; and the majesty of the things ought the more to have moved them to consider the miracle. Although they give due honor to God, in that they are astonished and amazed, yet the principal and of the miracle is expressed in this, that they inquire, and thereby declare that they are prepared to learn; for otherwise their amazedness and wondering should not have done them any great good. And certainly we must so wonder at the works of God, that there must be also a consideration, and a desire to understand. </p>
