<p><b>26.</b><i>For this my heart rejoiced</i> Joy of the soul, gladness of the tongue, and quietness of all the whole body, do ensue upon sure hope and confidence; for unless men be quite past feeling, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(118)</sup></span> they must needs be careful and sorrowful, and so, consequently, miserably tormented, so long as they feel themselves destitute of the help of God. But that sure trust which we repose in God doth not only deliver us from carefulness, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(119)</sup></span> but doth also replenish our hearts with wonderful joy (and gladness.) That is the joy which Christ promised to his disciples should be full in them, and which he testified could not be taken from them, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:22">John 16:22</span>.) He expresseth the greatness of the joy when he saith, That it cannot be kept in, but that it will break forth into the gladness of the tongue. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(120)</sup></span> <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">כבוד</span></blu></heb>, doth signify, indeed, <i>glory,</i> but it is taken in that place, as in many others, for<i>the tongue</i> And so the Grecians have truly translated the same. The rest of the<i>flesh</i> doth signify the quietness of the whole man, which we have through the protection of God. Neither is this any let, because the faithful are continually out of quiet and tremble; for as in the midst of sorrows they do nevertheless rejoice; so there are no troubles so great that can break them of their rest. If any man object, that the peace of the faithful doth consist in the spirit, and that it is not in the flesh: I answer, that the faithful do rest in body; not that they are free from troubles, but because they believe that God careth for them wholly, and that not only their soul shall be safe through his protection, but their body also. </p>
