<p><b>27.</b><i>Because thou shalt not leave</i> To leave the soul in hell is to suffer the same to be oppressed with destruction. There be two words used in this place, both which do signify the grave amongst the Hebricians. Because <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">שאול</span></blu></heb>, doth signify <i>to require,</i> I suppose it is called <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">סול</span></blu></heb>, because death is insatiable; whence also cometh that translation, Hell hath enlarged her soul. Again, they set open their mouth like hell. And because the latter <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">שחת</span></blu></heb>, is derived and set for <i>corruption,</i> or <i>consumption,</i> that quality is to be considered, as David meant to note the same. Those things which are disputed in this place by divers, concerning the descending of Christ into hell, are in my judgment superfluous; because they are far from the intent and purpose of the prophet. For the word <i>anima,</i> or <i>soul,</i> doth not so much signify the spirit being of an immortal essence as the life itself. For when a man is dead, and lieth in the grave, the grave is said to rule over his life. Whereas the Grecians translate it <i>holy,</i> it is in Hebrew <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">חסת</span></blu></heb>, which doth properly signify <i>meek,</i> or <i>gentle,</i> but Luke did not much regard this, because it doth not much appertain unto the present purpose. Furthermore, gentleness and meekness is so often commended in the faithful, because it behoveth them to imitate and resemble the nature of their Father. </p>
