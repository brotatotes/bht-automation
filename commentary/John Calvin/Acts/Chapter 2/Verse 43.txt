<p><b>43.</b><i>And there came.</i> He signifieth unto us that the show and sight of the Church was such, that it made others afraid which did not consent unto [its] doctrine; and that was done for the preserving and furthering of the Church. When there ariseth any seen all men set themselves stoutly against the same; and as novelty is odious, the Jews would never have suffered the Church of Christ to stand one minute of an hour, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(144)</sup></span> unless the Lord had restrained them with fear as with a bridle. Furthermore, Luke noteth the manner of fear, that it was no such fear as bringeth men unto the obedience of Christ, but such as causeth men to stand in a doubt, and so, consequently, doth, as it were, so bind them hand and foot, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(145)</sup></span> that they dare not hinder the Lord’s work. Like as there be some at this day who will willingly be ignorant of the gospel; or, at least, are so holden <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(146)</sup></span> with the cares of this world, that they cannot thoroughly join themselves unto Christ; and yet they are not so hard-hearted but that they confess that the truth is on our side; and, therefore, they rest, as it were, in the middle way, neither do they favor the cruelty of the wicked, because they are afraid to strive against God. And whereas he saith, <i>Every soul,</i> he speaketh thus by <i>synecdoche.</i> For it is certain that many did contemn the hand of God, and that other some were stricken with no great fear, but that they did furiously rage together against the Church. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(147)</sup></span> But Luke’s meaning was this, that there appeared such power of God in the Church, that the people for the most part had not one word to say. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(148)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>And many wonders.</i> This member serveth also to the showing of the cause. For the miracles served to make them afraid, together with other works of God, although this was not the only reason, but one of many, why they were afraid to set themselves against God, who was on that side, as they did gather by the miracles; whence we gather that they are not only profitable for this to bring men to God, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(149)</sup></span> but also to make the wicked somewhat more gentle, and that they may tame their furiousness. Pharaoh was a man of desperate stubbornness, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+8:8">Exodus 8:8</span>, etc. 19,) and yet we see how miracles do sometimes pierce his obstinate heart. He forgetteth them by and by; but when the hand of God is heavy upon him, he is compelled through fear to yield. To be brief, Luke teacheth that the Jews were by this means kept back, that the Church, which might easily have been destroyed, might have got up her head. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(150)</sup></span> Which thing we have oftentimes tried <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(151)</sup></span> even in our time. And he doth not only declare that they were bridled with fear, lest they should be so bold as to attempt so much as they lusted to do hurt to the Church, but that they were also humbled with reverence to the glory of the gospel. </p>
