<p><b>22.</b><i>And, behold.</i> He declareth now more fully to what end he intreated of his upright dealing; to wit, because they should never see him any more. And it was very expedient that the pattern which was set before them by God of them to be followed should be always before their eyes, and that they should remember him when he was dead. For we know how readily men degenerate from pure institution. But though he deny that he doth know what shall befall him at Jerusalem, yet because he was taught by many prophecies that bonds were prepared for him there, as if he were now ready to die, he cutteth off shortly after the hope of his return. And yet for all this he is not contrary to himself. He speaketh doubtfully at the first of set purpose, that he may soften that which was about to be more (hard and) bitter; and yet he doth truly affirm, that he knew not as yet the ends and events of things, because he had no certain and special revelation touching the whole process. − </p>
<p><i>Bound in the spirit.</i> Some expound this that he was bound to the churches, who had committed to him this function to carry alms. Notwithstanding, I do rather think that hereby is meant the inward force and motion of the Spirit, not as though he were so inspired, − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(426)</sup></span> that he was out of his wit, but because being certified of the will of God, he did meekly − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(427)</sup></span> follow the direction and instinct of the Spirit, even of his own accord. Therefore, this speech importeth as much as if he should have said, I cannot otherwise do, unless I would be stubborn and rebellious against God, who doth as it were draw me thither, being bound by his Spirit. For to the end he may excuse himself of rashness, he saith that the Spirit is the author and guide of his journey. But would to God those brain-sick men, who boast that the Spirit doth incite to them those things which proceed from their own fantasy, did know the Spirit as familiarly as did Paul, who doth, notwithstanding, not say that all his motions and instigations − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(428)</sup></span> are of the Spirit, but declareth that that fell out in one thing as a singular thing. For men do oftentimes foolishly and unadvisedly take in hand those things which they put in practice afterward stoutly, because they be ashamed of lightness and instability. And he doth not only mean that he took in hand his journey for a good cause, which the Spirit of God showeth him, but that it is altogether necessary for him, because it is wickedness to resist. Furthermore, let us learn, by the example of the holy man, not to kick against the Spirit of the Lord, but obediently to give over ourselves by him to be governed, that he may rule us at his pleasure after we be as it were bound to him. − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(429)</sup></span> For if the reprobate, who are the bond-slaves of Satan, be carried not only willingly, but also greedily, through his motion, − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(430)</sup></span> how much more ought this voluntary bondage or service to be in the children of God? − </p>

<p>“ <blu>Non quod</blu> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ενθουσιασμω</span></blu></grk> <blu>correptus fuerit</blu>,” not that he was so enraptured. </p>
