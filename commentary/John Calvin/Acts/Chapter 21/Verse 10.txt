<p><b>10.</b><i>A certain prophet.</i> Though Luke doth not plainly express the same, yet do I conjecture that this Agabus was the same of whom mention is made in the eleventh chapter, ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>) who foretold that there should be famine under the reign of Claudius Caesar. And when as Luke calleth him a prophet, as of late he called, the four daughters of Philip, he signifieth that it was not a common but a peculiar gift. Now, we must see to what end the persecution which was at hand was now again showed by Agabus. As concerning Paul, he was sufficiently told already. − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(461)</sup></span> Therefore, I do not doubt but that this confirmation was added for other men’s sake; because the Lord meant every where to make known the bonds of his servant, partly that they might know that he entered the combat willingly, partly that they might perceive that he was appointed of God to be a champion to fight for the gospel. It was surely a profitable example of invincible constancy, seeing that he offered himself willingly and wittingly to the violence of the adversaries; and no less profitable is it for us at this day, that his apostleship should be confirmed with this voluntary and no less constant giving over of his life. − </p>
<p><i>The man who owneth this girdle.</i> It was an usual thing among the prophets to represent those things which they spake by signs; neither did they confirm their prophecies by using signs, through their own motion, but at the commandment of the Spirit, as when Isaias is commanded to go barefoot, ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+20:2">Isaiah 20:2</span>) Jeremiah to put a yoke upon his neck, to sell the possession and to buy it, ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+27:2">Jeremiah 27:2</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+32:7">Jeremiah 32:7</span>) and Ezekiel to dig through the wall of his house privily, and in the same night to carry forth burthens, ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eze+12:5">Ezekiel 12:5</span>). These and such like might seem to the common sort to be toys; − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(462)</sup></span> but the same Spirit, who did apply signs to his words, did inwardly touch the hearts of the godly, as if they had been brought to the very thing itself. So this spectacle, mentioned by Luke, did no less move Paul’s companions, than if they had seen him bound in deed. The false prophets did afterward essay to delude the simple by this policy, as Satan is in a manner God’s ape, and his ministers do envy the servants of God. Zedekias made himself horns, wherewith he promised Syria should be pushed. Ananias, by breaking Jeremiah’s yoke, put the people in a vain hope of deliverance. God hath suffered the reprobate to be deluded with such delusions, that he might punish their unbelief. − </p>
<p>But, forasmuch as there was in them no force of the Spirit, their vanity did no whit hurt the faithful. This is also worthy to be noted, that Agabus doth not set before their eyes a dumb spectacle, but he coupleth therewith the word, whereby he may show to the faithful the use and end of the ceremony. − </p>

<p>“ <blu>Jam satis superque admonitus fuerat</blu>,” he had been more than sufficiently warned already. </p>

<p>“ <blu>Ludicra</blu>,” ludicrous. </p>
