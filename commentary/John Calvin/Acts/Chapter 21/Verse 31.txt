<p><b>31.</b><i>As they sought to kill him.</i> Assuredly the force of Satan appeareth therein, in that he driveth the people headlong into such rage, that when they have shut the doors of the temple, being not content with mean punishment, they conspire to put Paul to death. We must thus think with ourselves that Satan doth prick forward the enemies of godliness, lest their rage, how cruel and troublesome soever it be, trouble us. On the other side appeareth the wonderful goodness of God, when as he raiseth up the chief captain at a sudden, that he may deliver Paul from death. He himself thought upon no such thing, but he came to appease the tumult which was raised among the people; but the Lord showeth a more evident token of his providence, because Paul’s life was delivered from such present danger without man’s counsel. Thus doth he suffer the faithful not only to labor, but to be almost oppressed, that he may deliver them from death more wonderfully. Luke calleth him the chief captain [tribune] of the band − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(491)</sup></span> improperly, seeing every chief captain was set over a thousand, which cloth also appear by the text, where he saith that the chief captain took with him under captains? − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(492)</sup></span> − </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(491)</span> − </p>
<p>“ <blu>Tribunum cohortis</blu>,” tribune of the cohort. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(492)</span> − </p>
<p>“ <blu>Centurionos... a tribuno assumptos</blu>,” that the tribune took with him centurions. </p>
