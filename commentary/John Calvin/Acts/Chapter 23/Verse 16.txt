− 16.Paul’s sister’s son. We see in this place how the Lord doth cross the purposes of the ungodly. He permitteth them to attempt many things, and he suffereth their wicked endeavors, but at length he showeth even in the twinkling of an eye − (549) that he doth from heaven deride whatsoever men go about upon earth. − “There is no wisdom,” saith Solomon, “there is no counsel against the Lord,” ( Proverbs 21:30). Whereto that of Isaiah doth answer, − “Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought: speak the word, and it shall not stand,” ( Isaiah 8:10). − This is set before our eyes to be considered, in this present history, as in a glass. The matter was almost dispatched, that Paul should come out on the morrow to be slain as an avowed sacrificed. − (550) But the Lord doth show that his life is most safely kept, so that whatsoever men go about all is in vain. As for us, let us not fear but that his providence, whereof he showed some token then, reacheth even unto the defending of us, because this promise continueth sure, − “There shall not an hair fall from your heads,” etc. ( Luke 21:18). − Moreover, it is worth the noting, that he worketh sometimes by means unlooked for to save those that be his, that he may the better exercise our faith. Who would have thought that a boy would have disclosed their lying in wait, which those who were partners in the conspiracy thought was known to none but to themselves? Therefore, let us learn to lean unto and stay ourselves upon the Lord, though we see no ordinary way to save ourselves, who shall find a way even through places where nothing can pass. (549) − “ Ipso articulo,” at the very nick of time (550) − “ Devota victima,” a devoted victim.
