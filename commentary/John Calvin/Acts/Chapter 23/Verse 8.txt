<p><b>8.</b><i>The Sadducees say.</i> Though Luke maketh mention of three points wherein these sects did dissent, yet shortly after he bringeth − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(536)</sup></span> them to two, because there is like respect to be had of spirits and of angels. Therefore, he saith that the Pharisees did confess both; to wit, that the dead shall rise again, and that human and angelical spirits are immortal. And here Luke declareth in what sense the apostle professed himself to be a Pharisee, not because he did subscribe to all their inventions, but only in the resurrection of the dead. We know how sharply Christ reproveth their errors, ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:29">Matthew 22:29</span>) therefore, it had been good that some exception had been added, − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(537)</sup></span> lest any man might think that Paul was one with them in all things. Now, though the Sadducees did deny the resurrection, yet may we not think that they were altogether like to the Epicures, [Epicureans]. For they did confess that the world is governed by the providence of God, and that every man is rewarded for his works. In this point they were sounder than the Epicures, [Epicureans]. But they did dote too grossly, when they included the rewards of righteousness and the punishments of wickedness in this life. For that I may omit the Scripture, experience doth teach, that as well the godly as the ungodly are either punished with many miseries, or else gently − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(538)</sup></span> dealt withal; and that the wicked do oftentimes live in wealth and pleasures, when as the worshippers of God are oftentimes miserably tormented; as it is <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+73:4">Psalms 73:4</span>. Therefore, whosoever esteemeth the judgment of God by the present estate of men, whether it be good or bad, he must needs fall away from faith at length unto Epicurish contempt of God. − </p>
<p>Now, this is beastly blockishness to rest in an uncertain and transitory life, and not to be wise above − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(539)</sup></span> the earth. For which cause we must flee from that error as from a detestable monster. For though godliness have the promises of the earthly life also, yet because we be most miserable if our hope stay still in this world, the children of God must begin with this, that they may lift up their eyes toward heaven, and think continually upon the glory of the last resurrection. − </p>
<p><i>Neither angel nor spirit.</i> This place is expounded two manner of ways. − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(540)</sup></span> Many refer it unto the Holy Ghost, which seemeth to be unlikely. For howsoever the Sadducees be to be holden excused in other errors, yet because the Scripture doth so often repeat the name of the Spirit, I will scarce believe that they denied that which the Pharisees believed only lightly and obscurely. For even these men had no distinct faith concerning the Holy Spirit, that they did acknowledge the proper person of the Spirit in the substance of God. − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(541)</sup></span> Some will have angel and spirit to signify one thing, − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(542)</sup></span> as if one thing were spoken twice. But to what end was it to repeat a thing which was plain enough? I warrant you, that member which followeth did deceive them, where Luke seemeth to make no distinction. But we showed the reason before; because, seeing the souls of men and angels are of one and the same nature and substance, they be both placed in one order. Therefore, I do not doubt but that this is Luke’s true meaning, that the Sadducees did deny angels, and also all manner of spirits. − </p>
<p>Now, forasmuch as Paul crieth that he is a Pharisee in this point of doctrine, he doth flatly condemn all brain-sick fellows, who at this day are in the same error. For there be certain profane and unlearned men who dream that angels and devils are nothing else but good and evil inspirations; and lest they want some color, they say that all that came from the heathen which the Scripture hath concerning good and evil angels, whereas that opinion which was common in the world had his [its] beginning from the heavenly doctrine. But the heathen did with their lies pollute that doctrine which they had from the Fathers. As touching men’s souls, because even at this day certain miscreants do feign that the souls do vanish away in death until the day of the resurrection, their madness is likewise refuted by the testimony of Luke. − </p>
