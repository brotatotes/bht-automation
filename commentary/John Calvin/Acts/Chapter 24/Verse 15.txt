<p><b>15.</b><i>Hoping in God.</i> We must note the course of his speech. For after that he hath professed that he believeth the Scripture, he doth now add the hope of the resurrection to come, that it may appear that it cometh not from the understanding of the flesh, − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(582)</sup></span> or from the decrees of men, but it is conceived out of the word of God. Thus doth the reverence of the Scripture go before, − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(583)</sup></span> that it − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(584)</sup></span> may hold us fast bound, and it is the beginning of faith. After that the knowledge of those things which God hath revealed there doth follow, being coupled and linked with sure hope. And whereas he maketh them his fellows, it is referred unto the sounder sort. Though it be not to be doubted, but that he seeketh, by this means and policy, to bring them out of their lurking places into the clear light, and that before Felix; as it shall again appear by the conclusion of the defense. But in this place, the general resurrection is defended [asserted] against certain brain-sick fellows, who restrain the same unto the members of Christ. But as Paul doth in this place say that all men shall rise again, so by the plain voice of Christ all are cited; − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(585)</sup></span> some unto judgment, some unto life ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29">John 5:29</span>). − </p>

<p>“ <blu>Carnis sensu</blu>,” from carnal sense. </p>

<p>“ <blu>Praecedit</blu>,” take precedence </p>
