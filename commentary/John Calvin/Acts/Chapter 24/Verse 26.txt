<p><b>26.</b><i>Hoping that money.</i> Though Felix had thoroughly tried Paul’s integrity, so that he was ashamed to take money of the Jews for condemning him; yet forasmuch as he was a covetous man, and a man given to corruptions, he would not acquit him for nothing; for this cause he doth often call Paul, that he may with fair words put him in some hope of deliverance. − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(594)</sup></span> For judges which gape after money do insinuate themselves thus, when as they will make way for corruptions. Whence we gather, that it was but a vain and transitory fear wherewith Felix was taken when he heard Paul dispute, seeing hope of gain doth compel him to call for him whom he was enforced with fear to send away. How did Felix hope for some reward at the hands of a poor man, and one that was destitute? for that ghoul would not have been content with a small prey. I do not doubt but that (as those who have the law and right to sell are witty and can perceive things − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(595)</sup></span>) when he saw the Jews did make such earnest suit to have Paul put to death, he smelled somewhat afar off touching him; − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(596)</sup></span> to wit, that he was none of the common sort; but such a man as was in great favor with many. Wherefore, he did not doubt but that many of his friends would willingly bestow cost to redeem him. − </p>

<p>“ <blu>Aliquid procul de ipso subodoratum esse</blu>,” he had some distant idea of what kind of a person he was. </p>
