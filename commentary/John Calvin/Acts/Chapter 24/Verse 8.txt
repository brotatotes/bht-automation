<p><b>8.</b><i>Having made inquiry.</i> A good − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(570)</sup></span> request, that the governor do not give sentence before he thoroughly examine and know the matter; and that he do not condemn Paul before he be lawfully convict. But how dare they put in these conditions, seeing their own consciences do accuse them of unjust dealing? I answer, that they had witnesses in readiness; and that they do not offer themselves to prove the matter until they do call them; − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(571)</sup></span> though there were another end. For they did hope that Felix would be so persuaded with such glorious words, − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(572)</sup></span> that he would turn over unto them the man whom they did accuse for a condemned man, whom they might handle at their pleasure. In sum, the more fierce they be upon him, and the more they were puffed up with some affiance they had in themselves, they think they shall get the upper hand by this means, because the party arraigned shall have no license granted to defend himself. Thus do false accusers boldly boast that their matter is plain, that they may blind the eyes of the judges. </p>
