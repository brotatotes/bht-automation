<p><b>5.</b><i>Shaking off the viper.</i> The shaking off of the viper is a token of a quiet mind. For we see how greatly fear doth trouble and weaken men; and yet you must not think that Paul was altogether void of fear. For faith doth not make us blockish, as brain-sick men do imagine, when they be out of danger. − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(659)</sup></span> But though faith doth not quite take away the feeling of evils, yet it doth temperate the same, lest the godly be more afraid than is meet; that they may always be bold and have a good hope. So though Paul understand that the viper was a noisome beast, yet did he trust to the promise which was made to him, and did not so fear her plaguy − <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(660)</sup></span> biting, that it did trouble him; because he was even ready to die if need had been. − </p>

<p>“ <blu>In umbra et extra teli jacturam</blu>,” in the shade, and out of bowshot. </p>

<p>“ <blu>Pestiferum</blu>,” pestiferous, deadly. </p>
