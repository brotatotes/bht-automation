23.Furthermore when they were let go. It shall appear by and by to what end they declared to the other disciples what things had befallen them, to wit, that they might be the more emboldened and encouraged by the grace of God hereafter; secondly, that they might arm themselves with prayer against the furious threatenings of their enemies; and thus must the children of God do, one must prick forward another, and they must join hand in hand, that they may vanquish the common adversary fighting under Christ’s banner. They consider (219) with themselves what dangers hang over their heads, to the end they may be the more ready to enter (220) the same, although they see their enemies press sore upon them; yet lest it should grieve them (221) to have a new combat ever now and then, they assure (222) themselves that they shall be invincible (223) through the same power of God whereby they got the victory before. And it is to be thought (although Luke makes no mention thereof) that the apostles being contented with their former answer, did not contend with those furies, [furious men;] and yet we must persuade ourselves that they were not so forgetful of their former constancy that they did submit themselves unto their ungodly decree like slaves. (224) (219) “Reputent,” let them consider. (220) “Obcundis,” to obviate or face them. (221) “Ne pigeat,” let it not grieve them. (222) “Confidant,” let them confide. (223) “Semper inexpugnabiles,” always invincible. (224) “Ut serviliter excipient,” as servilely to submit.
