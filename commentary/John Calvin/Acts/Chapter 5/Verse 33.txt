<p><b>33.</b><i>They were cut in sunder.</i> The priests ought to have been thoroughly moved, though they had had hearts of iron, but they burst. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(280)</sup></span> Whence we gather that no reasons can prevail with the reprobate, to bring them unto the obedience of Christ; for unless God speak within, the outward doctrine shall be able to do nothing else but to beat the cars. The apostles were able so to overcome their enemies, that they should not have had one word to say; but their fury was so untamed, and unbridled that they do rather go mad. Yet we must therewithal note the force of the word, because although the reprobate are not thereby changed, that they may become better, yet it pierceth into their hearts, so that it urgeth their consciences; for thence springeth their fury, because they saw themselves <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(281)</sup></span> urged by their judge. They would gladly mock all the gospel, as they attempt whatsoever they can, that they may count it as nothing; but there is in the same a certain hidden majesty, which driveth away mightily all their delicacy. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(282)</sup></span> And chiefly when they are cited by the sound of the trumpet to appear before the judgment-seat of God, then appeareth their madness and fury. </p>
