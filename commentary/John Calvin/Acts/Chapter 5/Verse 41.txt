<p><b>41.</b><i>Then they went rejoicing.</i> We must not think that the apostles were so senseless but that they felt some shame and did also lament, when they felt the punishment; for they had not quite put off nature; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(298)</sup></span> but when they considered the cause, then joy got the upperhand. So the faithful must be two manner of ways affectioned so often as they suffer persecution for the gospel; they must be touched with the bitterness of punishments, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(299)</sup></span> yet so that they overcome this sorrow with spiritual joy. For they should have (changed their mind, and) stricken sail by and by, unless they had been strengthened and encouraged by that joy. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(300)</sup></span> And it is not to be doubted, but that even death was sweet, and pleasant to Peter on this fashion, which, notwithstanding the Lord doth testify shall be bitter unto him. Let us, therefore, learn that we must wrestle with sorrow and care, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(301)</sup></span> that we hold on courageously to suffer the cross, and that we bear the same when it is laid upon us. </p>
<p><i>That they were counted worthy.</i> This might seem at the first blush absurd, in that Luke placeth honor in reproach; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(302)</sup></span> but the disagreement which is between God and the world causeth this, that that which is counted amongst men most reproachful, excelleth in dignity and glory in the sight of God and his angels. We know that the kind of death which Christ suffered was of all other most shameful, and yet did he triumph most nobly upon the cross; so, when we are made like unto him, we may worthily boast that it is a point of singular excellency, that we suffer rebuke in the sight of the world. Thus doth Paul boast of the marks of Christ, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:17">Galatians 6:17</span>.) For we must here respect the cause which doth associate us unto Christ, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(303)</sup></span> who doth not only swallow up the shame of the world with his glory, but doth also turn reproaches, slanders, and mocks of the world, into great honor. Wherefore, it is no marvel that there be so few found which are strong and stout to bear the cross, because we are almost all drowned and overwhelmed with the sense of the flesh; and there is scarce one amongst an hundred which considereth that the reproach of Christ doth far excel all the triumphs of the world, which is the only matter of comfort. Wherefore, we must use the greater diligence in thinking upon this sentence; that we are at this day made partakers <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(304)</sup></span> of the sufferings of Christ, that we may be partakers of his glory. </p>
