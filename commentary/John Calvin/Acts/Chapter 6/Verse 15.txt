<p><b>15.</b><i>And when they had beheld.</i> Men do commonly in places of judgment turn their eyes toward the party arraigned, when as they look for his defense. He saith that Stephen appeared like to an angel; this is not spoken of his natural face, but rather of his present countenance. For whereas the countenance of those which are arraigned useth commonly to be pale, whereas they stammer in their speech, and show other signs of fear, Luke teacheth that there was no such thing in Stephen, but that there appeared rather in him a certain majesty. For the Scripture useth sometimes to borrow a similitude of angels in this sense; as <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1sa+24:9">1 Samuel 24:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2sa+14:17">2 Samuel 14:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2sa+19:27">2 Samuel 19:27</span> </p>
