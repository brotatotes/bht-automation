<p><b>3.</b><i>Therefore, brethren, look out.</i> Now we see to what end deacons were made. The word itself is indeed general, yet is it properly taken for those which are stewards for the poor. Whereby it appeareth how licentiously the Papists do mock God and men, who assign unto their deacons no other office but this, to have the charge of <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(331)</sup></span> the paten and chalice. Surely we need no disputation to prove that they agree in no point with the apostles. But if the readers be desirous to see any more concerning this point, they may repair unto our Institution, chapter 8. As touching this present place, the Church is permitted to choose. For it is tyrannous if any one man appoint or make ministers at his pleasure. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(332)</sup></span> Therefore, this is the (most) lawful way, that those be chosen by common voices <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(333)</sup></span> who are to take upon them <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(334)</sup></span> any public function in the Church. And the apostles prescribe what manner [of] persons ought to be chosen, to wit, men of tried honesty and credit, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(335)</sup></span> men endued with wisdom <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(336)</sup></span> and other gifts of the Spirit. And this is the mean between tyranny and confused liberty, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(337)</sup></span> that nothing be done without <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(338)</sup></span> the consent and approbation of the people, yet so that the pastors moderate and govern (this action, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(339)</sup></span>) that their authority may be as a bridle to keep under the people, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(340)</sup></span> lest they pass their bounds too much. In the mean season, this is worth the noting, that the apostles prescribe an order unto the faithful, lest they appoint any save those which are fit. For we do God no small injury if we take all that come to hand <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(341)</sup></span> to govern his house. Therefore, we must use great circumspection that we choose none <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(342)</sup></span> unto the holy function of the Church unless we have some trial of him first. The number of seven is applied <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(343)</sup></span> unto the present necessity, lest any man should think <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(344)</sup></span> that there is some mystery comprehended under the same. Whereas Luke saith, <i>full of the Spirit and wisdom,</i> I do interpret it thus, that it is requisite that they be furnished both with other gifts of the Spirit, and also with wisdom, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(345)</sup></span> without which that function cannot be exercised well, both that they may beware of the leger-demain <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(346)</sup></span> of those men, who being too much given unto begging, require <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(347)</sup></span> that which is necessary for the poverty of the brethren, and also of their slanders, who cease not to backbite, though they have none occasion given them. For that function is not only painful, but also subject to many ungodly murmurings. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(348)</sup></span> </p>
