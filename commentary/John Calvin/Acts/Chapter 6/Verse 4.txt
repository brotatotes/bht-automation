<p><b>4.</b><i>And we will give ourselves unto prayer.</i> They show again that they have too much business otherwise, wherein they may exercise themselves during their whole life. For the old proverb agreeth hereunto very fitly, which was used sometimes in the solemn rites, <i>do this.</i> Therefore, they use the word [<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">προσκαρτερησαι</span></blu></grk> ] which signifieth to be, as it were, fastened and tied to anything. Therefore, pastors must not think that they have so done their duty that they need to do no more when they have daily spent some time in teaching. There is another manner of study, another manner of zeal, another manner of continuance <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(349)</sup></span> required, that they may <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(350)</sup></span> indeed boast that they are wholly given to that thing. They adjoin thereunto prayer, not that they alone ought to pray, (for that is an exercise common to all the godly,) but because they have peculiar causes to pray above all others. There is no man which ought not to be careful for the common salvation of the Church. How much more, then, ought the pastor, who hath that function enjoined him by name to labor carefully [anxiously] for it? So Moses did indeed exhort others unto prayer, but he went before them as the ringleader <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(351)</sup></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+17:11">Exodus 17:11</span>.) And it is not without cause that Paul doth so often make mention of his prayers, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:10">Romans 1:10</span>.) Again, we must always remember that, that we shall lose all our labor bestowed upon plowing, sowing, and watering, unless the increase come from heaven, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:7">1 Corinthians 3:7</span>.) Therefore, it shall not suffice to take great pains in teaching, unless we require the blessing at the hands of the Lord, that our labor may not be in vain and unfruitful. Hereby it appeareth that the exercise of prayer <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(352)</sup></span> is not in vain commended unto the ministers of the word. </p>
