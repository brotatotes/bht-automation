<p><b>11.</b><i>There came a famine.</i> Hereby it appeareth that the deliverance of Joseph was such a benefit as was common to all the family of Jacob. For, seeing the famine drew on, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(396)</sup></span> Joseph was sent before in due time to provide sustenance to feed the hungry; as he himself doth acknowledge the wonderful counsel of God in that point. Nevertheless, the free goodness of God appeareth plainly in the person of Joseph, whilst that he is appointed to nourish and feed his brethren, who had sold him, and by that means sent him far away, and thought that he was gone away quite <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(397)</sup></span> out of the world. He putteth meat in their mouths who had thrown him into a pit, and had deprived him of the air and the common breath. Finally, he nourisheth and preserveth their life who were not afraid <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(398)</sup></span> to take from him his life. In the mean season, Stephen putteth the Jews in mind of this, that the patriarchs were enforced to depart out of that land which was given them for an heritage, and that they died in another place. Therefore, forasmuch as they were sojourners in it, they are at length banished out of the same. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(399)</sup></span> </p>
