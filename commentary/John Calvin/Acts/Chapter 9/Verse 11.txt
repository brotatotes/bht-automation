<p><b>11.</b><i>For, behold, he prayeth.</i> Luke showeth that Paul gave himself <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(585)</sup></span> to prayer those three days; and peradventure this was one cause why he fasted, although it be certain, as I have already said, that he suffered such long hunger, because he was after a sort deprived of sense, as men which are in a trance use to be. Christ doth assuredly speak of no short prayer <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(586)</sup></span> in this place, but he doth rather show that Paul continued in this kind of exercise until he should be more quiet in mind. For besides other causes of terror, that voice might sound in his ears, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?” And it is not to be doubted but that the careful <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(587)</sup></span> looking for a perfect revelation did marvellously trouble his mind; but this was the reason why the Lord caused him to wait three days, that he might the more kindle in him an earnest desire to pray. </p>
