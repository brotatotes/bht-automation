18.There fell from his eyes as it had been scales. The blindness of Paul, as we have said before did not proceed from fear alone or from amazedness; but by this means was he admonished of his former blindness, that he might quite abandon that boldness and vain confidence wherewith he was puffed up. He boasted that he was taught at the feet of Gamaliel, (Acts 22:3;) and undoubtedly he thought very well of his great wittiness, (596) which was notwithstanding mere blindness. Therefore he is deprived of the sight of his body (597) three days, that he may begin to see with his mind; for those must become fools, whosoever they be, which seem to themselves wise, that they may attain to true wisdom. For seeing that Christ is the Sun of righteousness, in seeing without him we see not; it is he also which openeth the eyes of the mind. Both things were showed to Paul, and to us are they showed in his person; for he hath his eyes covered with scales, that, condemning all his knowledge of ignorance, (598) he may learn that he hath need of new light, which he hath hitherto wanted; and he is taught that he must let [seek] the true light from none other save only from Christ, and that it is given by no other means save only through his goodness. Furthermore, whereas being pined with three days hunger, he maketh no haste to receive meat until he be baptized, thereby appeareth the earnest (599) desire he had to learn, because he refreshed not his body with meat until his soul had received strength. (596) “Quin sibi multum placuerit in sua perspicacia,” but he was much pleased with his own perspicacity.” (597) “Oculis,” of his eyes, his bodily sight. (598) “Ut totum suum acumen ignorantiae damnans,” that confessing all his acuteness to be ignorance. (599) “Ferventissimum,” most fervent.
