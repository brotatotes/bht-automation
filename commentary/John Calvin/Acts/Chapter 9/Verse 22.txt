<p><b>22.</b><i>And Saul waxed stronger.</i> Luke doth not only in this place commend the bold zeal of Paul in confessing the faith of Christ, but also he telleth us that he had strong reasons to convince the Jews. He waxed strong, saith he, that is, he got the victory in disputation; his confession did carry with it great force and efficacy, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(603)</sup></span> because being furnished with testimonies of Scripture, and such other helps of the Holy Ghost, he did, as it were, tread all his adversaries under his feet. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(604)</sup></span> For the word confounded, which Luke useth, doth signify, that, forasmuch as Paul did urge them out of measure, they were so stricken that they could not tell where they were. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(605)</sup></span> The manner of the confounding is expressed, because Paul proved that Jesus was Christ. For the sense is this, that even when the Jews were most desirous to resist, they were overcome and <i>confounded.</i> So that Paul tried [found] by experience, that that was most true which he himself affirmeth, that the Scripture is profitable to convince, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:16">Titus 3:16</span>.) Also, he performed that which he required elsewhere of a bishop and teacher, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</span>;) for he was armed with the word of God to maintain the truth. And Luke setteth down two things, that Paul so got the victory in disputing that he overthrew the Jews; and yet their stubbornness was not broken and tamed that they yielded to the truth, because their consciences rage nevertheless inwardly, and being thrown down from their false opinion, they do not submit themselves to Christ. </p>
<p>Whence had Paul this victory, save only because the Scripture was his sword? Therefore, so often as heretics stand up to resist the true faith, so often as wicked men endeavor to overthrow all godliness, so often as the ungodly do obstinately resist, let us remember that we must fet [seek] armor hence. Because the Papists find no weapons in Scripture, yea, because they see that it maketh quite against them, they fly into this miserable fortress <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(606)</sup></span> that they must not dispute with heretics, and that there can no certain thing be set down out of Scripture. But if Satan himself be vanquished with the sword of the word, why shall it not be able to put heretics to flight? not that they will submit themselves, or make an end of murmuring, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(607)</sup></span> but because they shall lie overcome in themselves. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(608)</sup></span> And if so be it we covet to escape this trouble, let us raise no tumults against God, but let us, with a quiet and meek spirit, receive that peace which the Scripture offereth us. </p>
