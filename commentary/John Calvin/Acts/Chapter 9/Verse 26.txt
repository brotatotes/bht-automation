<p><b>26.</b><i>When Saul was.</i> These were yet hard entrances <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(617)</sup></span> for Paul, who was as yet but a freshwater soldier, in that, when he had hardly escaped the hands of the enemies, the disciples would not receive him. For he might have seemed to have been so tossed to and fro, as it were, in mockery, that he could have no resting place. All his own nation was set against him for Christ’s cause. The Christians refuse him. Might he not have been quite discouraged and out of hope as one expelled out of men’s company? First, what remaineth but that he fall away from the Church, seeing he is not received? But when he remembereth the life which he had led aforetime he marvelleth not that they are afraid <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(618)</sup></span> of him. Therefore, he doth patiently suffer the brethren to refuse his company, seeing they had just cause of fear. This was true conversion, that whereas he raged horribly before, he doth now valiantly suffer the storms of persecutions; and, in the mean season, when as he cannot be admitted into the company of the godly, he waiteth with a quiet mind until God reconcile them unto him. We must diligently note what he desireth, to wit, that he may be numbered amongst the disciples of Christ. This can he not obtain. Here is no ambition, but he was to be instructed by this means to make more account even of the lowest place amongst the disciples of Christ than of all masterships in corrupt and revolted <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(619)</sup></span> synagogues, And from this submission was he exalted unto the highest degree of honor, that he might be the principal doctor of the Church, even unto the end of the world. But no man is fit to be a teacher in the Church save only he who willingly submitteth himself, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(620)</sup></span> that he may be a fellow disciple with other men. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(617)</span> “<blu>Dura et aspera Paulo adhuc tironi rudimenta haec fuerunt</blu>,” this was rough and harsh training for Paul, who was as yet a tyro. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(618)</span> “<blu>Se horrori esse</blu>,” that he is a terror to them. </p>
