<p><b>7.</b><i>And the men.</i> He speaketh now briefly of the companions of Paul, that they were witnesses of the vision. Yet it seemeth that this narration doth not in all points agree with that of Paul, which we shall see in the 22<sup>nd</sup> chapter, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:9">Acts 22:9</span>.) For he will say there, that his companions were terrified with the light, but they heard no voice. Some there be who think that it was a fault, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(577)</sup></span> and that through ignorance of the writer <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(578)</sup></span> the negation is placed out of its right place. I think that it is no hard matter to answer it; because it may be that they heard the sound of the voice, yet did they not discern either who it was that spake, or what was spoken. “They heard not,” saith he, “the voice of him that spake with me.” Surely this is the meaning of these words, that he alone knew the speech of Christ. It followeth not thereupon, but that the rest might have heard a dark and doubtful voice. Whereas Luke saith in this place that there was a voice heard, and no man seen, his meaning is, that the voice proceeded from no man, but that it was uttered by God. Therefore, to the end the miracle may carry the greater credit, Paul’s companions see a light like to lightning; they see Paul lie prostrate; a voice they hear (though not distinctly <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(579)</sup></span>) sounding from heaven; and yet, nevertheless, Paul alone is taught what he must do. </p>
