<p><b>8.</b><i>He was raised up from the earth.</i> Luke addeth now, that he was taken with so great fear that he could not rise of himself; and not that only, but he was also blind for a time, that he might forget his former wit and wiliness. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(580)</sup></span> When as he saith, that <i>after that his eyes were opened, he saw not,</i> it seemeth that it doth not agree with the other words which shall follow by and by, that his eyes were covered, as it were, with scales; but the meaning of this place is, that he was blind indeed, and deprived of his sight for that three days; because when he opened his eyes he saw nothing. </p>
