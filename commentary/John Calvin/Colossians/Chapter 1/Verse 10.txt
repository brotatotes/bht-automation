<p><b>10.</b><i>That ye may walk worthy of God.</i> In the <i>first</i> place he teaches, what is the end of <i>spiritual understanding</i>, and for what purpose we ought to make proficiency in God’s school — that we may <i>walk worthy of God</i>, that is, that it may be manifest in our life, that we have not in vain been taught by God. Whoever they may be that do not direct their endeavors towards this object, may possibly toil and labor much, but they do nothing better than wander about in endless windings, without making any progress. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(289)</sup></span> Farther, he admonishes us, that if we would <i>walk worthy of God</i>, we must above all things take heed that we regulate our whole course of life according to the will of God, renouncing our own understanding, and bidding farewell to all the inclinations of our flesh. </p>
<p>This also he again confirms by saying — <i>unto all obedience</i>, or, as they commonly say, <i>well-pleasing</i>. Hence if it is asked, what kind of life is <i>worthy of God</i>, let us always keep in view this definition of Paul — that it is such a life as, leaving the opinions of men, and leaving, in short, all carnal inclination, is regulated so as to be in subjection to God alone. From this follow good works, which are the fruits that God requires from us. </p>
<p><i>Increasing, in the knowledge of God.</i> He again repeats, that they have not arrived at such perfection as not to stand in need of farther increase; by which admonition he prepares them, and as it were leads them by the hand, to an eagerness for proficiency, that they may shew themselves ready to listen, and teachable. What is here said to the Colossians, let all believers take as said to themselves, and draw from this a common exhortation that we must always make progress in the doctrine of piety until death. </p>
