<p><b>11.</b><i>Strengthened with all might.</i> As he has previously prayed that they might have both a sound understanding and the right use of it, so also now he prays that they may have courage and constancy. In this manner he puts them in mind of their own weakness, for he says, that they will not be strong otherwise than by the Lord’s help; and not only so, but with the view of magnifying this exercise of grace the more, he adds, <i>according to his glorious power.</i> “So far from any one being able to stand, through dependence on his own strength, the power of God shews itself illustriously in helping our infirmity.” Lastly, he shews in what it is that the strength of believers ought to display itself — <i>in all patience and long-suffering.</i> For they are constantly, while in this world, exercised with the cross, and a thousand temptations daily present themselves, so as to weigh them down, and they see nothing of what God has promised. They must, therefore, arm themselves with an admirable patience, that what Isaiah says may be accomplished, </p>
<p>In hope and in silence shall be your strength. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(290)</sup></span> <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+30:15">Isaiah 30:15</span>.) </p>
<p>It is preferable to connect with this sentence the clause, <i>with joy</i>. For although the other reading is more commonly to be met with in the Latin versions, <i>this</i> is more in accordance with the Greek manuscripts, and, unquestionably, patience is not sustained otherwise than by alacrity of mind, and will never be maintained with fortitude by any one that is not satisfied with his condition. </p>
