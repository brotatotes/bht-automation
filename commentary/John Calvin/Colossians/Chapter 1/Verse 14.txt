<p><b>14.</b><i>In whom we have redemption.</i> He now proceeds to set forth in order, that all parts of our salvation are contained in Christ, and that he alone ought to shine forth, and to be seen conspicuous above all creatures, inasmuch as he is the beginning and end of all things. In the <i>first</i> place, he says that we have <i>redemption</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(300)</sup></span> and immediately explains it as meaning the <i>remission of sins</i>; for these two things agree together by <i>apposition</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(301)</sup></span> For, unquestionably, when God remits our transgressions, he exempts us from condemnation to eternal death. This is our liberty, this our glorying in the face of death — that our sins are not imputed to us. He says that this redemption was procured through the <i>blood of Christ</i>, for by the sacrifice of his death all the sins of the world have been expiated. Let us, therefore, bear in mind, that this is the sole price of reconciliation, and that all the trifling of Papists as to satisfactions is blasphemy. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(302)</sup></span> </p>
