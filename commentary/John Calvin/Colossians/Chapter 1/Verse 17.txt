<p><b>17.</b><i>All things were created by him, and for him.</i> He places angels in subjection to Christ, that they may not obscure his glory, for <i>four</i> reasons: In the <i>first</i> place, because they were <i>created by him</i>; <i>secondly</i>, because their creation ought to be viewed as having a relation <i>to</i> him, as their legitimate end; <i>thirdly</i>, because he himself existed always, prior to their creation; <i>fourthly</i>, because he sustains them by his power, and upholds them in their condition. At the same time, he does not affirm this merely as to angels, but also as to the whole world. Thus he places the Son of God in the Highest seat of honor, that he may have the <i>pre-eminence</i> over angels as well as men, and may bring under control all creatures in heaven and in earth. </p>
