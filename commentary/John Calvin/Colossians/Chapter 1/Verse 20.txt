<p><b>20.</b><i>And by him to reconcile all things to himself.</i> This, also, is a magnificent commendation of Christ, that we cannot be joined to God otherwise than through him. In the first place, let us consider that our happiness consists in our cleaving to God, and that, on the other hand, there is nothing more miserable than to be alienated from him. He declares, accordingly, that we are blessed through Christ alone, inasmuch as he is the bond of our connection with God, and, on the other hand, that, apart from him, we are most miserable, because we are shut out from God. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(311)</sup></span> Let us, however, bear in mind, that what he ascribes to Christ belongs peculiarly to him, that no portion of this praise may be transferred to any other. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(312)</sup></span> Hence we must consider the contrasts to these things to be understood — that if this is Christ’s prerogative, it does not belong to others. For of set purpose he disputes against those who imagined that the angels were pacificators, through whom access to God might be opened up. </p>
<p><i>Making peace through the blood of his cross.</i> He speaks of the Father, — that he has been made propitious to his creatures by the blood of Christ. Now he calls it the <i>blood of the cross</i>, inasmuch as it was the pledge and price of the making up of our peace with God, because it was poured out upon the cross. For it was necessary that the Son of God should be an expiatory victim, and endure the punishment of sin, that we might be <i>the righteousness of God in him</i>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>.) The <i>blood of the cross,</i> therefore, means the blood of the sacrifice which was offered upon the cross for appeasing the anger of God. </p>
<p>In adding <i>by him,</i> he did not mean to express anything new, but to express more distinctly what he had previously stated, and to impress it still more deeply on their minds — that Christ alone is the author of reconciliation, as to exclude all other means. For there is no other that has been crucified for us. Hence it is he alone, by whom and for whose sake we have God propitious to us. </p>
<p><i>Both upon earth and in heaven.</i> If you are inclined to understand this as referring merely to rational creatures, it will mean, men and angels. There were, it is true, no absurdity in extending it to all without exception; but that I may not be under the necessity of philosophizing with too much subtlety, I prefer to understand it as referring to angels and men; and as to the latter, there is no difficulty as to their having need of a peace maker in the sight of God. As to angels, however, there is a question not easy of solution. For what occasion is there for reconciliation, where there is no discord or hatred? Many, influenced by this consideration, have explained the passage before us in this manner — that angels have been brought into agreement with men, and that by this means heavenly creatures have been restored to favor with earthly creatures. Another meaning, however, is conveyed by Paul’s words, <i>that God hath reconciled to himself</i>. That explanation, therefore, is forced. </p>
<p>It remains, that we see what is the reconciliation of angels and men. I say that men have been reconciled to God, because they were previously alienated from him by sin, and because they would have had him as a Judge to their ruin, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(313)</sup></span> had not the grace of the Mediator interposed for appeasing his anger. Hence the nature of the peace making between God and men was this, that enmities have been abolished through Christ, and thus God becomes a Father instead of a Judge. </p>
<p>Between God and angels the state of matters is very different, for there was <i>there</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(314)</sup></span> no revolt, no sin, and consequently no separation. It was, however, necessary that angels, also, should be made to be at peace with God, for, being creatures, they were not beyond the risk of falling, had they not been confirmed by the grace of Christ. This, however, is of no small importance for the perpetuity of peace with God, to have a fixed standing in righteousness, so as to have no longer any fear of fall or revolt. Farther, in that very obedience which they render to God, there is not such absolute perfection as to give satisfaction to God in every respect, and without the need of pardon. And this beyond all doubt is what is meant by that statement in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="job+4:18">Job 4:18</span>, He <i>will find iniquity in his angels</i>. For if it is explained as referring to the devil, what mighty thing were it? But the Spirit declares there, that the greatest purity is vile, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(315)</sup></span> if it is brought into comparison with the righteousness of God. We must, therefore, conclude, that there is not on the part of angels so much of righteousness as would suffice for their being fully joined with God. They have, therefore, need of a peace maker, through whose grace they may wholly cleave to God. Hence it is with propriety that Paul declares, that the grace of Christ does not reside among mankind alone, and on the other hand makes it common also to angels. Nor is there any injustice done to angels, in sending them to a Mediator, that they may, through his kindness, have a well grounded peace with God. </p>
<p>Should any one, on the pretext of the universality of the expression, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(316)</sup></span> move a question in reference to devils, whether Christ be their peace maker also? I answer, No, not even of wicked men: though I confess that there is a difference, inasmuch as the benefit of redemption is offered to the latter, but not to the former. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(317)</sup></span> This, however, has nothing to do with Paul’s words, which include nothing else than this, that it is through Christ alone, that, all creatures, who have any connection at all with God, cleave to him. </p>
