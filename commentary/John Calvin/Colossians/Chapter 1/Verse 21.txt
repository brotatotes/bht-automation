<p><b>21.</b><i>And whereas ye were formerly.</i> The general doctrine which he had set forth he now applies particularly to them, that they may feel that they are guilty of very great ingratitude, if they allow themselves to be drawn away from Christ to new inventions. And this arrangement must be carefully observed, because the particular application of a doctrine, so to speak, affects the mind more powerfully. Farther, he leads their views to experience, that they may recognize in themselves the benefit of that redemption of which he had made mention. “You are yourselves a sample <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(318)</sup></span> of that grace which I declare to have been offered to mankind through Christ. For ye were <i>alienated</i>, that is, from God. Ye were <i>enemies</i>; now ye are received into favor: whence comes this? It is because God, being appeased by the death of Christ, has become reconciled to you.” At the same time, there is in this statement a change of person, for what he has previously declared as to the Father, he now affirms respecting Christ; for we must necessarily explain it thus, in <i>the body of</i> HIS <i>flesh</i> </p>
<p>The term <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">διανοίας</span></blu></grk> (thought) I explain, as employed by way of amplification, as though he had said, that they were altogether, and in the whole of their mental system, <i>alienated from God</i>, that no one may imagine, after the manner of philosophers, that the alienation is merely in a particular part, as Popish theologians restrict it to the lower appetites. “Nay,” says Paul, “what made you odious to God, had taken possession of your whole mind.” In fine, he meant to intimate, that man, whatever he may be, is wholly at variance with God, and is an enemy to him. The old interpreter renders it (<blu><i>sensum</i></blu> ) <i>sense</i>. Erasmus renders it <blu><i>mentem</i></blu> , (<i>mind</i>.) I have made use of the term <blu><i>cogitationis</i></blu> , to denote what the French call intention. For such is the force of the Greek word, and Paul’s meaning requires that it should be rendered so. </p>
<p>Farther, while the term <i>enemies</i> has a passive as well as active signification, it is well suited to us in both respects, so long as we are apart from Christ. For we are born children of wrath, and every thought of the flesh is enmity against God. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:7">Romans 8:7</span>.) </p>
<p><i>In wicked works.</i> He shews from its effects the inward hatred which lies hid in the heart. For as mankind endeavor to free themselves from all blame, until they have been openly convicted, God shews them their impiety by outward works, as is more amply treated of in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:19">Romans 1:19</span>. Farther, what is told us here as to the Colossians, is applicable to us also, for we differ nothing in respect of nature. There is only this difference, that some are called from their mother’s womb, whose malice God anticipates, so as to prevent them from breaking forth into open fruits, while others, after having wandered during a great part of their life, are brought back to the fold. We all, however, stand in need of Christ as our peace maker, because we are the slaves of sin, and where sin is, there is enmity between God and men. </p>
