<p><b>23.</b><i>If ye continue.</i> Here we have an exhortation to perseverance, by which he admonishes them that all the grace that had been conferred upon them hitherto would be vain, unless they persevered in the purity of the gospel. And thus he intimates, that they are still only making progress, and have not yet reached the goal. For the stability of their faith was at that time exposed to danger through the stratagems of the false apostles. Now he paints in lively colors assurance of faith when he bids the Colossians be <i>grounded and settled</i> in it. For faith is not like mere opinion, which is shaken by various movements, but has a firm steadfastness, which can withstand all the machinations of hell. Hence the whole system of Popish theology will never afford even the slightest taste of true faith, which holds it as a settled point, that we must always be in doubt respecting the present state of grace, as well as respecting final perseverance. He afterwards takes notice also of a relationship <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(321)</sup></span> which subsists between faith and the gospel, when he says that the Colossians will be <i>settled</i> in the faith only in the event of their not falling back from the <i>hope of the gospel</i>; that is, the hope which shines forth upon us through means of the gospel, for where the gospel is, <i>there</i> is the hope of everlasting salvation. Let us, however, bear in mind, that the sum of all is contained in Christ. Hence he enjoins it upon them here to shun all doctrines which lead away from Christ, so that the minds of men are otherwise occupied. </p>
<p><i>Which ye have heard.</i> As the false apostles themselves, who tear and rend Christ in pieces, are accustomed proudly to glory in the name of the gospel, and as it is a common artifice of Satan to trouble men’s consciences under a false pretext of the gospel, that the truth of the gospel may be brought into confusion, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(322)</sup></span> Paul, on this account, expressly declares, that <i>that</i> was the genuine, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(323)</sup></span> <i>that</i> the undoubted gospel, which the Colossians had heard, namely, from Epaphras, that they might not lend an ear to doctrines at variance with it. He adds, besides, a confirmation of it, that it is the very same as was preached over the whole world. It is, I say, no ordinary confirmation when they hear that they have the whole Church agreeing with them, and that they follow no other doctrine than what the Apostles had alike taught and was everywhere received. </p>
<p>It is, however, a ridiculous boasting of Papists, in respect of their impugning our doctrine by this argument, that it is not preached everywhere with approbation and applause, inasmuch as we have few that assent to it. For though they should burst, they will never deprive us of this — that we at this day teach nothing but what was preached of old by Prophets and Apostles, and is obediently received by the whole band of saints. For Paul did not mean that the gospel should be approved of by the consent of all ages <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(324)</sup></span> in such a way that, if it were rejected, its authority would be shaken. He had, on the contrary, an eye to that commandment of Christ, </p>
<p>Go, preach the gospel to every creature; (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15">Mark 16:15</span>;) </p>
<p>which commandment depends on so many predictions of the Prophets, foretelling that the kingdom of Christ would be spread over the whole world. What else then does Paul mean by these words than that the Colossians had also been watered by those <i>living streams</i>, which, <i>springing forth from Jerusalem</i>, were to flow out through the whole world? (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:8">Zechariah 14:8</span>.) </p>
<p>We also do not glory in vain, or without remarkable fruit and consolation, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(325)</sup></span> that we have the same gospel, which is preached among all nations by the commandment of the Lord, which is received by all the Churches, and in the profession of which all pious persons have lived and died. It is also no common help for fortifying us against so many assaults, that we have the consent of the whole Church — such, I mean, as is worthy of so distinguished a title. We also cordially subscribe to the views of Augustine, who refutes the Donatists <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(326)</sup></span> by this argument particularly, that they bring forward a gospel that is in all the Churches unheard of and unknown. This truly is said on good grounds, for if it is a true gospel that is brought forward, while not ratified by any approbation on the part of the Church, it follows, that vain and false are the many promises in which it is predicted that the preaching of the gospel will be carried through the whole world, and which declare that the <i>sons of God shall be gathered from all nations and countries, etc.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ho+1:10">Hosea 1:10</span>.) But what do Papists do? Having bid farewell to Prophets and Apostles, and passing by the ancient Church, they would have their revolt from the gospel be looked upon as the consent of the universal Church. Where is the resemblance? Hence, when there is a dispute as to the consent of the Church, let us return to the Apostles and their preaching, as Paul does here. Farther, lest any one should explain too rigidly the term denoting universality, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(327)</sup></span> Paul means simply, that it had been preached everywhere far and wide. </p>
<p><i>Of which I am made.</i> He speaks also of himself personally, and this was very necessary, for we must always take care, that we do not rashly intrude ourselves into the office of teaching. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(328)</sup></span> He accordingly declares, that this office was appointed him, that he may secure for himself right and authority. And, indeed, he so connects his apostleship with their faith, that they may not have it in their power to reject his doctrine otherwise than by abandoning the gospel which they had embraced. </p>
