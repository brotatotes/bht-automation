<p><b>24.</b><i>I now rejoice.</i> He has previously claimed for himself authority on the ground of his calling. Now, however, he provides against the honor of his apostleship being detracted from by the bonds and persecutions, which he endured for the sake of the gospel. For Satan, also, perversely turns these things into occasions of rendering the servants of God the more contemptible. Farther, he encourages them by his example not to be intimidated by persecutions, and he sets forth to their view his zeal, that he may have greater weight. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(329)</sup></span> Nay more, he gives proof of his affection towards them by no common pledge, when he declares that he willingly bears for their sake the afflictions which he endures. “But whence,” some one will ask, “arises this <i>joy</i> ?” From his seeing the fruit that springs from it. “The affliction that I endure on your account is pleasant to me, because I do not suffer it in vain.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(330)</sup></span> In the same manner, in his First Epistle to the Thessalonians, he says, that he <i>rejoiced in all necessities and afflictions</i>, on the ground of what he had heard as to their faith. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:6">1 Thessalonians 3:6</span>.) </p>
<p><i>And fill up what is wanting.</i> The particle <i>and</i> I understand as meaning <i>for</i>, for he assigns a reason why he is joyful in his sufferings, because he is in this thing a partner with Christ, and nothing happier can be desired than this partnership. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(331)</sup></span> He also brings forward a consolation common to all the pious, that in all tribulations, especially in so far as they suffer anything for the sake of the gospel, they are partakers of the cross of Christ, that they may enjoy fellowship with him in a blessed resurrection. </p>
<p>Nay more, he declares that there is thus <i>filled up what is wanting in the affliction of Christ.</i> For as he speaks in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>, </p>
<p>Whom God elected, he also hath predestinated to be conformed to the image of Christ, that he may be the first-born among the brethren. </p>
<p>Farther, we know that there is so great a unity between Christ and his members, that the name of <i>Christ</i> sometimes includes the whole body, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:12">1 Corinthians 12:12</span>, for while discoursing there respecting the Church, he comes at length to the conclusion, that in Christ the same thing holds as in the human body. As, therefore, Christ has suffered <i>once</i> in his own person, so he suffers <i>daily</i> in his members, and in this way there are <i>filled up</i> those sufferings which the Father hath appointed for his body by his decree. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(332)</sup></span> Here we have a <i>second</i> consideration, which ought to bear up our minds and comfort them in afflictions, that it is thus fixed and determined by the providence of God, that we must be conformed to Christ in the endurance of the cross, and that the fellowship that we have with him extends to this also. </p>
<p>He adds, also, a <i>third</i> reason — that his sufferings are advantageous, and that not merely to a few, but to the whole Church. He had previously stated that he suffered in behalf of the Colossians, and he now declares still farther, that the advantage extends to the whole Church. This advantage has been spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+1:12">Philippians 1:12</span>. What could be clearer, less forced, or more simple, than this exposition, that Paul is joyful in persecution, because he considers, in accordance with what he writes elsewhere, that we must </p>
<p>carry about with us in our body the mortification of Christ, that his life may be manifested in us? (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:10">2 Corinthians 4:10</span>.) </p>
<p>He says also in Timothy, </p>
<p>If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him: if we die with him, we shall also live with him, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:11">2 Timothy 2:11</span>) </p>
<p>and thus the issue will be blessed and glorious. <i>Farther</i>, he considers that we must not refuse the condition which God has appointed for his Church, that the members of Christ may have a suitable correspondence with the head; and, <i>thirdly</i>, that afflictions must be cheerfully endured, inasmuch as they are profitable to all the pious, and promote the welfare of the whole Church, by adorning the doctrine of the gospel. </p>
<p>Papists, however, disregarding and setting aside all these things, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(333)</sup></span> have struck out a new contrivance in order that they may establish their system of indulgences. They give the name of <i>indulgences</i> to a remission of punishments, obtained by us through the merits of the martyrs. For, as they deny that there is a gratuitous remission of sins, and allege that they are redeemed by <i>satisfactory</i> deeds, when the <i>satisfactions</i> do not fill up the right measure, they call into their help the blood of the martyrs, that it may, along with the blood of Christ, serve as an expiation in the judgment of God. And this mixture they call the <i>treasure of the Church</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(334)</sup></span>, the keys of which they afterwards intrust to whom they think fit. Nor are they ashamed to wrest this passage, with the view of supporting so execrable a blasphemy, as if Paul here affirmed that his sufferings are of avail for expiating the sins of men. </p>
<p>They urge in their support the term <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑστερήματα</span></blu></grk>, (<i>things wanting</i>,) as if Paul meant to say, that the sufferings which Christ has endured for the redemption of men were insufficient. There is no one, however, that does not see that Paul speaks in this manner, because it is necessary, that by the afflictions of the pious, the body of the Church should be brought to its perfection, inasmuch as the members are conformed to their head. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(335)</sup></span> I should also be afraid of being suspected of calumny in repeating things so monstrous, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(336)</sup></span> if their books did not bear witness that I impute nothing to them groundlessly. They urge, also, what Paul says, that he suffers <i>for</i> the Church. It is surprising that this refined interpretation had not occurred to any of the ancients, for they all interpret it as we do, to mean, that the saints suffer <i>for</i> the Church, inasmuch as they confirm the faith of the Church. Papists, however, gather from this that the saints are redeemers, because they shed their blood for the expiation of sins. That my readers, however, may perceive more clearly their impudence, allow that the martyrs, as well as Christ, <i>suffered for</i> the Church, but in different ways, as I am inclined to express in Augustine’s words rather than in my own. For he writes thus in his 84<sup>th</sup> treatise on John: “Though we brethren die for brethren, yet there is no blood of any martyr that is poured out for the remission of sins. This Christ did for us. Nor has he in this conferred upon us matter of imitation, but ground of thanksgiving.” Also, in the fourth book to Bonifacius: “As the only Son of God became the Son of man, that he might make us sons of God, so he has alone, without offense, endured punishment for us, that we may through him, without merit, obtain undeserved favor.” Similar to these is the statement of Leo Bishop of Rome; “The righteous <i>received</i> crowns, did not give them; and for the fortitude of believers there have come forth <i>examples of patience</i>, <i>not gifts of righteousness</i>. For their deaths were for themselves, and no one by his latter end paid the debt of another.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(337)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Now, that this is the meaning of Paul’s words is abundantly manifest from the context, for he adds, that he suffers <i>according to the dispensation that was given to him.</i> And we know that the ministry was committed to him, not of <i>redeeming</i> the Church, but of <i>edifying</i> it; and he himself immediately afterwards expressly acknowledges this. This is also what he writes to Timothy, </p>
<p>that he endures all things for the sake of the elect, that they may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus. <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:10">2 Timothy 2:10</span>.) </p>
<p>Also, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:4">2 Corinthians 1:4</span>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(338)</sup></span> that </p>
<p>he willingly endures all things for their consolation and salvation. </p>
<p>Let, therefore, pious readers learn to hate and detest those profane sophists, who thus deliberately corrupt and adulterate the Scriptures, in order that they may give some color to their delusions. </p>
