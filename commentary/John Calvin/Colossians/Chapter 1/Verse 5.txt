<p><b>5.</b><i>For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven.</i> For the <i>hope</i> of eternal life will never be inactive in us, so as not to produce <i>love</i> in us. For it is of necessity, that the man who is fully persuaded that a treasure of life is laid up for him in heaven will aspire thither, looking down upon this world. Meditation, however, upon the heavenly life stirs up our affections both to the worship of God, and to exercises of love. The Sophists pervert this passage for the purpose of extolling the merits of works, as if the hope of salvation depended on works. The reasoning, however, is futile. For it does not follow, that because hope stimulates us to aim at upright living, it is therefore founded upon works, inasmuch as nothing is more efficacious for this purpose than God’s unmerited goodness, which utterly overthrows all confidence in works. </p>
<p>There is, however, an instance of <i>metonymy</i> in the use of the term <i>hope,</i> as it is taken for the thing hoped for. For the hope that is in our hearts is the glory which we hope for in heaven. At the same time, when he says, that there is a <i>hope</i> that is <i>laid up for us in heaven</i>, he means, that believers ought to feel assured as to the promise of eternal felicity, equally as though they had already a treasure laid up <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(280)</sup></span> in a particular place. </p>
<p><i>Of which ye heard before.</i> As eternal salvation is a thing that surpasses the comprehension of our understanding, he therefore adds, that the assurance of it had been brought to the Colossians by means of the gospel; and at the same time he says in the outset, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(281)</sup></span> that he is not to bring forward anything new, but that he has merely in view to confirm them in the doctrine which they had previously received. Erasmus has rendered — <i>it the true word of the gospel</i>. I am also well aware that, according to the Hebrew idiom, the genitive is often made use of by Paul in place of an epithet; but the words of Paul here are more emphatic. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(282)</sup></span> For he calls the gospel, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καψ ἐξοχήν</span></blu></grk>, (<i>by way of eminence</i>,) <i>the word of truth</i>, with the view of putting honor upon it, that they may more steadfastly and firmly adhere to the revelation which they have derived from that source. Thus the term <i>gospel</i> is introduced by way of <i>apposition</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(283)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(280)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Vn tresor en seure garde</span></blu>;” — “A treasure in safe keeping.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(281)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Il dit auant que passer plus outre</span></blu>;” — “He says before proceeding farther.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(282)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Ont yci plus grande signifiance, et emportent plus</span></blu>;” — “Have here more significancy, and are more emphatic.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(283)</span> The term <i>apposition</i>, in grammar, signifies the putting of two nouns in the same case. — Ed. </p>
