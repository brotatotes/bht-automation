<p><i>Love in the Spirit</i> I take to mean, <i>spiritual love</i>, according to the view of Chrysostom, with whom, however, I do not agree in the interpretation of the preceding words. Now, <i>spiritual love</i> is of such a nature as has no view to the world, but is consecrated to the service of piety, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(286)</sup></span> and has, as it were, an internal root, while carnal friendships depend on external causes. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(286)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Mais est commencee et comme consacree a l’adueu de la piete et cognoissance de Dieu</span></blu>;” — “But is commenced and, as it were, consecrated to the service of piety and the knowledge of God.” </p>
