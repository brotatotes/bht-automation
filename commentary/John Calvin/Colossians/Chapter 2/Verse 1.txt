<p><b>1.</b><i>I would have you know.</i> He declares his affection towards them, that he may have more credit and authority; for we readily believe those whom we know to be desirous of our welfare. It is also an evidence of no ordinary affection, that he was concerned about them in the midst of death, that is, when he was in danger of his life; and that he may express the more emphatically the intensity of his affection and concern, he calls it a <i>conflict</i>. I do not find fault with the rendering of Erasmus — <i>anxiety</i>; but, at the same time, the force of the Greek word is to be noticed, for <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀγών</span></blu></grk> is made use of to denote <i>contention</i>. By the same proof he confirms his statement, that his ministry is directed to them; for whence springs so anxious a concern as to their welfare, but from this, that the Apostle of the Gentiles was under obligation to embrace in his affection and concern even those who were unknown to him? As, however, there is commonly no love between those who are unknown to each other, he speaks slightingly of the acquaintance that is contracted from sight, when he says, <i>as many as have not seen my face in the flesh</i>; for there is among the servants of God a sight different from that of the flesh, which excites love. As it is almost universally agreed that the First Epistle to Timothy was written from Laodicea, some, on this account, assign to Galatia that Laodicea of which Paul makes mention here, while the other was the metropolis of Phrygia Pacatiana. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(345)</sup></span> It seems to me, however, to be more probable that that inscription is incorrect, as will be noticed in its proper place. </p>
