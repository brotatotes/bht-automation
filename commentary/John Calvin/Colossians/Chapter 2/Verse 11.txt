<p><b>11.</b><i>In whom ye also are circumcised.</i> From this it appears, that he has a controversy with the false apostles, who mixed the law with the gospel, and by that means made Christ have, as it were, two faces. He specifies, however, one instance by way of example. He proves that the circumcision of Moses is not merely unnecessary, but is opposed to Christ, because it destroys the spiritual <i>circumcision of Christ</i>. For circumcision was given to the Fathers that it might be the figure of a thing that was absent: those, therefore, who retain that figure after Christ’s advent, deny the accomplishment of what it prefigures. Let us, therefore, bear in mind that outward <i>circumcision</i> is here compared with spiritual, just as a figure with the reality. The figure is of a thing that is absent: hence it puts away the presence of the reality. What Paul contends for is this — that, inasmuch as what was shadowed forth by a <i>circumcision made with hands</i>, has been completed in Christ, there is now no fruit or advantage from it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(371)</sup></span> Hence he says, that the circumcision which is made in the heart is the <i>circumcision of Christ</i>, and that, on this account, that which is outward is not now required, because, where the reality exists, that shadowy emblem vanishes, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(372)</sup></span> inasmuch as it has no place except in the absence of the reality. </p>
<p><i>By the putting off of the body.</i> He employs the term <i>body</i>, by an elegant metaphor, to denote a mass, made up of all vices. For as we are encompassed by our bodies, so we are surrounded on all sides by an accumulation of vices. And as the body is composed of various members, each of which has its own actings and offices, so from that accumulation of corruption all sins take their rise as members of the entire body. There is a similar manner of expression in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:13">Romans 6:13</span>. </p>
<p>He takes the term <i>flesh</i>, as he is wont, to denote corrupt nature. The <i>body of the sins of the flesh</i>, therefore, is the <i>old man with his deeds</i>; only, there is a difference in the manner of expression, for here he expresses more properly the mass of vices which proceed from corrupt nature. He says that we obtain this <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(373)</sup></span> through Christ, so that unquestionably an entire regeneration is his benefit. It is he that circumcises the foreskin of our heart, or, in other words, mortifies all the lusts of the flesh, not with the <i>hand</i>, but by his Spirit. Hence there is in him the reality of the figure. </p>
