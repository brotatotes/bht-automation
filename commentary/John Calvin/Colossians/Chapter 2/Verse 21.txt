<p><b>21.</b><i>Eat not, taste not.</i> Hitherto this has been rendered — <i>Handle not</i>, but as another word immediately follows, which signifies the same thing, every one sees how cold and absurd were such a repetition. Farther, the verb <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἅπτεσθαι</span></blu></grk> is employed by the Greeks, among its other significations, in the sense of <i>eating</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(417)</sup></span> in accordance with the rendering that I have given. Plutarch makes use of it in the life of Caesar, when he relates that his soldiers, in destitution of all things, <i>ate</i> animals which they had not been accustomed previously to use as food. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(418)</sup></span> And this arrangement is both in other respects natural and is also most in accordance with the connection of the passage; for Paul points out, (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">μιμητικῶς</span></blu></grk>,) <i>by way of imitation</i>, to what length the waywardness of those who bind consciences by their laws is wont to proceed. From the very commencement they are unduly rigorous: hence he sets out with their prohibition — not simply against eating, but even against slightly partaking. After they have obtained what they wish they go beyond that command, so that they afterwards declare it to be unlawful to taste of what they do not wish should be eaten. At length they make it criminal even to <i>touch</i>. In short, when persons have once taken upon them to tyrannize over men’s souls, there is no end of new laws being daily added to old ones, and new enactments starting up from time to time. How bright a mirror there is as to this in Popery! Hence Paul acts admirably well in admonishing us that human traditions are a labyrinth, in which consciences are more and more entangled; nay more, are snares, which from the beginning bind in such a way that in course of time they strangle in the end. </p>
