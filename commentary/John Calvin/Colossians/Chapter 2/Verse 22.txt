<p><b>22.</b><i>All which things tend to corruption.</i> He sets aside, by a twofold argument, the enactments of which he has made mention — because they make religion consist in things outward and frail, which have no connection with the spiritual kingdom of God; and secondly, because they are from men, not from God. He combats the first argument, also, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>, when he says, </p>
<p>The kingdom of God is not in meat and drink; </p>
<p>likewise in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:13">1 Corinthians 6:13</span>, </p>
<p>Meat for the belly, and the belly for meats: God will destroy both. </p>
<p>Christ also himself says, </p>
<p>Whatever entereth into the mouth defileth not the man, because it goes down into the belly, and is cast forth.<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:11">Matthew 15:11</span>.) </p>
<p>The sum is this — that the worship of God, true piety, and the holiness of Christians, do not consist in drink, and food, and clothing, which are things that are transient and liable to corruption, and perish by abuse. For abuse is properly applicable to those things which are corrupted by the use of them. Hence enactments are of no value in reference to those things which tend to excite scruples of conscience. But in Popery you would scarcely find any other holiness, than what consists in little observances of corruptible things. </p>
<p>A <i>second</i> refutation is added <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(419)</sup></span> — that they originated with men, and have not God as their Author; and by this thunderbolt he prostrates and swallows up all traditions of men. For why? This is Paul’s reasoning: “Those who bring consciences into bondage do injury to Christ, and make void his death. For whatever is of human invention does not bind conscience.” </p>
