<p><b>3.</b><i>In whom are all the treasures.</i> The expression <blu><i>in quo</i></blu> (<i>in whom</i>, or <i>in which</i>) may either have a reference collectively to everything he has said as to the <i>acknowledgment of the mystery</i>, or it may relate simply to what came immediately before, namely, <i>Christ</i>. While there is not much difference between the one or the other, I rather prefer the <i>latter</i> view, and it is the one that is more generally received. The meaning, therefore, is, that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid in Christ â€” by which he means, that we are perfect in wisdom if we truly know Christ, so that it is madness to wish to know anything besides Him. For since the Father has manifested himself wholly in Him, that man wishes to be wise apart from God, who is not contented with Christ alone. Should any one choose to interpret it as referring to the <i>mystery,</i> the meaning will be, that all the wisdom of the pious is included in the gospel, by means of which God is revealed to us in his Son. </p>
<p>He says, however, that the <i>treasures are hidden</i>, because they are not seen glittering with great splendor, but do rather, as it were, lie hid under the contemptible abasement and simplicity of the cross. For the <i>preaching of the cross</i> is always <i>foolishness to the world</i>, as we found stated in <i>Corinthians</i>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18">1 Corinthians 1:18</span>.) I do not reckon that there is any great difference between <i>wisdom</i> and <i>understanding</i> in this passage, for the employment of two different terms serves only to give additional strength, as though he had said, that no knowledge, erudition, learning, wisdom, can be found elsewhere. </p>
