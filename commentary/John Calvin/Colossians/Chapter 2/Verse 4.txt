<p><b>4.</b><i>This I say, that no man may deceive you.</i> As the contrivances of men have (as we shall afterwards see) an appearance of wisdom, the minds of the pious ought to be preoccupied with this persuasion — that the knowledge of Christ is of itself amply sufficient. And, unquestionably, this is the key that can close the door against all base errors. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(348)</sup></span> For what is the reason why mankind have involved themselves in so many wicked opinions, in so many idolatries, in so many foolish speculations, but this — that, despising the simplicity of the gospel, they have ventured to aspire higher? All the errors, accordingly, that are in Popery, must be reckoned as proceeding from this ingratitude — that, not resting satisfied with Christ alone, they have given themselves up to strange doctrines. </p>
<p>With propriety, therefore, does the Apostle act in writing to the Hebrews, inasmuch as, when wishing to exhort believers not to allow themselves to be led astray <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(349)</sup></span> by strange or new doctrines, he first of all makes use of this foundation — </p>
<p>Christ yesterday, and to-day, and for ever. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:8">Hebrews 13:8</span>.) </p>
<p>By this he means, that those are out of danger who remain in Christ, but that those who are not satisfied with Christ are exposed to all fallacies and deceptions. So Paul here would have every one, that would not be <i>deceived</i>, be fortified by means of this principle — that it is not lawful for a Christian man to know anything except Christ. Everything that will be brought forward after this, let it have ever so imposing an appearance, will, nevertheless, be of no value. In fine, there will be no <i>persuasiveness of speech</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(350)</sup></span> that can turn aside so much as the breadth of a finger the minds of those that have devoted their understanding to Christ. It is a passage, certainly, that ought to be singularly esteemed. For as he who has taught men to know nothing except Christ, has provided against all wicked doctrines, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(351)</sup></span> so there is the same reason why we should at this day destroy the whole of Popery, which, it is manifest, is built on ignorance of Christ. </p>
