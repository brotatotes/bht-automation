By praising, also, their present condition, he admonishes them not to fall back from it, or turn aside. </p>
<p><i>Rejoicing</i>, says he, <i>And seeing</i>, that is — “Because <i>I see</i>. ” For <i>and</i> means <i>for</i>, as is customary among the Latins and Greeks. “Go on as you have begun, for I know that hitherto you have pursued the right course, inasmuch as distance of place does not prevent me from beholding you with the eyes of the mind.” </p>
<p><i>Order and steadfastness.</i> He mentions two things, in which the perfection of the Church consists — <i>order</i> among themselves, and <i>faith</i> in Christ. By the term <i>order</i>, he means — agreement, no less than duly regulated morals, and entire discipline. He commends their <i>faith</i>, in respect of its constancy and steadfastness, meaning that it is an empty shadow of faith, when the mind wavers and vacillates between different opinions. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(352)</sup></span> </p>
