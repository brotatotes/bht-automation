<p><b>6.</b><i>As ye have received.</i> To commendation he adds exhortation, in which he teaches them that their having once received Christ will be of no advantage to them, unless they remain in him. Farther, as the false apostles held forth Christ’s name with a view to deceive, he obviates this danger twice, by exhorting them to go on as they <i>had been taught</i>, and as they <i>had received Christ</i>. For in these words he admonishes them, that they must adhere to the doctrine which they had embraced, as delivered to them by Epaphras, with so much constancy, as to be on their guard against every other doctrine and faith, in accordance with what Isaiah said, </p>
<p>This is the way, walk ye in it. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+30:21">Isaiah 30:21</span>.) </p>
<p>And, unquestionbly, we must act in such a manner, that the truth of the gospel, after it has been manifested to us, may be to us as a brazen wall <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(353)</sup></span> for keeping back all impostures. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(354)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Now he intimates by <i>three</i> metaphors what steadfastness of faith he requires from them. The <i>first</i> is in the word <i>walk</i>. For he compares the pure doctrine of the gospel, as they had learned it, to a way that is sure, so that if any one will but keep it he will be beyond all danger of mistake. He exhorts them, accordingly, if they would not go astray, not to turn aside from the course on which they have entered. </p>
<p>The <i>second</i> is taken from trees. For as a tree that has struck its roots deep has a sufficiency of support for withstanding all the assaults of winds and storms, so, if any one is deeply and thoroughly fixed in Christ, as in a firm root, it will not be possible for him to be thrown down from his proper position by any machinations of Satan. On the other hand, if any one has not fixed his roots in Christ, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(355)</sup></span> he will easily be </p>
<p>carried about with every wind of doctrine, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span>,) </p>
<p>just as a tree that is not supported by any root. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(356)</sup></span> </p>
<p>The <i>third</i> metaphor is that of a foundation, for a house that is not supported by a foundation quickly falls to ruins. The case is the same with those who lean on any other foundation than Christ, or at least are not securely founded on him, but have the building of their faith suspended, as it were, in the air, in consequence of their weakness and levity. </p>
<p>These two things are to be observed in the Apostle’s words — that the stability of those who rely upon Christ is immovable, and their course is not at all wavering, or liable to error, (and this is an admirable commendation of faith from its effect;) and, <i>secondly</i>, that we must make progress in Christ aye and until we have taken deep root in him. From this we may readily gather, that those who do not know Christ only wander into bypaths, and are tossed about in disquietude. </p>
