<p><b>8.</b><i>Beware lest any one plunder you.</i> He again instructs them as to the poison, which the antidote presented by him should be made use of to counteract. For although this, as we have stated, is a common remedy against all the impostures of the devil, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(359)</sup></span> it had, nevertheless, at that time a peculiar advantage among the Colossians, to which it required to be applied. <i>Beware</i>, says he, <i>lest any one plunder you</i>. He makes use of a very appropriate term, for he alludes to <i>plunderers</i>, who, when they cannot carry off the flock by violence, drive away some of the cattle fraudulently. Thus he makes Christ’s Church a sheep-fold, and the pure doctrine of the gospel the enclosures of the fold. He intimates, accordingly, that we who are the sheep of Christ repose in safety when we hold the unity of the faith, while, on the other hand, he likens the false apostles to <i>plunderers</i> that carry us away from the folds. Would you then be reckoned as belonging to Christ’s flock? Would you remain in his folds? Do not deviate a nail’s breadth from purity of doctrine. For unquestionably Christ will act the part of the <i>good Shepherd</i> by protecting us if we but <i>hear his voice</i>, and <i>reject those of strangers</i>. In short, the <i>tenth</i> chapter of John is the exposition of the passage before us. [<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:0">John 10:0</span> ] </p>
<p><i>Through philosophy</i>. As many have mistakingly imagined that <i>philosophy</i> is here condemned by Paul, we must point out what he means by this term. Now, in my opinion, he means everything that men contrive of themselves when wishing to be wise through means of their own understanding, and that not without a specious pretext of reason, so as to have a plausible appearance. For there is no difficulty in rejecting those contrivances of men which have nothing to set them off, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(360)</sup></span> but in rejecting those that captivate men’s minds by a false conceit of wisdom. Or should any one prefer to have it expressed in one word, <i>philosophy</i> is nothing else than a persuasive speech, which insinuates itself into the minds of men by elegant and plausible arguments. Of such a nature, I acknowledge, will all the subtleties of philosophers be, if they are inclined to add anything of their own to the pure word of God. Hence <i>philosophy</i> will be nothing else than a corruption of spiritual doctrine, if it is mixed up with Christ. Let us, however, bear in mind, that under the term <i>philosophy</i> Paul has merely condemned all spurious doctrines which come forth from man’s head, whatever appearance of reason they may have. What immediately follows, as to <i>vain deceit</i>, I explain thus; “Beware of <i>philosophy</i>, which is nothing else than <i>vain deceit</i>, ” so that this is added by way of <i>apposition</i>. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(361)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>According to the tradition of men</i>. He points out more precisely what kind of <i>philosophy</i> he reproves, and at the same time convicts it of vanity on a twofold account — because it is <i>not according to Christ</i>, but according to the inclinations of men; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(362)</sup></span> and because it consists in the <i>elements of the world</i>. Observe, however, that he places Christ in opposition to the <i>elements of the world</i>, equally as to the <i>tradition of men</i>, by which he intimates, that whatever is hatched in man’s brain is not in accordance with Christ, who has been appointed us by the Father as our sole Teacher, that he might retain us in the simplicity of his gospel. Now, that is corrupted by even a small portion of the leaven of <i>human traditions</i>. He intimates also, that all doctrines are foreign to Christ that make the worship of God, which we know to be spiritual, according to Christ’s rule, to consist in the <i>elements of the world</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(363)</sup></span> and also such as fetter the minds of men by such trifles and frivolities, while Christ calls us directly to himself. </p>
<p>But what is meant by the phrase — <i>elements of the world</i> ? <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(364)</sup></span> There can be no doubt that it means ceremonies. For he immediately afterwards adduces one instance by way of example — <i>circumcision</i>. The reason why he calls them by such a name is usually explained in two ways. Some think that it is a metaphor, so that the <i>elements</i> are the rudiments of children, which do not lead forward to mature doctrine. Others take it in its proper signification, as denoting things that are outward and are liable to corruption, which avail nothing for the kingdom of God. The former exposition I rather approve of, as also in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:3">Galatians 4:3</span> </p>
