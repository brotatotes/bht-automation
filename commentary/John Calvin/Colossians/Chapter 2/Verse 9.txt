<p><b>9.</b><i>For in him dwelleth</i>. Here we have the reason why those <i>elements of the world</i>, which are taught by men, do not accord with Christ — because they are additions for supplying a deficiency, as they speak. Now in Christ there is a perfection, to which nothing can be added. Hence everything that mankind of themselves mix up, is at variance with Christ’s nature, because it charges him with imperfection. This argument of itself will suffice for setting aside all the contrivances of Papists. For to what purpose do they tend, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(365)</sup></span> but to perfect what was commenced by Christ? <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(366)</sup></span> Now this outrage upon Christ <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(367)</sup></span> is not by any means to be endured. They allege, it is true, that they add nothing to Christ, inasmuch as the things that they have appended to the gospel are, as it were, a part of Christianity, but they do not effect an escape by a cavil of this kind. For Paul does not speak of an imaginary Christ, but of a Christ preached, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(368)</sup></span> who has revealed himself by express doctrine. </p>
<p>Further, when he says that the <i>fullness of the Godhead</i> dwells in Christ, he means simply, that God is wholly found in him, so that he who is not contented with Christ alone, desires something better and more excellent than God. The sum is this, that God has manifested himself to us fully and perfectly in Christ. </p>
<p>Interpreters explain in different ways the adverb <i>bodily</i>. For my part, I have no doubt that it is employed — not in a strict sense — as meaning <i>substantially</i>. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(369)</sup></span> For he places this manifestation of God, which we have in Christ, to all others that have ever been made. For God has often manifested himself to men, but it has been only in part. In Christ, on the other hand, he communicates himself to us wholly. He has also manifested himself to us otherwise, but it is in figures, or by power and grace. In Christ, on the other hand, he has appeared to us essentially. Thus the statement of John holds good: </p>
<p>He that hath the Son, hath the Father also. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:23">1 John 2:23</span>.) </p>
<p>For those who possess Christ have God truly present, and enjoy Him wholly. </p>
