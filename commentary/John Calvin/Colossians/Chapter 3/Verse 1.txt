<p>To those fruitless exercises which the false apostles urged, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(429)</sup></span> as though perfection consisted in them, he opposes those true exercises in which it becomes Christians to employ themselves; and this has no slight bearing upon the point in hand; for when we see what God would have us do, we afterwards easily despise the inventions of men. When we perceive, too, that what God recommends to us is much more lofty and excellent than what men inculcate, our alacrity of mind increases for following God, so as to disregard men. Paul here exhorts the Colossians to meditation upon the heavenly life. And what as to his opponents? They were desirous to retain their childish rudiments. This doctrine, therefore, makes the ceremonies be the more lightly esteemed. Hence it is manifest that Paul, in this passage, exhorts in such a manner as to confirm the foregoing doctrine; for, in describing solid piety and holiness of life, his aim is, that those vain <i>shows</i> of human traditions may vanish. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(430)</sup></span> At the same time, he anticipates an objection with which the false apostles might assail him. What then? “Wouldst thou rather have men be idle than addict themselves to such exercises, of whatever sort they may be?” When, therefore, he bids Christians apply themselves to exercises of a greatly superior kind, he cuts off the handle for this calumny; nay more, he loads them with no small odium, on the ground that they impede the right course of the pious by worthless amusements. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(431)</sup></span> </p>
<p><b>1.</b><i>If ye are risen with Christ.</i> Ascension follows resurrection: hence, if we are the members of Christ we must ascend into heaven, because he, on being raised up from the dead, was <i>received up into heaven</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:19">Mark 16:19</span>,) that he might draw us up with him. Now, we <i>seek those things which are above</i>, when in our minds <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(432)</sup></span> we are truly sojourners in this world, and are not bound to it. The word rendered <i>think upon</i> expresses rather assiduity and intensity of aim: “Let your whole meditation be as to this: to this apply your intellect — to this your mind.” But if we ought to think of nothing but of what is heavenly, because Christ is in heaven, how much less becoming were it to seek Christ upon the earth. Let us therefore bear in mind that <i>that</i> is a true and holy <i>thinking</i> as to Christ, which forthwith bears us up into heaven, that we may there adore him, and that our minds may dwell with him. </p>
<p>As to the <i>right hand of God</i>, it is not confined to heaven, but fills the whole world. Paul has made mention of it here to intimate that Christ encompasses us by his power, that we may not think that distance of place is a cause of separation between us and him, and that at the same time his majesty may excite us wholly to reverence him. </p>
