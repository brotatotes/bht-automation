<p><b>13.</b><i>Put on therefore</i>. As he has enumerated some parts of the <i>old man</i>, so he now also enumerates some parts of the <i>new. “Then</i>, ” says he, “will it appear that ye are renewed by Christ, when ye are <i>merciful</i> and <i>kind</i>. For these are the effects and evidences of renovation.” Hence the exhortation depends on the second clause, and, accordingly, he keeps up the metaphor in the word rendered <i>put on</i> </p>
<p>He mentions, first, <i>bowels of mercy</i>, by which expression he means an earnest affection, with yearnings, as it were, of the <i>bowels</i>: Secondly, he makes mention of <i>kindness</i>, (for in this manner I have chosen to render <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χρηστότητα</span></blu></grk>,) by which we make ourselves amiable. To this he adds <i>humility</i>, because no one will be kind and gentle but the man who, laying aside haughtiness, and high mindedness, brings himself down to the exercise of modesty, claiming nothing for himself. </p>
<p><i>Gentleness</i> — the term which follows — has a wider acceptation than <i>kindness</i>, for that is chiefly in look and speech, while this is also in inward disposition. As, however, it frequently happens, that we come in contact with wicked and ungrateful men, there is need of patience, that it may cherish mildness in us. He at length explains what he meant by <i>long-suffering</i> — that we embrace each other indulgently, and forgive also where any offense has been given. As, however, it is a thing that is hard and difficult, he confirms this doctrine by the example of Christ, and teaches, that the same thing is required from us, that as we, who have so frequently and so grievously offended, have nevertheless been received into favor, we should manifest the same kindness towards our neighbors, by forgiving whatever offenses they have committed against us. Hence he says,<i>if any one have a quarrel against another.</i> By this he means, that even just occasions of quarrel, according to the views of men, ought not to be followed out. </p>
<p><i>As the chosen of God. Elect</i> I take here to mean, set apart. “God has <i>chosen</i> you to himself, has sanctified you, and received you into his love on this condition, that ye be merciful, etc. To no purpose does the man that has not these excellences boast that he is holy, and beloved of God; to no purpose does he reckon himself among the number of believers.” </p>
