<p><b>18</b><i>Wives, be subject.</i> Now follow particular duties, as they are called, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(456)</sup></span> which depend on the calling of individuals. In handling these it were superfluous to take up many words, inasmuch as I have already stated in the Epistle to the Ephesians <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(457)</sup></span> almost everything that was necessary. Here I shall only add briefly such things as are more particularly suited to an exposition of the passage before us. </p>
<p>He commands <i>wives</i> to be <i>subject</i>. This is clear, but what follows is of doubtful signification — <i>as it is fit in the Lord.</i> For some connect it thus — “Be subject in the Lord, as it is fit.” I, however, view it rather differently, — <i>As it is fit in the Lord</i>, that is, according to the appointment of the Lord, so that he confirms the subjection of wives by the authority of God. He requires <i>love</i> on the part of <i>husbands,</i> and <i>that they be not bitter</i>, because there is a danger lest they should abuse their authority in the way of tyranny. </p>
