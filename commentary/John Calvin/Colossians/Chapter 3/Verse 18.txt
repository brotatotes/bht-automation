18Wives, be subject. Now follow particular duties, as they are called, (456) which depend on the calling of individuals. In handling these it were superfluous to take up many words, inasmuch as I have already stated in the Epistle to the Ephesians (457) almost everything that was necessary. Here I shall only add briefly such things as are more particularly suited to an exposition of the passage before us. He commands wives to be subject. This is clear, but what follows is of doubtful signification — as it is fit in the Lord. For some connect it thus — “Be subject in the Lord, as it is fit.” I, however, view it rather differently, — As it is fit in the Lord, that is, according to the appointment of the Lord, so that he confirms the subjection of wives by the authority of God. He requires love on the part of husbands, and that they be not bitter, because there is a danger lest they should abuse their authority in the way of tyranny. (456) “Les enseignemens concernans le deuoir particulier d’vn chacun;” — “Instructions relating to the particular duty of each individual.” (457) I believe Calvin is referring to his commentary on Ephesians 5:21, — v.41 p. 317. — fj.
