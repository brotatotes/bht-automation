<p><b>5.</b><i>Mortify therefore</i>. Hitherto he has been speaking of contempt of the world. He now proceeds further, and enters upon a higher philosophy, as to the <i>mortification of the flesh</i>. That this may be the better understood, let us take notice that there is a twofold <i>mortification</i>. The former relates to those things that are around us. Of this he has hitherto treated. The other is inward — that of the understanding and will, and of the whole of our corrupt nature. He makes mention of certain vices which he calls, not with strict accuracy, but at the same time elegantly, <i>members</i>. For he conceives of our nature as being, as it were, a mass made up of different vices. They are, therefore, our <i>members</i>, inasmuch as they in a manner stick close to us. He calls them also <i>earthly</i>, alluding to what he had said — <i>not the things that are on earth</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+3:2">Colossians 3:2</span>,) but in a different sense. “I have admonished you, that earthly things are to be disregarded: you must, however, make it your aim to mortify those vices which detain you on the earth.” He intimates, however, that we are earthly, so long as the vices of our flesh are vigorous in us, and that we are made heavenly by the renewing of the Spirit. </p>
<p>After <i>fornication</i> he adds <i>uncleanness</i>, by which term he expresses all kinds of wantonness, by which lascivious persons pollute themselves. To these is added, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πάθος</span></blu></grk> that is, <i>lust</i>, which includes all the allurements of unhallowed desire. This term, it is true, denotes mental perturbations of other kinds, and disorderly motions contrary to reason; but <i>lust</i> is not an unsuitable rendering of this passage. As to the reason why <i>covetousness</i> is here spoken of as a worshipping of <i>images</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(436)</sup></span> consult the Epistle to the Ephesians, that I may not say the same thing twice. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(436)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Est appelee Idolatrie</span></blu>;” — “Is called Idolatry.” </p>
