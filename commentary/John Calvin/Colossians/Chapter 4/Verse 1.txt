<p><b>1.</b><i>Masters, what is just</i>. He mentions first, <i>what is just</i>, by which term he expresses that kindness, as to which he has given injunction in the Epistle to the Ephesians. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:8">Ephesians 6:8</span>.) But as masters, looking down as it were from aloft, despise the condition of servants, so that they think that they are bound by no law, Paul brings them under control, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(462)</sup></span> because both are equally under subjection to the authority of God. Hence that <i>equity</i> of which he makes mention. </p>
<p><i>And mutual equity.</i> Some understand it otherwise, but I have no doubt that Paul here employed <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἰσότητα</span></blu></grk> to mean analogical <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(463)</sup></span> or distributive right, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(464)</sup></span> as in <i>Ephesians</i>, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὰ αὐτὰ</span></blu></grk>, (<i>the same things</i>.) <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(465)</sup></span> For masters have not their servants bound to them in such a manner as not to owe something to them in their turn, as analogical right to be in force among all ranks. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(466)</sup></span> </p>
