<p><b>10.</b><i>Fellow-prisoner.</i> From this it appears that there were others that were associated with Paul, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(477)</sup></span> after he was brought to Rome. It is also probable that his enemies exerted themselves, in the outset, to deter all pious persons from giving him help, by threatening them with the like danger, and that this for a time had the desired effect; but that afterwards some, gathering up courage, despised everything that was held out to them in the way of terror. </p>
<p><i>That ye receive him.</i> Some manuscripts have <i>receive</i> in the imperative mood; but it is a mistake, for he expresses the nature of the <i>charge</i> which the Colossians had received — that it was a commendation of either Barnabas, or of Marcus. The latter is the more probable. In the Greek it is the infinitive mood, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(478)</sup></span> but it may be rendered in the way I have done. Let us, however, observe, that they were careful in furnishing attestations, that they might distinguish good men from false brethren — from pretenders, from impostors, and multitudes of vagrants. The same care is more than simply necessary at the present day, both because good teachers are coldly received, and because credulous and foolish men lay themselves too open to be deceived by impostors. </p>
