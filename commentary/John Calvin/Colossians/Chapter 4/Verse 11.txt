<p><b>11.</b><i>These only are fellow-workers,</i> — that is, of the circumcision; for he afterwards names others, but they were of the uncircumcision. He means, therefore, that there were few Jews at Rome who shewed themselves to be helpers to the gospel, nay more, that the whole nation was opposed to Christ. At the same time, by <i>workers</i> he means those only who were endowed with gifts that were necessary for promoting the gospel. But where was Peter at that time? Unquestionably, he has either been shamefully passed over here, and not without injustice, or else those speak falsely who maintain that he was then at Rome. Farther, he calls the gospel the <i>kingdom of God</i>, for it is the scepter by which God reigns over us, and by means of it we are singled out to life eternal. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(479)</sup></span> But of this form of expression we shall treat more fully elsewhere. </p>
