<p><b>3.</b><i>Pray also for us</i>. He does not say this by way of pretense, but because, being conscious to himself of his own necessity, he was earnestly desirous to be aided by their prayers, and was fully persuaded that they would be of advantage to them. Who then, in the present day, would dare to despise the intercessions of brethren, which Paul openly declares himself to stand in need of? And, unquestionably, it is not in vain that the Lord has appointed this exercise of love between us — that we pray for each other. Not only, therefore, ought each of us to pray for his brethren, but we ought also, on our part, diligently to seek help from the prayers of others, as often as occasion requires. It is, however, a childish <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(468)</sup></span> argument on the part of Papists, who infer from this, that the dead must be implored <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(469)</sup></span> to pray for us. For what is there here that bears any resemblance to this? Paul commends himself to the prayers of the brethren, with whom he knows that he has mutual fellowship according to the commandment of God: who will deny that this reason does not hold in the case of the dead? Leaving, therefore, such trifles, let us return to Paul. </p>
<p>As we have a signal example of modesty, in the circumstance that Paul calls others to his assistance, so we are also admonished, that it is a thing that is replete with the greatest difficulty, to persevere steadfastly in the defense of the gospel, and especially when danger presses. For it is not without cause that he desires that the Churches may assist him in this matter. Consider, too, at the same time, his amazing ardor of zeal. He is not solicitous as to his own safety; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(470)</sup></span> he does not ask that prayers may be poured forth by the Churches on his behalf, that he may be delivered from danger of death. He is contented with this one thing, that he may, unconquered and undaunted, persevere in a confession of the gospel; nay more, he fearlessly makes his own life a secondary matter, as compared with the glory of Christ and the spread of the gospel. </p>
<p>By a <i>door of utterance</i>, however, he simply means what, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:19">Ephesians 6:19</span>, he terms the <i>opening of the mouth</i>, and what Christ calls a <i>mouth and wisdom</i>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:15">Luke 21:15</span>.) For the expression differs nothing from the other in meaning, but merely in form, for he here intimates, by all elegant metaphor, that it is in no degree easier for us to speak confidently respecting the gospel, than to break through a door that is barred and bolted. For this is truly a divine work, as Christ himself said, </p>
<p>It is not ye that speak, <br>but the Spirit of your Father <br/>that speaketh in you. <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:20">Matthew 10:20</span>.) </br></p>
<p>Having, therefore, set forward the difficulty, he stirs up the Colossians the more to prayer, by declaring that he cannot speak right, except in so far as his tongue is directed by the Lord. <i>Secondly</i>, he argues from the dignity <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(471)</sup></span> of the matter, when he calls the gospel the <i>mystery of Christ</i>. For we must labor in a more perfunctory manner in a matter of such importance. <i>Thirdly</i>, he makes mention also of his danger. </p>
