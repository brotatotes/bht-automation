<p>He adds, <i>Onesimus</i>, that the embassy may have the more weight. It is, however, uncertain who this Onesimus was.

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(476)</span> Paley, in his <blu>Horae Paulinae</blu>, finds the statement here made respecting Onesimus, “who is one of you,” one of the many undesigned coincidences which he adduces in that admirable treatise, in evidence of the credibility of the New Testament. The train of his reasoning in this instance may be briefly stated thus — that while it appears from the Epistle to Philemon, that Onesimus was the servant or slave of Philemon, it is not stated in that Epistle to what city Philemon belonged; but that it appears from the Epistle, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="+1:1"> 1:1</span>,) that he was of the same place, whatever that place was, with an eminent Christian, named Archippus, whom we find saluted by name amongst the Colossian Christians; while the expression made use of by Paul here respecting Onesimus, “who is one of you,” clearly marks him out as being of the same city, viz., Colosse. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
