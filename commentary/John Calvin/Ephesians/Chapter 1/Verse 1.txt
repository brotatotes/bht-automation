<p><b>1.</b><i>Paul, an apostle.</i> As the same form of salutation, or at least very little varied, is found in all the Epistles, it would be superfluous to repeat here the observations which we have formerly made. He calls himself “an apostle of Jesus Christ;” for all to whom has been given the ministry of reconciliation are his ambassadors. The word Apostle, indeed, carries something more; for it is not every minister of the gospel, as we shall afterwards see, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>,) that can be called an apostle. But this subject has been explained more fully in my remarks on the Epistle to the Galatians. (See Calvin on “<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span> ”) </p>
<p>He adds, <i>by the will of God;</i> for “no man ought to take this honor unto himself,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:4">Hebrews 5:4</span>,) but every man ought to wait for the calling of God, which alone makes lawful ministers. He thus meets the jeers of wicked men by holding out the authority of God, and removes every occasion of inconsiderate strife. </p>
<p><i>To all the saints.</i> He gives the name of <i>saints</i> to those whom he afterwards denominates <i>faithful in Christ Jesus.</i> No man, therefore, is a believer who is not also a saint; and, on the other hand, no man is a saint who is not a believer. Most of the Greek copies want the word <i>all;</i> but I was unwilling to strike it out, because it must, at all events, be understood. </p>
