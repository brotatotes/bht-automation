<p><b>12.</b><i>That we should be to the praise of his glory.</i> Here again he mentions the <i>final</i> cause of salvation; for we must eventually become illustrations of the glory of God, if we are nothing but vessels of his mercy. The word <i>glory,</i> by way of eminence, (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κατ ᾿ ἐξοχὴν</span></blu></grk>) denotes, in a peculiar manner, that which shines in the goodness of God; for there is nothing that is more peculiarly his own, or in which he desires more to be glorified, than goodness. </p>
