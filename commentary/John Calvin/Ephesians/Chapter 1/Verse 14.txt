<p><b>14.</b><i>Which is the earnest</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(115)</sup></span> <i>of our inheritance.</i> This phrase is twice used by Paul in another Epistle. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:22">2 Corinthians 1:22</span>.) The metaphor is taken from bargains, in which, when a pledge has been given and accepted, the whole is confirmed, and no room is left for a change of mind. Thus, when we have received the Spirit of God, his promises are confirmed to us, and no dread is felt that they will be revoked. In themselves, indeed, the promises of God are not weak; but, until we are supported by the testimony of the Spirit, we never rest upon them with unshaken confidence. The Spirit, then, is <i>the earnest of our inheritance</i> of eternal life, <i>until the redemption,</i> that is, until the day of complete redemption is arrived. So long as we are in this world, our warfare is sustained by hope, and therefore this earnest is necessary; but when the possession itself shall have been obtained, the necessity and use of the earnest will then cease. </p>
<p>The significance of a pledge lasts no longer than till both parties have fulfilled the bargain; and, accordingly, he afterwards adds, <i>ye are sealed to the day of redemption,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:30">Ephesians 4:30</span>,) which means the day of judgment. Though we are now redeemed by the blood of Christ, the fruit of that redemption does not yet appear; for “every creature groaneth, desiring to be delivered from the bondage of corruption. And not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, <i>the redemption</i> of our body;” for we have not yet obtained it, but by hope. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21">Romans 8:21</span>.) But we shall obtain it in reality, when Christ shall appear to judgment. Such is the meaning of the word <i>redemption</i> in the passage now quoted from the Epistle to the Romans, and in a saying of our Lord, </p>
<p>“Look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.”<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:28">Luke 21:28</span>.) </p>
<p lang="el-GR"><grk><blu>Περιποίησις,</blu></grk> <span lang="en-US"> which we translate</span> <i><span lang="en-US" style="">the possession obtained,</span></i> <span lang="en-US">is not the kingdom of heaven, or a blessed immortality, but the Church itself. This is added for their consolation, that they might not think it hard to cherish their hope till the day of Christ’s coming, or be displeased that they have not yet obtained the promised inheritance; for such is the common lot of the whole Church.</span> </p>
<p><i>To the praise of his glory.</i> The word <i>praise,</i> as in the twelfth verse, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:12">Ephesians 1:12</span> signifies “making known.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(116)</sup></span> The glory of God may sometimes be concealed, or imperfectly exhibited. But in the Ephesians God had given proofs of his goodness, that his glory might be celebrated and openly proclaimed. Those persons, therefore, who slighted the calling of the Ephesians, might be charged with envying and slighting the glory of God. </p>
<p>The frequent mention of the glory of God ought not to be regarded as superfluous, for what is infinite cannot be too strongly expressed. This is particularly true in commendations of the Divine mercy, for which every godly person will always feel himself unable to find adequate language. He will be more ready to utter, than other men will be to hear, the expression of praise; for the eloquence both of men and angels, after being strained to the utmost, falls immeasurably below the vastness of this subject. We may likewise observe, that there is not a more effectual method of shutting the mouths of wicked men, than by shewing that our views tend to illustrate, and theirs to obscure, the glory of God. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(115)</span> “The original word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀρ᾿ῥαβών</span></blu></grk>, seems properly to denote the first part of the price that is paid in any contract, as an earnest and security of the remainder, and which, therefore, is not taken back, but kept till the residue is paid to complete the whole sum. And thus it differs from a pledge, which is somewhat given for the security of a contract, but redeemed and restored, when the contract is completed; but it must be owned that the word is used to denote both an earnest and a pledge, and in either sense it is very properly applied to the Holy Spirit of promise.” — Chandler. </p>
