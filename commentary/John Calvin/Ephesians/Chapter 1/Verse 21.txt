<p><b>21.</b><i>Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion.</i> All these names, there can be no doubt, are applied to angels, who are so denominated, because, by means of them, God exercises his power, and might, and dominion. He permits them to share, as far as is competent to creatures, what belongs to himself, and even gives to them his own name; for we find that they are called <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">אלהים</span></blu></heb>, (<i>elohim,</i>) <i>gods</i>. From the diversity of names we conclude that there are various orders of angels; but to attempt to settle these with exactness, to fix their number, or determine their ranks, would not merely discover foolish curiosity, but would be rash, wicked, and dangerous. </p>
<p>But why did he not simply call them Angels? I answer, it was to convey exalted views of the glory of Christ that Paul employed those lofty titles. As if he had said, “There is nothing so elevated or excellent, by whatever name it may be named, that is not subject to the majesty of Christ.” There was an ancient superstition, prevalent both among Jews and Gentiles, falsely attributing to angels many things, in order to draw away their minds from God himself, and from the true Mediator. Paul constantly labors to prevent this imaginary lustre of angels from dazzling the eyes of men, or obscuring the brightness of Christ; and yet his utmost exertions could not prevent “the wiles of the devil”(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:11">Ephesians 6:11</span>) from succeeding in this matter. Thus we see how the world, through a superstitious dread of angels, departed from Christ. It was indeed the unavoidable consequence of the false opinions entertained respecting angels, that the pure knowledge of Christ disappeared. </p>
<p><i>Above every name that is named. Name</i> is here taken for largeness, or excellence; and <i>to be named</i> means to enjoy celebrity and praise. <i>The age that is to come</i> is expressly mentioned, to point out that the exalted rank of Christ is not temporal, but eternal; and that it is not limited to this world, but shines illustriously in the kingdom of God. For this reason, too, Isaiah calls him, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>,) <i>The Father of the future age</i>. In short, the glories of men and angels are made to hold an inferior place, that the glory of Christ, unequalled and unapproached, may shine above them all. </p>
