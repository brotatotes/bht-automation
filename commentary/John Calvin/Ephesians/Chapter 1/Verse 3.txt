<p><b>3.</b><i>Blessed</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(108)</sup></span> <i>be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i> The lofty terms in which he extolls the grace of God toward the Ephesians, are intended to rouse their hearts to gratitude, to set them all on flame, to fill them even to overflowing with this thought. They who perceive in themselves discoveries of the Divine goodness, so full and absolutely perfect, and who make them the subject of earnest meditation, will never embrace new doctrines, by which the very grace which they feel so powerfully in themselves is thrown into the shade. The design of the apostle, therefore, in asserting the riches of divine grace toward the Ephesians, was to protect them against having their faith shaken by the false apostles, as if their calling were doubtful, or salvation were to be sought in some other way. He shews, at the same time, that the full certainty of future happiness rests on the revelation of his love to us in Christ, which God makes in the gospel. But to confirm the matter more fully, he rises to the first cause, to the fountain, — the eternal election of God, by which, ere we are born, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:11">Romans 9:11</span>,) we are adopted as sons. This makes it evident that their salvation was accomplished, not by any accidental or unlooked-for occurrence, but by the eternal and unchangeable decree of God. </p>
<p>The word <i>bless</i> is here used in more than one sense, as referring to God, and as referring to men. I find in Scripture four different significations of this word.<b>1.</b>We are said to bless God when we offer praise to him for his goodness.<b>2.</b>God is said to bless us, when he crowns our undertakings with success, and, in the exercise of his goodness, bestows upon us happiness and prosperity; and the reason is, that our enjoyments depend entirely upon his pleasure. Our attention is here called to the singular efficacy which dwells in the very word of God, and which Paul expresses in beautiful language.<b>3.</b>Men bless each other by prayer.<b>4.</b>The priest’s blessing is not simply a prayer, but is likewise a testimony and pledge of the Divine blessing; for the priests received a commission to bless in the name of the Lord. Paul therefore blesses God, because <i>he hath blessed us,</i> that is, hath enriched us with all blessing and grace. </p>
<p><i>With all spiritual blessings.</i> I have no objection to Chrysostom’s remark, that the word <i>spiritual</i> conveys an implied contrast between the blessing of Moses and of Christ. The law had its blessings; but in Christ only is perfection found, because he gives us a perfect revelation of the kingdom of God, which leads us directly to heaven. When the body itself is presented to us, figures are no longer needed. </p>
<p><i>In heavenly.</i> Whether we understand the meaning to be, in heavenly Places, or in heavenly Benefits, is of little consequence. All that was intended to be expressed is the superiority of that grace which we receive through Christ. The happiness which it bestows is not in this world, but in heaven and everlasting life. In the Christian religion, indeed, as we are elsewhere taught, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:8">1 Timothy 4:8</span>,) is contained the “promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come;” but its aim is spiritual happiness, for the kingdom of Christ is spiritual. A contrast is drawn between Christ and all the Jewish emblems, by which the blessing under the law was conveyed; for where Christ is, all those things are superfluous. </p>
