<p><b>5.</b><i>Who hath predestinated us.</i> What follows is intended still further to heighten the commendation of divine grace. The reason why Paul inculcated so earnestly on the Ephesians the doctrines of free adoption through Christ, and of the eternal election which preceded it, has been already considered. But as the mercy of God is nowhere acknowledged in more elevated language, this passage will deserve our careful attention. Three causes of our salvation are here mentioned, and a fourth is shortly afterwards added. The efficient cause is <i>the good pleasure of the will</i> of God, the material cause is, <i>Jesus Christ,</i> and the final cause is,<i>the praise of the glory of his grace.</i> Let us now see what he says respecting each. </p>
<p>To the first belongs the whole of the following statement <i>God hath predestinated us in himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, unto the adoption of sons, and hath made us accepted by his grace.</i> In the word <i>predestinate</i> we must again attend to the order. We were not then in existence, and therefore there was no merit of ours. The cause of our salvation did not proceed from us, but from God alone. Yet Paul, not satisfied with these statements, adds <i>in himself.</i> The Greek phrase is<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, εἰς αὑτὸν,</span></blu></grk> and has the same meaning with <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐν αὑτῷ.</span></blu></grk> By this he means that God did not seek a cause out of himself, but predestinated us, because such was his will. </p>
<p>But this is made still more clear by what follows, <i>according to the good pleasure of his will.</i> The word <i>will</i> was enough, for Paul very frequently contrasts it with all outward causes by which men are apt to imagine that the mind of God is influenced. But that no doubt may remain, he employs the word <i>good pleasure,</i> which expressly sets aside all merit. In adopting us, therefore, God does not inquire what we are, and is not reconciled to us by any personal worth. His single motive is the eternal good pleasure, by which he predestinated us. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(109)</sup></span> Why, then, are the sophists not ashamed to mingle with them other considerations, when Paul so strongly forbids us to look at anything else than the good pleasure of God? </p>
<p>Lest anything should still be wanting, he adds<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, ἐχαρίτωσεν ἐν χάριτι</span></blu></grk> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(110)</sup></span> This intimates, that, in the freest manner, and on no mercenary grounds, does God bestow upon us his love and favor, just as, when we were not yet born, and when he was prompted by nothing but his own will, he fixed upon us his choice. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(111)</sup></span> </p>
<p>The material cause both of eternal election, and of the love which is now revealed, is <i>Christ, the Beloved.</i> This name is given, to remind us that by him the love of God is communicated to us. Thus he is the well-beloved, in order that we may be reconciled by him. The highest and last end is immediately added, the glorious praise of such abundant grace. Every man, therefore, who hides this glory, is endeavoring to overturn the everlasting purpose of God. Such is the doctrine of the sophists, which entirely overturns the doctrine of Christ, lest the whole glory of our salvation should be ascribed undividedly to God alone. </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(111)</span> “The original word, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐχαρίτωσεν</span></blu></grk>, ‘he hath made us accepted,’ is not used by any profane authors; however, the sense of it is plain. It is used in the angel’s salutation to the Virgin Mary, ‘Hail, thou that art highly favored;’ and that the word there is rightly rendered, is plain from the reason which the angel himself gives, ‘Thou hast found favor with God.’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:28">Luke 1:28</span>) So that the plain meaning of the word, and the true rendering of it in the place before us, is, not as we have translated it, ‘made us accepted,’ but ‘highly favored us.’” — Chandler. </p>
