<p><b>11.</b><i>Wherefore remember.</i> The apostle never once loses sight of his subject, marks it out clearly, and pursues it with increasing earnestness. He again exhorts the Ephesians to remember what their character had been before they were called. This consideration was fitted to convince them that they had no reason to be proud. He afterwards points out the method of reconciliation, that they might rest with perfect satisfaction on Christ alone, and not imagine that other aids were necessary. The first clause may be thus summed up: “Remember that, when ye were uncircumcised, ye were aliens from Christ, from the hope of salvation, and from the Church and kingdom of God; so that ye had no friendly intercourse with God.” The second may run thus: “But now ingrafted into Christ, ye are at the same time reconciled to God.” What is implied in both parts of the description, and what effect the remembrance of it was fitted to produce on their minds, has been already considered. </p>
<p><i>Gentiles in the flesh</i>. He first mentions that they had wanted the marks of God’s people. <i>Circumcision</i> was a token by which the people of God were marked out and distinguished from other men: <i>Uncircumcision</i> was the mark of a profane person. Since, therefore, God usually connects his grace with the sacraments, their want of the sacraments is taken as an evidence that neither were they partakers of his grace. The argument, indeed, does not hold universally, though it does hold as to God’s ordinary dispensations. Hence we find the following language: </p>
<p>“And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man.”<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:22">Genesis 3:22</span>) </p>
<p>Though he had devoured the whole tree, he would not, by merely eating it, have recovered the possession of life; but, by taking away the sign, the Lord took from him also life itself. Uncircumcision is thus held out to the Ephesians as a mark of pollution. By taking from the Ephesians the token of sanctification, he deprives them also of the thing signified. </p>
<p>Some are of opinion, that all these observations are intended to throw contempt on outward circumcision; but this is a mistake. At the same time, I acknowledge, that the qualifying clause<i>, the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands,</i> points out a twofold circumcision. The Jews were thus taught that they should no longer indulge in foolish boasting about the literal circumcision. The Ephesians, on the other hand, were instructed to abstain from all scruples on their own account, since the most important privilege—nay, the whole truth expressed by the outward sign—was in their possession. He calls it, <i>Uncircumcision in the flesh,</i> because they bore the mark of their pollution; but, at the same time, he suggests that their uncircumcision was no hinderance to their being spiritually circumcised by Christ. </p>
<p>The words may likewise be read in one clause, <i>Circumcision in the flesh made by hands,</i> or in two clauses: <i>Circumcision in the flesh,</i> meaning that it was carnal;<i>made by hands,</i> meaning that it was done by the hand of man. This kind of circumcision is contrasted with that of the Spirit, or <i>of the heart,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span>,) which is also called <i>the circumcision of Christ.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+2:11">Colossians 2:11</span>) </p>
<p><i>By that which is called. Circumcision</i> may be viewed here either as a collective noun for the Jews themselves, or literally for the thing itself; and then the meaning would be, that the Gentiles were called <i>Uncircumcision,</i> because they wanted the sacred symbol, that is, by way of distinction. This latter sense is countenanced by the qualifying phrase; but the substance of the argument is little affected. </p>
