<p><b>13.</b><i>But now in Christ Jesus.</i> We must either supply the verb, <i>now that ye have been received in Christ Jesus,</i> or connect the word <i>now</i> with the conclusion of the verse, <i>now through the blood of Christ,</i> â€” which will be a still clearer exposition. In either case, the meaning is, that the Ephesians, <i>who were far off</i> from God and from salvation, had been reconciled to God through Christ, and <i>made nigh by his blood;</i> for the blood of Christ has taken away <i>the enmity</i> which existed between them and God, and from being enemies hath made them sons. </p>
