<p><b>16.</b><i>And that he might reconcile both.</i> The reconciliation between ourselves which has now been described is not the only advantage which we derive from Christ. We have been brought back into favor with God. The Jews are thus led to consider that they have not less need of a Mediator than the Gentiles. Without this, neither the Law, nor ceremonies, nor their descent from Abraham, nor all their dazzling prerogatives, would be of any avail. We are all sinners; and forgiveness of sins cannot be obtained but through the grace of Christ. He adds, <i>in one body,</i> to inform the Jews, that to cultivate union with the Gentiles will be well-pleasing in the sight of God. </p>
<p><i>By the cross.</i> The word <i>cross</i> is added, to point out the propitiatory sacrifice. Sin is the cause of enmity between God and us; and, until it is removed, we shall not be restored to the Divine favor. It has been blotted out by the death of Christ, in which he offered himself to the Father as an expiatory victim. There is another reason, indeed, why the cross is mentioned here, as it is through the cross that all ceremonies have been abolished. Accordingly, he adds, <i>slaying the enmity thereby.</i> These words, which unquestionably relate to the cross, may admit of two senses, — either that Christ, by his death, has turned away from us the Father’s anger, or that, having redeemed both Jews and Gentiles, he has brought them back into one flock. The latter appears to be the more probable interpretation, as it agrees with a former clause, <i>abolishing in his flesh the enmity.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span>.) </p>
