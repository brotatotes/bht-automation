<p><b>22.</b><i>In whom ye also are builded together,</i> or <i>in whom also</i> Be Ye Builded <i>together.</i> The termination of the Greek verb<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, συνοικοδομεῖσθε,</span></blu></grk> like that of the Latin, <blu><i>cooedificamini,</i></blu> does not enable us to determine whether it is in the imperative or indicative mood. The context will admit either, but I prefer the latter sense. It is, I think, an exhortation to the Ephesians to grow more and more in the faith of Christ, after having been once founded in it, and thus to form a part of that new temple of God, the building of which through the gospel was then in progress in every part of the world. </p>
<p><i>Through the Spirit.</i> This is again repeated for two reasons: first, to remind them that all human exertions are of no avail without the operation of the Spirit; and secondly, to point out the superiority of the spiritual building to all Jewish and outward services. </p>
