<p><b>3.</b><i>Among whom also we all had our conversation.</i> Lest it should be supposed that what he had now said was a slanderous reproach against the former character of the Ephesians, or that Jewish pride had led him to treat the Gentiles as an inferior race, he associates himself and his countrymen along with them in the general accusation. This is not done in hypocrisy, but in a sincere ascription of glory to God. It may excite wonder, indeed, that he should speak of himself as having walked “in the lusts of the flesh,” while, on other occasions, he boasts that his life had been throughout irreproachable. </p>
<p>“Touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+3:6">Philippians 3:6</span>.) </p>
<p>And again, </p>
<p>“Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily, and justly, and unblamably, we behaved ourselves among you that believe.”<br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:10">1 Thessalonians 2:10</span>) </br></p>
<p>I reply, the statement applies to all who have not been regenerated by the Spirit of Christ. However praiseworthy, in appearance, the life of some may be, because their lusts do not break out in the sight of men, there is nothing pure or holy which does not proceed from the fountain of all purity. </p>
<p><i>Fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind.</i> To fulfill these desires, is to live according to the guidance of our natural disposition and of our mind. <i>The flesh</i> means here the disposition, or, what is called, the inclination of the nature; and the next expression (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τῶν διανοιῶν</span></blu></grk>) means what proceeds from the mind. Now, <i>the mind</i> includes reason, such as it exists in men by nature; so that <i>lusts</i> do not refer exclusively to the lower appetites, or what is called the sensual part of man, but extend to the whole. </p>
<p><i>And were by nature</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(121)</sup></span> <i>children of wrath.</i> All men without exception, whether Jews or Gentiles, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:15">Galatians 2:15</span>,) are here pronounced to be guilty, until they are redeemed by Christ; so that out of Christ there is no righteousness, no salvation, and, in short, no excellence. <i>Children of wrath</i> are those who are lost, and who deserve eternal death. <i>Wrath</i> means the judgment of God; so that <i>the children of wrath</i> are those who are condemned before God. Such, the apostle tells us, had been the Jews, — such had been all the excellent men that were now in the Church; and they were so<i>by nature,</i> that is, from their very commencement, and from their mother’s womb. </p>
<p>This is a remarkable passage, in opposition to the views of the Pelagians, and of all who deny original sin. What dwells naturally in all is certainly original; but Paul declares that we are all naturally liable to condemnation; therefore sin dwells naturally in us, for God does not condemn the innocent. Pelagians were wont to object, that sin spread from Adam to the whole human race, not by descent, but by imitation. But Paul affirms that we are born with sin, as serpents bring their venom from the womb. Others who think that it is not in reality sin, are not less at variance with Paul’s language; for where condemnation is, there must unquestionably be sin. It is not with blameless men, but with sin, that God is offended. Nor is it wonderful that the depravity which we inherit from our parents is reckoned as sin before God; for the seeds of sin, before they have been openly displayed, are perceived and condemned. </p>
<p>But one question here arises. Why does Paul represent the Jews, equally with others, as subject to wrath and curse, while they were the blessed seed? I answer, they have a common nature. Jews differ from Gentiles in nothing but this, that, through the grace of the promise, God delivers them from destruction; but that is a remedy which came after the disease. Another question is, since God is the Author of nature, how comes it that no blame attaches to God, if we are lost by nature? I answer, there is a twofold nature: the one was produced by God, and the other is the corruption of it. This condemnation therefore which Paul mentions does not proceed from God, but from a depraved nature: for we are not born such as Adam was at first created, we are not </p>
<p>“wholly a right seed, but are turned into the degenerate”<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:21">Jeremiah 2:21</span>) </p>
<p>offspring of a degenerate and sinful man. </p>
