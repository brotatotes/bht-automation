<p><b>12.</b><i>Through whom we have boldness.</i> The honor of reconciling the Father to the whole world must be given to Christ. From the effects of this grace its excellence is demonstrated; for <i>faith,</i> which is possessed by Gentiles in common with Jews, admits them into the presence of God. When the words, <i>through Christ</i> and <i>by the faith of him,</i> are used by Paul, in connection with the name of God, there is always an implied contrast, which shuts up every other approach, — which excludes every other method of obtaining Divine fellowship. Most important and valuable instruction is here conveyed. The true nature and power of faith, and the confidence which is necessary for calling upon God, are beautifully expressed. That the consequences of faith, and the duties which it performs, should be the subject of much controversy between us and the Papists, is not surprising. They do not properly understand the meaning of the word <i>Faith,</i> which they might learn from this passage, if they were not blinded by prejudice. </p>
<p>First, Paul denominates it <i>the faith of Christ;</i> by which he intimates, that everything which faith ought to contemplate is exhibited to us in Christ. Hence it follows, that an empty and confused knowledge of Christ must not be mistaken for Faith, but that knowledge which is directed to Christ, in order to seek God in Christ; and this can only be done when the power and offices of Christ are understood.<i>Faith</i> produces<i>confidence,</i> which again, in its turn, produces <i>boldness.</i> There are three stages in our progress. First, we believe the promises of God; next, by relying on them, we obtain that <i>confidence,</i> which is accompanied by holiness and peace of mind; and, last of all, comes <i>boldness,</i> which enables us to banish fear, and to come with firmness and steadiness into the presence of God. </p>
<p>To separate <i>faith</i> from <i>confidence</i> would be an attempt to take away heat and light from the sun. I acknowledge, indeed, that, in proportion to the measure of faith, confidence is small in some and greater in others; but faith will never be found unaccompanied by these effects or fruits. A trembling, hesitating, doubting conscience, will always be a sure evidence of unbelief; but a firm, steady faith, will prove to be invincible against the gates of hell. To trust in Christ as Mediator, and to entertain a firm conviction of our heavenly Father’s love, — to venture boldly to promise to ourselves eternal life, and not to tremble at death or hell, — is, to use a common phrase, a holy presumption. </p>
<p>Observe the expression, <i>access with confidence.</i> Wicked men seek rest in forgetfulness of God, and are never at ease but when they remove to the greatest possible distance from God. His own children differ from them in this respect, that they “have peace with God,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1">Romans 5:1</span>,) and approach to him with cheerfulness and delight. We infer, likewise, from this passage, that, in order to call on God in a proper manner, <i>confidence</i> is necessary, and thus becomes the key that opens to us the gate of heaven. Those who doubt and hesitate will never be heard. </p>
<p>“Let him ask in faith,” says James, “nothing wavering: for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:6">James 1:6</span>) </p>
<p>The sophists of the <i>Sorbonne,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(133)</sup></span> when they enjoin men to hesitate, know not what it is to call upon God. </p>
