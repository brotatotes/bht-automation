<p><b>4.</b><i>By attending to which, ye may understand,</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πρὸς ὃ δύνασθε ἀναγινώσκοντες νοὢσαι.</span></blu></grk> Erasmus renders it, “from which things, when ye read, ye may understand.” But to translate<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀναγινώσκειν τι</span></blu></grk> as signifying <i>to read</i> is, I think, at variance with Greek syntax. I leave it as a subject of consideration, whether it does not rather signify <i>to attend</i>. The participle would then be connected with the preposition<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πρὸς,</span></blu></grk> in the commencement of the verse, and the clause would run thus, <i>to which when ye attend, ye may understand</i> If, however, by viewing the verb<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀναγινώσκοντες,</span></blu></grk> as disjoined from the preposition, you make it signify <i>reading,</i> the meaning will still be, “by reading you may understand according to what I have written;” taking the phrase<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πρὸς ὃ,</span></blu></grk> <i>to which,</i> as equivalent to<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καθ ᾿ ὃ,</span></blu></grk> <i>according to which;</i> but I suggest this merely as a doubtful conjecture. </p>
<p>If we adopt the view which is almost universally approved, that the apostle had formerly written to the Ephesians, this is not the only Epistle which we have lost. And yet there is no room for the sneers of the ungodly, as if the Scriptures had been mutilated, or in any part had become imperfect. If we duly consider Paul’s earnestness, — his watchfulness and care, — his zeal and fervor, — his kindness and readiness in assisting brethren, — we shall be led to regard it as highly probable that he would write many epistles, both of a public and private nature, to various places. Those which the Lord judged to be necessary for his church have been selected by his providence for everlasting remembrance. Let us rest assured, that what is left is enough for us, and that the smallness of the remaining number is not the result of accident; but that the body of Scripture, which is in our possession, has been adjusted by the wonderful counsel of God. </p>
<p><i>My knowledge.</i> The frequent mention of this point shews the necessity that the calling of ministers should be firmly believed both by themselves and by their people. But Paul looks more to others than to himself. He had everywhere indeed given great offense by preaching the gospel indiscriminately to Jews and Gentiles, but his solicitude was not chiefly on his own account. There were not a few who, overwhelmed by the slanders of wicked men, began to doubt of his apostleship, and whose faith was consequently shaken. It was this that induced him so frequently to remind the Ephesians that he knew the will and command of God who called him to the office. —<i>In the mystery of Christ,</i> </p>
