<p><b>5.</b><i>Which in other ages was not made known.</i> He had simply called it a <i>mystery,</i> but now calls it <i>a mystery of Christ,</i> because it was necessary that it should remain hidden, until it was revealed by his coming; just as the appellation of “prophecies of Christ” may be given to those which relate to his kingdom. We must first explain the word <i>mystery,</i> and then inquire why it is said to have remained unknown in all ages. The <i>mystery</i> was, </p>
<p>“that the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel.”<br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:6">Ephesians 3:6</span>.) </br></p>
<p>When this name is given to the gospel, it has other meanings, which do not apply to the present passage. The calling of the Gentiles, then, was a “mystery of Christ;” that is, it was to be fulfilled under the reign of Christ. </p>
<p>But why does he affirm that it was not known, when it had been the subject of so many predictions? The prophets everywhere declare, that people shall come from every nation in the world, to worship God; that an altar shall be erected both in Assyria and in Egypt, and that all alike shall speak the language of Canaan. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+19:18">Isaiah 19:18</span>.) It is intimated by these words, that the worship of the true God, and the same profession of faith, will be everywhere diffused. Of the Messiah it is predicted, that he shall have dominion from east to west, and that all nations shall serve him. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+72:8">Psalms 72:8</span>.) We see also, that many passages to this purpose are quoted by the apostles, not only from the later prophets, but from Moses. How could that be hidden which had been proclaimed by so many heralds? Why are all without exception pronounced to have been in ignorance? Shall we say, that the prophets spake what they did not understand, and uttered sounds without meaning? </p>
<p>I answer, the words of Paul must not be understood to mean that there had been no knowledge at all on these subjects. There had always been some of the Jewish nation who acknowledged that, at the advent of the Messiah, the grace of God would be proclaimed throughout the whole world, and who looked forward to the renovation of the human race. The prophets themselves, though they spoke with the certainty of revelation, left the time and manner undetermined. They knew that some communication of the grace of God would be made to the Gentiles, but at what time, in what manner, and by what means it should be accomplished, they had no information whatever. This ignorance was exemplified in a remarkable way by the apostles. They had not only been instructed by the predictions of the prophets, but had heard the distinct statement of their Master, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:16">John 10:16</span>,) </p>
<p>“Other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice: and there shall be one fold and one shepherd;” </p>
<p>and yet the novelty of the subject prevented them from understanding it fully. Nay, after they had received the injunction, </p>
<p>“Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15">Mark 16:15</span>,) </p>
<p>and, </p>
<p>“Ye shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:8">Acts 1:8</span>,) </p>
<p>they dreaded and recoiled from the calling of the Gentiles as a proposal absolutely monstrous, because the manner of its accomplishment was still unknown. Before the actual event arrived, they had dark and confused apprehensions of our Savior’s words; for ceremonies were </p>
<p>“a vail over their face, that they could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:13">2 Corinthians 3:13</span>.) </p>
<p>With unquestionable propriety, therefore, does Paul call this a <i>mystery,</i> and say, that it had been hidden; for the repeal of the ceremonial law, which admitted them within the vail, was not understood. </p>
<p><i>As it is now revealed.</i> To lay claim to information which none of the patriarchs, prophets, or holy kings, had possessed, might wear the aspect of arrogance. To guard against this imputation, Paul reminds them, first, that in this respect he was not alone, but shared the <i>revelation</i> with the most eminent teachers of the church; and, secondly, that it was the gift of the Holy Spirit, who has a right to bestow it on whom he pleases; for there is no other limit of our knowledge but that which he assigns to us. </p>
<p>These few words, <i>as it is now revealed,</i> throw additional light on the admission of the Gentiles to be the people of God. It is on the condition that they shall be placed on a level with the Jews, and form one body. That the novelty might give no offense, he states that this must be accomplished <i>by the gospel.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:6">Ephesians 3:6</span>.) Now, the gospel was itself a novelty; for it had never till now been heard of, and yet was acknowledged by all the godly to have come from heaven. Where, then, was the wonder, if, in renewing the world, God should follow an unwonted method? </p>
