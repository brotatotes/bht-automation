<p><b>7.</b><i>Of which I was made a minister.</i> Having declared the gospel to be the instrument employed in communicating grace to the Gentiles, he now adds, that he <i>was made a minister</i> of the Gospel; and thus applies to himself the general statements which had been made. But, to avoid claiming for himself more than is proper, he affirms that it is<i>the gift of the grace of God,</i> and that this gift was an exhibition of divine <i>power.</i> As if he had said, “Inquire not what I have deserved; for in the free exercise of kindness, the Lord made me an apostle of the Gentiles, not for any excellence of mine, but by his own grace. Inquire not what I formerly was; for it is the Lord’s prerogative to ‘exalt them of low degree.’” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:52">Luke 1:52</span>.) To produce something great out of nothing, shews <i>the effectual working of his power.</i> </p>
