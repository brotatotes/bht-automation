<p><b>18.</b><i>Being alienated from the life of God. The life of God</i> may either mean what is accounted life in the sight of God, as in that passage, </p>
<p>“they loved the praise of men more than <i>the praise of God</i>, ”<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:43">John 12:43</span>,) </p>
<p>or, that life which God bestows on his elect by the Spirit of regeneration. In both cases the meaning is the same. Our ordinary life, as men, is nothing more than an empty image of life, not only because it quickly passes, but also because, while we live, our souls, not keeping close to God, are dead. There are three kinds of life in this world. The first is animal life, which consists only of motion and the bodily senses, and which we have in common with the brutes; the second is human life, which we have as the children of Adam; and the third is that supernatural life, which believers alone obtain. And all of them are from God, so that each of them may be called <i>the life of God.</i> As to the first, Paul, in his sermon at Athens, says, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:28">Acts 17:28</span>,) “In him we live, and move, and have our being;” and the Psalmist says, </p>
<p>“Send forth thy Spirit, and they shall be created; and thou wilt renew the face of the earth.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+104:30">Psalms 104:30</span>.) </p>
<p>Of the second Job says, </p>
<p>“Thou hast granted me life, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="job+10:12">Job 10:12</span>.) </p>
<p>But the regeneration of believers is here called, by way of eminence, <i>the life of God,</i> because then does God truly live in us, and we enjoy his life, when he governs us by his Spirit. Of this life all men who are not new creatures in Christ are declared by Paul to be destitute. So long, then, as we remain in the flesh, that is, in ourselves, how wretched must be our condition! We may now form a judgment of all the moral virtues, as they are called; for what sort of actions will that life produce which, Paul affirms, is not the life of God? Before anything good can begin to proceed from us, we must first be renewed by the grace of Christ. This will be the commencement of a true, and, as the phrase is, a <i>vital</i> life. </p>
<p><i>On account of the ignorance that is in them.</i> We ought to attend to the reason which is here assigned; for, as the knowledge of God is the true life of the soul, so, on the contrary, ignorance is the death of it. And lest we should adopt the opinion of philosophers, that ignorance, which leads us into mistakes, is only an incidental evil, Paul shews that it has its root <i>in the blindness of their heart,</i> by which he intimates that it dwells in their very nature. The first blindness, therefore, which covers the minds of men, is the punishment of original sin; because Adam, after his revolt, was deprived of the true light of God, in the absence of which there is nothing but fearful darkness. </p>
