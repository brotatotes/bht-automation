<p><b>24.</b><i>And that ye put on the new man.</i> All that is meant is, “Be renewed in the spirit, or, be renewed <i>within</i> or <i>completely,</i> — beginning with the mind, which appears to be the part most free from all taint of sin.” What is added about the creation, may refer either to the first creation of man, or to the second creation, which is effected by the grace of Christ. Both expositions will be true. Adam was at first created after the image of God, and reflected, as in a mirror, the Divine righteousness; but that image, having been defaced by sin, must now be restored in Christ. The regeneration of the godly is indeed — as we have formerly explained <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(149)</sup></span> — nothing else than the formation anew of the image of God in them. There is, no doubt, a far more rich and powerful manifestation of Divine grace in this second creation than in the first; but our highest perfection is uniformly represented in Scripture as consisting in our conformity and resemblance to God. Adam lost the image which he had originally received, and therefore it becomes necessary that it shall be restored to us by Christ. The design contemplated by regeneration is to recall us from our wanderings to that end for which we were created. </p>
<p><i>In righteousness.</i> If <i>righteousness</i> be taken as a general term for uprightness, <i>holiness</i> will be something higher, or that purity which lies in being devoted to the service of God. I am rather inclined to consider <i>holiness</i> as referring to the first table, and <i>righteousness</i> to the second table, of the law, as in the song of Zacharias, </p>
<p>“That we may serve him in <i>holiness and righteousness</i>, all the days of our life.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:74">Luke 1:74</span>.) </p>
<p>Plato lays down the distinction correctly, that <i>holiness</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὁσιότης</span></blu></grk>) lies in the worship of God, and that the other part,<i>righteousness,</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δικαιοσύνη,</span></blu></grk>) bears a reference to men. The genitive, <i>of truth</i>, (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὢς αληθείας,</span></blu></grk>) is put in the place of an adjective, and refers to both terms; so that, while it literally runs, <i>in righteousness and holiness of truth,</i> the meaning is, <i>in true righteousness and holiness.</i> He warns us that both ought to be sincere; because we have to do with God, whom it is impossible to deceive. </p>
