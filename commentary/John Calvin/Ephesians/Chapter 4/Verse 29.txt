<p><b>29.</b><i>No filthy speech.</i> He first forbids believers to use any <i>filthy</i> language, including under this name all those expressions which are wont to be employed for the purpose of inflaming lust. Not satisfied with the removal of the vice, he enjoins them to frame their discourse for edification. In another Epistle he says, “Let your speech be seasoned with salt.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+4:6">Colossians 4:6</span>.) Here a different phrase is employed, <i>if any</i> (speech) <i>be good to the use of edifying,</i> which means simply, <i>if it be useful.</i> The genitive, <i>of use,</i> may no doubt be viewed, according to the Hebrew idiom, as put for an adjective, so that <i>for the edification of use</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πρὸς οἰκοδομὴν τὢς χρείας</span></blu></grk>) may mean <i>for useful edification;</i> but when I consider how frequently, and in how extensive a meaning, the metaphor of <i>edifying</i> occurs in Paul’s writings, I prefer the former exposition. <i>The edification of use</i> will thus mean the progress of our edification, for to edify is to carry forward. To explain the manner in which this is done, he adds, <i>that it may impart grace to the hearers,</i> meaning by the word <i>grace,</i> comfort, advice, and everything that aids the salvation of the soul. </p>
