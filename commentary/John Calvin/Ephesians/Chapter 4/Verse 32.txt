<p><b>32.</b><i>And be ye kind one to another.</i> With <i>bitterness</i> he contrasts <i>kindness,</i> or gentleness of countenance, language, and manners. And as this virtue will never reign in us, unless attended by <i>compassion,</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ουμπάθεια,</span></blu></grk>) he recommends to us to be <i>tender-hearted</i> This will lead us not only to sympathize with the distresses of our brethren, as if they were our own, but to cultivate that true humanity which is affected by everything that happens to them, in the same manner as if we were in their situation. The contrary of this is the cruelty of those iron-hearted, barbarous men, by whom the sufferings of others are beheld without any concern whatever. </p>
<p><i>Forgiving one another.</i> The Greek word here rendered<i>forgiving,</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χαριζόμενοι ἑαυτοῖς,</span></blu></grk>) is supposed by to mean beneficence. Erasmus, accordingly, renders it (<blu><i>largientes</i></blu> ) <i>bountiful.</i> Though the word admits of that meaning, yet the context induces me to prefer the other view, that we should be ready to <i>forgive</i> It may sometimes happen, that men are <i>kind</i> and <i>tender-hearted,</i> and yet, when they receive improper treatment, do not so easily forgive injuries. That those whose kindness of heart in other respects disposes them to acts of humanity, may not fail in their duty through the ingratitude of men, he exhorts them to discover a readiness to lay aside resentment. To give his exhortation the greater weight, he holds out the example of God, who has forgiven to us, through Christ, far more than any mortal man can forgive to his brethren. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(152)</sup></span> </p>
