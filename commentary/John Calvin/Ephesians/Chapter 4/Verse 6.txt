<p><b>6.</b><i>One God and Father of all.</i> This is the main argument, from which all the rest flow. How comes it that we are united by faith, by baptism, or even by the government of Christ, but because God the Father, extending to each of us his gracious presence, employs these means for gathering us to himself? The two phrases<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, ἐπὶ πάντων καὶ διὰ πάντων,</span></blu></grk> may either mean, <i>above all and through all</i> Things, or <i>above all and through all</i> Men. Either meaning will apply sufficiently well, or rather, in both cases, the meaning will be the same. Although God by his power upholds, and maintains, and rules, all things, yet Paul is not now speaking of the universal, but of the spiritual government which belongs to the church. By the Spirit of sanctification, God spreads himself through all the members of the church, embraces all in his government, and dwells in all; but God is not inconsistent with himself, and therefore we cannot but be united to him into one body. </p>
<p>This spiritual unity is mentioned by our Lord. </p>
<p>“Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast, given me, that they may be one as we are.”<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:11">John 17:11</span>) </p>
<p>This is true indeed, in a general sense, not only of all men but of all creatures. “In him we live, and move, and have our being.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:28">Acts 17:28</span>.) And again, “Do not I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord?” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:24">Jeremiah 23:24</span>.) But we must attend to the connection in which this passage stands. Paul is now illustrating the mutual relation of believers, which has nothing in common either with wicked men or with inferior animals. To this relation we must limit what is said about God’s government and presence. It is for this reason, also, that the apostle uses the word <i>Father,</i> which applies only to the members of Christ. </p>
