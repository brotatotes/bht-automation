<p><b>7.</b><i>But to every one.</i> He now describes the manner in which God establishes and preserves among us a mutual relation. No member of the body of Christ is endowed with such perfection as to be able, without the assistance of others, to supply his own necessities. A certain proportion is allotted to each; and it is only by communicating with each other, that all enjoy what is sufficient for maintaining their respective places in the body. The diversity of gifts is discussed in another Epistle, and very nearly with the same object. </p>
<p>“There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit”<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4">1 Corinthians 12:4</span>.) </p>
<p>Such a diversity, we are there taught, is so far from injuring, that it tends to promote and strengthen, the harmony of believers. </p>
<p>The meaning of this verse may be thus summed up. “On no one has God bestowed all things. Each has received a certain measure. Being thus dependent on each other, they find it necessary to throw their individual gifts into the common stock, and thus to render mutual aid.” The words <i>grace</i> and <i>gift</i> remind us that, whatever may be our attainments, we ought not to be proud of them, because they lay us under deeper obligations to God. These blessings are said to be <i>the gift of Christ;</i> for, as the apostle, first of all, mentioned the Father, so his aim, as we shall see, is to represent all that we are, and all that we have, as gathered together in Christ. </p>
