17.Wherefore be ye not unwise. He whose “delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates in it day and night,”(Psalms 1:2,) will triumph over every obstacle which Satan can oppose to his progress. Whence comes it that some wander, others fall, others strike against a rock, others go away, — but because we allow ourselves to be gradually blinded by Satan, and lose sight of the will of God, which we ought constantly to remember? And observe, that Paul defines wisdom to be, understanding what the will of the Lord is “How shall a young man,” says David, “direct his way? By attending to thy word, O Lord.” (Psalms 119:9.) He speaks of youths, but it is the same wisdom which belongs to old men.
