<p><b>24.</b><i>But, as the church is subject to Christ</i>. The particle <i>but,</i> may lead some to believe that the words, <i>he is the savior of the body,</i> are intended to anticipate an objection. Christ has, no doubt, this peculiar claim, that he is the Savior of the Church: nevertheless, let wives know, that their husbands, though they cannot produce equal claims, have authority over them, after the example of Christ. I prefer the former interpretation; for the argument derived from the word <i>but,</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀλλά,</span></blu></grk>) does not appear to me to have much weight. </p>
