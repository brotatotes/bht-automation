<p><b>27.</b><i>That he might present it to himself.</i> He declares what is the design of baptism and of our being washed. It is, that we may live in a holy and unblamable manner before God. We are washed by Christ, not that we may return to our pollution, but that we may retain through our life the purity which we have once received. This is described in metaphorical language appropriate to his argument. </p>
<p><i>Not having spot or wrinkle.</i> As the beauty of the wife produces love in the husband, so Christ adorns the Church his bride with holiness as a proof of his regard. This metaphor contains an allusion to marriage; but he afterwards lays aside the figure, and says plainly, that Christ has reconciled the church, <i>that it might be holy and without blemish.</i> The true beauty of the church consists in this conjugal chastity, that is, in holiness and purity. </p>
<p>The word <i>present</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">παραστήσὟ</span></blu></grk>) implies that the church ought to be holy, not only in the view of men, but in the eyes of the Lord; for Paul says, <i>that he might present it to himself,</i> not that he might shew it to others, though the fruits of that hidden purity become afterwards evident in outward works. Pelagians were wont to quote this passage in order to prove the perfection of righteousness in this life, but have been successfully answered by Augustine. Paul does not state what has been done, but for what purpose Christ has cleansed his church. Now, when a thing is said to be done that another may afterwards follow, it is idle to conclude that this latter thing, which ought to follow, has been already done. We do not deny that the holiness of the church is already begun; but, so long as there is daily progress, there cannot be perfection. </p>
