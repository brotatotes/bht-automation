<p><b>32.</b><i>This is a great mystery.</i> He concludes by expressing his astonishment at the spiritual union between Christ and the church. <i>This is a great mystery;</i> by which he means, that no language can explain fully what it implies. It is to no purpose that men fret themselves to comprehend, by the judgment of the flesh, the manner and character of this union; for here the infinite power of the Divine Spirit is exerted. Those who refuse to admit anything on this subject beyond what their own capacity can reach, act an exceedingly foolish part. We tell them that the flesh and blood of Christ are exhibited to us in the Lord’s supper. “Explain to us the manner,” they reply, “or you will not convince us.” For my own part, I am overwhelmed by the depth of this mystery, and am not ashamed to join Paul in acknowledging at once my ignorance and my admiration. How much more satisfactory would this be than to follow my carnal judgment, in undervaluing what Paul declares to be a deep mystery! Reason itself teaches how we ought to act in such matters; for whatever is supernatural is clearly beyond our own comprehension. Let us therefore labor more to feel Christ living in us, than to discover the nature of that intercourse. </p>
<p>We cannot avoid admiring the acuteness of the Papists, who conclude from the word <i>mystery</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">μυστήριον</span></blu></grk>) that marriage is one of seven sacraments, as if they had the power of changing water into wine. They enumerate seven sacraments, while Christ has instituted no more than two; and, to prove that matrimony is one of the seven, they produce this passage. On what ground? Because the Vulgate has adopted the word <i>Sacrament</i> (<blu><i>sacramentum</i></blu> ) as a translation of the word <i>Mystery,</i> which the apostle uses. As if Sacrament (<blu><i>sacramentum</i></blu> ) did not frequently, among Latin writers, denote <i>Mystery,</i> or as if <i>Mystery</i> had not been the word employed by Paul in the same Epistle, when speaking of the calling of the Gentiles. But the present question is, Has marriage been appointed as a sacred symbol of the grace of God, to declare and represent to us something spiritual, such as Baptism or the Lord’s Supper? They have no ground for such an assertion, unless it be that they have been deceived by the doubtful signification of a Latin word, or rather by their ignorance of the Greek language. If the simple fact had been observed, that the word used by Paul is <i>Mystery,</i> no mistake would ever have occurred. </p>
<p>We see then the hammer and anvil with which they fabricated this sacrament. But they have given another proof of their indolence in not attending to the correction which is immediately added, </p>
<p><i>But I speak concerning Christ and the church.</i> He intended to give express warning that no man should understand him as speaking of marriage; so that his meaning is more fully expressed than if he had uttered the former sentiment without any exception. The <i>great mystery</i> is, that Christ breathes into the church his own life and power. But who would discover here anything like a sacrament? This blunder arose from the grossest ignorance. </p>
