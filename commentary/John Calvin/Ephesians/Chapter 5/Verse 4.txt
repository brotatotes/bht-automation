<p><b>4.</b><i>Neither filthiness.</i> To those three — other three are now added. By <i>filthiness</i> I understand all that is indecent or inconsistent with the modesty of the godly. By <i>foolish talking</i> I understand conversations that are either unprofitably or wickedly foolish; and as it frequently happens that idle talk is concealed under the garb of <i>jesting</i> or wit, he expressly mentions pleasantry, — which is so agreeable as to seem worthy of commendation, — and condemns it as a part of <i>foolish talking</i> The Greek word<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εὐτραπελία</span></blu></grk> is often used by heathen writers, in a good sense, for that ready and ingenious pleasantry in which able and intelligent men may properly indulge. But as it is exceedingly difficult to be witty without becoming satirical, and as jesting itself carries in it a portion of conceit not at all in keeping with the character of a godly man, Paul very properly dissuades from this practice. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(155)</sup></span> Of all the three offenses now mentioned, Paul declares that they are <i>not convenient,</i> or, in other words, that they are inconsistent with Christian duty. </p>
<p><i>But rather grace.</i> Others render it <i>giving of thanks;</i> but I prefer Jerome’s interpretation. With the vices which had been formerly mentioned it was proper that Paul should contrast something of a general character, displaying itself in all our communications with each other. If he had said, “While they take pleasure in idle or abusive talk, do you give thanks to God,” the exhortation would have been too limited. The Greek word<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, εὐχαριστία,</span></blu></grk> though it usually signifies <i>Thanksgiving,</i> admits of being translated <i>Grace.</i> “All our conversations ought to be, in the true sense of the words, sweet and graceful; and this end will be gained if the useful and the agreeable are properly mingled.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(155)</span> “He doth not condemn the innocent pleasantries and mirth of a cheerful conversation; but that kind of obscene discourse which we mean by the French expression of <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">double entendre</span></i></blu> <i>;</i> when men, for the sake of merriment and sport, convey lewd sentiments and thoughts to others, under chaste and cleanly expressions. This seems to be the proper meaning of the word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εὐτραπελία</span></blu></grk>, <i>jesting,</i> in this place. The original sense of it is, ‘an artfully turned discourse.’ And accordingly it is used either in a good sense, to denote proper wit; or in a bad sense, to signify any kind of lewd and scurrilous discourse, that artfully conveys an ill meaning. And as it is here joined with ‘filthiness and foolish talking,’ it is plain that the apostle intended by it such ambiguous forms of speech as are intended to raise mirth by dishonest and corrupt meanings.” — Chandler. </p>
