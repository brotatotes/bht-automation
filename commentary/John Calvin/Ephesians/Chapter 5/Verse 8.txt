<p><b>8.</b><i>For ye were once darkness.</i> The precepts which immediately follow derive greater weight from the motives with which they are mingled. Having spoken of unbelievers, and warned the Ephesians not to become partakers of their crimes and their destruction, he argues still further, that they ought to differ widely from the life and conduct of those men. At the same time, in order to guard them against ingratitude to God, he refreshes their remembrance of their own past life. “You ought,” he says, “to be very different persons from what you formerly were; for out of darkness God hath made you light.” <i>Darkness</i> is the name here given to the whole nature of man before regeneration; for, where the brightness of God does not shine, there is nothing but fearful darkness. <i>Light,</i> again, is the name given to those who are <i>enlightened</i> by the Spirit of God; for immediately afterwards in the same sense, he calls them <i>children of light,</i> and draws the inference, that they ought to walk in light, because by the mercy of God they had been rescued from darkness. Observe here, we are said to be<i>light in the Lord,</i> because, while we are out of Christ, all is under the dominion of Satan, whom we know to be the Prince of darkness. </p>
