<p><b>9.</b><i>For the fruit of the light.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(157)</sup></span> This parenthesis is introduced, to point out the road in which the <i>children of light</i> ought to walk. A complete description is not given, but a few parts of a holy and pious life are introduced by way of example. To give them a general view of duty, their attention is again directed to the will of God. Whoever desires to live in a proper and safe manner, let him resolve to obey God, and to take his will as the rule. To regulate life entirely by his command is, as he says in another Epistle, <i>a reasonable service,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span>,) or, as another inspired man expresses it, <i>To obey is better than sacrifice.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:22">1 Samuel 15:22</span>.) I wonder how the word Spirit (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πνεὐματος</span></blu></grk>) has crept into many Greek manuscripts, as the other reading is more consistent, — <i>the fruit of the light</i> Paul’s meaning indeed is not affected; for in either case it will be this, that believers must walk in the light, because they are “children of the light.” This is done, when they do not live according to their own will, but devote themselves entirely to obedience to God, — when they undertake nothing but by his command. Besides, such obedience is testified by its fruits, such as <i>goodness, righteousness, and truth.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(157)</span> The English version reads, <i>The fruit of the Spirit</i>; Calvin’s, <i>The fruit of light.</i> Without attempting, in a brief note, to balance the various readings, it may be proper to mention, that, instead of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πνεύματος</span></blu></grk>, (<i>of the Spirit</i>,) many Greek manuscripts have <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">θωτὸς</span></blu></grk>, (<i>of the light</i>,) and the latter reading has been adopted by Griesbach. — <i>Ed</i> </p>
