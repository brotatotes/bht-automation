<p><b>1.</b><i>Children, obey.</i> Why does the apostle use the word <i>obey</i> instead of <i>honor,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(167)</sup></span> which has a greater extent of meaning? It is because <i>Obedience</i> is the evidence of that <i>honor</i> which children owe to their parents, and is therefore more earnestly enforced. It is likewise more difficult; for the human mind recoils from the idea of subjection, and with difficulty allows itself to be placed under the control of another. Experience shews how rare this virtue is; for do we find one among a thousand that is obedient to his parents? By a figure of speech, a part is here put for the whole, but it is the most important part, and is necessarily accompanied by all the others. </p>
<p><i>In the Lord.</i> Besides the law of nature, which is acknowledged by all nations, the obedience of children is enforced by the authority of God. Hence it follows, that parents are to be obeyed, so far only as is consistent with piety to God, which comes first in order. If the command of God is the rule by which the submission of children is to be regulated, it would be foolish to suppose that the performance of this duty could lead away from God himself. </p>
<p><i>For this is right.</i> This is added in order to restrain the fierceness which, we have already said, appears to be natural to almost all men. He proves it to be <i>right,</i> because God has commanded it; for we are not at liberty to dispute, or call in question, the appointment of him whose will is the unerring rule of goodness and righteousness. That <i>honor</i> should be represented as including <i>obedience</i> is not surprising; for mere ceremony is of no value in the sight of God. The precept, <i>honor thy father and mother,</i> comprehends all the duties by which the sincere affection and respect of children to their parents can be expressed. </p>
