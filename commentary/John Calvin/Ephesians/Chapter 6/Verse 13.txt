<p><b>13.</b><i>Wherefore take unto you.</i> Though our enemy is so powerful, Paul does not infer that we must throw away our spears, but that we must prepare our minds for the battle. A promise of victory is, indeed, involved in the exhortation, <i>that ye may be able.</i> If we only <i>put on the whole armor of God,</i> and fight valiantly to the end, we shall certainly <i>stand.</i> On any other supposition, we would be discouraged by the number and variety of the contests; and therefore he adds, <i>in the evil day.</i> By this expression he rouses them from security, bids them prepare themselves for hard, painful, and dangerous conflicts, and, at the same time, animates them with the hope of victory; for amidst the greatest dangers they will be safe. <i>And having done all.</i> They are thus directed to cherish confidence through the whole course of life. There will be no danger which may not be successfully met by the power of God; nor will any who, with this assistance, fight against Satan, fail in the day of battle. </p>
