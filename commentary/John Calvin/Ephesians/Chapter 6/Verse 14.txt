<p><b>14.</b><i>Stand therefore.</i> Now follows a description of the arms which they were enjoined to wear. We must not, however, inquire very minutely into the meaning of each word; for an allusion to military customs is all that was intended. Nothing can be more idle than the extraordinary pains which some have taken to discover the reason why <i>righteousness</i> is made a <i>breastplate,</i> instead of a <i>girdle.</i> Paul’s design was to touch briefly on the most important points required in a Christian, and to adapt them to the comparison which he had already used. </p>
<p><i>Truth,</i> which means sincerity of mind, is compared to a <i>girdle.</i> Now, a girdle was, in ancient times, one of the most important parts of military armor. Our attention is thus directed to the fountain of sincerity; for the purity of the gospel ought to remove from our minds all guile, and from our hearts all hypocrisy. Secondly, he recommends <i>righteousness,</i> and desires that it should be a <i>breastplate</i> for protecting the breast. Some imagine that this refers to a freely bestowed righteousness, or the imputation of righteousness, by which pardon of sin is obtained. But such matters ought not, I think, to have been mentioned on the present occasion; for the subject now under discussion is a blameless life. He enjoins us to be adorned, first, with integrity, and next with a devout and holy life. </p>
