<p><b>17.</b><i>And take the helmet of salvation.</i> In a passage already quoted, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:8">1 Thessalonians 5:8</span>,) “the <i>hope</i> of salvation” is said to be a <i>helmet,</i> which I consider to be in the same sense as this passage. The head is protected by the best <i>helmet,</i> when, elevated by <i>hope,</i> we look up towards heaven to that <i>salvation</i> which is promised. It is only therefore by becoming the object of <i>hope</i> that <i>salvation</i> is a <i>helmet.</i> </p>
