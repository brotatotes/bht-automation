<p><b>23.</b><i>Peace be to the brethren.</i> I consider the word <i>peace,</i> as in the salutations of the Epistles, to mean <i>prosperity.</i> Yet if the reader shall prefer to view it as signifying <i>harmony,</i> because, immediately afterwards, Paul mentions <i>love,</i> I do not object to that interpretation, or rather, it agrees better with the context. He wishes the Ephesians to be peaceable and quiet among themselves; and this, he presently adds, may be obtained by brotherly <i>love</i> and by agreement in <i>faith</i> From this prayer we learn that <i>faith</i> and <i>love,</i> as well as <i>peace</i> itself, are gifts of God bestowed upon us through Christ, â€” that they come equally <i>from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</i> </p>
