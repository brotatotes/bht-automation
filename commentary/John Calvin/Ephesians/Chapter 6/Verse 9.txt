<p><b>9.</b><i>And ye masters.</i> In the treatment of their slaves, the laws granted to masters a vast amount of power. Whatever had thus been sanctioned by the civil code was regarded by many as in itself lawful. To such an extent did their cruelty in some instances proceed, that the Roman emperors were forced to restrain their tyranny. But though no royal edicts had ever been issued for the protection of slaves, God allows to masters no power over them beyond what is consistent with the law of love. When philosophers attempt to give to the principles of equity their full effect in restraining the excess of severity to slaves, they inculcate that masters ought to treat them in the same manner as hired servants. But they never look beyond utility; and, in judging even of that, they inquire only what is advantageous to the head of the family, or conducive to good order. The Apostle proceeds on a very different principle. He lays down what is lawful according to the Divine appointment, and how far they, too, are debtors to their servants. </p>
<p><i>Do the same things to them.</i> “Perform the duty which on your part you owe to them.” What he calls in another Epistle, (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὸ δίκαιον καὶ τὴν ἰσότητα</span></blu></grk>) <i>that which is just and equal,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(169)</sup></span> is precisely what, in this passage, he calls <i>the same things,</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὰ αὐτὰ.</span></blu></grk>) And what is this but the law of analogy? Masters and servants are not indeed on the same level; but there is a mutual law which binds them. By this law, servants are placed under the authority of their masters; and, by the same law, due regard being had to the difference of their station, masters lie under certain obligations to their servants. This analogy is greatly misunderstood; because men do not try it by the law of love, which is the only true standard. Such is the import of Paul’s phrase, <i>the same things;</i> for we are all ready enough to demand what is due to ourselves; but, when our own duty comes to be performed, every one attempts to plead exemption. It is chiefly, however, among persons of authority and rank that injustice of this sort prevails. </p>
<p><i>Forbearing threatenings.</i> Every expression of disdain, arising from the pride of masters, is included in the single word, <i>threatenings.</i> They are charged not to assume a lordly air or a terrific attitude, as if they were constantly threatening some evil against their servants, when they have occasion to address them. Threatenings, and every kind of barbarity, originate in this, that masters look upon their servants as if they had been born for their sake alone, and treat them as if they were of no more value than cattle. Under this one description, Paul forbids every kind of disdainful and barbarous treatment. </p>
<p><i>Their Master and yours.</i> A very necessary warning. What is there which we will not dare to attempt against our inferiors, if they have no ability to resist, and no means of obtaining redress, — if no avenger, no protector appears, none who will be moved by compassion to listen to their complaints? It happens here, in short, according to the common proverb, that Impunity is the mother of Licentiousness. But Paul here reminds them, that, while masters possess authority over their servants, they have themselves the same Master in heaven, to whom they must render an account. </p>
<p><i>And there is no respect of persons with him.</i> A regard to <i>persons</i> blinds our eyes, so as to leave no room for law or justice; but Paul affirms that it is of no value in the sight of God. By <i>person</i> is meant anything about a man which does not belong to the real question, and which we take into account in forming a judgment. Relationship, beauty, rank, wealth, friendship, and everything of this sort, gain our favor; while the opposite qualities produce contempt and sometimes hatred. As those absurd feelings arising from the sight of a <i>person</i> have the greatest possible influence on human judgments, those who are invested with power are apt to flatter themselves, as if God would countenance such corruptions. “Who is he that God should regard him, or defend his interest against mine?” Paul, on the contrary, informs masters that they are mistaken if they suppose that their servants will be of little or no account before God, because they are so before men. “God is no respecter of persons,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:34">Acts 10:34</span>,) and the cause of the meanest man will not be a whit less regarded by him than that of the loftiest monarch. </p>
