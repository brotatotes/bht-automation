<p><b>7.</b><i>Which is not another thing</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(20)</sup></span> Some explain it thus, “though there is not another gospel;” as if it were a sort of correction of the Apostle’s language, to guard against the supposition that there were more gospels than one. So far as the explanation of the words is concerned, I take a more simple view of them; for he speaks contemptuously of the doctrine of the false apostles, as being nothing else than a mass of confusion and destruction. As if he had said, “What do those persons allege? On what grounds do they attack the doctrine which I have delivered? They merely trouble you, and subvert the gospel. They do nothing more.” But it amounts to the same meaning; for this, too, I acknowledge, is a correction of the language he had used about <i>another gospel</i>. He declares that it is not a gospel, but a mere disturbance. All I intended to say was, that, in my opinion, the word <i>another</i> means <i>another thing</i>. It resembles strongly the expression in common use, “this amounts to <i>nothing, but that</i> you wish to deceive.” </p>
<p><i>And wish to pervert.</i> He charges them with the additional crime of doing an injury to Christ, by endeavoring to subvert his gospel. Subversion is an enormous crime. It is worse than corruption. And with good reason does he fasten on them this charge. When the glow of justification is ascribed to another, and a snare is laid for the consciences of men, the Savior no longer occupies his place, and the doctrine of the gospel is utterly ruined. </p>
<p><i>The gospel of Christ</i>. To know what are the leading points of the gospel, is a matter of unceasing importance. When these are attacked, the gospel is destroyed. When he adds the words, <i>of Christ</i>, this may be explained in two ways; either that it has come from Christ as its author, or that it purely exhibits Christ. The apostle’s reason for employing that expression unquestionably was to describe the true and genuine gospel, which alone is worthy of the name. </p>
