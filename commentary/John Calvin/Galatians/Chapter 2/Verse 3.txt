<p><b>3.</b><i>But neither Titus</i>. This is an additional argument to prove that the Apostles held the same views with himself; for he had brought to them an uncircumcised man, whom they did not hesitate to acknowledge as a brother. The reason is assigned why he was not circumcised; for circumcision, being a matter of indifference, might be neglected or practiced as edification required. Our invariable rule of action is, that, if “all things are lawful for us,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:23">1 Corinthians 10:23</span>) we ought to inquire what is expedient. He circumcises Timothy, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:3">Acts 16:3</span>,) in order to take away a ground of offense from weak minds; for he was at that time dealing with weak minds, which it was his duty to treat with tenderness. And he would gladly have done the same thing with Titus, for he was unwearied in his endeavors to “support (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:35">Acts 20:35</span>) the weak;” but the case was different. For some false brethren were watching for an opportunity of slandering his doctrine, and would immediately have spread the report: “See how the valiant champion of liberty, when he comes into the presence of the apostles, lays aside the bold and fierce aspect which he is wont to assume among the ignorant!” Now, as it is our duty to “bear the infirmities of the weak,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:1">Romans 15:1</span>,) so concealed foes, who purposely watch for our liberty, must, be vigorously resisted. The duties of love to our neighbor ought never to be injurious to faith; and therefore, in matters of indifference, the love of our neighbour will be our best guide, provided that faith shall always receive our first regard. </p>
