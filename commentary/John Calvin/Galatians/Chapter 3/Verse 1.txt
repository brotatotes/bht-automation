<p><b>1.</b><i>O foolish Galatians</i>. An expostulation is here interwoven — I should rather say, inserted — amidst his doctrinal statements. Some will wonder that he did not delay it to the close of the Epistle, but the very serious nature of the errors which he has brought forward unquestionably roused him to a burst of passion. When we hear that the Son of God, with all his benefits, is rejected, that his death is esteemed as nothing, what pious mind would not break out into indignation? He therefore declares that those who allowed themselves to be involved in so heinous a crime must have been<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀνόητοι,</span></blu></grk> that is, “disordered in mind.” He accuses them not only of having suffered themselves to be deceived, but of having been carried away by some sort of magical enchantment, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(54)</sup></span> which is a still more serious charge. He insinuates that their fall partook more of madness than of folly. </p>
<p>Some think that Paul refers to the temper of the nation, that, being sprung from barbarians, it was more difficult to train them; but I rather think that he refers to the subject itself. It looks like something supernatural, that, after enjoying the gospel in such clearness, they should be affected by the delusions of Satan. He does not merely say that they were “bewitched” and “disordered in mind,” because they did not obey the truth; but because, after having received instruction so clear, so full, so tender, and so powerful, they immediately fell away. Erasmus has chosen to interpret the words, “that ye should not <i>believe</i> the truth.” I am not quite prepared to set aside that rendering, but would prefer the word <i>obey</i>, because Paul does not charge them with having, from the outset, rejected the gospel, but with not having persevered in obedience. </p>
<p><i>Before whose eyes</i>. This is intended, as I have already hinted, to express an aggravation; for, the better opportunities they had of knowing Christ, the more heinous was the criminality of forsaking him. Such, he tells them, was the clearness of his doctrine, that it was not naked doctrine, but the express, living image of Christ. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(55)</sup></span> They had known Christ in such a manner, that they might be almost said to have seen him. </p>
<p><i>Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth</i>. Augustine’s interpretation of the word<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">προεγράφη,</span></blu></grk> (“hath been set forth,”) is harsh, and inconsistent with Paul’s design. He makes it to signify that Christ was to be thrust out from possession. Others propose a different phrase, (<i>proscriptus</i>,) which, if used in the sense of “openly proclaimed,” would not be inapplicable. The Greeks, accordingly, borrow from this verb the word<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">προγράμματα,</span></blu></grk> to denote boards on which property intended to be sold was published, so as to be exposed to the view of all. But the participle, <i>painted</i>, is less ambiguous, and, in my own opinion, is exceedingly appropriate. To shew how energetic his preaching was, Paul first compares it to a picture, which exhibited to them, in a lively manner, the image of Christ. </p>
<p>But, not satisfied with this comparison, he adds, <i>Christ hath been crucified among you,</i> intimating that the actual sight of Christ’s death could not have affected them more powerfully than his own preaching. The view given by some, that the Galatians had “crucified to themselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:6">Hebrews 6:6</span>) the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame;” that they had withdrawn from the purity of the gospel; or, at least, had lent their ear, and given their confidence, to impostors who crucified him, — appears to me overstrained. The meaning therefore is, that Paul’s doctrine had instructed them concerning Christ in such a manner as if he had been exhibited to them in a picture, nay, “crucified among them.” Such a representation could not have been made by any eloquence, or by “enticing words of man’s wisdom,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:4">1 Corinthians 2:4</span>,) had it not been accompanied by that power of the Spirit, of which Paul has treated largely in both the Epistles to the Corinthians. </p>
<p>Let those who would discharge aright the ministry of the gospel learn, not merely to speak and declaim, but to penetrate into the consciences of men, to make them see Christ crucified, and feel the shedding of his blood. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(56)</sup></span> When the Church has painters such as these, she no longer needs the dead images of wood and stone, she no longer requires pictures; both of which, unquestionably, were first admitted to Christian temples when the pastors had become dumb and been converted into mere idols, or when they uttered a few words from the pulpit in such a cold and careless manner, that the power and efficacy of the ministry were utterly extinguished. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(54)</span> “<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Βασκαίνειν</span></blu></grk>, ‘to enchant, to fascinate, to delude by magical charms,’ — -rather an uncommon word, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἃπαξ λεγόμενον</span></blu></grk> in the New Testament. It may amuse to notice the etumon of the word. Some grammarians have strangely thought it derived from <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">φάεσι καίνειν</span></blu></grk>, ‘to kill with the eyes.’ Its true etymology obviously is, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">βάω, βάσκω, βασκάω βασκαίνω. βάσκω</span></blu></grk> (equivalent to <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">φάσκω</span></blu></grk>,), ‘to say, to speak,’ comes, in the form <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">βασκαίνω</span></blu></grk>, to signify <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κακολογεῖν</span></blu></grk>, ‘to calumniate,’ then ‘to deceive,’ then ‘to deceive by magical arts.’” — Brown. </p>

How, then, does he say, ‘Among you?’ To demonstrate the power of faith, which is able to see even distant objects, And he does not say, ‘Was crucified,’ but ‘Was painted crucified,’ shewing that by the eyes of faith they beheld more distinctly than some who were present and saw the transactions.” — Chrysostom. </p>
