<p><b>18.</b><i>If the inheritance be of the law</i>. His opponents might still reply, that nothing was farther from their intention than to weaken or disannul God’s covenant. To deprive them of every kind of subterfuge, he comes forward with the assertion, that salvation by the law, and salvation by the promise of God, are wholly inconsistent with each other. Who will dare to explain this as applying to ceremonies alone, while Paul comprehends under it whatever interferes with a free promise? Beyond all doubt, he excludes works of every description. “For,” says he to the Romans, </p>
<p>“if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,<br/>and the promise made of none effect.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:14">Romans 4:14</span>.) </p>
<p>Why so? Because salvation would be suspended on the condition of satisfying the law; and so he immediately concludes: </p>
<p>“Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, in order that the promise might be sure to all the seed.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:16">Romans 4:16</span>.) </p>
<p>Let us carefully remember the reason why, in comparing the promise with the law, the establishment of the one overturns the other. The reason is, that the promise has respect to faith, and the law to works. Faith receives what is freely given, but to works a reward is paid. And he immediately adds, <i>God gave it to Abraham</i>, not by requiring some sort of compensation on his part, but by free promise; for if you view it as conditional, the word <i>gave</i>, (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κεχάρισται,</span></blu></grk>) would be utterly inapplicable. </p>
