<p><b>24.</b><i>Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster</i> This is the second comparison, which still more clearly expresses Paul’s design. A schoolmaster is not appointed for the whole life, but only for childhood, as the etymology of the Greek word<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">παιδαγωγός</span></blu></grk> implies. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(63)</sup></span> Besides, in training a child, the object is to prepare him, by the instructions of childhood, for maturer years. The comparison applies in both respects to the law, for its authority was limited to a particular age, and its whole object was to prepare its scholars in such a manner, that, when its elementary instructions were closed, they might make progress worthy of manhood. And so he adds, that it was our schoolmaster (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἰς Χριστὸν</span></blu></grk>) <i>unto Christ</i>. The grammarian, when he has trained a boy, delivers him into the hands of another, who conducts him through the higher branches of a finished education. In like manner, the law was the grammar of theology, which, after carrying its scholars a short way, handed them over to <i>faith</i> to be completed. Thus, Paul compares the Jews to children, and us to advanced youth. </p>
<p>But a question arises, what was the instruction or education of this schoolmaster? First, the law, by displaying the justice of God, convinced them that in themselves they were unrighteous; for in the commandments of God, as in a mirror, they might see how far they were distant from true righteousness. They were thus reminded that righteousness must be sought in some other quarter. The promises of the law served the same purpose, and might lead to such reflections as these: “If you cannot obtain life by works but by fulfilling the law, some new and different method must be sought. Your weakness will never allow you to ascend so high; nay, though you desire and strive ever so much, you will fall far short of the object.” The threatenings, on the other hand, pressed and entreated them to seek refuge from the wrath and curse of God, and gave them no rest till they were constrained to seek the grace of Christ. </p>
<p>Such too, was the tendency of all the ceremonies; for what end did sacrifices and washings serve but to keep the mind continually fixed on pollution and condemnation? When a man’s uncleanness is placed before his eyes, when the unoffending animal is held forth as the image of his own death, how can he indulge in sleep? How can he but be roused to the earnest cry for deliverance? Beyond all doubt, ceremonies accomplished their object, not merely by alarming and humbling the conscience, but by exciting them to the faith of the coming Redeemer. In the imposing services of the Mosaic ritual, every thing that was presented to the eye bore an impress of Christ. The law, in short, was nothing else than an immense variety of exercises, in which the worshippers were led by the hand to Christ. </p>
<p><i>That we might be justified by faith</i>. He has already said that the law is not perfect, when he compared it to the training of childhood; but it would make men perfect if it bestowed upon them righteousness. What remains but that faith shall take its place? And so it does, when we, who are destitute of a righteousness of our own, are clothed by it with the righteousness of Christ. Thus is the saying accomplished, “he hath filled the hungry with good things.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:53">Luke 1:53</span>.) </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(63)</span> “As the law was before compared to a <i>jailer</i>, so it is here likened to a <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">παιδαγωγός</span></blu></grk>, by which term is not to be understood a <i>schoolmaster</i>, (for that would have been <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">διδάσκαλος</span></blu></grk>,) but the paedagous or person (usually a freedman or slave) who conducted children to and from school, attended them out of school hours, formed their manners, superintended their moral conduct, and in various respects prepared them for the <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">διδάσκαλος</span></blu></grk>.” — Bloomfield.
