<p><b>8.</b><i>The scripture foreseeing</i>. What he had said in a general manner is now applied expressly to the Gentiles; for the calling of the Gentiles was a new and extraordinary occurrence. Doubts existed as to the manner in which they should be called. Some thought that they were required “to be circumcised and to keep the law,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:24">Acts 15:24</span>,) and that otherwise they were shut out from having a share in the covenant. But Paul shews, on the other hand, that by faith they arrive at the blessing, and by faith they must be “in grafted” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:17">Romans 11:17</span>,) into the family of Abraham. How does he prove this? Because it is said, <i>In thee shall all nations be blessed</i>. These words unquestionably recall that all must be blessed in the same manner as Abraham; for he is the model, nay, the rule, to be universally observed. Now, he obtained the blessing by faith, and in the same manner must it be obtained by all. </p>
