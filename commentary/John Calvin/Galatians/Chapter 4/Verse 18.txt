<p><b>18.</b><i>But it is good to be the object of jealousy.</i> It is hard to say whether this refers to himself or to the Galatians. Good ministers are exhorted to cherish holy jealousy in watching over the churches, </p>
<p>“that they may present them as a chaste virgin to Christ.”<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span>.) </p>
<p>If it refers to Paul, the meaning will be: “I confess that I also am jealous of you, but with a totally different design: and I do so as much when I am absent as when I am present, because I do not seek my own advantage.” But I am rather inclined to view it as referring to the Galatians, though in this case it will admit of more than one interpretation. It may mean: “They indeed attempt to withdraw your affections from me, that, when you are thrown destitute, you may go over to them; but do you, who loved me while I was present, continue to cherish the same regard for me when I am absent.” But a more correct explanation is suggested by the opposite senses which the word<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ζηλοῦσθαι</span></blu></grk> bears. As, in the former verse, he had used the word <i>jealous</i> in a bad sense, denoting an improper way of accomplishing an object, so here he uses it in a good sense, denoting a zealous imitation of the good qualities of another. By condemning improper jealousy, he now exhorts the Galatians to engage in a different sort of competition, and that, too, while he was absent. </p>
