<p><b>10.</b><i>I have confidence in you</i>. All his fierceness is again directed against the false apostles. To them the evil is traced, and on them the punishment is threatened. Good hopes are expressed regarding the Galatians, that they will quickly and readily return to a sincere belief. It gives us courage to learn that good hopes are entertained about us; for we reckon it shameful to disappoint those whose feelings towards us are kind and friendly. But to bring back the Galatians to the pure doctrine of faith, from which they had turned aside, was the work of God. The apostle says that he has confidence in them<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, ἐν Κυρίῳ,</span></blu></grk> <i>through the Lord</i>, by which he reminds them that repentance is a heavenly gift, and that they must ask it from God. </p>
<p><i>He that troubleth you</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(86)</sup></span> The sentiment which he had just delivered is confirmed by thus indirectly imputing the greater part of the blame to those impostors by whom the Galatians had been deceived. From the punishment denounced against <i>them</i>, the Galatians are very nearly exempted. Let all who introduce confusion into churches, who break the unity of faith, who destroy their harmony, lend an ear to this; and if they have any right feeling, let them tremble at this word. God declares, by the mouth of Paul, that none “through whom such offenses come” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:1">Luke 17:1</span>) will pass unpunished. The phrase, <i>whosoever he be</i>, is emphatic; for the high sounding language of the false apostles had terrified the ignorant multitude. It became necessary for Paul to defend his doctrine with corresponding warmth and energy, and not to spare any one who dared to raise his voice against it, however eminent or however distinguished. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(86)</span> “However, he ‘that troubleth you,’ or rather, ‘perplexes and unsettles you;’ as if this was <i>all</i> he could do, — not <i>teach</i> them. So Galen, cited by Wetstein; <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ταράττοντες μόνον τοὺς μανθάνοντας, διδάσκοντες δὲ οὐδέν</span></blu></grk>, ‘only troubling the scholars, and teaching them nothing.’ The use of the singular will not prove that there was no more than <i>one</i> false teacher; since it may be used collectively. Yet the apostle seems to glance at one, the principal of them; and by <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὅστις ἄν ᾖ</span></blu></grk>, ‘whosoever he be,’ we may infer that he was a person of some consequence.” — Bloomfield. </p>
