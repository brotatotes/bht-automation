<p><b>25.</b><i>If we live in the Spirit.</i> According to his usual custom, the apostle draws from the doctrine a practical exhortation. The death of the flesh is the life of the Spirit. If the Spirit of God lives in us, let him govern our actions. There will always be many persons daring enough to make a false boast of living in the Spirit, but the apostle challenges them to a proof of the fact. As the soul does not remain idle in the body, but gives motion and rigour to every member and part, so the Spirit of God cannot dwell in us without manifesting himself by the outward effects. By the <i>life</i> is here meant the inward power, and by the <i>walk</i> the outward actions. The metaphorical use of the word <i>walk</i>, which frequently occurs, describes works as evidences of the spiritual life. </p>
