<p><b>5.</b><i>For we through the Spirit</i>. He now anticipates an objection that, might readily occur. “Will circumcision then be of no use?” <i>In Jesus Christ</i>, he replies, it <i>availeth</i> nothing. <i>Righteousness</i>, therefore, depends on faith, and is obtained, through the Spirit, without ceremonies. To <i>wait for the hope of righteousness</i>, is to place our confidence in this or that object, or, to decide from what quarter righteousness is to be expected; though the words probably contain the exhortation, “Let us continue steadfastly in the hope of righteousness which we obtain by faith.” When he says that we obtain righteousness by faith, this applies equally to us and to our fathers. All of them, as Scripture testifies, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:5">Hebrews 11:5</span>,) “pleased God;” but their faith was concealed by the veil of ceremonies, and therefore he distinguishes us from them by the word <i>Spirit</i>, which is contrasted with outward shadows. His meaning therefore is, that all that is now necessary for obtaining righteousness is a simple faith, which declines the aid of splendid ceremonies, and is satisfied with the spiritual worship of God. </p>
