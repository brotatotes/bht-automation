Such an admonition would not be entitled to much regard, were it not supported by the authority of the speaker. But Paul, to whom the Galatians had been indebted for the announcement of their Divine calling, was well entitled to address them in this confident language. This is the reason why he does not directly say, <i>from God</i>, but expresses it by a circumlocution, <i>him that hath called you</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(85)</sup></span> As if he had said, “God is never inconsistent with himself, and he it is who by my preaching called you to salvation. This new persuasion then has come from some other quarter; and if you wish to have it thought that your calling is from God, beware of lending an ear to those who thrust upon you their new inventions.” Though the Greek participle<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καλοῦντος,</span></blu></grk> I acknowledge, is in the present tense, I have preferred translating, <i>who hath called you</i>, in order to remove the ambiguity. </p>

It comes from a very different quarter. The men who have employed it are not moved by <i>his</i> spirit. They have no divine authority; and you ought not to yield to them, no, not for an hour.’“ — Brown. </p>
