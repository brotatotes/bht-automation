<p><b>16.</b><i>And as many as walk according to this rule</i>. “May they enjoy all prosperity and happiness!” This is not merely a prayer in their behalf, but a token of approbation. His meaning therefore is, that those who teach this doctrine are worthy of all esteem and regard, and those who reject it do not deserve to be heard. The word <i>rule</i> denotes the regular and habitual course which all godly ministers of the gospel ought to pursue. Architects employ a model in the erection of buildings, to assist them in preserving the proper form and just proportions. Such a <i>model</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κανόνα</span></blu></grk>) does the apostle prescribe to the ministers of the word, who are to build the church “according to the pattern shewn to them.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>.) </p>
<p>Faithful and upright teachers, and all who allow themselves to conform to this rule, must derive singular encouragement from this passage, in which God, by the mouth of Paul, pronounces on them a blessing. We have no cause to dread the thunders of the Pope, if God promises to us from heaven <i>peace</i> and <i>mercy</i>. The word <i>walk</i> may apply both to a minister and to his people, though it refers chiefly to ministers. The future tense of the verb, (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὅσοι στοιχήσουσιν,</span></blu></grk>) as many as <i>shall walk</i>, is intended to express perseverance. </p>
<p><i>And upon the Israel of God</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(101)</sup></span> This is an indirect ridicule of the vain boasting of the false apostles, who vaunted of being the descendants of Abraham according to the flesh. There are two classes who bear this name, a pretended Israel, which appears to be so in the sight of men, — and the Israel of God. Circumcision was a disguise before men, but regeneration is a truth before God. In a word, he gives the appellation of the <i>Israel of God</i> to those whom he formerly denominated the children of Abraham by faith, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:29">Galatians 3:29</span>,) and thus includes all believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, who were united into one church. On the contrary, the name and lineage are the sole boast of Israel according to the flesh; and this led the apostle to argue in the Epistle to the Romans, that “they are not all Israel which are of Israel, neither because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:6">Romans 9:6</span>.) </p>
