<p><b>18.</b><i>The grace</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(105)</sup></span> <i>of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit</i>. His prayer is not only that God may bestow upon them his grace in large measure, but that they may have a proper feeling of it in their hearts. Then only is it truly enjoyed by us, when it comes to our <i>spirit</i>. We ought therefore to entreat that God would prepare in our souls a habitation for his grace. Amen. </p>
