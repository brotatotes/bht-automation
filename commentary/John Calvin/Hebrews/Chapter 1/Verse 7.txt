<p><b>7.</b><i>And to the angels, etc.</i> To the angels means <i>of</i> the angels. But the passage quoted seems to have been turned to another meaning from what it appears to have; for as David is there describing the manner in which we see the world to be governed, nothing is more certain than the winds are mentioned, which he says are made messengers by the Lord, for he employs them as his runners; so also, when he purifies the air by lightnings, he shows what quick and swift ministers he has to obey his orders. But this has nothing to do with angels. Some have had recourse to an allegory, as though the Apostle explained the plain, and as they say, the literal sense allegorically of angels. But it seems preferable to me to consider this testimony is brought forward for this purpose, that it might by a similitude be applied to angels, and in this way David compares winds to angels, because they perform offices in this world similar to what the angels do in heaven; for the winds are, as it were, visible spirits. And, doubtless, as Moses, describing the creation of the world, mentioned only those things which are subject to our senses, and yet intended that higher things should be understood; so David in describing the world and nature, represented to us on a tablet what ought to be understood respecting the celestial orders. Hence I think that the argument is one of likeness or similarity, when the Apostle transfers to angels what properly applies to the winds. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(22)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(22)</span> Many have been the explanations of this sentence; but this is the most suitable to the passage as it occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+104:4">Psalms 104:4</span>, and to the design of the Apostle; it is the one adopted by Doddridge, Stuart, and Bloomfield. </p>
<p>The meaning would be thus more apparent, — “Who maketh like his angels the winds, and like his ministers the flaming fire,” that is, the winds are subject to him as the angels are, and also the flaming fire as his ministers or attendants.
