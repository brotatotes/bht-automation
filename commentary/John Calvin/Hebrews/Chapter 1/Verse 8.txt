<p><b>8.</b><i>But to the Son, etc.</i> It must indeed be allowed, that this Psalm was composed as a marriage song for Solomon; for here is celebrated his marriage with the daughter of the king of Egypt; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(23)</sup></span> but it cannot yet be denied but that what is here related, is much too high to be applied to Solomon. The Jews, that they may not be forced to own Christ to be called God, make an evasion by saying, it at the throne of God is spoken of, or that the verb “established” is to be understood. So that, according to the first exposition, the word Elohim, God, is to be in construction with throne, “the throne of God;” and that according to the second, it is supposed to be a defective sentence. But these are mere evasions. Whosoever will read the verse, who is of a sound mind and free from the spirit of contention, cannot doubt but that the Messiah is called God. Nor is there any reason to object, that the word Elohim is sometimes given to angels and to judges; for it is never found to be given simply to one person, except to God alone. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(24)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Farther, that I may not contend about a word, whose throne can be said to be established <i>forever</i>, except that of God only? Hence the perpetuity of his kingdom is an evidence of his divinity. </p>
<p>The <i>scepter</i> of Christ’s kingdom is afterwards called the scepter of righteousness; of this there were some, though obscure, lineaments in Solomon; he exhibited them as far as he acted as a just king and zealous for what was right. But righteousness in the kingdom of Christ has a wider meaning; for he by his gospel, which is his spiritual scepter, renews us after the righteousness of God. The same thing must be also understood of his <i>love</i> of righteousness; for he causes it to reign in his own people, because he loves it. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(23)</span> It is generally admitted to be a kind of epithalamium, but not on the occasion here specified, as there was nothing in that marriage that in any degree correspond with the contents of the Psalm. Such was the opinion of Beza, Dr. Owen, Scott, and Horsley. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(24)</span> The Hebrew will admit of no other construction than that given in our version and by Calvin. The Greek version, the Sept., which the Apostle adopts, seems at first view to be different, as “God” is in the nominative case<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, ὁ Θεὸς;</span></blu></grk> but the Sept. used in commonly instead of the vocative case. We meet with two instances in the seventh Psalm, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+7:1">Psalms 7:1</span>, and in connection with “Lord<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">,” κύριε</span></blu></grk> in the vocative case. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+10:12">Psalms 10:12</span>, etc. </p>
<p>The Vulgate, following literally the Sept., without regarding the preceding peculiarity, has rendered “God” in the nominative, “<blu>Deus</blu>,” and not “<blu>O Deus</blu>.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
