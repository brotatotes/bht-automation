<p><b>33.</b><i>Partly, whilst ye were made, etc.</i> We see who they were whom he addresses, even those whose faith had been proved by no common trials, and yet he refrains not from exhorting them to greater things. Let no man therefore deceive himself by self-flattery as though he had reached the goal, or had no need of incentives from others. </p>
<p>Now he says, that they had been <i>made gazingstocks both by reproaches and afflictions,</i> or exposed to public shame by reproaches and distresses, as though they were exposed on a public theater. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(192)</sup></span> We hence learn that the persecutions which they had sustained were remarkably severe. But we ought especially to notice the latter clause, when he says that they became <i>companions</i>, or associates of the godly in their persecutions; for as it is Christ’s cause for which all the godly contend, and as it is what their contend for in common, whatever one of them suffers, all the rest ought to transfer, as it were, to themselves; and this is what ought by all means to be done by us, unless we would separate ourselves from Christ himself. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(193)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(192)</span> The words may be rendered, “When ye were publicly exposed to reproaches and afflictions,” or, to revilings and persecutions. They were reproached with bad names, or reviled, and also oppressed and persecuted. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(193)</span> The latter clause of this verse is rendered the same as in our version by Beza and Macknight, while Grotius, Doddridge, Stuart and Bloomfield, give in effect this rendering, “when ye became partakers (i.e., in sympathy, and in their losses) with those who were so treated.” It signifies, says Grotius, that they sympathized with their brethren in their calamities, and also succored them as far as they could by praying for them, and administering to their wants. In <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:30">Matthew 23:30</span><grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, κοινωνοὶ αὐτῶν</span></blu></grk> is rendered, “partakers with them,” or sharers with them; and so it might be rendered here, “sharers with those who were so treated,” i.e., sharers in reproach and suffering. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
