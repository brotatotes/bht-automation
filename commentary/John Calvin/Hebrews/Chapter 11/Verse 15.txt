<p><b>15.</b><i>And truly if they had been mindful, etc.</i> He anticipates an objection that might have been made, — that they were strangers because they had left their own country. The apostle meets this objection, and says, that though they called themselves strangers, they yet did not think of Mesopotamia; for if they had a desire to return, they might have done so: but they had willingly banished themselves from it, nay, they had disowned it, as though it did not belong to them. By another country, then, they meant, that which is beyond this world. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(224)</sup></span> </p>
