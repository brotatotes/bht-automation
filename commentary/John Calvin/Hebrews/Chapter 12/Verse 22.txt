<p><b>22.</b><i>Unto mount Sion, etc.</i> He alludes to those prophecies in which God had formerly promised that his Gospel should thence go forth, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:1">Isaiah 2:1</span>, and in other places. Then he contrasts mount Sion with mount Sinai; and he further adds, <i>the heavenly Jerusalem,</i> and he expressly calls it heavenly, that the Jews might not cleave to that which was earthly, and which had flourished under the Law; for when they sought perversely to continue under the slavish yoke of the Law, mount Sion was turned into mount Sinai as Paul teaches us in the <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:21">Galatians 4:21</span> of the Epistle to the Galatians. Then by the heavenly Jerusalem he understood that which was to be built throughout the whole world, even as the angel, mentioned by Zechariah, extended his line from the east even to the west. </p>
<p><i>To an innumerable company of angels, etc.</i> He means that we are associated with angels, chosen into the ranks of patriarchs, and placed in heaven among all the spirits of the blessed, when Christ by the Gospel calls us to himself. But it is an incalculable honor, conferred upon us by our heavenly Father, that he should enroll us among angels and the holy fathers. The expression, <i>myriads of angels,</i> in taken from the book of Daniel, though I have followed Erasmus, and rendered it <i>innumerable company of angels.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(266)</sup></span> </p>
