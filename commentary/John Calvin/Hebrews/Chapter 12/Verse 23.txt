<p><b>23.</b><i>The firstborn, etc.</i> He does not call the children of God indiscriminately the firstborn, for the Scripture calls many his children who are not of this number; but for the sake of honor he adorns with this distinction the patriarchs and other renowned saints of the ancient Church. He adds, which are written in heaven, because God is said to have all the elect enrolled in his book or secret catalogue, as Ezekiel speaks. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(267)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>The judge of all, etc.</i> This seems to have been said to inspire fear, as though he had said, that grace is in such a way altered to us, that we ought still to consider that we have to do with a judge, to whom an account must be given if we presumptuously intrude into his sanctuary polluted and profane. </p>
<p><i>The spirits of just men, etc.</i> He adds this to intimate that we are joined to holy souls, which have put off their bodies, and left behind them all the filth of this world; and hence he says that they are consecrated or “made perfect”, for they are no more subject to the infirmities of the flesh, having laid aside the flesh itself. And hence we may with certainty conclude, that pious souls, separated from their bodies, still live with God, for we could not possibly be otherwise joined to them as companions. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(267)</span> To keep this clause distinct from the next but one, “the spirits of just men,” etc. has been difficult. The distinction which Calvin seems to make as well as Doddridge, Scott and Stuart, is this, — that those mentioned here, “the first-born,” were the most eminent of the ancients; but that “the spirits of just men” include the godly generally. The people of Israel were called “the first born,” <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:22">Exodus 4:22</span>, because they were God’s chosen people. Ephraim is also called, “the first born,” <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:9">Jeremiah 31:9</span>, because of the superiority granted to that tribe; and the Messiah is so called, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:27">Psalms 89:27</span>, on account of his eminence. The first born is one possessed of peculiar privileges. The word here seems to designate the saints, believers, Christians, as they are God’s chosen people and highly privileged. We hence see the propriety of “the whole assembly,” or the whole number of the faithful, composed of Jews or Gentiles. The Apostle says, “We are part of this whole assembly,” and in order to point out his meaning more distinctly he calls it “the Church.” The reference here seems to be the saints on earth, and at the end of the verse to departed saints. And they are said to be “made perfect,” because freed from guilt, sin, and every pollution, having “washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb.” — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
