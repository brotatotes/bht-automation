<p><b>21.</b><i>To do his will, etc.</i> He now gives a definition of good works by laying down God’s <i>will</i> as the rule; for he thus intimates, that no works are to be deemed good, but such as are agreeable to the will of God, as Paul also teaches us in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:2">Romans 12:2</span>, and in many other places. Let us then remember, that it is the perfection of a good and holy life, when we live in obedience to his will. The clause which next follows is explanatory, <i>working</i> (or doing) <i>in you what is well pleasing in his sight.</i> He had spoken of that will which is made known in the Law; he now shows, that in vain is obtruded on God what he has not commanded; for he values the decrees of his own will far more than all the inventions of the world. </p>
<p><i>Through Jesus Christ, etc.</i> This may be explained in two ways, — “Working through Jesus Christ”, or, “Well­pleasing through Jesus Christ.” Both senses are suitable. For we know that the spirit of regeneration and also all graces are bestowed on us through Christ; and then it is certain, that as nothing can proceed from us absolutely perfect, nothing can be acceptable to God without that pardon which we obtain through Christ. Thus it comes, that our works, performed by the odor of Christ’s grace, emit a sweet fragrance in God’s presence, while otherwise they would have a fetid smell. I am disposed to include both meanings. </p>
<p><i>To whom be glory, etc.</i> This I refer to Christ. And as he here ascribes to Christ what peculiarly belongs to God alone, he thus bears a clear testimony to his divinity; but still if anyone prefers to explain this of the Father, I do not object; though I embrace the other sense, as being the most obvious. </p>
