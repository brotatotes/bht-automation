<p><b>3.</b><i>Remember them that are in bonds,</i> or, <i>Be mindful of the bound, etc.</i> There is nothing that can give us a more genuine feeling of compassion than to put ourselves in the place of those who are in distress; hence he says, that we ought to think of those in bonds as though we were bound with them. What follows the first clause, <i>As being yourselves also in the body,</i> is variously explained. Some take a general view thus, “Ye are also exposed to the same evils, according to the common lot of humanity;” but others give a more restricted sense, “As though ye were in their body.” Of neither can I approve, for I apply the words to the body of the Church, so that the meaning would be this, “Since ye are members of the same body, it behooves you to feel in common for each other’s evils, that there may be nothing disunited among you.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(276)</sup></span> </p>

It is so taken here by Grotius, Doddridge, Scott, and Stuart. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
