<p><b>9.</b><i>Diverse doctrines, etc.</i> He concludes that we ought not to fluctuate, since the truth of Christ, in which we ought to stand firm, remains fixed and unchangeable. And doubtless, variety of opinions, every kind of superstition, all monstrous errors, in a word, all corruptions in religion, arise from this, that men abide not in Christ alone; for it is not in vain that Paul teaches us, that Christ is given to us by God to be our wisdom. </p>
<p>The import then of this passage is that in order that the truth of God may remain firm in us, we must acquiesce in Christ alone. We hence conclude that all who are ignorant of Christ are exposed to all the delusions of Satan; for apart from him there is no stability of faith, but innumerable tossings here and there. Wonderful then is the acuteness of the Papists, who have contrived quite a contrary remedy for driving away errors, even by extinguishing or burying the knowledge of Christ! But let this warning of the Holy Spirit be fixed in our hearts, that we shall never be beyond the reach of danger except we cleave to Christ. </p>
<p>Now the doctrines which lead us away from Christ, he says, are <i>divers</i> or various, because there is no other simple and unmixed truth but the knowledge of Christ; and he calls them also <i>strange</i> or foreign, because whatever is apart from Christ is not regarded by God as his own; and we are hereby also reminded how we are to proceed, if we would make a due proficiency in the Scripture, for he who takes not a straight course to Christ, goes after strange doctrines. The Apostle farther intimates that the Church of God will always have to contend with strange doctrines and that there is no other means of guarding against them but by being fortified with the pure knowledge of Christ. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(282)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>For it is a good thing, etc.</i> He now comes from a general principle to a particular case. The Jews, for instance, as it is well known, were superstitious as to distinctions in meats; and hence arose many disputes and discords; and this was one of the strange doctrines which proceeded from their ignorance of Christ. Having then previously grounded our faith on Christ, he now says that the observance of meats does not conduce to our salvation and true holiness. As he sets <i>grace</i> in opposition to <i>meats</i>, I doubt not but that by grace he means the spiritual worship of God and regeneration. In saying <i>that the heart may be established,</i> he alludes to the word, <i>carried about,</i> as though he had said, “It is the spiritual grace of God, and not the observance of meats, that will really establish us. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(283)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>Which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.</i> It is uncertain to whom he here refers; for the fathers who lived under the Law had no doubt a useful training, and a part of it was the distinction as to meats. It seems then that this is to be understood rather of the superstitious, who, after the Gospel had been revealed, still perversely adhered to the old ceremonies. At the same time were we judiciously to explain the words as applied to the fathers, there would be no inconsistency; it was indeed profitable for them to undergo the yoke laid on them by the Lord, and to continue obediently under the common discipline of the godly and of the whole Church; but the Apostle means that abstinence from meats was in itself of no avail. And no doubt it is to be regarded as nothing, except as an elementary instruction at the time when God’s people were like children as to their external discipline. To be <i>occupied in meats</i> is to be taken as having a regard to them, so as to make a distinction between clean and unclean. But what he says of meats may be extended to the other rites of the Law. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(282)</span> “Doctrines” were said to be “various” because of their number; there were then as now many false doctrines; and “strange” because they were new or foreign to the truth, not consistent with the faith, but derived from abroad as it were, borrowed from traditions, ceremonies, or other foreign sources. Stuart gives another meaning to the first word, that is “different” from Christian doctrine; but it has no such meaning. Still less warranted is Macknight in saying that it means what is “discordant.” What is meant by “diverse diseases” and “diverse lusts” is that they were of various kinds, or that they were many. The same author gives an unprecedented meaning to the second word. “foreign,” that is, taught by unauthorized teachers! Stuart says, that it means “foreign” to Christian doctrine. The word is indeed used in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:12">1 Peter 4:12</span>, in the sense of “new,” a thing unusual, not heard of before; nor is this meaning unsuitable here. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span>, where the same subject is handled. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:9">Matthew 15:9</span>. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
