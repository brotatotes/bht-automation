<p><b>7.</b><i>Thou madest him, etc.</i> A new difficulty now arises as to the explanation of the words. I have already shown that the passage is fitly applicable to the Son of God; but the Apostle seems now to turn the words from that meaning in which David understood them; for <i>a little,</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">βραχύ τι</span></blu></grk> seems to refer to time, as it means a little while, and designates the abasement of Christ’s humiliation; and he confines the glory to the day of resurrection, while David extends it generally to the whole life of man. </p>
<p>To this I answer, that it was not the Apostle’s design to give an exact explanation of the words. For there is nothing improperly done, when verbal allusions are made to embellish a subject in hand, as Paul does in quoting a passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:6">Romans 10:6</span>, from Moses, “Who shall ascend into heaven,” <i>etc.</i>, he does not join the words “heaven and hell” for the purpose of explanation, but as ornaments. The meaning of David is this, — “O Lord, thou hast raised man to such a dignity, that it differs but little from divine or angelic honor; for he is set a ruler over the whole world.” This meaning the Apostle did not intend to overthrow, nor to turn to something else; but he only bids us to consider the abasement of Christ, which appeared for a short time, and then the glory with which he is perpetually crowned; and this he does more by alluding to expressions than by explaining what David understood. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(35)</sup></span> </p>
<p>To be <i>mindful</i> and to <i>visit</i> mean the same thing, except that the second is somewhat fuller, for it sets forth the presence of God by the effect. </p>
