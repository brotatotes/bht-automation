<p><b>15.</b><i>While it is said, etc.</i> He intimates that the reason for making progress never ceases as long as we live, because God calls us daily. For since faith responds to the preaching of the Gospel, as preaching continues through the whole course of our life, so we ought to continue growing in faith. The phrase, then, <i>while it is said,</i> is the same as though he had said, “Since God never makes an end of speaking, it is not enough for us readily to receive his doctrine, except we exhibit the same teachableness and obedience tomorrow and every following day.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(66)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(66)</span> Most connect this verse with the preceding, as in our version, and as Doddridge thus “forasmuch as it is said;” and Macknight thus “as ye may know by the saying.” So does Beza; and Calvin seems to do the same; but some connect it with the 13<sup>th</sup> and others with the 14<sup>th</sup> verse. Modern authors, such as Stuart and Blooomfield, regard it as the commencement of a paragraph, and connect it with what follows. Stuart’s version is — </p>
<p>15. With regard to the saying, “today while ye hear his voice, harden<br>16. Not your hearts as in the provocation;” who now were they that when they heard did provoke? Nay, did not all who came out of Egypt under Moses? Etc. </br></p>
<p>Bloomfield approves of this version, only he considers the quotation is confined to the words, “Today, while ye hear his voice,” and regards what follows, “harden not,” etc., as said by the writer: See Appendix N. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
