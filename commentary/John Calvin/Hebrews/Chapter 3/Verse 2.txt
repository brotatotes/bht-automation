<p><b>2.</b><i>Who was,</i> or <i>is faithful, etc.</i> This is a commendation of the apostleship of Christ, in order that the faithful may securely acquiesce in him; and he commends it on two grounds, because the Father has set him to be over us as our teacher, and because Christ himself has faithfully performed the office committed to him. These two things are always necessary to secure authority to a doctrine; for God alone ought to be attended to, as the whole Scripture testifies; hence Christ declares, that the doctrine which he delivered was not his own, but the Father’s, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:16">John 7:16</span>;) and in another place he says, “He who received me, receiveth him who has sent me.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:48">Luke 9:48</span>.) For we say of Christ, that as he is clothed with our flesh, he is the Father’s minister to execute his commands. To the calling of God is added the faithful and upright performance of duty on the part of Christ; and this is required in true ministers, in order that they may obtain credence in the Church. Since these two things are found in Christ, doubtless he cannot be disregarded without despising God in him. </p>
<p><i>As also Moses, etc.</i> Omitting for a while the priesthood, he speaks here of his apostleship. For as there are two parts in God’s covenant, the promulgation of the truth, and so to speak, its real confirmation, the full perfection of the covenant would not appear in Christ, were not both parts found in him. Hence the writer of the epistle, after having mentioned both, roused attention by a brief exhortation. But he now enters on a longer discussion, and begins with the office of a teacher: he therefore now compares Christ only with Moses. The words, <i>in all his house,</i> may be applied to Moses; but I prefer to apply them to Christ, as he may be said to be faithful to his Father in ruling his whole house. It hence follows, that none belong to the Church of God except those who acknowledge Christ. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(57)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(57)</span> This testimony as to Moses is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:7">Numbers 12:7</span>. God says there “in all mine house;” we ought therefore to consider “his” here as referring to God or to Christ, and not to Moses. </p>
<p>“For this man<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">,” οὖτος;</span></blu></grk> it is better to render it here he, as it is sometimes rendered, and is so rendered in this place by Doddridge, Macknight and Stuart. The connection is with “consider,” in the first verse; “for,” a reason is given for the exhortation; “for he,” i.e., the apostle and high priest before mentioned, etc. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
