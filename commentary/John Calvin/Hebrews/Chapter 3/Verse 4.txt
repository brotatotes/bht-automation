<p><b>4.</b><i>He that built, etc.</i> Though these words may be extended to the creation of the whole world, yet I confine them to the present subject. We are then to understand that nothing is done in the Church which ought not to he ascribed to Gods power; for he alone has founded it by his own hand, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+87:5">Psalms 87:5</span>;) and Paul says of Christ that he is the head, from whom the whole body, joined together and connected by every subservient juncture, makes an increase according to what is done proportionally by every member. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:16">Ephesians 4:16</span>.) Hence he often declares that the success of his ministry was God’s work. In a word, if we take a right view of things, it will appear that how much soever God may use the labors of men in building his Church, yet he himself performs everything — the instrument derogates nothing from the workman. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(58)</sup></span> </p>
