<p><b>5.</b><i>And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, etc.</i> The second difference is, that to Moses was committed a doctrine to which he, in common with others, was to submit; but Christ, though he put on the form of a servant, is yet Master and Lord, to whom all ought to be subject; for, as we found in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>, he is constituted heir of all things. </p>
<p><i>For a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after,</i> or <i>which were afterwards to be said</i> or <i>declared</i>. I explain this simply in this way, â€” that Moses, while a herald of that doctrine which was to be published for a time to the ancient people, did at the same time render a testimony to the Gospel, the publication of which was not as yet to be made; for it is doubtless evident, that the end and completion of the Law is that perfection of wisdom contained in the Gospel. This exposition seems to comport with the future tense of the participle. The meaning indeed is, that Moses faithfully delivered to the people what the Lord had committed to him, but that limits were prescribed to him which it was not lawful for him to pass. God formerly spoke at different times and in various ways by the prophets, but he deferred to the fullness of time the complete revelation of the Gospel. </p>
