<p><b>9.</b><i>Tempted, etc.</i> This word is to be taken in a bad sense; it means to provoke in a proud and insulting manner, which we express in French by saying, <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">defier comme en depitant</span></i></blu> For though God had often brought them help, yet they forgot all, and scornfully asked, where was his power. <i>Proved, etc.</i> This clause is to be thus explained, “When yet they had proved me and seen my works”. For it enhanced the guilt of their impiety, that having been taught by so many evidences of divine power, they had made so bad a progress. For it was a marvelous supineness and stupidity to esteem God’s power as nothing, which had been so fully proved. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(61)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>Forty years.</i> These are connected by David with what follows. But we know that the Apostles in quoting passages attend more to the general meaning than to the words. And no doubt God complained that the people had been vexatious to him for forty years, because so many benefits had availed nothing for the purpose of teaching them; for though God did good continually to them who were wholly unworthy, they yet never ceased to rise up against him. Hence arose his continual indignation, as though he had said “Not once or for a short time have they provoked me, but by their incessant wickedness for forty years.” <i>Generation</i> means race, or men of one age. </p>
