<p><b>1.</b><i>Let us therefore fear, etc.</i> He concludes that there was reason to fear lest the Jews to whom he was writing should be deprived of the blessing offered to them; and then he says, <i>lest anyone,</i> intimating that it was his anxious desire to lead them, one and all, to God; for it is the duty of a good shepherd, in watching over the whole flock so to care for every sheep that no one may be lost; nay, we ought also so to feel for one another that every one should fear for his neighbors as well as for himself </p>
<p>But the fear which is here recommended is not that which shakes the confidence of faith but such as fills us with such concern that we grow not torpid with indifference. Let us then fear, not that we ought to tremble or to entertain distrust as though uncertain as to the issue, but lest we be unfaithful to God’s grace. </p>
<p>By saying <i>Lest we be disappointed of the promise left us,</i> he intimates that no one comes short of it except he who by rejecting grace has first renounced the promise; for God is so far from repenting to do us good that he ceases not to bestow his gifts except when we despise his calling. The illative <i>therefore,</i> or <i>then</i> means that by the fall of others we are taught humility and watchfulness according to what Paul also says, </p>
<p>“These through unbelief have fallen; be not thou then high ­ minded, but fear.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(67)</sup></span> <sup><br/></sup>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:20">Romans 11:20</span>.) </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(67)</span> Calvin renders the last verb “be disappointed,” (<blu>frustratus</blu>,) though the verb means properly to be behind in time, to be too late; yet it is commonly used in the sense of falling short of a thing, of being destitute; of being without. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:23">Romans 3:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:15">Hebrews 12:15</span>. To “come short” of our version fitly expresses its meaning here, as adopted by Doddridge and Stuart; or “to fall short,” as rendered by Macknight. </p>
<p>“Seem” is considered by some to be pleonastic. The verb<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δοκέω</span></blu></grk> is so no doubt sometimes, but not always; but here appears to have a special meaning, as the Apostle would have no one to present even the appearance of neglecting to secure the rest promised. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
