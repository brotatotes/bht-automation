<p><b>13.</b><i>For every one who uses milk,</i> or, <i>who partakes of milk, etc.</i> He means those who from tenderness or weakness as yet refuse solid doctrine; for otherwise he who is grown up is not averse to milk. But he reproves here an infancy in understanding, such as constrains God even to prattle with us. He then says, that babes are not fit to receive the <i>word of righteousness,</i> understanding by righteousness the perfection of which he will presently speak. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(93)</sup></span> For the Apostle does not here, as I think, refer to the question, how we are justified before God, but takes the word in a simpler sense, as denoting that completeness of knowledge which leads to perfection, which office Paul ascribes to the Gospel in his epistle to the <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+1:28">Colossians 1:28</span>; as though he had said, that those who indulge themselves in their ignorance preclude themselves from a real knowledge of Christ, and that the doctrine of the Gospel is unfruitful in them, because they never reach the goal, nor come even near it. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(93)</span> This is the view of Grotius and others, but some regard “the word of righteousness” as a paraphrasis for the Gospel; and Stuart renders it, “the word of salvation.” Dr. Owen says that the Gospel is called “the word of righteousness,” because it reveals the righteousness of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>. It may also be so called, because it reveals and contains the truth, the full truth, partly revealed previously. The word “righteousness” has this meaning both in the Old and New Testaments. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+3:4">Psalms 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:19">Isaiah 45:19</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:23">Matthew 21:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:15">2 Corinthians 11:15</span>. “The ministers of righteousness” in the last text are opposed to false ministers. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
