<p><b>2.</b><i>Who can, etc.</i> This <i>fourth</i> point has some affinity to the first, and yet it may be distinguished from it; for the Apostle before taught us that mankind are united to God in the person of one man, as all men partake of the same flesh and nature; but now he refers to another thing, and that is, that the priest ought to be kind and gentle to sinners, because he partakes of their infirmities. The word which the Apostle uses<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, μετριοπαθεῖν</span></blu></grk> is differently explained both by Greek and Latin interpreters. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(85)</sup></span> I, however, think that it simply means one capable of sympathy. All the things which are here said of the Levitical priests do not indeed apply to Christ; for Christ we know was exempt from every contagion of sin; he therefore differed from others in this respect, that he had no necessity of offering a sacrifice for himself. But it is enough for us to know that he bare our infirmities, though free from sin and undefiled. Then, as to the ancient and Levitical priests, the Apostle says, that they were subject to human infirmity, and that they made atonement also for their own sins, that they might not only be kind to others when gone astray, but also condole or sympathize with them. This part ought to be so far applied to Christ as to include that exception which he mentioned before, that is, that he bare our infirmities, being yet without sin. At the same time, though ever free from sin, yet that experience of infirmities before described is alone abundantly sufficient to incline him to help us, to make him merciful and ready to pardon, to render him solicitous for us in our miseries. The sum of what is said is, that Christ is a brother to us, not only on account of unity as to flesh and nature, but also by becoming a partaker of our infirmities, so that he is led, and as it were formed, to show forbearance and kindness. The participle<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, δυνάμενος</span></blu></grk> is more forcible than in our common tongue, <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">qui possit</span></i></blu> <i>,</i> “who can,” for it expresses aptness or fitness. <i>The ignorant</i> and those <i>out of the way,</i> or erring, he has named instead of sinners, according to what is done in Hebrew; for <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">שגגה</span></blu></heb>, <i>shegage,</i> means every kind of error or offense, as I shall have presently an occasion to explain. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(85)</span> “The classic or philosophic use of the word<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">μετριοπαθεῖν,</span></blu></grk> may be briefly explained. The Stoics maintained that a man should be<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀπαθὴς,</span></blu></grk> i.e., not subject to passions, such as anger, fear, hope, joy, etc. The Platonists on the other hand averred that a wise man should<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">μετριοπαθὴς,</span></blu></grk> moderate in his affections, and not<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀπαθὴς.</span></blu></grk> The leading sense, then, or the word<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">μετριοπαθεῖν,</span></blu></grk> is to be moderate in our feelings or passions.” — Stuart. </p>
<p>But this is not exactly its meaning here. Schleusner, quoting the Greek Lexicographers, shows that it was used in the sense of being indulgent, or of acting kindly and forgivingly, or forebearingly; and this seems to be its meaning in this passage. The sentence is rendered by Macknight, “Being able to have a right measure of compassion on the ignorant and erring.” It may be rendered, “Being capable of duly feeling for the ignorant and the erring,” or the deceived, that is by sin. See as to the ignorant <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+5:17">Leviticus 5:17</span>; and as to the deceived by passions or interest, see <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+6:1">Leviticus 6:1</span> — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
