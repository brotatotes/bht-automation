<p><b>2.</b><i>Of the sanctuary,</i> or, literally, <i>of holy things, etc.</i> The word is to be taken, as being in the neuter gender; and the Apostle explains himself by saying, <i>of the true tabernacle.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(128)</sup></span> </p>
<p>But it may be asked, whether the tabernacle built by Moses was a false one, and presumptuously constructed, for there is an implied contrast in the words? To this I answer, that to us mentioned here is not set in opposition to what is false, but only to what is typical; as we find in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span>, “The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.” Then the old tabernacle was not the empty inventions of man, but the effigy of the heavenly tabernacle. As, however, a shadow differs from the substance, and the sign from the thing signified, the Apostle denies it to have been the true tabernacle, as though he had said, that it was only a shadow. </p>
<p><i>Which the Lord pitched,</i> or, <i>fixed, etc.</i> What does the Apostle mean by locating Christ’s priesthood in heaven? For doubtless he suffered on earth, and by an earthly blood he atoned for our sins, for he derived his origin from the seed of Abraham; the sacrifice of his death was visible; and lastly, that he might offer himself to the Father, it was necessary for him to descend from heaven to the earth, and as man to become exposed to the sorrows of this mortal life, and at length to death itself. To all this I reply, that whatever of an earthly kind appears at first sight to be in Christ, it is to be viewed spiritually by the eye of faith. Thus his flesh, which proceeded from the seed of Abraham, since it was the temple of God, possessed a vivifying power; yea, the death of Christ became the life of the world, which is certainly above nature. The Apostle therefore does not refer to what belongs peculiarly to human nature, but to the hidden power of the Spirit; and hence it is, that the death of Christ has nothing earthly in it. When therefore we speak of Christ, let us learn to raise up all our thoughts to the kingdom of God, so that no doubt may remain in us. </p>
<p>Nearly to the same purpose is the language of Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>; he calls God the builder of this tabernacle, in order to set forth its stability and perpetuity; for, on the other hand, what is built by men’s hands, is unstable, and at last sure to perish. But he says this, because redemption was truly a divine work, attained by the death of Christ; and in this the power of Christ manifested itself in a wonderful manner. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(128)</span> It is better to take “holy things” as designating the holy duties of the priest, afterwards specified when the offering of gifts and sacrifices is mentioned, than as signifying “the sanctuary.” Christ is a priest and a minister in sacred things, and a minister in the true tabernacle. He has holy things to do, and he does them, not in the shadowy and typical tabernacle, but in that which is real and celestial. </p>
<p>We find, that the word in the next chapter means the holiest place, accompanied as here with the article, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:8">Hebrews 9:8</span>, and without the article, the holy place or the sanctuary, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:2">Hebrews 9:2</span>. So then if this meaning be taken, the rendering here ought to be, “the minister of the holiest;” and then “tabernacle” is used as including the whole building, as in chapter 9:2. But the context here seems to favor the former meaning. The version of Doddridge is, “A minister of holy things.” — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
