<p><b>2.</b><i>For there was a tabernacle, etc.</i> As the Apostle here touches but lightly on the structure of the tabernacle, that he might not be detained beyond what his subject required; so will I also designedly abstain from any refined explanation of it. It is then sufficient for our present purpose to consider the tabernacle in its three parts, — the first was the court of the people; the middle was commonly called the sanctuary; and the last was the inner sanctuary, which they called, by way of eminence, <i>the holy of holies.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(141)</sup></span> </p>
<p>As to the first sanctuary, which was contiguous to the court of the people, he says that there were the <i>candlestick</i> and <i>the table</i> on which the <i>shew­bread</i> was set: he calls this place, in the plural number, the holies. Then, after this is mentioned, the most secret place, which they called the holy of holies, still more remote from the view of the people, and it was even hid from the priests who ministered in the first sanctuary; for as by a veil the sanctuary was closed up to the people, so another veil kept the priests from the holy of holies. There, the Apostle says, was the<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">θυμιατήριον</span></blu></grk> by which name I understand the altar of incense, or fumigation, rather than the censer; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(142)</sup></span> then <i>the ark of the covenant</i>, with its covering, <i>the two cherubim, the golden pot</i> filled with <i>manna, the rod of Aaron, and the two tables.</i> Thus far the Apostle proceeds in describing the tabernacle. </p>
<p>But he says that the pot in which Moses had deposited the manna, and Aaron’s rod which had budded, were in the ark with the two tables; but this seems inconsistent with sacred history, which in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:9">1 Kings 8:9</span>, relates that there was nothing in the ark but the two tables. But it is easy to reconcile these two passages: God had commanded the pot and Aaron’s rod to be laid up before the testimony; it is hence probable that they were deposited in the ark, together with the tables. But when the Temple was built, these things were arranged in a different order, and certain history relates it as a thing new that the ark had nothing else but the two tables. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(143)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(141)</span> See Appendix F 2. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(142)</span> This is evidently a mistake, for the altar of incense was in the sanctuary — the first tabernacle. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:1">Exodus 30:1</span>. The word is used in the Sept., for “censer,” <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ch+26:19">2 Chronicles 26:19</span>. There were many censors made, as it is supposed, of brass; for they were daily used in the sanctuary for incense; but this golden censor was probably used only on the day of expiation, when the chief priest entered the holiest place; and the probability is, though there is no account of this in the Old Testament, that it was laid up or deposited, as Stuart suggests, in the holy of holies. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(143)</span> Stuart observes, “Our author is speaking of the tabernacle, and not of the temple; still less of the second temple, which must have lacked even the tables of testimony. The probability is, that the ark, during its many removals, and in particular during its captivity by the Philistines, was deprived of those sacred deposits; for we hear no more concerning them.” — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
