<p><b>1</b><i>To the twelve tribes</i>. When the ten tribes were banished, the Assyrian king placed them in different parts. Afterwards, as it usually happens in the revolutions of kingdoms (such as then took place,) it is very probable that they moved here and there in all directions. And the Jews had been scattered almost unto all quarters of the world. He then wrote and exhorted all those whom he could not personally address, because they had been scattered far and wide. But that he speaks not of the grace of Christ and of faith in him, the reason seems to be this, because he addressed those who had already been rightly taught by others; so that they had need, not so much of doctrine, as of the goads of exhortations. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(98)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(98)</span> The salutation is peculiar; but in the same form with the letter sent to Antioch by the Apostles, (of whom James was one,) and the church at Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:23">Acts 15:23</span>. It is therefore apostolic, although adopted from a form commonly used by the heathen writers. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:26">Acts 23:26</span>. John in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:10">John 2:10</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span> uses the verb <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χαίρειν</span></blu></grk> in a similar sense; and it means properly to rejoice. It being an infinitive, the verb <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">λέγω</span></blu></grk>, to say or to bid, is put before it by John, and is evidently understood here. Hence the salutation may thus be rendered, — </p>
<p>“James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, bids, (or sends, or wishes) joy to the twelve tribes who are in their dispersion.” </p>
<p>There had been an <i>eastern</i> and a <i>western</i> dispersion, the first at the Assyrian and Babylonian captivity, and the second during the predominancy of the Grecian power, which commenced with Alexander the Great. As this epistle was written in Greek, it was no doubt intended more especially for those of the latter dispersion. But the benefit of the eastern dispersion was soon consulted, as the very <i>first</i> version of the New Testament was made into this language, that is, the Syriac; and this was done at the beginning of the second century. </p>
