<p>Though the received reading is <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐν ταῖς πορείαις</span></blu></grk>, yet I agree with Erasmus, and read the last word, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πορίαις</span></blu></grk>, without the diphthong “in his riches,” or, with his riches; and the latter I prefer. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(104)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(104)</span> The received text is regarded as the best reading; the other is found in very few copies. </p>
