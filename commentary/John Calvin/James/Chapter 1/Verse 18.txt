<p><b>18</b><i>Of his own will</i>. He now brings forward a special proof of the goodness of God which he had mentioned, even that he has regenerated us unto eternal life. This invaluable benefit every one of the faithful feels in himself. Then the goodness of God, when known by experience, ought to remove from them all a contrary opinion respecting him. </p>
<p>When he says that God <i>of his own will</i>, or spontaneously, <i>hath begotten us</i>, he intimates that he was induced by no other reason, as the will and counsel of God are often set in opposition to the merits of men. What great thing, indeed, would it have been to say that God was not constrained to do this? But he impresses something more, that God according to his own goodwill hath begotten us, and has been thus a cause to himself. It hence follows that it is natural to God to do good. </p>
<p>But this passage teaches us, that as our election before the foundation of the world was gratuitous, so we are illuminated by the grace of God alone as to the knowledge of the truth, so that our calling corresponds with our election. The Scripture shews that we have been gratuitously adopted by God before we were born. But James expresses here something more, that we obtain the right of adoption, because God does also call us gratuitously. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>.) Farther, we hence learn, that it is the peculiar office of God spiritually to regenerate us; for that the same thing is sometimes ascribed to the ministers of the gospel, means no other thing than this, that God acts through them; and it happens indeed through them, but he nevertheless alone doeth the work. </p>
<p>The word <i>begotten</i> means that we become new men, so that we put off our former nature when we are effectually called by God. He adds how God begets us, even by <i>the word of truth</i>, so that we may know that we cannot enter the kingdom of God by any other door. </p>
<p><i>That we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures</i>. The word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τινὰ</span></blu></grk>, “some,” has the meaning of likeness, as though he had said, that we are in a manner firstfruits. But this ought not to be restricted to a few of the faithful; but it belongs to all in common. For as man excels among all creatures, so the Lord elects some from the whole mass and separates them as a holy offering, to himself. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(108)</sup></span> It is no common nobility into which God extols his own children. Then justly are they said to be excellent as firstfruits, when God’s image is renewed in them. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(108)</span> The firstfruits being a part and a pledge of the coming harvest, to retain the metaphor, we must regard “creatures” here as including all the saved in future ages. Hence their opinion is to be preferred, who regard the first converts, who were Jews, as the firstfruits. </p>
