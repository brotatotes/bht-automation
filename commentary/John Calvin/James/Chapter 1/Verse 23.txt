<p><b>23</b><i>He is like to a man</i>. Heavenly doctrine is indeed a mirror in which God presents himself to our view; but so that we may be transformed unto his image, as Paul says in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>. But here he speaks of the external glance of the eye, not of the vivid and efficacious meditation which penetrates into the heart. It is a striking comparison, by which he briefly intimates, that a doctrine merely heard and not received inwardly into the heart avails nothing, because it soon vanishes away. </p>
