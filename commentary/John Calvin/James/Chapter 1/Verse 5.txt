<p><b>5</b><i>If any of you lack wisdom.</i> As our reason, and all our feelings are averse to the thought that we can be happy in the midst of evils, he bids us to ask of the Lord to give us wisdom. For <i>wisdom</i> here, I confine to the subject of the passage, as though he had said, “If this doctrine is higher than what your minds can reach to, ask of the Lord to illuminate you by his Spirit; for as this consolation alone is sufficient to mitigate all the bitterness of evils, that what is grievous to the flesh is salutary to us; so we must necessarily be overcome with impatience, except we be sustained by this kind of comfort.” Since we see that the Lord does not so require from us what is above our strength, but that he is ready to help us, provided we ask, let us, therefore, learn, whenever he commands anything, to ask from him the power to perform it. </p>
<p>Though in this place to be wise is to submit to God in the endurance of evils, under a due conviction that he so orders all things as to promote our salvation; yet the sentence may be generally applied to every branch of right knowledge. </p>
<p>But why does he say <i>If any one,</i> as though all of them did not want wisdom. To this I answer, that all are by nature without it; but that some are gifted with the spirit of wisdom, while others are without it. As, then, all had not made such progress as to rejoice in affliction, but few there were to whom this had been given, James, therefore, referred to such cases; and he reminded those who were not as yet fully convinced that by the cross their salvation was promoted by the Lord, that they were to ask to be endued with wisdom. And yet there is no doubt, but that necessity reminds us all to ask the same thing; for he who has made the greatest progress, is yet far off from the goal. But to ask an increase of wisdom is another thing than to ask for it at first. </p>
<p>When he bids us to <i>ask of the Lord,</i> he intimates, that he alone can heal our diseases and relieve our wants. </p>
<p><i>That giveth to all men liberally</i>. By <i>all</i>, he means those who ask; for they who seek no remedy for their wants, deserve to pine away in them. However, this universal declaration, by which every one of us is invited to ask, without exception, is very important; hence no man ought to deprive himself of so great a privilege. </p>
<p>To the same purpose is the promise which immediately follows; for as by this command he shews what is the duty of every one, so he affirms that they would not do in vain what he commands; according to what is said by Christ, </p>
<p>“Knock, and it shall be opened.”<br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7">Matthew 7:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:9">Luke 11:9</span>.) </br></p>
<p>The word <i>liberally</i>, or <i>freely</i>, denotes promptitude in giving. So Paul, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span>, requires simplicity in deacons. And in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:0">2 Corinthians 8:0</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:0">2 Corinthians 9:0</span>, when speaking of charity or love, he repeats the same word several times. The meaning, then, is, that God is so inclined and ready to give, that he rejects none, or haughtily puts them off, being not like the niggardly and grasping, who either sparingly, as with a closed hand, give but little, or give only a part of what they were about to give, or long debate with themselves whether to give or not. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(101)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>And upbraideth not.</i> This is added, lest any one should fear to come too often to God. Those who are the most liberal among men, when any one asks often to be helped, mention their formal acts of kindness, and thus excuse themselves for the future. Hence, a mortal man, however open-handed he may be, we are ashamed to weary by asking too often. But James reminds us, that there is nothing like this in God; for he is ready ever to add new blessings to former ones, without any end or limitation. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(101)</span> The literal meaning of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἁπλῶς</span></blu></grk> is simply without any mixture; the noun, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἁπλότης</span></blu></grk>, is used in the sense of sincerity, which has no mixture of hypocrisy or fraud, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span>.) and in the sense of liberality, or disposition free from what is sordid or parsimonious, having no mixture of niggardliness, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:2">2 Corinthians 8:2</span>.) This latter is evidently the meaning here, so that “liberally,” according to our version, is the best word. </p>
