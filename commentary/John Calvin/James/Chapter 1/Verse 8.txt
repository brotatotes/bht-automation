<p><b>8</b><i>A double-minded man</i>, or, <i>a man of a double mind</i>. This sentence may be read by itself, as he speaks generally of hypocrites. It seems, however, to me to be rather the conclusion of the preceding doctrine; and thus there is an implied contrast between the simplicity or liberality of God, mentioned before, and the double-mindedness of man; for as God gives to us with a stretched out hand, so it behooves us in our turn to open the bosom of our heart. He then says that the unbelieving, who have tortuous recesses, are <i>unstable</i>; because they are never firm or fixed, but at one time they swell with the confidence of the flesh, at another they sink into the depth of despair. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(102)</sup></span> </p>

When again used, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:8">James 4:8</span>, it means a hesitation between God and the world. </p>
