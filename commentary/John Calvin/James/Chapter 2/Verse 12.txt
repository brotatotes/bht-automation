<p><b>12</b><i>So speak ye</i>. Some give this explanation, that as they flattered themselves too much, they are summoned to the right tribunal; for men absolve themselves according to their own notions, because they withdraw themselves from the judgment of the divine law. He then reminds them that all deeds and words are there to be accounted for, because God will judge the world according to his law. As, however, such a declaration might have smitten them with immoderate terror, to correct or mitigate what they might have thought severe, he adds, <i>the law of liberty</i>. For we know what Paul says, </p>
<p>“Whosoever are under the law are under a curse.”<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:10">Galatians 3:10</span>.) </p>
<p>Hence the judgment of the law in itself is condemnation to eternal death; but he means by the word <i>liberty</i>, that we are freed from the rigor of the law. </p>
<p>This meaning is not altogether unsuitable, though if one examines more minutely what immediately follows, he will see that James meant another thing; the sense is as though he had said, “Except ye wish to undergo the rigor of the law, ye must be less rigid towards your neighbors; for the law of liberty is the same as the mercy of God, which delivers us from the curse of the law” And so this verse ought to be read with what follows, where he speaks of the duty of bearing with infirmities. And doubtless the whole passage thus reads well: “Since none of us can stand before God, except we be delivered and freed from the strict rigor of the law, we ought so to act, that we may not through too much severity exclude the indulgence or mercy of God, of which we all have need to the last.” </p>
