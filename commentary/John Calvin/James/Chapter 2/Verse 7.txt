<p><b>7</b><i>Worthy,</i> or <i>good name</i>. I doubt not but that he refers here to the name of God and of Christ. And he says, <i>by</i>, or, <i>on, the which ye are called</i>; not in prayer, as Scripture is wont sometimes to speak, but by profession; as the name of a father, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:16">Genesis 48:16</span>, is said to be called on his offspring, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+4:1">Isaiah 4:1</span>, the name of a husband is called on the wife. It is, then, the same as though he had said, “The good name in which ye glory, or which ye deem it an honor to be called by; but if they proudly calumniate the glory of God, how unworthy are they of being honored by Christians!” </p>
