<p><b>l4</b><i>But if ye have bitter envying</i>. He points out the fruits which proceed from that extreme austerity which is contrary to meekness; for immoderate rigor necessarily begets mischievous emulations, which presently break forth into contentions. It is, indeed, an improper mode of speaking, to place contentions in the heart; but this affects not the meaning; for the object was to shew that the evil disposition of the heart is the fountain of these evils. </p>
<p>He has called <i>envying</i>, or <i>emulation</i>, <i>bitter</i>; for it prevails not, except when minds are so infected with the poison of malignity, that they turn all things into bitterness. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(125)</sup></span> </p>
<p>That we may then really glory that we are the children of God, he bids us to act calmly and meekly towards our brethren; otherwise he declares that we are lying in assuming the Christian name. But it is not without reason that he has added the associate of envying, even <i>strife</i>, or contention, for contests and quarrels ever arise from malignity and envy. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(125)</span> A similar order as to the words is found here as in the former verse: bitter envying is occasioned by strife of contention. There may be envying without contention, but it is contention that commonly makes it bitter. </p>
