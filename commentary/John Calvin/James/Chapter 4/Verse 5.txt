<p><b>5</b><i>Do ye think</i>. He seems to adduce from Scripture the next following sentence. Hence interpreters toil much, because none such, at least none exactly alike, is found in Scripture. But nothing hinders the reference to be made to what has been already said, that is, that the friendship of the world is adverse to God. Moreover; it has been rightly said, that this is a truth which occurs everywhere in Scripture. And that he has omitted the pronoun, which would have rendered the sentence clearer, is not to be wondered at, for, as it is evident, he is everywhere very concise. </p>
<p><i>The Spirit</i>, or, <i>Does the Spirit?</i> Some think that the soul of man is meant, and therefore read the sentence affirmatively, and according to this meaning, — that the spirit of man, as it is malignant, is so infected with envy, that it has ever a mixture of it. They, however, think better who regard the Spirit of God as intended; for it is he that is given to dwell in us. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(131)</sup></span> I then take the Spirit as that of God, and read the sentence as a question; for it was his object to prove, that because they envied they were not ruled by the Spirit of God; because he teaches the faithful otherwise; and this he confirms in the next verse, by adding that <i>he giveth more grace</i> </p>
<p>For it is an argument arising from what is contrary. Envy is a proof or sign of malignity; but the Spirit of God proves himself to be bountiful by the affluence of his blessings. There is then nothing more repugnant to his nature than envy. In short, James denies that the Spirit of God rules where depraved lusts prevail, which excite to mutual contention; because it is peculiarly the office of the Spirit to enrich men more and more continually with new gifts. </p>
<p>I will not stop to refute other explanations. Some give this meaning that the Spirit lusteth against envy; which is too harsh and forced. Then they say that God <i>gives more grace</i> to conquer and subdue lust. But the meaning I have given is more suitable and simple, — that he restores us by his bounty from the power of malignant emulation. The continuative particle <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δὲ</span></blu></grk> is to be taken adversatively, for <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀλλὰ</span></blu></grk> or <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀλλά γε</span></blu></grk>; so have I rendered it <blu><i>quin</i></blu> , but. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(131)</span> There are wagon-loads of interpretations, says <i>Erasmus</i>, on this passage. The one given by <i>Calvin</i>, and adopted by <i>Whitby</i>, <i>Doddridge</i>, <i>Scholefield</i>, and others, is the most satisfactory, and what alone enables us to see a meaning in the words, “more grace,” in the following verse. The Spirit dwells in God’s people, and he dwells there to give more or increasing grace, according to the tenor of what is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:15">Isaiah 57:15</span>, where God is said to “dwell with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit,” and for this purpose, “to revive the spirit of the humble,” etc. </p>

<p><b>5, 6</b>“Do ye think that the scripture speaketh <i>thus</i> in vain? Doth the Spirit who dwells in us lust to envy? <i>nay</i>, but he giveth more (or increasing) grace: he therefore saith, God sets himself in array against the insolent, but gives grace to the humble.” </p>
<p>The humble are those who are made so by grace; but God promises to give them more grace, to perfect that which had begun. </p>
