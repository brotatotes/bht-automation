<p><b>6</b><i>Ye have condemned</i>. Here follows another kind of inhumanity, that the rich by their power oppressed and destroyed the poor and weak. He says by a metaphor that the just were condemned and killed; for when they did not kill them by their own hand, or condemn them as judges, they yet employed the authority which they had to do wrong, they corrupted judgments, and contrived various arts to destroy the innocent, that is, really to condemn and kill them. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(139)</sup></span> </p>
<p>By adding that <i>the just did not resist them</i>, he intimates that the audacity of the rich was greater; because those whom they oppressed were without any protection. He, however, reminds them that the more ready and prompt would be the vengeance of God, when the poor have no protection from men. But though the just did not resist, because he ought to have patiently endured wrongs, I yet think that their weakness is at the same time referred to, that is he did not resist, because he was unprotected and without any help from men. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(139)</span> Many have thought that what is referred to here is the condemnation of our Savior by the Jewish nation, especially as he is called <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὁ δίκαιος</span></blu></grk>, “the just one.” This is true, but the Christian is also called too, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:18">1 Peter 4:18</span>. James very frequently individualizes the faithful, using the singular for the plural number. The whole context proves that he speaks here of the poor faithful who suffered injustice from the rich, professing the same faith. Besides, the death of Christ is not ascribed to the rich, but to the elders and chief priests. </p>
<p>The two first verbs, being aorists, may be rendered in the present tense, especially as the last verb is in that tense. For in the very next verse, the 7<sup>th</sup>, the aorist is so used. We may then give this version, — </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>6</b>. “Ye condemn, ye kill the righteous; he sets himself not in array against you.” </p>
<p>Probably the aorist is used, as it expresses what was done habitually, or a continued act, like the future tense often in Hebrew. The preceding verse, the 5<sup>th</sup>, where all the verbs are aorists, would be better rendered in the same way, “Ye live in pleasure,” etc. </p>
