<p><b>7</b><i>Be patient therefore</i>. From this inference it is evident that what has hitherto been said against the rich, pertains to the consolation of those who seemed for a time to be exposed to their wrongs with impunity. For after having mentioned the causes of those calamities which were hanging over the rich, and having stated this among others, that they proudly and cruelly ruled over the poor, he immediately adds, that we who are unjustly oppressed, have this reason to be patient, because God would become the judge. For this is what he means when he says, <i>unto the coming of the Lord</i>, that is, that the confusion of things which is now seen in the world will not be perpetual, because the Lord at his coming will reduce things to order, and that therefore our minds ought to entertain good hope; for it is not without reason that the restoration of all things is promised to us at that day. And though the day of the Lord is everywhere called in the Scriptures a manifestation of his judgment and grace, when he succors his people and chastises the ungodly, yet I prefer to regard the expression here as referring to our final deliverance. </p>
<p><i>Behold, the husbandman</i>. Paul briefly refers to the same similitude in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:6">2 Timothy 2:6</span>, when he says that the husbandman ought to labor before he gathers the fruit; but James more fully expresses the idea, for he mentions the daily patience of the husbandman, who, after having committed the seed to the earth, confidently, or at least patiently, waits until the time of harvest comes; nor does he fret because the earth does not immediately yield a ripe fruit. He hence concludes, that we ought not to be immoderately anxious, if we must now labor and sow, until the harvest as it were comes, even the day of the Lord. </p>
<p><i>The precious fruit</i>. He calls it <i>precious</i>, because it is the nourishment of life and the means of sustaining it. And James intimates, that since the husbandman suffers his life, so precious to him, to lie long deposited in the bosom of the earth, and calmly suspends his desire to gather the fruit, we ought not to be too hasty and fretful, but resignedly to wait for the day of our redemption. It is not necessary to specify particularly the other parts of the comparison. </p>
<p><i>The early and the latter rains</i>. By the two words, <i>early</i> and <i>latter</i>, two seasons are pointed out; the first follows soon after sowing; and the other when the corn is ripening. So the prophets spoke, when they intended to set forth the time for rain, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+28:12">Deuteronomy 28:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:23">Joel 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:3">Hosea 6:3</span>.) And he has mentioned both times, in order more fully to shew that husbandmen are not disheartened by the slow progress of time, but bear with the delay. </p>
