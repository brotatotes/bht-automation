<p><b>18.</b><i>No man hath ever seen God</i>. Most appropriately is this added to confirm the preceding statement; for the knowledge of God is the door by which we enter into the enjoyment of all blessings; and as it is by Christ alone that God makes himself known to us, hence too it follows that we ought to seek all things from Christ. This order of doctrine ought to be carefully observed. No remark appears to be more common than this, that each of us receives, according to the measure of his faith, what God offers to us; but there are few who think that we must bring the vessel of faith and of the knowledge of God with which we draw. </p>
<p>When he says that <i>no man hath seen God</i>, we must not understand him to refer to the outward perception of the bodily eye; for he means generally, that as God <i>dwells in inaccessible light</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:16">1 Timothy 6:16</span>,) he cannot be known but in Christ, who is his lively image. This passage is usually explained thus that as the naked majesty of God is concealed within himself, he never could be comprehended, except so far as he revealed himself in Christ; and therefore that it was only in Christ that God was formerly known to the fathers. But I rather think that the Evangelist here abides by the comparison already stated, namely, how much better our condition is than that of the fathers, because God, who was formerly concealed in his secret glory, may now be said to have rendered himself visible; for certainly when Christ is called <i>the lively image of God</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>,) this refers to the peculiar privilege of the New Testament. In like manner, the Evangelist describes, in this passage, something new and uncommon, when he says that <i>the only-begotten Son, who was in the bosom of the Father</i>, hath made known to us what was formerly concealed. He therefore magnifies the manifestation of God, which has been brought to us by the gospel, in which he distinguishes us from the fathers, and shows that we are superior to them; as also Paul explains more fully in the Third and Fourth chapters of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians. For he maintains that there is now no longer any <i>vail</i>, such as existed under the Law, but that God is openly beheld in the face of Christ. </p>
<p>If it be thought unreasonable that the fathers are deprived of the knowledge of God, who have the prophets daily going before them and holding out the torch, I reply, that what is ascribed to us is not simply or absolutely denied to them, but that a comparison is made between the less and the greater, as we say; because they had nothing more than little sparks of the true light, the full brightness of which daily shines around us. If it be objected, that at that time also God was <i>seen face to face</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+32:30">Genesis 32:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+34:10">Deuteronomy 34:10</span>,) I maintain that that sight is not at all to be compared with ours; but as God was accustomed at that time to exhibit himself obscurely, and, as it were, from a distance, those to whom he was more clearly revealed say that they <i>saw him face to face</i>. They say so with reference to their own time; but they did not see God in any other way than wrapped up in many folds of figures and ceremonies. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(31)</sup></span> That vision which Moses obtained on the mountain was remarkable and more excellent than almost all the rest; and yet God expressly declares, </p>
<p>thou shalt not be able to see my face, only thou shalt see my back, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:23">Exodus 33:23</span>;) </p>
<p>by which metaphor he shows that the time for a full and clear revelation had not yet come. It must also be observed that, when the fathers wished to behold God, they always turned their eyes towards Christ. I do not only mean that they beheld God in his eternal <i>Speech</i>, but also that they attended, with their whole mind and with their whole heart, to the promised manifestation of Christ. For this reason we shall find that Christ afterwards said, <i>Abraham saw my day</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:56">John 8:56</span>;) and that which is subordinate is not contradictory. It is therefore a fixed principle, that God, who was formerly invisible, hath now made himself visible in Christ. </p>
<p>When he says that the Son <i>was in the bosom of the Father</i>, the metaphor is borrowed from men, who are said to receive into their <i>bosom</i> those to whom they communicate all their secrets. The breast is the seat of counsel. He therefore shows that the Son was acquainted with the most hidden secrets of his Father, in order to inform us that we have the breast of God, as it were, laid open to us in the Gospel. </p>
