<p><b>21.</b><i>Art thou Elijah</i> ? Why do they name <i>Elijah</i> rather than Moses? It was because they learned from the prediction of <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:2">Malachi 4:2</span>, that when the Messiah, <i>the Sun of Righteousness</i>, should arise, <i>Elijah</i> would be the morning star to announce his approach. But the question is founded on a false opinion which they had long held; for, holding the opinion that the soul of a man departs out of one body into another, when the Prophet Malachi announced that <i>Elijah</i> would be sent, they imagined that the same <i>Elijah</i>, who lived under the reign of king Ahab, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:1">1 Kings 17:1</span>,) was to come. It is therefore a just and true reply which John makes, that <i>he is not Elijah</i>; for he speaks according to the opinion which they attached to the words; but Christ, giving the true interpretation of the Prophet, affirms that <i>John is</i> Elijah, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:14">Matthew 11:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:13">Mark 9:13</span>.) </p>
<p><i>Art thou a Prophet</i> ? Erasmus gives an inaccurate explanation of these words by limiting them to Christ; for the addition of the article (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὁ προφήτης</span></blu></grk>, <i>the prophet</i>) carries no emphasis in this passage; and the messengers afterwards declare plainly enough, that they meant a different <i>prophet</i> from Christ; for they sum up the whole: by saying, (verse 25,)<i>if thou art neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor a Prophet</i>. Thus we see that they intended to point out different persons. Others think that they inquired if he was one of the ancient <i>prophets</i>; but neither do I approve of that exposition. Rather do they by this term point out the office of John, and ask if God had appointed him to be <i>a prophet</i>. When he replies, <i>I am not</i>, he does not for the sake of modesty tell a lie, but honestly and sincerely detaches himself from the company of the <i>prophets</i>. And yet this reply is not inconsistent with the honorable attestation which Christ gives him. Christ bestows on John the designation of <i>prophet</i>, and even adds that he is <i>more than a prophet</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:9">Matthew 11:9</span>;) but by these words he does nothing more than demand credit and authority for his doctrine, and at the same time describes, in lofty terms, the excellence of the office which had been conferred on him. But in this passage John has a different object in view, which is, to show that he has no special message, as was usually the case with the <i>prophets</i>, but that he was merely appointed to be the herald of Christ. </p>
<p>This will be made still more clear by a comparison. All ambassadors — even those who are not sent on matters of great importance — obtain the name and authority of ambassadors, because they hold special commissions. Such were all the Prophets who, having been enjoined to deliver certain predictions, discharged the prophetic office. But if some weighty matter come to be transacted, and if two ambassadors are sent, one of whom announces the speedy arrival of another who possesses full power to transact the whole matter, and if this latter has received injunctions to bring it to a conclusion, will not the former embassy be reckoned a part and appendage of the latter, which is the principal? Such was the case with John the Baptist, to whom God had given no other injunction than to prepare the Jews for listening to Christ, and becoming his disciples. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(35)</sup></span> That this is the meaning, will still more fully appear from the context; for we must investigate the opposite clause, which immediately follows. <i>I am not a prophet</i>, says he, but <i>a voice crying in the wilderness</i>. The distinction lies in this, that <i>the voice crying</i>, <i>that a way may be prepared for the Lord</i>, is not a <i>prophet</i>, but merely a subordinate minister, so to speak; and his doctrine is only a sort of preparation for listening to another Teacher. In this way John, though he is more excellent than all the prophets, still is <i>not a prophet</i> </p>
