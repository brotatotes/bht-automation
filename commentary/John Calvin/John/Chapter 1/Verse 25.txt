<p><b>25.</b><i>Why then dost thou baptize</i> ? By laying down those three degrees, they appear to form a very conclusive argument<i>: if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor a prophet</i>; for it does not belong to every man to institute the practice of <i>baptism</i>. The <i>Messiah</i> was to be one who possessed all authority. Of <i>Elijah</i> who was to come, they had formed this opinion, that he would commence the restoration both of the royal authority and of the Church. The <i>prophets</i> of God, they readily grant, have a right to discharge the office committed to them. They conclude, therefore, that for John to <i>baptize</i> is an unlawful novelty, since he has received from God no public station. But they are wrong in not acknowledging him to be that <i>Elijah</i> who is mentioned by <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:5">Malachi 4:5</span>; though he denies that he is that <i>Elijah</i> of whom they foolishly dreamed. </p>
