<p><b>28.</b><i>These things were done in Bethabara</i>. The place is mentioned, not only to authenticate the narrative, but also to inform us that this answer was given amidst a numerous assembly of people; for there were many who flocked to Johnâ€™s baptism, and this was his ordinary place for baptizing. It is likewise supposed by some to be a passage across Jordan, and, from this circumstance, they derive the name, for they interpret it <i>the house of passage</i>; unless, perhaps, some may prefer the opinion of those who refer to the memorable <i>passage</i> of the people, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jos+3:13">Joshua 3:13</span>,) when God opened up a way for them in the midst of the waters, under the direction of Joshua. Others say that it ought rather to be read <i>Betharaba</i>. Instead of <i>Bethabara</i>, some have inserted here the name <i>Bethany</i>, but this is a mistake; for we shall afterwards see how near <i>Bethany</i> was to Jerusalem. The situation of <i>Bethabara</i>, as laid down by those who have described the country, agrees best with the words of the Evangelist; though I have no wish to dispute about the pronunciation of the word. </p>
