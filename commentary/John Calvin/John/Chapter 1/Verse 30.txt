<p><b>30.</b><i>This is he of whom I said.</i> He comprehends every thing in a few words, when he declares that Christ is the person who, he said, was to be preferred to him; for hence it follows that John is nothing more than a herald sent on his account; and hence again it is evident that Christ is the Messiah. Three things are here stated; for when he says that a man <i>cometh after him,</i> he means that he himself was before him in the order of time, to prepare the way for Christ, according to the testimony of Malachi, </p>
<p>Behold, I send my messenger before my face, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:1">Malachi 3:1</span>.) </p>
<p>Again, when he says that <i>he was preferred to himself</i>, this relates to the glory with which God adorned his Son, when he came into the world to fulfill the office of a Redeemer. At last, the reason is added, which is, that Christ is far superior in dignity to John the Baptist. That honor, therefore, which the Father bestowed upon him was not accidental, but was due to his eternal majesty. But of this expression, <i>he was preferred to me</i>, <i>because he was before me</i>, I have already Spoken. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(37)</sup></span> </p>
