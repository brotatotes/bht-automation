<p><b>34.</b><i>I saw and testified.</i> He means that what he declares is not doubtful; because God was pleased to make him fully and thoroughly acquainted with those things of which he was to be the witness to the world; and it is worthy of notice, that he <i>testified</i> that Christ was<i>the Son of God,</i> because he who gives the Holy Spirit must be the Christ, for to no other belongs the honor and the office of reconciling men to God. </p>
