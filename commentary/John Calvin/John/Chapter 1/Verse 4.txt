<p><b>4.</b><i>In him was life</i>. Hitherto he has taught us, that by <i>the Speech</i> of God <i>all things were created</i>. He now attributes to him, in the same manner, the preservation of those things which had been created, as if he had said, that in the creation of the world there was not merely displayed a sudden exercise of his power, which soon passed away, but that it is manifested in the steady and regular order of nature, as he is said to uphold all things <i>by the word</i> or will <i>of his power</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>). This <i>life</i> may be extended either to inanimate creatures, (which live after their own manner, though they are devoid of feeling,) or may be explained in reference to <i>living</i> creatures alone. It is of little consequence which you choose; for the simple meaning is, that <i>the Speech</i> of God was not only the source of <i>life</i> to all the creatures, so that those which were not began to be, but that his <i>life</i> -giving power causes them to remain in their condition; for were it not that his continued inspiration gives vigor to the world, every thing that <i>lives</i> would immediately decay, or be reduced to nothing. In a word, what Paul ascribes to God, that <i>in him we are</i>, <i>and move</i>, <i>and live</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:28">Acts 17:28</span>,) John declares to be accomplished by the gracious agency of<i>the Speech</i>; so that it is God who gives us <i>life</i>, but it is by the eternal <i>Speech</i> </p>
<p><i>The life was the light of men</i>. The other interpretations, which do not accord with the meaning of the Evangelist, I intentionally pass by. He speaks here, in my opinion, of that part of <i>life</i> in which men excel other animals; and informs us that <i>the life</i> which was bestowed on <i>men</i> was not of an ordinary description, but was united to <i>the light</i> of understanding. He separates man from the rank of other creatures; because we perceive more readily the power of God by feeling it in us than by beholding it at a distance. Thus Paul charges us not <i>to seek God</i> at a distance, because he makes himself to be felt within us, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:27">Acts 17:27</span>.) After having presented a general exhibition of the kindness of Christ, in order to induce men to take a nearer view of it, he points out what has been bestowed peculiarly on themselves; namely, that they were not created like the beasts, but having been endued with reason, they had obtained a higher rank. As it is not in vain that God imparts his light to their minds, it follows that the purpose for which they were created was, that they might acknowledge Him who is the Author of so excellent a blessing. And since this light, of which <i>the Speech</i> was the source, has been conveyed from him to us, it ought to serve as a mirror, in which we may clearly behold the divine power of<i>the Speech</i> </p>
