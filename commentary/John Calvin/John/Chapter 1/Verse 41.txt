<p><b>41.</b><i>We have found the Messiah.</i> The Evangelist has interpreted the Hebrew word <i>Messiah</i> (<i>Anointed</i>) by the Greek word <i>Christ,</i> in order to publish to the whole world what was secretly known to the Jews. It was the ordinary designation of kings, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(39)</sup></span> as <i>anointing</i> was observed by them as a solemn rite. But still they were aware that one King would be anointed by God, under whom they might hope to obtain perfect and eternal happiness; especially when they should learn that the earthly kingdom of David would not be permanent. And as God raised their minds, when subdued and weighed down by various calamities, to the expectation of the Messiah, so he more clearly revealed to them that his coming was at hand. The prediction of Daniel is more clear and forcible than all the rest, so far as relates to the name of <i>Christ</i>; for he does not, like the earlier Prophets, ascribe it to kings, but appropriates it exclusively to the Redeemer, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="da+9:25">Daniel 9:25</span>.) Hence this mode of expression became prevalent, so that when the <i>Messiah</i> or<i>Christ</i> was mentioned, it was understood that no other than the Redeemer was meant. Thus we shall find the woman of Samaria saying, <i>the Messiah will come</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:25">John 4:25</span>;) which makes it the more wonderful that he who was so eagerly desired by all, and whom they had constantly in their mouths, should be received by so small a number of persons. </p>
