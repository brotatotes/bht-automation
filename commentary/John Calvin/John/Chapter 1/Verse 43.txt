<p><b>43.</b><i>Follow me.</i> When <i>Philip</i> was inflamed by this single word to follow Christ, we infer from it how great is the efficacy of the word of God; but it does not appear indiscriminately in all, for God addresses many without any advantage, just as if he struck their ears with a sound which vanished into air. So then the external preaching of the word is in itself unfruitful, except that it inflicts a deadly wound on the reprobate, so as to render them inexcusable before God. But when the secret grace of God quickens it, all the senses must be affected in such a manner that men will be prepared to <i>follow</i> wherever God calls them. We ought, therefore, to pray to Christ that he may display in us the same power of the Gospel. In the case of <i>Philip,</i> there was no doubt a peculiarity about his <i>following</i> Christ; for he is commanded to follow, not like one of us, but as a domestic, and as a familiar companion. But still the calling of all of us is illustrated by this calling of <i>Philip.</i> </p>
