<p><b>46.</b><i>Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?</i> At first, <i>Nathanael</i> refuses, the place of Christ’s nativity (as described by <i>Philip</i>) having given him offense. But, first of all, he is deceived by the inconsiderate discourse of <i>Philip;</i> for what <i>Philip</i> foolishly believed <i>Nathanael</i> receives as certain. Next, there is added a foolish judgment arising from hatred or contempt of the place. Both of these points ought to be carefully observed by us. This holy man was not far from shutting out against himself all approach to Christ. Why was this? Because he rashly believes what Philip spoke incorrectly about Christ; and next, because his mind was under the influence of a preconceived opinion that <i>no good thing could come out of Nazareth</i>. If then we are not carefully on our guard, we shall be liable to the same danger; and Satan labors every day, by similar obstacles, to hinder us from coming to Christ; for he has the dexterity to spread many falsehoods, the tendency of which is to excite our hatred or suspicion against the Gospel, that we may not venture to taste it. And next, he ceases not to try another method, namely, to make us look on Christ with contempt; for we see how many there are who take offense at the degradation of the cross, which appears both in Christ the head and in his members. But as we can hardly be so cautious as not to be tempted by those stratagems of Satan, let us at least remember immediately this caution: </p>
<p><i>Come and see.</i> Nathanael allowed his twofold error to be corrected by this expression which Philip uttered. Following his example, let us first show ourselves to be submissive and obedient; and next, let us not shrink from inquiry, when Christ himself is ready to remove the doubts which harass us. Those who read these words not as a question, but as an affirmation, <i>Some good thing may come out of Nazareth</i>, are greatly mistaken. For, in the first place, how trivial would such an observation be? And next, we know that the city <i>Nazareth</i> was not at that time held in estimation; and Philip’s reply shows plainly enough that it was expressive of hesitation and distrust. </p>
