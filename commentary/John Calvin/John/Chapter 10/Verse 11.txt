<p><b>11.</b><i>The good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</i> From the extraordinary affection which he bears towards the <i>sheep,</i> he shows how truly he acts towards them as a <i>shepherd;</i> for he is so anxious about their salvation, that he does not even spare his own life. Hence it follows, that they who reject the guardianship of so kind and amiable a <i>shepherd</i> are exceedingly ungrateful, and deserve a hundred deaths, and are exposed to every kind of harm. The remark of Augustine is exceedingly just, that this passage informs us what we ought to desire, what we ought to avoid, and what we ought to endure, in the government of the Church. Nothing is more desirable than that the Church should be governed by good and diligent <i>shepherds</i> Christ declares that <i>he is the good shepherd</i>, who keeps his Church safe and sound, first, by himself, and, next, by his agents. Whenever there is good order, and fit men hold the government, then Christ shows that he is actually <i>the shepherd</i> But there are many wolves and thieves who, wearing the garb of <i>shepherds</i>, wickedly scatter the Church. Whatever name such persons may assume, Christ threatens that we must avoid them. </p>
