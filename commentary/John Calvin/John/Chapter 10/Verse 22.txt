<p><b>22.</b><i>And it was the feast of Dedication.</i> The Greek word (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐγκαίνια</span></blu></grk>) which we have translated <i>dedication</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(298)</sup></span> properly signifies <i>renovations</i>; because the temple, which had been polluted, was again consecrated by the command of Judas Maccabaeus; and at that time it was enacted that the day of the new <i>dedication</i> or <i>consecration</i> should be celebrated every year as a festival, that the people might recall to remembrance the grace of God, which had put an end to the tyranny of Antiochus. Christ appeared <i>in the temple</i> at that time, according to custom, that his preaching might yield more abundant fruit amidst a large assembly of men. </p>
