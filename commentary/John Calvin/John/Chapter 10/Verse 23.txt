23.And Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon’s porch. The Evangelist gives to Solomon’s porch the designation ofthe temple; not that it was the sanctuary, but only an appendage tothe temple Nor does he mean the ancient porch which was built by Solomon, which had been altogether destroyed by the Chaldeans, but that which the Jews — perhaps immediately after their return from the Babylonish captivity — built after the pattern of the ancient porch, and gave it the same name, that it might be more highly honored; and Herod afterwards built a new temple.
