<p><b>23.</b><i>And Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon’s porch.</i> The Evangelist gives to <i>Solomon’s porch</i> the designation of<i>the temple</i>; not that it was the sanctuary, but only an appendage to<i>the temple</i> Nor does he mean the ancient <i>porch</i> which was built by <i>Solomon</i>, which had been altogether destroyed by the Chaldeans, but that which the Jews — perhaps immediately after their return from the Babylonish captivity — built after the pattern of the ancient <i>porch</i>, and gave it the same name, that it might be more highly honored; and Herod afterwards built a new temple. </p>
