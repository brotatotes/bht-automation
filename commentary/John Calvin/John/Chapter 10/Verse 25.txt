<p><b>25.</b><i>I have told you.</i> Our Lord Jesus <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(299)</sup></span> does not conceal that he is the Christ, and yet he does not teach them as if they were willing to learn, but rather reproaches them with obstinate malice, because, though they had been taught by the word and works of God, they had not yet made any progress. Accordingly, that they do not know him, he imputes to their own fault, as if he said: “My doctrine is easily enough understood, but the blame lies with you, because you maliciously resist God.” </p>
<p><i>The works which I do.</i> He speaks of his <i>works,</i> in order to convict them of being doubly obstinate; for, besides the doctrine, they had a striking testimony in his miracles, if they had not been ungrateful to God. He twice repeats the words, <i>You do not believe</i>, in order to prove that, of their own accord, they were deaf to doctrine, and blind to works; which is a proof of extreme and desperate malice. He says that <i>he did the works in the name of his Father;</i> because his design was, to testify the power of God in them, by which it might be openly declared that he came from God. </p>
