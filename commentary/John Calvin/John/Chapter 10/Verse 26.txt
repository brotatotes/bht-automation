<p><b>26.</b><i>Because you are not of my sheep.</i> He assigns a higher reason why they do not believe either in his miracles or in his doctrine. It is, because they are reprobate. We must observe Christ’s design; for, since they boasted of being the Church of God, that their unbelief may detract nothing from the authority of the Gospel, he affirms that the gift of <i>believing</i> is a special gift. And, indeed, <i>before that men know God</i>, <i>they must first be known by him</i>, as Paul says, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:9">Galatians 4:9</span>.) On the other hand, those to whom God does not look must always continue to look away from him. If any one murmur at this, arguing that the cause of unbelief dwells in God, because he alone has power to make <i>sheep</i>; I reply, He is free from all blame, for it is only by their voluntary malice that men reject his grace. God does all that is necessary to induce them to believe, but who shall tame wild beasts? <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(300)</sup></span> This will never be done, till the Spirit of God change them into <i>sheep</i> They who are wild will in vain attempt to throw on God the blame of their wildness, for it belongs to their own nature. In short, Christ means that it is not wonderful, if there are few who obey his Gospel, because all whom the Spirit of God does not subdue to the obedience of faith are wild and fierce beasts. So much the more unreasonable and absurd is it, that the authority of the Gospel should depend on the belief of men; but believers ought rather to consider, that they are the more strongly bound to God, because, while others remain in a state of blindness, they are drawn to Christ by the illumination of the Spirit. Here, too, the ministers of the Gospel have ground of consolation, if their labor be not profitable to all. </p>
