<p><b>3.</b><i>To him the porter openeth.</i> If by the word <i>Porter</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(282)</sup></span> any one choose to understand God, I do not object; and Christ even appears expressly to contrast the judgment of God with the false opinion of men in approving of pastors, as if he had said, “There are others, indeed, whom the world generally applauds, and on whom it willingly confers honor; but God, who holds the reins of government, does not acknowledge or approve of any but those who lead <i>the sheep</i> by this road.” </p>
<p><i>He calleth his own sheep by name.</i> I consider this as referring to the mutual consent of faith; because the disciple and the teacher are united together by the one Spirit of God, so that the teacher goes before, and the disciple follows. Some think that it denotes the intimate knowledge which every <i>shepherd</i> ought to have of each of his flock, but I do not know if this rests on solid grounds. </p>
