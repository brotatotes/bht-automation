<p><b>38.</b><i>But if I do.</i> He shows that they are held plainly convicted of unbelieving and sacrilegious contempt, because they render no reverence or honor <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(304)</sup></span> to what are undoubtedly the works of God. This is a second concession, when he says, “Though I allow you to doubt of my doctrine, you cannot deny, at least, that the miracles which I have performed are from God. You therefore openly reject God, and not a man.” </p>
<p><i>That you may know and believe.</i> Though he places <i>knowledge</i> before faith, as if <i>faith</i> were inferior to it, he does so, because he has to do with unbelieving and obstinate men, who never yield to God, until they are vanquished and constrained by experience; for rebels wish to <i>know</i> before they <i>believe</i> And yet our gracious God indulges us so far, that he prepares us for <i>faith</i> by a <i>knowledge</i> of his works. But the <i>knowledge</i> of God and of his secret wisdom comes after <i>faith</i>, because the obedience of<i>faith</i> opens to us the door of the kingdom of heaven. </p>
<p><i>That the Father is in me, and I in him.</i> He repeats the same thing which he had said before in other words, <i>I and my Father are one</i> All tends to this point, that in his ministry there is nothing contrary to his Father. “<i>The Father</i>, he says, <i>is</i> in me; that is, Divine power is manifested in me.” </p>
<p><i>And I am in my Father;</i> that is, “I do nothing but by the command of God, so that there is a mutual connection between me and my Father.” For this discourse does not relate to the unity of essence, but to the manifestation of Divine power in the person of Christ, from which it was evident that he was sent by God. </p>
