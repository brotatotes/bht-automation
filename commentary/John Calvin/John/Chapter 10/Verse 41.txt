<p><b>41.</b><i>And many came to him.</i> This large assembly shows that Christ did not seek solitude, in order to cease from the discharge of his duty, but to erect a sanctuary of God in the wilderness, when Jerusalem, which was his own abode and dwelling-place, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(306)</sup></span> had obstinately driven him out. And indeed this was a dreadful vengeance of God, that, while the temple chosen by God was <i>a den of robbers</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+7:11">Jeremiah 7:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:13">Matthew 21:13</span>,) the Church of God was collected in a despised place. </p>
<p><i>John indeed did no miracle.</i> They infer that Christ is more excellent than <i>John</i>, because he has distinguished himself by so many miracles, while <i>John did not perform a single miracle</i> Not that we ought always to judge from <i>miracles,</i> but that <i>miracles</i>, when united with doctrine, have no small weight, as has already been repeatedly mentioned. Their argument is defective; for they compare Christ with John, but they express only one part of the comparison. Besides, they take for granted, that John was an eminent prophet of God, and that he was endued with extraordinary grace of the Holy Spirit. They justly argue, therefore, that Christ ought to be preferred to John, because it was only by the fixed Providence of God that it was brought about that <i>John,</i> though in other respects a very great prophet, yet was not honored by performing any miracle. Hence they conclude, that this was done on Christ’s account, that he might be more highly esteemed. </p>
<p><i>But all that John said.</i> It appears that this was not spoken by themselves, but was added by the Evangelist, in order to show that there were two reasons which induced them to believe in Christ. On the one hand, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(307)</sup></span> they saw that the testimony which John had given to him was true; and, on the other hand, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(308)</sup></span> the miracles of Christ procured for him greater authority. </p>
