<p><b>6.</b><i>This parable.</i> This is the reason why, proudly vaunting of their wisdom, they rejected the light of Christ; for in a matter not very obscure they are exceedingly dull of apprehension. </p>
<p><i>But they did not understand what things they were which he spoke to them.</i> In this clause the Greek manuscripts differ. Some copies might be literally rendered, <i>they did not understand what he said</i> Another reading, which I have followed, is more full, though it amounts to the same meaning. The third reading is, that <i>they did not know that he who spoke of himself was the Son of God</i>; but this is not much approved. </p>
