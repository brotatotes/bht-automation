<p><b>12.</b><i>If he sleepeth, he will recover.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(313)</sup></span> Replying that <i>sleep</i> will have a salutary effect on Lazarus, they thus endeavor indirectly to dissuade Christ from going thither. And yet they do not craftily or deceitfully turn aside Christ’s words to suit their own purpose, on the pretense of not understanding what he said; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(314)</sup></span> but, thinking that he spoke about sleep, they gladly seize this opportunity of avoiding danger. Augustine, and many writers since his time, speculate about the word <i>sleep</i>, alleging that the reason why it is applied to death is, because it is as easy for God to raise the dead to life, as it is for us to perform the customary act of awaking those who are asleep. But that nothing of this sort came into the mind of Christ, may be inferred from the constant use of the term in Scripture; and since even profane writers usually apply this word <i>Sleep</i> to <i>Death</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(315)</sup></span> there was unquestionably no other reason why it came into use, but because a lifeless corpse lies without feeling, just as the body of a man who is in a profound sleep. Hence, also, <i>sleep</i> is not inappropriately called <i>the image of death</i>, and Homer calls it <i>the brother of death</i>, (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κασίγνητος θανάτουυ</span></blu></grk>.) Since this word denotes only the sleep of the body, it is prodigiously absurd to apply it — as some fanatics have done — to souls, as if, by being deprived of understanding, they were subject to death. </p>
<p><i>But I go to awake him.</i> Christ asserts his own power, when he says that he will come <i>to awake</i> Lazarus; for, though, as we have said, the word <i>sleep</i> does not express the facility of the resurrection, yet Christ shows that he is Lord of <i>death</i>, when he says, that he <i>awakes</i> those whom he restores to life. </p>
