<p><b>16.</b><i>Then Thomas.</i> Hitherto the disciples had endeavored to hinder Christ from going. <i>Thomas</i> is now prepared to follow, but it is without confidence; or, at least, he does not fortify himself by the promise of Christ, so as to follow hint with cheerfulness and composure. </p>
<p><i>Let us go, that we may die with him.</i> This is the language of despair, for they ought to have entertained no fears about their own life. The phrase, <i>with him</i>, may be explained as referring either to Lazarus or to Christ. If we refer it to Lazarus, it will be ironical, as if Thomas had said, “Of what use will it be to go thither, unless it be that we cannot discharge the duty of friends in any other manner than by seeking <i>to die along with him</i> ?” Yet I greatly prefer the other meaning, that <i>Thomas</i> does not refuse <i>to die with Christ</i> But this, as I have said, proceeds from inconsiderate zeal; for he ought rather to have taken courage from faith in the promise. </p>
