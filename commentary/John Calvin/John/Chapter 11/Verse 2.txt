<p><b>2.</b><i>It was that Mary who anointed the Lord.</i> It is a similar display of ignorance, to imagine that this <i>Mary</i>, <i>the sister of Lazarus</i>, was that woman of wicked and infamous life, who is mentioned by Luke, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:37">Luke 7:37</span>.) This mistake was occasioned by the <i>anointing</i>; as if it were not evident enough that Christ was anointed on various occasions, and even at different places. <i>The woman who was a sinner</i>, of whom Luke gives an account, <i>anointed</i> Christ at Jerusalem, where he dwelt; but Mary afterwards <i>anointed</i> him at Bethany, which was her own village. The past tense employed by the Evangelist, <i>who</i> anointed, must be referred, not to the time of the occurrence which he is now relating, but to the time when he wrote; as if he had said, “It was this Mary who afterwards poured on the head of Christ the <i>ointment</i>, on account of which a murmuring arose among the disciples,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:7">Matthew 26:7</span>.) </p>
