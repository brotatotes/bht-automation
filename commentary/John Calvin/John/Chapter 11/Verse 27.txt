<p><b>27.</b><i>Yes, Lord.</i> To prove that she believes what she had heard Christ say about himself, that <i>he is the resurrection and the life</i>, Martha replies, that <i>she believes that he is the Christ, and the Son of God</i>; and indeed this knowledge includes the sum of all blessings; for we ought always to remember for what purpose the Messiah was promised, and what duty the prophets ascribe to him. Now when Martha confesses that <i>it was he who was to come into the world</i>, she strengthens her faith by the predictions of the prophets. Hence it follows, that we ought to expect from him the full restoration of all things and perfect happiness; and, in short, that he was sent to erect and prepare the true and perfect state of the kingdom of God. </p>
