<p><b>32.</b><i>She fell at his feet.</i> From her <i>falling down at his feet</i> we learn that Christ was honored in that house beyond the ordinary custom of men. For, though it was customary to throw themselves down on the ground in the presence of kings and great men, yet as Christ had nothing about him, according to the flesh, that was royal or magnificent, it was for a different purpose that Mary<i>fell down at his feet</i> Indeed, she would not have done so, if she had not been convinced that he was the Son of God. </p>
<p><i>Lord, if thou hadst been here.</i> Though she appears to speak of Christ respectfully, yet we have lately pointed out what is faulty in these words; for the power of Christ, which filled heaven and earth, ought not to have been limited to his bodily presence. </p>
