<p><b>4.</b><i>Now Jesus, having heard this, said, This sickness is not to death.</i> He intended by this reply to free his disciples from anxiety, that they might not take it amiss, when they saw him giving himself so little concern about the danger of his friend. That they might not be alarmed, therefore, about the life of Lazarus, he declares that the disease is not deadly, and even promises that it will be an additional occasion of promoting his own glory. Though Lazarus died, yet as Christ soon afterwards restored him to life, he now declares, looking to this result, that <i>the disease is not to death</i> </p>
<p><i>But for the glory of God.</i> This clause is not contrasted with <i>death,</i> as if it were an argument that would always hold; for we know that, even though the reprobate die, the glory of God is not less strikingly displayed in their destruction than in the salvation of believers. But Christ strictly meant, in this passage, <i>the glory of God,</i> which was connected with his office. The power of God, which was displayed in the miracles of Christ, was not fitted to strike terror, but was kind and gentle. When he says that there is no danger of <i>death</i>, because he intends to display in it his own <i>glory</i> and the glory of his Father, we ought to inquire for what purpose, and with what intention, he was sent by the Father; which was, to save, and not to destroy. </p>
<p><i>For the glory, of God, that the Son of God may be glorified.</i> This expression is highly emphatic; for we learn from it that God wishes to be acknowledged in the person of his Son in such a manner, that all the reverence which he requires to be given to his own majesty <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(309)</sup></span> may be ascribed to the Son. Hence we were told formerly, </p>
<p>He who doth not honor the Son doth not honor the Father, <br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:23">John 5:23</span>.) </br></p>
<p>It is in vain for Mahometans and Jews, therefore, to pretend to worship God; for they blaspheme against Christ, and even endeavor, in this manner, to rob God of himself. </p>
