<p><b>43.</b><i>He cried with a loud voice.</i> By not touching with the hand, but only <i>crying with the voice</i>, his Divine power is more fully demonstrated. At the same time, he holds out to our view the secret and astonishing efficacy of his word. For how did Christ restore life to the dead but by the word? And therefore, in raising Lazarus, he exhibited a visible token of his spiritual grace, which we experience every day by the perception of faith, when he shows that his voice gives life. </p>
