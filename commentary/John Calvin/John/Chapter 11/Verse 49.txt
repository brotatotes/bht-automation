<p><b>49.</b><i>Then one of them, named Caiaphas.</i> It was a short consultation, for <i>Caiaphas</i> did not allow them to hesitate long. He holds out that there is but one way of purchasing safety, and that is, to slay an innocent man. To what a pitch of wickedness do men proceed, who, destitute of the fear of God, form their plans rather from the judgment of their flesh than from the word of God, and who confidently believe that they will derive advantage from that which is not permitted by the Author of every blessing.

God did not intend that this dignity should be terminated but by the death of him who held it; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(330)</sup></span> but, in consequence of trouble and confusion in public affairs, the Romans frequently changed the priests according to their fancy. </p>
