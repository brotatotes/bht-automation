<p><b>56.</b><i>They therefore sought Jesus.</i> The design of the Evangelist is, to show how extensively the fame of Christ was diffused through the whole of Judea; for they who assemble in the temple, from whatever quarter they come, are eager to seek Christ, and are employed in holding conversations among themselves concerning him. It is true that they <i>seek</i> him after a human fashion, but yet, in <i>seeking</i> him, they discover that it is the tyranny of the priests which prevents him from appearing openly. </p>
