<p><b>21.</b><i>These men therefore went to Philip.</i> It is an indication of reverence, that they do not address Christ, but are desirous to obtain access through <i>Philip</i>; for reverence always begets modesty. The inference which the Papists draw from this, that we ought to call on departed saints, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(19)</sup></span> that they may be our advocates with Christ and with the Father, is so ridiculous that it does not need refutation. The Greeks address <i>Philip,</i> while he is present; and, pray, where is the resemblance to those who address their prayers to departed saints, from whom they are separated? <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(20)</sup></span> But such are the fruits of human presumption, when it has once permitted itself to go beyond the limits of the word of God. Invocation of the saints has been rashly fabricated by the Papists out of their own brain; and now, in order to shelter themselves under a false pretense borrowed from the word of God, they corrupt the Scripture, and tear it to pieces, and do not scruple to expose it to shameful taunts. </p>
