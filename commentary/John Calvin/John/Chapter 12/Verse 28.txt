<p><b>28.</b><i>Father, glorify thy name.</i> By these words he testifies, that he prefers the <i>glory</i> of <i>the Father</i> to all things else, and even neglects and disregards his own life. And the true regulation of all our desires is, to seek the glory of God in such a manner that all other things shall give way to it; for it ought to be reckoned by us an abundant recompense, leading us to endure patiently all that is vexatious or irksome. </p>
<p><i>I have both glorified it</i>. It is as if he had said, I will finish what I have begun; for <i>God never leaveth the work of his hands imperfect</i> as it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+138:8">Psalms 138:8</span>. But as it is the purpose of God to prevent the offense of the cross, he not only promises that the death of Christ will be glorious, but also mentions with commendation the numerous ornaments with which he had already adorned it. </p>
