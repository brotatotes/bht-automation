<p><b>30.</b><i>This voice came not for my sake.</i> Had Christ no need of being strengthened, or did the Father care less for him than for us? But we must attend to this principle. As it was on our account that Christ clothed himself with flesh, so all the blessings which he received from the Father were bestowed on our account. Again, it is also true, that <i>the voice came from heaven</i> for the sake of the people; for he had no need of an outward miracle. Besides, there is here an indirect reproof, that the Jews are deaf like stones to the voice of God; for since God speaks <i>for their sake</i>, there can be no excuse for their ingratitude, when they do not lend their ears. </p>
