<p><b>31.</b><i>Now is the judgment of this world.</i> The Lord now, as if he had already succeeded in the contest, boasts of having obtained a victory not only over fear, but over death; for he describes, in lofty terms, the advantage of his death, which might have struck his disciples with consternation. Some view the word, <i>judgment</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πρίσις</span></blu></grk>) as denoting <i>reformation</i>, and others, as denoting <i>condemnation</i>. I rather agree with the former who explain it to mean, that <i>the world</i> must be restored to a proper order; for the Hebrew word <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">משפט</span></blu></heb>, <i>mishpat</i>, which is translated <i>judgment</i>, means a well-ordered state. Now we know, that out of Christ there is nothing but confusion in <i>the world</i>; and though Christ had already begun to erect the kingdom of God, yet his death was the commencement of a well-regulated condition, and the full restoration of the world. </p>
<p>Yet it must also be observed, that this proper arrangement cannot be established in <i>the world</i>, until the kingdom of Satan be first destroyed, until the flesh, and every thing opposed to the righteousness of God, be reduced to nothing. Lastly, the renovation of <i>the world</i> must be preceded by mortification. Accordingly, Christ declares: </p>
<p><i>Now shall the prince of this world be cast out;</i> for the confusion and deformity arise from this, that while Satan usurps tyrannical dominion, iniquity everywhere abounds. When Satan has been<i>cast out</i>, therefore, <i>the world</i> is brought back from its revolt, and placed under obedience to the government of God. It may be asked, how was Satan <i>cast out</i> by the death of Christ, since he does not cease to make war continually? I reply, this <i>casting out</i> must not be limited to any short period of time, but is a description of that remarkable effect of the death of Christ which is daily manifested. </p>
