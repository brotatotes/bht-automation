<p><b>34.</b><i>We have heard from the law.</i> Their intention undoubtedly was, to carp malignantly at the words of Christ; and therefore their malice blinds them, so that they perceive nothing amidst the clearest light. They say that Jesus ought not to be regarded as the Christ, because he said that he would die, while <i>the Law</i> ascribes perpetuity to the Messiah; as if both statements had not been expressly made in <i>the Law</i> that Christ will die, and that afterwards his kingdom will flourish to the end of the world. But they seize on the second clause, and make it a ground of calumny. The origin of their error was, that they judged of the splendor of Messiah’s kingdom according to their carnal views; in consequence of which, they reject Christ because he does not correspond to their foolish notion. Under the term <i>the Law</i> they embrace also the Prophets, and the present tense — <i>remaineth</i> — -is used, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, instead of the future tense, <i>will remain</i> </p>
