<p><b>35.</b><i>Yet a little while the light is with you.</i> Though in this reply the Lord gently admonishes them, yet at the same time he reproves them sharply; for he charges them with shutting their eyes against <i>the light</i>, and at the same time threatens that ere long the light will be taken away from them. When he says that <i>yet a little while</i> there is some remaining <i>light</i>, he confirms what he had already said about his death; for though by <i>the light</i> he does not mean his bodily presence, but his Gospel, yet he alludes to his departure; as if he had said, When I shall have gone away, I will not cease to be <i>the light</i>, and thus my glory will not be diminished through your darkness. When he says that <i>the light is with them</i>, he indirectly reproves them for closing their eyes and shutting out the light; and thus he declares that they do not deserve an answer to their objection, because of their own accord they seek an opportunity of falling into error. </p>
<p><i>Walk while you have the light lest darkness overtake you.</i> This statement, that <i>the light</i> does not continue to shine on them but for <i>a little while</i>, Applies equally to all unbelievers; for Scripture promises that to the children of God <i>the Sun of righteousness</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:2">Malachi 4:2</span>) will rise, and will never go down. </p>
<p>The sun shall no longer be your light by day, nor the moon by night, but the Lord shall be your everlasting light,<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:19">Isaiah 60:19</span>.) </p>
<p>But all ought to <i>walk</i> cautiously, because contempt of <i>the light</i> is followed by darkness. This, too, is the reason why night so thick and dark sat down on the world for many centuries. It was because there were few who deigned to walk in the brightness of heavenly wisdom; for Christ enlightens us by his Gospel, in order that we may follow the way of salvation, which he points out to us. For this reason, they who do not avail themselves of the grace of God extinguish, as far as lies in their power, the light which is offered to them. </p>
<p><i>And he who walketh in darkness knoweth not where he goeth.</i> To strike them with still deeper alarm, he reminds them how wretched is the condition of those who, being destitute of light, do nothing but wander throughout the whole course of, their life. For they cannot move a step without the risk of falling or even of destruction. But now Christ declares that we are <i>in darkness</i>, unless he shine upon us. Hence infer what is the value of the sagacity of the human mind, when it is the sole guide and instructor, apart from Christ. </p>
