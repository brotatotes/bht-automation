<p><b>2.</b><i>After supper.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(39)</sup></span> We shall afterwards take into consideration, at the proper place, the whole of Christ’s design in <i>washing the feet</i> of his disciples, and the advantage to be derived from this narrative. Let us now attend to the connection of the words. The Evangelist says that this was done, while Judas already resolved to betray Christ, not only to show the wonderful patience of Christ, who could endure to <i>wash the feet</i> of such a wicked and detestable traitor; but also that he purposely selected the time when he was near death, for performing what may be regarded as the last act of his life. </p>
<p><i>The devil having already put it into the heart of Judas.</i> When the Evangelist says that Judas had been impelled by <i>the devil</i> to form the design of <i>betraying</i> Christ, this tends to show the enormity of the crime; for it was dreadful and most atrocious wickedness, in which the efficacy of Satan was openly displayed. There is no wickedness, indeed, that is perpetrated by men, to which Satan does not excite them, but the more hideous and execrable any crime is, the more ought we to view in it the <i>rage of the devil</i>, who drives about, in all possible directions, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(40)</sup></span> men who have been forsaken by God. But though the lust of men is kindled into a fiercer flame by Satan’s fan, still it does not cease to be a furnace; it contains the flame kindled within itself, it receives with avidity the agitation of the fan, so that no excuse is left for wicked men. </p>
