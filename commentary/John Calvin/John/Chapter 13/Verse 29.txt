<p><b>29.</b><i>Or that he should give something to the poor.</i> It is plain enough from other passages how great was Christâ€™s poverty, and yet, out of the little that he had, he <i>gave something to the poor</i>, in order to lay down a rule for us; for the Apostles would not have conjectured that he had spoken about <i>the poor</i>, if it had not been their usual custom to relieve <i>the poor</i> </p>
