<p><b>31.</b><i>Now is the Son of man glorified.</i> The last hour was at hand; Christ knew that the minds of his disciples were very weak, and, therefore, he endeavored, by every possible method, to support them, that they might not give way. Even at the present day, the remembrance of the cross of Christ is sufficient to make us tremble, were we not instantly met by the consolation, that he triumphed in the cross, having obtained a victory over Satan, sin, and death. What, then, might have happened to the Apostles, when they saw the Lord soon dragged to the cross, loaded with every kind of reproaches? Might not an exhibition so melancholy and revolting have overwhelmed them a hundred times? Christ, therefore, provides against this danger, and withdraws them from the outward aspect of death to its spiritual fruit. Whatever ignominy, then, may be seen in the cross, fitted to confound believers, yet Christ testifies that the same cross brings glory and honor to him. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(57)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>And God is glorified in him.</i> This clause, which immediately follows the other, is added for confirmation; for it was a paradoxical statement, that <i>the glory of the Son of man</i> arose from a death which was reckoned ignominious among men, and was even accursed before God. He shows, therefore, in what manner he would obtain glory to himself from such a death. It is, because by it <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(58)</sup></span> he glorifies God the Father; for in the cross of Christ:, as in a magnificent theater, the inestimable goodness of God is displayed before the whole world. In all the creatures, indeed, both high and low, the glory of God shines, but nowhere has it shone more brightly than in the cross, in which there has been an astonishing change of things, the condemnation of all men has been manifested, sin has been blotted out, salvation has been restored to men; and, in short, the whole world has been renewed, and every thing restored to good order. </p>
<p><i>In him.</i> Though the preposition (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐν</span></blu></grk>) <i>in</i> is often used instead of the Hebrew <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">ב</span></blu></heb>, and, in such eases, is equivalent to <i>by</i>, yet I have preferred translating it simply, that <i>God is glorified</i> in <i>the Son of man</i>; because I considered that phrase to be more emphatic. When he says, and <i>God is glorified</i>, the meaning, I apprehend, is, for <i>God is glorified</i> </p>
