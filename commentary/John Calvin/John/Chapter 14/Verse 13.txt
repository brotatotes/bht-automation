<p><b>13.</b><i>And whatever you ask in my name, that I will do.</i> By these words He plainly declares that he will be the Author of all that shall be done by the hands of the Apostles. But it may be asked, was he not even then the Mediator in whose name men ought to pray to the Father? I reply, he plainly discharged the office of Mediator, ever since he entered into the heavenly sanctuary; as we shall afterwards repeat at the proper place. </p>
<p><i>That the Father may be glorified in the Son.</i> This passage agrees with what Paul says, </p>
<p>That every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+2:11">Philippians 2:11</span>.) </p>
<p>The end of all things is the sanctification of the name of God; but here the true method of sanctifying it is declared; that is, <i>in the Son</i>, and <i>by the Son</i>. For, though the majesty of God be in itself hidden from us, it shines <i>in Christ</i>; though his hand be concealed, we have it visible <i>in Christ</i>. Consequently, in the benefits which the Father bestows upon us, we have no right to separate <i>the Father</i> from <i>the Son</i>, according to that saying, </p>
<p>He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father, <br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:23">John 6:23</span>.) </br></p>
