<p><b>15.</b><i>If you love me.</i> The <i>love</i> with which the disciples <i>loved</i> Christ was true and sincere, and yet there was some superstition mixed with it, as is frequently the case with ourselves; for it was very foolish in them to wish to keep him in the world. To correct this fault, he bids them direct their love to another end; and that is, to employ themselves in <i>keeping the commandments</i> which he had given them. This is undoubtedly a useful doctrine, for of those who think that they <i>love</i> Christ, there are very few who honor him as they ought to do; but, on the contrary, after having performed small and trivial services, they give themselves no farther concern. The true <i>love</i> of Christ, on the other hand, is regulated by the observation of his doctrine as the only rule. But we are likewise reminded how sinful our affections are, since even the love which we bear to Christ is not without fault, if it be not directed to a pure obedience. </p>
