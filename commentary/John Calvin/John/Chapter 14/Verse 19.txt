<p><b>19.</b><i>Yet a little while.</i> He continues the commendation of special grace, which ought to have been sufficient for alleviating, and even for removing the grief of the disciples. “When I shall have withdrawn,” says he, “from the view of the world: still I shall be present with you.” That we may enjoy this secret beholding of Christ, we must not judge of his presence or his absence according to carnal perception, but we must earnestly employ the eyes of faith for contemplating his power. Thus believers always have Christ present by his Spirit, and behold him, though they be distant from him in body. </p>
<p><i>Because I live.</i> This statement may be explained in two ways. Either it may be viewed as a confirmation of the former clause, <i>because I live</i>, <i>and you shall live</i>; or, it may be read separately, <i>because I live</i>, <i>you also shall live</i>; and then the meaning will be, that believers <i>will live</i>, <i>because Christ liveth</i> I willingly embrace the former opinion, and yet we may draw from it the other doctrine, that the life of Christ is the cause of our life. He begins by pointing out the cause of the difference, why he shall be <i>seen</i> by his disciples, and <i>not by the world</i> It isn’t because Christ cannot be <i>seen</i> but according to the spiritual life, of which the world is deprived. <i>The world seeth not</i> Christ; this is not wonderful, for the death of blindness is the cause; but as soon as any man begins to live by the Spirit, he is immediately endued with eyes to see Christ. Now, the reason of this is, that our life is closely connected with the life of Christ, and proceeds from it as from its source; for we are dead in ourselves, and the life with which we flatter ourselves is a very bad death. Accordingly, when the question is, how we are to obtain life, our eyes must be directed to Christ, and his life must be conveyed to us by faith, that our consciences may be fully convinced, that, so long as Christ lives, we are free from all danger of destruction; for it is an undoubted truth, that <i>his life</i> would be nothing, when his members were dead. </p>
