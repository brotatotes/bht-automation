<p><b>20.</b><i>At that day</i> Some refer this to <i>the day</i> of Pentecost; but it rather denotes the uninterrupted course, as it were, of a single day, from the time when Christ exerted the power of his Spirit till the last resurrection. From that time they began to <i>know</i>, but it was a sort of feeble beginning, because the Spirit had not yet wrought so powerfully in them. For the object of these words is, to show that we cannot, by indolent speculation, <i>know</i> what is the sacred and mystical union between us and him, and again, between him and <i>the Father</i>; but that the only way of knowing it is, when he diffuses his life in us by the secret efficacy of the Spirit; and this is the trial of faith, which I lately mentioned. </p>
<p>As to the manner in which this passage was formerly abused by the Aryans, to prove that Christ is God only by participation and by grace, it is easy to refute their sophistry. For Christ does not speak merely of his eternal essence, but of that Divine power which was manifested in him. As <i>the Father</i> has laid up in the Son all fullness of blessings, so, on the other hand, the Son has conveyed himself entirely into us. He is said <i>to be in us</i>, because he plainly shows, by the efficacy of his Spirit, that he is the Author and the cause of our life. </p>
