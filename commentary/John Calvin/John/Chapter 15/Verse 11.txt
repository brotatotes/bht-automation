<p><b>11.</b><i>These things I have spoken to you.</i> He adds, that his love is far from being unknown to the godly, but that it is perceived by faith, so that they enjoy blessed peace of conscience; for the <i>joy</i> which he mentions springs from that peace with God which is possessed by all that have been justified by free grace. As often, then, as God’s fatherly love towards us is preached, let us know that there is given to us ground for true <i>joy</i>, that, with peaceable consciences, we may be certain of our salvation. </p>
<p><i>My joy and your joy.</i> It is called <i>Christ</i> ’<i>s joy</i> and <i>our joy</i> in various respects. It is <i>Christ</i> ’<i>s</i>, because it is given to us by him; for he is both the Author and the Cause of it. I say that he is the <i>Cause</i> of it, because we were freed from guilt, when </p>
<p>the chastisement of our peace was laid on him, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:5">Isaiah 53:5</span>.) </p>
<p>I call him also the Author of it, because by his Spirit he drives away dread and anxiety in our hearts, and then arises that calm cheerfulness. It is said to be <i>ours</i> for a different reason; because we enjoy it since it has been given to us. Now since Christ declares that <i>he spake these things</i>, <i>that the disciples might have joy</i>, we conclude from these words, that all who have duly profited by this sermon have something on which they can rest. </p>
<p><i>That my joy may abide in you.</i> By the word <i>abide</i> he means, that it is not a fleeting or temporary<i>joy</i> of which he speaks, but a<i>joy</i> which never fails or passes away. Let us therefore learn that we ought to seek in the doctrine of Christ the assurance of salvation, which retains its vigor both in life and in death. </p>
<p><i>That your joy may be full.</i> He adds, that this <i>joy</i> will be solid and<i>full;</i> not that believers will be entirely free from all sadness, but that the ground for<i>joy</i> will be far greater, so that no dread, no anxiety, no grief, will swallow them up; for those to whom it has been given to glory in Christ will not be prevented, either by life, or by death, or by any distresses, from bidding defiance to sadness. </p>
