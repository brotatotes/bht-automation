He does not mean that we obtain so great an honor by our own merit, but only reminds them of the condition on which he receives us into favor, and deigns to reckon us among his friends; as he said a little before, If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, (John 15:10.) For the grace of God our Savior hath appeared, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and righteously, and piously, in this world, (Titus 2:11.) But ungodly men, who, through wicked contempt of the Gospel, want only oppose Christ, renounce his friendship.
