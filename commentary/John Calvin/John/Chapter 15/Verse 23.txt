<p><b>23.</b><i>He who hateth me hateth my Father also.</i> This is a remarkable passage, which teaches us that no man can hate the doctrine of the Gospel without manifesting his impiety against God. There are many, indeed, who profess differently in words; for, though they abhor the Gospel, still they wish to be thought very good servants of God; but it is false, for a contempt of God is concealed within. In this manner Christ discovers the hypocrisy of many by the light of his doctrine; and on this subject we have spoken more largely under that passage, </p>

<p>and under that passage, </p>
<p>He who honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(90)</sup></span> <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:23">John 5:23</span>.) </p>
