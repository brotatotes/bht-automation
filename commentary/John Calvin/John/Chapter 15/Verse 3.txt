<p><b>3.</b><i>You are already clean, on account of the word.</i> He reminds them that they have <i>already</i> experienced in themselves what he had said; that they have been planted in him, and have also been <i>cleansed</i> or <i>pruned</i> He points out the means of <i>pruning</i>, namely, doctrine; and there can be no doubt that he speaks of outward preaching, for he expressly <i>mentions the word,</i> which they had heard from his mouth. Not that <i>the word</i> proceeding from the mouth of a man has so great efficacy, but, so far as Christ works in the heart by the Spirit, <i>the word</i> itself is the instrument of <i>cleansing</i> Yet Christ does not mean that the apostles are pure from all sin, but he holds out to them their experience, that they may learn from it that the continuance of grace is absolutely necessary. Besides, he commends to them the doctrine of the gospel from the fruit which it produces, that they may be more powerfully excited to meditate on it continually, since it resembles the vine-dresserâ€™s knife to take away what is useless. </p>
