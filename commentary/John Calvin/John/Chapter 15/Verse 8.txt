<p><b>8.</b><i>In this my Father is glorified</i> This is a confirmation of the former statement; for he shows that we ought not to doubt that God will listen to the prayers of his people, when they desire to be rendered fruitful; for this contributes very greatly to his glory. But by this end or effect he likewise kindles in them the desire of doing good; for there is nothing which we ought to value more highly than that the name of God may be glorified by us. To the same effect is the latter clause, <i>that you may become my disciples;</i> for he declares that he has no one in his flock who does not <i>bear fruit</i> to the <i>glory</i> of God. </p>
