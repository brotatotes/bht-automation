<p><b>26.</b><i>In that day you shall ask in my name.</i> He again repeats the reason why the heavenly treasures were then to be so bountifully opened up. It is, because <i>they ask in the name of Christ</i> whatever they need, and God will refuse nothing that shall be asked <i>in the name</i> of his Son. But there appears to be a contradiction in the words; for Christ immediately adds, that it will be unnecessary for him <i>to pray to the Father</i> Now, what purpose does it serve to pray <i>in his name</i>, if he does not undertake the office of Intercessor? In another passage John calls him <i>our Advocate</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>.) Paul also testifies that Christ now <i>intercedes</i> for <i>us</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:34">Romans 8:34</span>;) and the same thing is confirmed by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, who declares that Christ <i>always liveth to make intercession for us</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span>.) I reply, Christ does not absolutely say, in this passage, that he will not be Intercessor, but he only means, that <i>the Father</i> will be so favorably disposed towards the disciples, that, without any difficulty, he will give freely whatever they shall ask. “<i>My Father</i>, ” he says, “will meet you, and, on account of the great love which he bears towards you, will anticipate the Intercessor, who, otherwise, would speak on your behalf.” </p>
<p>Besides, when Christ is said to intercede with <i>the Father</i> for <i>us</i>, let us not indulge in carnal imaginations about him, as if he were on his knees before <i>the Father</i>, offering humble supplication in our name. But the value of his sacrifice, by which he once pacified God toward us, is always powerful and efficacious; the blood by which he atoned for our sins, the obedience which he rendered, is a continual intercession for us. This is a remarkable passage, by which we are taught that we have the heart of the Heavenly Father, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(104)</sup></span> as soon as we have placed before Him <i>the name</i> of his Son. </p>
