<p><b>33.</b><i>These things I have spoken to you.</i> He again repeats how necessary those consolations are which he had addressed to them; and he proves it by this argument, that numerous distresses and <i>tribulations</i> await them in <i>the world.</i> We ought to attend, first, to this admonition, that all believers ought to be convinced that their life is exposed to many afflictions, that they may be disposed to exercise patience. Since, therefore, <i>the world</i> is like a troubled sea, true<i>peace</i> will be found nowhere but in Christ. Next, we ought to attend to the manner of enjoying that <i>peace,</i> which he describes in this passage. He says that they will have <i>peace</i>, if they make progress in this doctrine. Do we wish then to have our minds calm and easy in the midst of afflictions? Let us be attentive to this discourse of Christ, which in itself will give us <i>peace</i> </p>
<p><i>But be of good courage.</i> As our sluggishness must be corrected by various afflictions, and as we must be awakened to seek a remedy for our distress, so the Lord does not intend that our minds shall be cast down, but rather that we shall fight keenly, which is impossible, if we are not certain of success; for if we must fight, while we are uncertain as to the result, all our zeal will quickly vanish. When, therefore, Christ calls us to the contest, he arms us with assured confidence of victory, though still we must toil hard. </p>
<p><i>I have overcome the world.</i> As there is always in us much reason for trembling, he shows that we ought to be confident for this reason, that he has obtained a <i>victory</i> over <i>the world</i>, not for himself individually, but for our sake. Thus, though in ourselves almost overwhelmed, if we contemplate that magnificent glory to which our Head has been exalted, we may boldly despise all the evils which hang over us. If, therefore, we desire to be Christians, we must not seek exemption from the cross, but must be satisfied with this single consideration, that, fighting under the banner of Christ, we are beyond all danger, even in the midst of the combat. Under the term <i>World,</i> Christ here includes all that is opposed to the salvation of believers, and especially all the corruptions which Satan abuses for the purpose of laying snares for us. </p>
