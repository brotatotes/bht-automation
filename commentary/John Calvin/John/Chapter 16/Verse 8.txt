<p><b>8.</b><i>And when he is come.</i> Passing by the diversity of expositions, which we have received in consequence of the obscurity of the passage, I shall only state what appears to me to be in accordance with Christ’s true meaning. He had promised his <i>Spirit</i> to the disciples; and now he praises the excellence of the gift from its effect, because this <i>Spirit</i> will not only guide, support, and protect them in private, but will extend more widely his power and efficacy. </p>
<p><i>He will convince the world;</i> that is, he will not remain shut up in you, but; his power will go forth from you to be displayed to the whole world. He therefore promises to them a<i>Spirit</i>, who will be the Judge of the world, and by whom their preaching will be so powerful and efficacious, that it will bring into subjection those who formerly indulged in unbounded licentiousness, and were restrained by no fear or reverence. </p>
<p>It ought to be observed, that in this passage Christ does not speak of secret revelations, but of the power of the Spirit, which appears in the outward doctrine of the Gospel, and in the voice of men. For how comes it that the voice proceeding from the mouth of a man <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(94)</sup></span> penetrates into the hearts, takes root there, and at length yields fruit, changing hearts of stone into hearts of flesh, and renewing men, but because the Spirit of Christ quickens it? Otherwise it would be a dead letter and a useless sound, as Paul says in that beautiful passage, in which he boasts of being <i>a minister of the Spirit</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>,) because God wrought powerfully in his doctrine. The meaning therefore is, that, though the Spirit had been given to the apostles, they would be endued with a heavenly and Divine power, by which they would exercise jurisdiction over the whole world. Now, this is ascribed to the Spirit rather than to themselves, because they will have no power of their own, but will be only ministers and organs, and the Holy Spirit will be their director and governor. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(95)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Under the term <i>world</i> are, I think, included not only those who would be truly converted to Christ, but hypocrites and reprobates. For there are two ways in which <i>the Spirit convinces</i> men by the preaching of the Gospel. Some are moved in good earnest, so as to bow down willingly, and to assent willingly to the <i>judgment</i> by which they are condemned. Others, though they are convinced of guilt and cannot escape, yet do not sincerely yield, or submit themselves to the authority and jurisdiction of the Holy Spirit, but, on the contrary, being subdued they groan inwardly, and, being overwhelmed with confusion, still do not cease to cherish obstinacy within their hearts. </p>
<p>We now perceive in what manner the Spirit was to convince <i>the world</i> by the apostles. It was, because God revealed his <i>judgment</i> in the Gospel, by which their consciences were struck, and began to perceive their evils and the grace of God. for the verb <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐλέγχειν</span></blu></grk> here signifies <i>to convince</i> or <i>convict</i>; and, for understanding this passage, not a little light will be obtained from the words of the Apostle Paul, when he says, </p>
<p>If all shall prophesy, and an unbeliever or unlearned man enter, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all, and thus shall the secrets of his heart be made manifest, <br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:23">1 Corinthians 14:23</span>.) </br></p>
<p>In that passage Paul speaks particularly of one kind of <i>conviction</i>, that is; when the Lord brings his elect to repentance by the Gospel; but this plainly shows in what manner <i>the Spirit</i> of God, by the sound of the human voice, constrains men, who formerly were not accustomed to his yoke, to acknowledge and submit to his authority. </p>
<p>A question now arises, For what purpose did Christ say this? Some think that he points out the cause of the hatred which he had mentioned; as if he had said, that the reason why they will be hated by <i>the world</i> is, that <i>the Spirit</i>, on the other hand, will earnestly solicit <i>the world</i> by means of them. But I rather agree with those who tell us that the design of Christ was different, as I stated briefly at the commencement of the exposition of this verse; for it was of great importance that the apostles should know that the gift of <i>the Spirit</i>, which had been promised to them, was of no ordinary value. He therefore describes its uncommon excellence, by saying that God will, in this way, erect his tribunal for<i>judging</i> the whole <i>world</i>. </p>
