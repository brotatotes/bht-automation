<p><b>9.</b><i>Of sin.</i> It now remains that we see what it is to <i>convince of sin</i> Christ appears to make unbelief the only cause <i>of sin</i>, and this is tortured by commentators in various ways; but, as I have already said, I do not intend to detail the opinions which have been held and advanced. First, it ought to be observed, that the <i>judgment of the Spirit</i> commences with the demonstration <i>of sin</i>; for the commencement of spiritual instruction is, that men born in <i>sin</i> have nothing in them but what leads to <i>sin</i> Again, Christ mentioned <i>unbelief</i>, in order to show what is the nature of men in itself for, since faith is the bond by which he is united to us, until we believe in him, we are out of him and separated from him. The import of these words is as if he had said, “<i>When the Spirit is come</i>, he will produce full conviction that, apart from me, <i>sin</i> reigns in <i>the world</i>; ” and, therefore, unbelief is here mentioned, because it separates us from Christ, in consequence of which nothing is left to us but <i>sin</i> In short, by these words he condemns the corruption and depravity of human nature, that we may not suppose that a single drop of integrity is in us without Christ. </p>
