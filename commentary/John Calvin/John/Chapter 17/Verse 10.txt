<p><b>10.</b><i>And all things that are mine are thine.</i> The object of the former clause is to show that the Father will assuredly listen to him. “I do not,” says he, “plead with thee for any but those whom thou acknowledgest to be <i>thine,</i> for I have nothing separated from thee, and therefore I shall not meet with a refusal.” In the second clause, <i>and thine are mine,</i> he shows that he has good reason for caring about the elect; for they are <i>his</i> in consequence of their being <i>his Father’s.</i> All these things are spoken for the confirmation of our faith. We must not seek salvation anywhere else than in Christ. But we shall not be satisfied with having Christ, if we do not know that we possess God in him. We must therefore believe that there is such a unity between the Father and the Son as makes it impossible that they shall have anything separate from each other. </p>
<p><i>And I am glorified in them.</i> This is connected with the second clause of the verse, <i>and thine are mine;</i> for it follows that it is reasonable that he, for his part, should promote their salvation; and this is a most excellent testimony for confirming our faith, that Christ never will cease to care for our salvation, since he <i>is glorified in us.</i> </p>
