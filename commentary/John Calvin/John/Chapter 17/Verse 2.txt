<p><b>2.</b><i>As thou hast given him.</i> He again confirms the statement, that he asks nothing but what is agreeable to the will of the Father; as it is a constant rule o prayer not to ask more than God would freely bestow; for nothing is more contrary to reason, than to bring forward in the <i>presence</i> of God whatever we choose. </p>
<p><i>Power over all flesh</i> means the authority which was given to Christ, when the Father appointed him to be King and Head; but we must observe the end, which is, <i>to give eternal life</i> to all his people. Christ receives authority, not so much for himself as for the sake of our salvation; and, therefore, we ought to submit to Christ, not only that we may obey God, but because nothing is more lovely than that subjection, since it brings to us eternal life. </p>
<p><i>To all whom thou hast given me.</i> Christ does not say that he has been made Governor over the whole world, in order to bestow <i>life</i> on all without any distinction; but he limits this grace to those who <i>have been given to him</i> But how were they <i>given to him</i> ? For the Father has subjected to him the reprobate. I reply, it is only the elect who belong to his peculiar flock, which he has undertaken to guard as a Shepherd. So then, the kingdom of Christ extends, no doubt, to all men; but it brings salvation to none but the elect, who with voluntary obedience follow the voice of the Shepherd; for the others are compelled by violence to obey him, till at length he utterly bruise them with his iron scepter. </p>
