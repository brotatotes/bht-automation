<p><b>23.</b><i>I in them, and thou in me;</i> for he intends to teach that in him dwells all fullness of blessings, and that what was concealed in God is now manifested in him, that he may impart it to his people, as the water, flowing from the fountain by various channels, waters the fields on all sides. </p>
<p><i>And hast loved them,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(126)</sup></span> He means that it is a very striking exhibition, and a very excellent pledge, of the love of God towards believers, which the world is compelled to feel, whether it will or not, when the Holy Spirit dwelling in them sends forth the rays of righteousness and holiness. There are innumerable other ways, indeed, in which God daily testifies his fatherly love towards us, but the mark of adoption is justly preferred to them all. He likewise adds,<i>and hast loved them,</i> As Thou Hast Loved Me. By these words he intended to point out the cause and origin of the love; for the particle <i>as,</i> means <i>because,</i> and the words, AS <i>thou hast loved me,</i> mean, Because <i>thou hast loved me;</i> for to Christ alone belongs the title of <i>Well-beloved,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>.) Besides, that love which the heavenly Father bears towards the Head is extended to all the members, so that he loves none but in Christ. </p>
<p>Yet this gives rise to some appearance of contradiction; for Christ, as we have seen elsewhere <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(127)</sup></span> declares that the unspeakable <i>love of God</i> towards <i>the world</i> was the reason why <i>he gave his only-begotten Son,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>.) If the cause must go before the effect, we infer that God the Father <i>loved</i> men apart from Christ; that is, before he was appointed to be the Redeemer. I reply, in that, and similar passages, <i>love</i> denotes the mercy with which God was moved towards unworthy persons, and even towards his enemies, before he reconciled them to himselfi It is, indeed, a wonderful goodness of God, and inconceivable by the human mind, that, exercising benevolence towards men whom he could not but hate, he removed the cause of the hatred, that there might be no obstruction to his love. And, indeed, Paul informs us that there are two ways in which we are <i>loved</i> in Christ; first, because the Father </p>
<p>chose us in him before the creation of the world, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>;) </p>
<p>and, secondly, because in Christ God <i>hath reconciled us to himself,</i> and hath showed that he is gracious to us, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:10">Romans 5:10</span>.) Thus we are at the same time the enemies and the friends of God, until, atonement having been made for our sins, we are restored to favor with God. But when we are justified by faith, it is then, properly, that we begin to be <i>loved</i> by God, as children by a father. That <i>love</i> by which Christ was appointed to be the person, in whom we should be fiercly chosen before we were born, and while we were still ruined in Adam, is hidden in the breast of God, and far exceeds the capacity of the human mind. True, no man will ever feel that God is gracious to him, unless he perceives that God is pacified in Christ. But as all relish for the love of God vanishes when Christ is taken away, so we may safely conclude that, since by faith we are ingrafted into his body, there is no danger of our falling from <i>the love of God;</i> for this foundation cannot be overturned, that we are <i>loved,</i> because the Father <i>hath loved</i> his Son. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(128)</sup></span> </p>
