<p><b>4.</b><i>I have glorified thee.</i> His reason for saying this is, that God had been made known to the world both by the doctrine of Christ, and by his miracles; and the <i>glory</i> of God is, when we know what he is. When he adds, <i>I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do</i>, he means that he has completed the whole course of his calling; for the full time was come when he ought to be received into the heavenly <i>glory</i> Nor does he speak only of the office of teaching, but includes also the other parts of his ministry; for, though the chief part of it still remained to be accomplished, namely, the sacrifice of death, by which he was to take away the iniquities of us all, yet, as the hour of his death was already at hand, he speaks as if he had already endured it. The amount of his request, therefore, <i>is</i> that the Father would put him in possession of the kingdom; since, having completed his course, nothing more remained for him to do, than to display, by the power of the Spirit, the fruit and efficacy of all that he had done on earth by the command of his Father, according to the saying of Paul, </p>
<p>He humbled and annihilated himself, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(111)</sup></span> by taking the form of a servant.
