<p><b>18.</b><i>And Simon Peter was standing with them.</i> When the evangelist adds that <i>Peter was standing near the fire, along with the others and servants,</i> this serves to connect the various parts of the narrative, as we shall afterwards see. But this shows how great was Peter’s stupidity, when, without the least concern, he <i>warmed himself</i> along with a multitude of wicked men, after having denied his Master; though it is possible that he may have been restrained by fear lest, in going out of the high priest’s house, he should fall into another danger of the same kind. </p>
