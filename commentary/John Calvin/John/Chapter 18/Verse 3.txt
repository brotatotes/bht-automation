<p><b>3.</b><i>Judas, therefore, having received a band of soldiers.</i> That <i>Judas</i> came accompanied by soldiers and by so large a retinue, is a sign of a bad conscience, which always trembles without any cause. It is certain that the <i>band of soldiers</i> was borrowed from the governor, who also sent a captain at the head of a thousand soldiers; for, on account of sudden mutinies, a garrison was stationed in the city, and the governor himself kept a body-guard, wherever he was. The rest were <i>officers</i> sent by <i>the priests;</i> but John makes separate mention <i>of the Pharisee,</i> because they were more enraged than all the rest, as if they had cared more about religion. </p>
