<p><b>30.</b><i>If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him to thee.</i> They indirectly complain of Pilate, that he has not a proper reliance on their integrity. “Why do you not, without further concerns” say they, “hold it to be certain, that the person whom we prosecute deserves to die?” Such is the manner in which wicked men, whom God has raised to a high degree of honor, blinded as it were by their own greatness, allow themselves to do whatever they choose. Such, too, is the intoxicating nature of pride. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(151)</sup></span> They wish that Christ should be reckoned a malefactor, and for no other reason <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(152)</sup></span> but because they accuse him. But if we come to the truth of the matter, what deeds of <i>a malefactor</i> shall we find in him, except that he has cured every kind of diseases, has driven the devils out of men, has made the paralytics and the lame to walk, has restored sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and life to the dead? Such were the real facts, and those men knew them well; but, as I said a little ago, when men are intoxicated with pride, nothing is more difficult than to arouse them to form a sound and correct judgment. </p>
