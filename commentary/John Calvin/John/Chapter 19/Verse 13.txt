<p><b>13.</b><i>And sat down on the judgment-seat.</i> Hence we see what conflicting opinions passed through the mind of Pilate, as if he had been a stage-player who was acting two characters. He ascends <i>the judgment-seat,</i> in order to pronounce sentence of death on Christ solemnly, and in the customary form; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(164)</sup></span> and yet he declares openly, that he does so reluctantly and against his conscience. When he calls Christ <i>king,</i> he speaks ironically, meaning that it was a trivial charge which the Jews brought against him; or rather, for the purpose of allaying their fury, he warns them, that it would bring disgrace on the whole nation, if a report were spread abroad, that a person of that nation had been condemned to die for aspiring to kingly power. </p>
<p><i>In the place which is called the Stone-pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</i> When the Evangelist says, that <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">גבתא</span></blu></heb> (<i>Gabbatha</i>) was the name of the place <i>in</i> Hebrew he means the Chaldaic or Syriac language, which was then in common use; for in <i>Hebrew,</i> <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">גבה</span></blu></heb> (<i>Gabach</i>) means <i>to be lofty.</i> It was proper, therefore, that Christ should be condemned from <i>a lofty place,</i> that he, coming from heaven as the supreme Judge, may acquit us at the last day. </p>
