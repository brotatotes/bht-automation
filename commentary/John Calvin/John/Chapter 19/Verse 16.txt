<p><b>16.</b><i>Then, therefore, he delivered him to them to be crucified.</i> Pilate was, no doubt constrained by their importunity to <i>deliver</i> Christ; and yet this was not done in a tumultuous manner, but he was solemnly condemned in the ordinary form, because there were also two robbers who, after having been tried, were at the same time condemned to be crucified. But John employs this expression, in order to make it more fully evident that Christ, though he had not been convicted of any crime, was given up to the insatiable cruelty of the people. </p>
