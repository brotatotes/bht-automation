<p><b>2.</b><i>And the soldiers, platting a crown of thorns.</i> This was unquestionably done by the authority of Pilate, in order to affix a mark of infamy on the Son of God, for having <i>made himself a king;</i> and that in order to satisfy the rage of the Jews, as if he had been convinced that the accusations which they brought against Christ were well founded. Yet the wickedness and insolence of the soldiers is indulged more freely than had been ordered by the judge; as ungodly men eagerly seize on the opportunity of doing evil whenever it is offered to them. But we see here the amazing cruelty of the Jewish nation, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(158)</sup></span> whose minds are not moved to compassion by so piteous a spectacle; but all this is directed by God, in order to reconcile the world to himself by the death of his Son. </p>
