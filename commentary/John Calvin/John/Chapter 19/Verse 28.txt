<p><b>28.</b><i>Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished.</i> John purposely passes by many things which are related by the other three Evangelists. He now describes the last act, which was an event of the greatest importance.When John says that <i>a vessel was placed there,</i> he speaks of it as a thing that was customary. There has been much controversy on this subject; but I agree with those who think (and, indeed, the custom is proved by histories) that it was a kind of beverage usually administered for the purpose of accelerating the death of wretched malefactors, when they had undergone sufficient torture <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(176)</sup></span> Now, it ought to be remarked, that Christ does not ask any thing to <i>drink</i> till <i>all things have been accomplished;</i> and thus he testified his infinite love towards us, and the inconceivable earnestness of his desire to promote our salvation. No words can fully express the bitterness of the sorrows which he endured; and yet he does not desire to be freed from them, till the justice of God has been satisfied, and till he has made a perfect atonement. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(177)</sup></span> </p>
<p>But how does he say, that all things were accomplished, while the most important part still remained to be performed, that is, his death? Besides, does not his resurrection contribute to the <i>accomplishment</i> of our salvation? I answer, John includes those things which were immediately to follow. Christ had not yet died: and had not yet risen again; but he saw that nothing now remained to hinder him from going forward to death and resurrection. In this manner he instructs us, by his own example, to render perfect obedience, that we may not think it hard to live according to his good pleasure, even though we must languish in the midst of the most excruciating pains. </p>
<p><i>That the Scripture might be fulfilled.</i> From what is stated by the other Evangelists, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:48">Matthew 27:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:23">Mark 15:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:36">Luke 23:36</span>,) it may readily be concluded that the passage referred to is <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:21">Psalms 69:21</span>, </p>
<p>They gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. </p>
<p>It is, undoubtedly, a metaphorical expression, and David means by it, not only that they refused to him the assistance which he needed, but that they cruelly aggravated his distresses. But there is no inconsistency in saying that what had been dimly shadowed out in David was more clearly exhibited in Christ: for thus we are enabled more fully to perceive the difference between truth and figures, when those things which David suffered, only in a figurative manner, are distinctly and perfectly manifested in Christ. To show that he was the person whom David represented, Christ chose to drink <i>vinegar;</i> and he did so for the purpose of strengthening our faith. </p>
<p><i>I thirst.</i> Those who contrive a metaphorical meaning for the word <i>thirst,</i> as if he meant that, instead of a pleasant and agreeable beverage, they gave him bitterness, as if they intended to flay his throat, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(178)</sup></span> are more desirous to be thought ingenious than to promote true edification; and, indeed, they are expressly refuted by the Evangelist, who says that Christ asked for vinegar when he was near death; from which it is evident that he did not desire any luxuries. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(179)</sup></span> </p>
