<p><b>36.</b><i>A bone of him shall not be broken.</i> This citation is made from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:46">Exodus 12:46</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="nu+9:12">Numbers 9:12</span>, where Moses treats of the paschal lamb. Note, Moses takes for granted that that lamb was a figure of the true and only sacrifice, by which the Church was to be redeemed. Nor is this inconsistent with the fact, that it was sacrificed as the memorial of a redemption which had been already made; for, while God intended that it should celebrate the former favor, he also intended that it should exhibit the spiritual deliverance of the Church, which was still future. On that account Paul, without any hesitation, applies to Christ the rule which Moses lays down about eating the lamb: </p>
<p>for even Christ, our Passover, is sacred for us. Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with, the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span>.) </p>
<p>From this analogy, or resemblance, faith derives no ordinary advantage, for, in all the ceremonies of the Law, it beholds the salvation which has been manifested in Christ. Such is also the design of the Evangelist John, when he says that Christ was not only the pledge of our redemption, but also the price of it, because in him we see accomplished what was formerly exhibited to the ancient people under the figure of the passover. Thus also the Jews are reminded that they ought to seek in Christ the substance of all those things which the Law prefigured, but did not actually accomplish. </p>
