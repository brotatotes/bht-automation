<p><b>41.</b><i>Now, in the place where he was crucified there was a garden.</i> This is the <i>third</i> point, as I have said, which ought to be observed in the history of the burial. It is related by the Evangelist for various reasons. In the first place, it did not happen by accident, but by an undoubted providence of God, that the body of Christ was buried <i>in a new sepulchre;</i> for although he died as all other men die, still, as he was to be <i>the first-born from the dead,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>,) and <i>the first-fruits of them that rise,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:20">1 Corinthians 15:20</span>) he had a <i>new sepulcher, in which no person had ever been laid</i> True, <i>Nicodemus</i> and <i>Joseph</i> had a different object in view; for, in consequence of the short time that now remained till sunset, which was the commencement of the Sabbath, they looked to the convenience of the place, but, contrary to their intention God provided for his own Son <i>a sepulchre</i> which had not yet been used. The good men are merely gratified by <i>the place being near at hand,</i> that they might not violate the Sabbath; but God offers them what they did not seek, that the burial of his Son might have some token to distinguish him from the rank of other men. The local situation served also to prove the truth of his resurrection, and to throw no small light on the narrative which is contained in the following chapter. </p>
