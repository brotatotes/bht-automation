<p><b>1.</b><i>Now, on the first day of the week.</i> As the resurrection of Christ is the most important article of our faith, and without it the hope of eternal life is extinguished, for this reason the Evangelists are the more careful to prove it, as John here collects many proofs, in order to assure us that Christ is risen from the dead. It may be thought strange, however, that he does not produce more competent witnesses; for he begins with a woman; but thus the saying is fulfilled, that </p>
<p>God chooseth what is weak, and foolish, and contemptible in the world, that he may bring to nought the wisdom, and excellence, and glory, of the flesh, <br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:27">1 Corinthians 1:27</span>.) </br></p>
<p>There certainly was nothing more of earthly grandeur in the disciples than in the women who followed Christ; but as Christ was pleased to reckon them the principal witnesses of his resurrection, on this single ground their testimony is entitled to the greatest deference, and is not liable to any objection. As to the priests, and scribes, and the whole people, and even Pilate, nothing but gross and wilful blindness prevented them from firmly believing that Christ was risen. All of them, therefore, deserved that <i>seeing they should not see;</i> yet Christ revealed himself to the little flock. </p>
<p>Before proceeding farther, however, it is necessary to show how the Evangelists agree with each other; for, at first sight, there appears to be some contradiction in their words. John mentions but one woman, <i>Mary Magdalene;</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:1">Matthew 28:1</span> mentions two, <i>Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary;</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:1">Mark 16:1</span> mentions three, <i>Mary Magdalene, and Mary</i> (the mother) <i>of James, and Salome;</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:10">Luke 24:10</span> does not fix the number, but only relates that <i>women came,</i> who had followed Christ from Galilee. But the difficulty is easily solved in this manner. As Matthew inserts the names of two women who were best known, and had the highest reputation among the disciples, so John satisfies himself with mentioning the name of <i>Mary Magdalene</i> alone, but yet does not exclude the others; and, indeed, it is evident, from viewing his words in their connection, that she was not alone, for, shortly afterwards, <i>Mary Magdalene</i> says, in the plural number, WE <i>know not where they have laid him.</i> Although, therefore, John says nothing about her companions, yet the other Evangelists, who relate that there were many along with her, say nothing that is contradicted by John’s narrative. </p>
<p>The discrepancy as to the <i>time</i> may be easily solved. When John says that they came before daybreak, we must understand, that they had set out on their journey during the darkness of the night; that, before they came to the sepulcher, the day had dawned; and that in the evening, after sunset, when the Sabbath was ended, they had bought the spices; and thus the narrative of the other Evangelists must be reconciled. </p>
<p>It may be thought that there is another appearance of contradiction in its being stated by John, that <i>Mary</i> spoke to none but himself and <i>Peter,</i> while <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:10">Luke 24:10</span> relates, that she came to the eleven Apostles, and that <i>her words appeared to them to be idle tales.</i> But this is easily explained, for John intentionally passed by the rest of the Apostles, because it was only himself and <i>Peter</i> that came to the sepulcher. As to Luke mentioning Peter alone, it is for the same reason as we have just now assigned in reference <i>to Mary Megdalene</i> and the rest of the women. It is also probable, that the other nine disciples were restrained by fear, lest they should be too easily observed if they went in a body. Nor is this inconsistent with what Luke appears to suggest, that they despised Mary’s words; for immediately afterwards he adds, that <i>Peter ran,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:12">Luke 24:12</span>.) He therefore means simply that, when they first heard it, they appeared to be astonished, but that at length <i>Peter</i> took courage, and followed her for the purpose of seeing. </p>
<p>When Luke relates that Christ appeared to Mary before that she had informed the disciples that the grave was empty, the order of the narrative is inverted. This is evident from the context, for he adds what, John tells us, happened before she saw Jesus; nor is there any thing strange in this, for the Hebrew writers frequently relate first what is later in the order of time. </p>
<p><i>On the first day of the week;</i> or, literally, <i>on the first day of the Sabbaths.</i> The Evangelists do not relate when or how Christ rose; for it was enough for them to explain at what time, and to what persons, his resurrection was made known. John therefore says, that Mary came on <i>the first day of the Sabbaths.</i> Literally, the words may be rendered, <i>on</i> One (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">μιᾷ</span></blu></grk>)<i>day of the Sabbaths;</i> but it is customary with the Hebrews to use the word <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">אהד</span></blu></heb> (<i>ehad</i>)<i>one,</i> instead <i>of first,</i> because in reckoning we begin with <i>one.</i> Now as every seventh day was dedicated to <i>rest,</i> they called the whole week a <i>Sabbath</i> conferring this honor on the sacredness of the day, that the rest of the time was named from it. The women, therefore, came to the sepulcher on the day after the Sabbath, having on the same day (but after sunset) <i>bought spices;</i> and afterwards went out of the city secretly, and during the darkness of the night, as people are wont to do when they are afraid. Now, it was <i>the first day of the Sabbaths,</i> with respect to the following <i>Sabbath,</i> because it was the commencement of the week, of which <i>the Sabbath</i> was the close. </p>
