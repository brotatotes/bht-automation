<p><b>11.</b><i>But Mary stood at the sepulcher without.</i> The Evangelist now begins to describe the manner in which Christ appeared both to the women and to the disciples, to testify his resurrection. Though he mentions but one woman, <i>Mary,</i> yet I think it is probable that the other women were also along with her; for it is not reasonable to suppose, as some have done, that the women fainted through fear. Those writers wish to avoid a contradiction, but I have already shown that no such contradiction exists. </p>
<p>As to the women remaining <i>at the sepulchre,</i> while the disciples return to the city, they are not entitled to great accommodation on this account; for the disciples carry with them consolation and joy, but the women torment themselves by idle and useless <i>weeping.</i> In short, it is superstition alone, accompanied by carnal feelings, that keeps them <i>near the sepulchre</i> </p>
