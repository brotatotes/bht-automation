<p><b>15.</b><i>Lord, if thou hast carried him hence.</i> She calls him <i>Lord,</i> according to the custom of her nation; for the same appellation, <i>Lord,</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Κύριε</span></blu></grk> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(198)</sup></span>) is employed by the Hebrews in addressing laborers and other persons of low condition. We see that Mary has no view of this matter but what is earthly. She desires only to obtain the dead body of Christ, that she may keep it hidden in the sepulcher; but she leaves out the most important matter, the elevation of her mind to the divine power of his resurrection. We need not wonder, therefore, if such grovelling views place a veil before her eyes. </p>
