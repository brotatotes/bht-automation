<p><b>16.</b><i>Jesus saith to her, Mary!</i> That Christ allowed Mary, a short time, to fall into a mistake, was useful for confirming her faith; but now, by a single word, he corrects her mistake. He had formerly addressed her, but his discourse seemed to be that of an unknown person; he now assumes the character of the Master, and addresses his disciple by name, as we have formerly seen that </p>
<p>the good shepherd calleth to him by name every sheep of his flock, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:3">John 10:3</span>.) </p>
<p>That <i>voice of the shepherd,</i> therefore, enters into Maryâ€™s heart, opens her eyes, arouses all her senses, and affects her in such a manner, that she immediately surrenders herself to Christ. </p>
<p>Thus in <i>Mary</i> we have a lively image of our calling; for the only way in which we are admitted to the true knowledge of Christ is, when he first knows us, and then familiarly invites us to himself, not by that ordinary voice which sounds indiscriminately in the ears of all, but by that voice with which he especially calls the sheep which the Father hath given to him. Thus Paul says, </p>
<p>After that you have known God, or rather, after that you have been known by him, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:9">Galatians 4:9</span>.) </p>
<p><i>And said to him, Rabboni!</i> The efficacy of the address is evident from this circumstance, that Mary immediately renders to Christ the honor which is due to him; for the word <i>Rabboni</i> is not only respectful, but involves a profession of obedience. Mary therefore declares, that she is a disciple of Christ, and submits to him as her <i>Master.</i> This is a secret and wonderful change effected on the human understanding, when God, enlightening her by his Spirit, renders her clear-sighted, who formerly was slow of apprehension, and, indeed, altogether blind. Besides, the example of Mary ought to serve the purpose of exhortation, that all whom Christ invites to himself may reply to him without delay. </p>
<p>The word <i>Rabboni</i> is Chaldee, though the Chaldeans pronounce it <i>Ribboni;</i> but it is customary to make a change on words, when they are transferred to a foreign tongue. The meaning is the same as if we were to say, <i>My Lord!</i> or, <i>My Master!</i> But in the time of Christ this mode of expression had gained currency, of using <i>Rabbi</i> and <i>Rabboni</i> instead of <i>Master.</i> </p>
