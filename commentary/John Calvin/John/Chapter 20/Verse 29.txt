<p><b>29.</b><i>Because thou hast seen me, Thomas.</i> Christ blames nothing in Thomas, but that he was so slow to believe, that he needed to be violently drawn to faith by the experience of the senses; which is altogether at variance with the nature of faith. If it be objected, that nothing is more unsuitable than to say <i>that faith</i> is a conviction obtained from <i>touching</i> and <i>seeing,</i> the answer may be easily obtained from what I have already said; for it was not by mere <i>touching</i> or <i>seeing</i> that Thomas was brought to believe that Christ is God, but, being awakened from sleep, he recalled to remembrance the doctrine which formerly he had almost forgotten. Faith cannot flow from a merely experimental knowledge of events, but must draw its origin from the word of God. Christ, therefore, blames Thomas for rendering less honor to the word of God than he ought to have done, and for having regarded faith — which springs from hearing, and ought to be wholly fixed on the word — as bound to the other senses. </p>
<p><i>Blessed are they who have not seen, and have believed</i> Here Christ commends faith on this ground, that it acquiesces in the bare word, and does not depend on carnal views or human reason <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(221)</sup></span> He therefore includes, in a short definition, the power and nature of faith; namely, that it does not rest satisfied with the immediate exercise of sight, but penetrates even to heaven, so as to believe those things which are hidden from the human senses. And, indeed, we ought to give to God this honor, that we should view His truth as (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">αὐτόπιστος</span></blu></grk> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(222)</sup></span>) beyond all doubt without any other proof <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(223)</sup></span> Faith has, indeed, its own <i>sight</i> but one which does not confine its view to the world, and to earthly objects. For this reason it is called </p>
<p>a demonstration of things invisible or not seen,<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span>;) </p>
<p>and Paul contrasts it with <i>sight,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:7">2 Corinthians 5:7</span>,) meaning, that it does not rest satisfied with looking at the condition of present object, and does not cast its eye in all directions to <i>those things which are visible</i> in the world, but depends on the mouth of God, and, relying on His word, rises above the whole world, so as to fix its anchor in heaven. It amounts to this, that faith is not of a right kind, unless it be founded on the word of God, and rise to the invisible kingdom of God, so as to go beyond all human capacity. </p>
<p>If it be objected, that this saying of Christ is inconsistent with another of his sayings, in which he declares that <i>the eyes which behold him are blessed,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:16">Matthew 13:16</span>,) I answer, Christ does not there speak merely of bodily sight, as he does in this passage, but of revelation, which is common to all believers, since he appeared to the world as a Redeemer. He draws a comparison between the Apostles and <i>the holy kings and prophets,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:17">Matthew 13:17</span>,) who had been kept under the dark shadows of the Mosaic Law. He says, that now the condition of believers is much more desirable, because a brighter light shines around them, or rather, because the substance and truth of the figures was made known to them. There were many unbelievers who, at that time, <i>beheld</i> Christ with <i>the eyes</i> of flesh, and yet were not more <i>blessed</i> on that account; but we, who have never beheld Christ with the eyes, enjoy that <i>blessedness</i> of which Christ speaks with commendation. Hence it follows, that he calls those eyes <i>blessed</i> which spiritually behold in him what is heavenly and divine; for we now behold Christ in the Gospel in the same manner as if he visibly stood before us. In this sense Paul says to the Galatians, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:1">Galatians 3:1</span>,) that <i>Christ was crucified before their eyes;</i> and, therefore, if we desire to see in Christ what may render us <i>happy</i> and <i>blessed,</i> let us learn to <i>believe,</i> when we <i>do not see.</i> To these words of Christ corresponds what is stated in another passage, in which the Apostle commends believers, who </p>
<p>love Christ whom they have not seen, and rejoice with unspeakable joy, though they do not behold him. <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:8">1 Peter 1:8</span>.) </p>
<p>The manner in which the Papists torture these words, to prove their doctrine of transubstantiation, is exceedingly absurd. That we may be <i>blessed,</i> they bid us believe that Christ is present under the appearance of bread. But we know that nothing was farther from Christ’s intention than to subject faith to the inventions of men; and as soon as it passes, in the smallest degree, beyond the limits of the word, it ceases to be faith. If we must believe without reserve all that we do not see, then every monster which men may be pleased to form, every fable which they may contrive, will hold our faith in bondage. That this saying of Christ may apply to the case in hand, we must first prove from the word of God the very point in question. They bring forward the word of God, indeed, in support of their doctrine of transubstantiation; but when the word is properly expounded, it gives no countenance to their foolish notion. </p>
