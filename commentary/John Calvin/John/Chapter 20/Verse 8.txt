<p><b>8.</b><i>And he saw and believed.</i> It is a poor exposition which some give of these words, that John <i>believed</i> what he had heard Mary say, namely, that Christâ€™s body had been carried away; for there is no passage in which the word <i>believe</i> bears this meaning, especially when it is used simply and without any addition. Nor is this inconsistent with the fact, that <i>Peter and John</i> return home, while they are still in doubt and perplexity; for in some passages John had employed this phraseology, when lie intended to describe the increase of faith. Besides, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:12">Luke 24:12</span> relates that <i>Peter wondered</i> at seeing the sepulcher in such good order; meaning by this, that Peter thought of something greater and loftier than what Mary had told him. </p>
