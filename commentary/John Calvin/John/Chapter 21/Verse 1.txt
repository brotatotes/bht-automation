<p><b>1.</b><i>After these things Jesus manifested himself again.</i> The Evangelist still labors to prove the resurrection of Christ, and relates, that he appeared to seven disciples, among whom he mentions <i>Thomas,</i> not out of respect to him, so much as because his testimony ought to be the more readily believed in proportion to the obstinacy of his unbelief. The Evangelist enters sufficiently into detail; for he carefully collects all the circumstances which contribute to prove the truth of the history. We have formerly mentioned that <i>the Lake of Tiberias,</i> according to the Hebrew custom, is called <i>the Sea of Tiberias.</i> </p>
