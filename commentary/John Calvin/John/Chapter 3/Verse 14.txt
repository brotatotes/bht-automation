<p><b>14.</b><i>And as Moses lifted up the serpent.</i> He explains more clearly why he said that it is he alone to whom heaven is opened; namely, that he brings to heaven all who are only willing to follow him as their guide; for he testifies that he will be openly and publicly manifested to all, that he may diffuse his power over men of every class. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(62)</sup></span> To be <i>lifted up</i> means to be placed in a lofty and elevated situation, so as to be exhibited to the view of all. This was done by the preaching of the Gospel; for the explanation of it which some give, as referring to the cross, neither agrees with the context nor is applicable to the present subject. The simple meaning of the words therefore is, that, by the preaching of the Gospel, Christ was to be raised on high, like a standard to which the eyes of all would be directed, as Isaiah had foretold, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:2">Isaiah 2:2</span>.) As a type of this <i>lifting up</i>, he refers to <i>the brazen serpent</i>, which was erected by Moses, the sight of which was a salutary remedy to those who had been wounded by the deadly bite of serpents. The history of that transaction is well known, and is detailed in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="nu+21:9">Numbers 21:9</span>. Christ introduces it in this passage, in order to show that he must be placed before the eyes of all by the doctrine of the Gospel, that all who look at him by faith may obtain salvation. Hence it ought to be inferred that Christ is clearly exhibited to us in the Gospel, in order that no man may complain of obscurity; and that this manifestation is common to all, and that faith has its own look, by which it perceives him as present; as Paul tells us that a lively portrait of Christ with his cross is exhibited, when he is truly preached, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:1">Galatians 3:1</span>.) </p>
<p>The metaphor is not inappropriate or far-fetched. As it was only the outward appearance of a serpent, but contained nothing within that was pestilential or venomous, so Christ clothed himself with the form of sinful flesh, which yet was pure and free from all sin, that he might cure in us the deadly wound of sin. It was not in vain that, when the Jews were wounded by serpents, the Lord formerly prepared this kind of antidote; and it tended to confirm the discourse which Christ delivered. For when he saw that he was despised as a mean and unknown person, he could produce nothing more appropriate than<i>the lifting up of the serpent</i>, to tell them, that they ought not to think it strange, if, contrary to the expectation of men, he were <i>lifted up</i> on high from the very lowest condition, because this had already been shadowed out under the Law by the type of the serpent. </p>
<p>A question now arises: Does Christ compare himself to the <i>serpent</i>, because there is some resemblance; or, does he pronounce it to have been a sacrament, as the Manna was? For though the Manna was bodily food, intended for present use, yet Paul testifies that it was a <i>spiritual</i> mystery, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:3">1 Corinthians 10:3</span>.) I am led to think that this was also the case with the brazen serpent, both by this passage, and the fact of its being preserved for the future, until the superstition of the people had converted it into an idol, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ki+18:4">2 Kings 18:4</span>.) If any one form a different opinion, I do not debate the point with him. </p>
