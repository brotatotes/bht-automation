<p><b>3.</b><i>Verily, verily, I say to thee.</i> The word Verily (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀμὴν</span></blu></grk>) is twice repeated, and this is done for the purpose of arousing him to more earnest attention. For when he was about to speak of the most important and weighty of all subjects, he found it necessary to awaken the attention of Nicodemus, who might otherwise have passed by this whole discourse in a light or careless manner. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(57)</sup></span> Such, then, is the design of the double affirmation. </p>
<p>Though this discourse appears to be far-fetched and almost inappropriate, yet it was with the utmost propriety that Christ opened his discourse in this manner. For as it is useless to sow seed in a field which has not been prepared by the labors of the husbandman, so it is to no purpose to scatter the doctrine of the Gospel, if the mind has not been previously subdued and duly prepared for docility and obedience. Christ saw that the mind of Nicodemus was filled with many thorns, choked by many noxious herbs, so that there was scarcely any room for spiritual doctrine. This exhortation, therefore, resembled a ploughing to purify him, that nothing might prevent him from profiting by the doctrine. Let us, therefore, remember that this was spoken to one individual, in such a manner that the Son of God addresses all of us daily in the same language. For which of us will say that he is so free from sinful affections that he does not need such a purification? If, therefore, we wish to make good and useful progress in the school of Christ, let us learn to begin at this point. </p>
<p><i>Unless a man be born again.</i> That is, So long as thou art destitute of that which is of the highest importance in the kingdom of God, I care little about your calling me <i>Master</i>; for the first entrance into the kingdom of God is, to become a new man. But as this is a remarkable passage, it will be proper to survey every part of it minutely. </p>
<p><i>To</i> SEE<i>the kingdom of God</i> is of the same meaning as <i>to</i> enter into <i>the kingdom of God</i>, as we shall immediately perceive from the context. But they are mistaken who suppose that <i>the kingdom of God</i> means <i>Heaven</i>; for it rather means the spiritual life, which is begun by faith in this world, and gradually increases every day according to the continued progress of faith. So the meaning is, that no man can be truly united to the Church, so as to be reckoned among the children of God, until he has been previously renewed. This expression shows briefly what is the beginning of Christianity, and at the same time teaches us, that we are born exiles and utterly alienated from <i>the kingdom of God</i>, and that there is a perpetual state of variance between God and us, until he makes us altogether different by our being <i>born again</i>; for the statement is general, and comprehends the whole human race. If Christ had said to one person, or to a few individuals, that they could not <i>enter into heaven</i>, <i>unless they had been</i> previously <i>born again</i>, we might have supposed that it was only certain characters that were pointed out, but he speaks of all without exception; for the language is unlimited, and is of the same import with such universal terms as these: <i>Whosoever shall not be born again cannot enter into the kingdom of God</i> </p>
<p>By the phrase<i>born again</i> is expressed not the correction of one part, but the renovation of the whole nature. Hence it follows, that there is nothing in us that is not sinful; for if reformation is necessary in the whole and in each part, corruption must have been spread throughout. On this point we shall soon have occasion to speak more largely. Erasmus, adopting the opinion of Cyril, has improperly translated the adverb <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἄνωθεν</span></blu></grk>, from above, and renders the clause thus: <i>unless a man be born</i> from above. The Greek word, I own, is ambiguous; but we know that Christ conversed with Nicodemus in the Hebrew language. There would then have been no room for the ambiguity which occasioned the mistake of Nicodemus and led him into childish scruples about a second birth of the flesh. He therefore understood Christ to have said nothing else than that <i>a man must be born</i> again, before he is admitted into the kingdom of God. </p>
