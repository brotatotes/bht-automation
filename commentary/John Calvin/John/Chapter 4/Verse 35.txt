<p><b>35.</b><i>Do you not say?</i> He follows out the preceding statement; for, having said that nothing was more dear to him than <i>to finish the work</i> of the Father, he now shows how <i>ripe</i> it is for execution; and he does so by a comparison with <i>the harvest.</i> When the corn is ripe, the harvest cannot bear delay, for otherwise the grain would fall to the ground and be lost; and, in like manner, the spiritual corn being now ripe, he declares that there must be no delay, because delay is injurious. We see for what purpose the comparison is employed; it is to explain the reason why he hastens to perform his work. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(83)</sup></span> By this expression,<i>Do you not say?</i> he intended indirectly to point out how much more attentive the minds of men are to earthly than to heavenly things; for they burn with so intense a desire of <i>harvest</i> that they carefully reckon up months and days, but it is astonishing how drowsy and indolent they are in gathering the heavenly wheat. And daily experience proves that this wickedness not only is natural to us, but can scarcely be torn from our hearts; for while all provide for the earthly life to a distant period, how indolent are we in thinking about heavenly things? Thus Christ says on another occasion, Hypocrites, you discern by the face of the sky what sort of day to-morrow will be, but you do not acknowledge the time of my visitation, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:3">Matthew 16:3</span>.) </p>
