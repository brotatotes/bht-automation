<p><b>39.</b><i>And many Samaritans out of that city believed.</i> The Evangelist here relates what was the success of the woman’s announcement to her citizens, from which it is evident that the expectation and desire of the promised Messiah had no small vigor among them. Now, the word <i>believe</i> is here used inaccurately, and means that they were induced by the woman’s statement to acknowledge Christ to be a Prophet. It is, in some respects, a commencement of<i>faith</i>, when minds are prepared to receive the doctrine. Such an entrance to <i>faith</i> receives here the honorable appellation of<i>faith</i>, in order to inform us how highly God esteems reverence for his word, when he confers so great honor on the docility of those who have not yet been taught. Now, their <i>faith</i> manifests itself in this respect, that they are seized with a desire to profit, and, for that reason, desire that Christ <i>should remain with them</i> </p>
