<p><b>46.</b><i>And there was a certain courtier.</i> This is a more correct rendering, though Erasmus thinks differently, who has translated <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">βασιλικός</span></blu></grk> by a Latin word, <i>Regulus</i>, which means a little king. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(89)</sup></span> I acknowledge indeed that, at that time, they gave the name of <i>Reguli</i> (or, <i>little kings</i>) to those who are now called Dukes, or Barons, or Earls; but the state of Galilee at that time was such that there could be no person of that rank dwelling in Capernaum. I think that he was some nobleman <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(90)</sup></span> of the court of Herod; for there is some plausibility in the opinion of those who think that he was sent by Caesar. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(91)</sup></span> This is expressly mentioned by the Evangelist, because the rank of this personage made the miracle the more illustrious. </p>
