<p><b>5.</b><i>Which is called Sichar</i> Jerome, in his epitaph on Paula, thinks that this is an incorrect reading, and that it ought to have been written <i>Sichem</i>; and, indeed, the latter appears to have been the ancient and true name; but it is probable that, in the time of the Evangelist, the word <i>Sichar</i> was already in common use. As to the place, it is generally agreed that it was a city situated close to Mount Gerizzim, the inhabitants of which were treacherously slain by Simeon and Levi, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+34:25">Genesis 34:25</span>,) and which Abimelech, a native of the place, afterwards razed to its thundations, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jdg+9:45">Judges 9:45</span>.) But the convenience of its situation was such that, a third time, a city was built there, which, in the age of Jerome, they called <i>Neapolis</i> By adding so many circumstances, the Apostle removes all doubt; for we are clearly informed by Moses where that field was which Jacob assigned to the children of Joseph, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:22">Genesis 48:22</span>.) It is universally acknowledged, also, that Mount Gerizzim was near to Shechem. We shall afterwards state that a temple was built there; and there can be no doubt that Jacob dwelt a long time in that place with his family. </p>
<p><i>And Jesus, fatigued by the journey.</i> He did not pretend weariness, but was actually fatigued; for, in order that he might be better prepared for the exercise of sympathy and compassion towards us, he took upon him our weaknesses, as the Apostle shows that </p>
<p>we have not a high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>.) </p>
<p>With this agrees the circumstance of the time; for it is not wonderful that, being thirsty and<i>fatigued,</i> he rested at the well about noon; for as the day, from sunrise to sunset, had twelve hours, <i>the sixth hour</i> was<i>Noon</i> When the Evangelist says that <i>he sat</i> thus, he means that it was the attitude of a man who was<i>fatigued</i> </p>
