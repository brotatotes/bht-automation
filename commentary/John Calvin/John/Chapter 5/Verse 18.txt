<p><b>18.</b><i>For this reason, therefore, the Jews sought the more to slay him.</i> This defense was so far from allaying their fury that it even enraged them the more. Nor was he unacquainted with their malignity and wickedness and hardened obstinacy, but he intended first to profit a few of his disciples who were then present, and next to make a public display of their incurable malice. By his example he has taught us that we ought never to yield to the fury of wicked men, but should endeavor to maintain the truth of God, so far as necessity demands it, though the whole world should oppose and murmur. Nor is there any reason why the servants of Christ should take it ill that they do not profit all men according to their wish, since Christ himself did not always succeed; and we need not wonder if, in proportion as the glory of God is more fully displayed, Satan rages the more violently in his members and instruments. </p>
<p><i>Because he not only had broken the Sabbath.</i> When the Evangelist says that the Jews were hostile to Christ, <i>because he had broken the Sabbath</i>, he speaks according to the opinion which they had formed; for I have already showed that the state of the case was quite the contrary. The principal cause of their wrath was, that <i>he called God his Father.</i> And certainly Christ intended that it should be understood <i>that God was his Father</i> in a peculiar sense, so as to distinguish himself from the ordinary rank of other men. <i>He made himself equal to God,</i> when he claimed for himself continuance in <i>working</i>; and Christ is so far from denying this, that he confirms it more distinctly. This refutes the madness of the Arians, who acknowledged that Christ is God, but did not think <i>that he is equal</i> to the Father, as if in the one and simple essence of God there could be any inequality. </p>
