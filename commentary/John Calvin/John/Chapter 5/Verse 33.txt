<p><b>33.</b><i>You sent to John.</i> Before producing the testimony of God, he presses them with the answer of <i>John,</i> from which they could not honorably withhold their belief. For of what use was it to <i>send to him</i>, if they did not intend to abide by his words? They <i>send to him</i> as a Prophet of God, and thus they pretend that his word will be regarded by them as an oracle. Now, though this implies another admission in their favor, still Christ openly brings against them this charge, that nothing but their own malice <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(106)</sup></span> hinders them from believing. And, therefore, we see that this circumstance is highly appropriate to the matter in hand, namely, that they sent to John, and — as if their motive had been a desire to learn — inquired at him who was the Messiah, and yet paid no attention to his reply. </p>
