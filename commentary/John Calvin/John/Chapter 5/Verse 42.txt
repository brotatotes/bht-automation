<p><b>42.</b><i>That you have not the love of God in you. The love of God</i> is here put for all religious feelings; for no man can <i>love God</i> without beholding him with admiration and submitting entirely to his authority; as, on the other hand, when <i>the love of God</i> does not prevail, there can be no desire to obey him. That is the reason why Moses gives this as the summary or recapitulation (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀνακεφαλαίωσις</span></blu></grk>) of the Law: </p>
<p>thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+6:5">Deuteronomy 6:5</span>.) </p>
