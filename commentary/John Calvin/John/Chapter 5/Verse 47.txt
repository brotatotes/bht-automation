<p><b>47.</b><i>But if you do not believe his writings.</i> Christ appears here to claim less authority for himself than for Moses; and yet we know that <i>heaven and earth have been shaken by the voice</i> of the Gospel, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:26">Hebrews 12:26</span>.) But Christ accommodates his discourse to those to whom he speaks; for the authority of the Law was, beyond all controversy, held sacred among the Jews; and thus it was impossible that Christ should be inferior to Moses. To the same purpose is the contrast between <i>writings</i> and <i>words</i>; for he shows their unbelief to be more aggravated, because the truth of God, recorded in an authentic form, has no authority with them. </p>
