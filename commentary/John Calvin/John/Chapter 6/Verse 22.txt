<p><b>22.</b><i>Next day.</i> Here the Evangelist relates circumstances from which the multitude might conclude that Christ had gone across by divine power. There had been but one ship; they see it go away without Christ; next day, ships come from other places, by which they are conveyed to Capernaum; and there they find Christ. It follows that he must have been conveyed across in a miraculous manner. There is an intricacy and apparent confusion (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀνακόλουθον</span></blu></grk>) in the words, but still the meaning of them is plain enough; for, in the 22<sup>nd</sup> verse, John says that <i>there had been but one ship</i>, and that all saw it leave the shore and that place, and that it had not Christ as a passenger; and, in the 23<sup>rd</sup> verse, he adds that <i>ships came from Tiberias,</i> by which the multitude passed over, which had remained on the shore, blockading, as it were, every outlet, that Christ might not escape. </p>
