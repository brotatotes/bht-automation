<p><b>25.</b><i>On the other side of the sea.</i> We have already said that Capernaum was not situated on the opposite shore; for Tiberias is situated on that part of the lake where it is broadest, Bethsaida follows next, and Capernaum lies near the lowest part, not far from where the river Jordan issues from the lake. Now, when John places it <i>on the other side of the lake</i> itself, we must not understand him as if its position were directly across, but because, at the lower extremity, the lake made a large winding, and, on account of the bay that intervened, it was impossible to go by land without a very circuitous journey. The Evangelist therefore says, <i>on the other side of the sea</i>, adopting the mode of expression used by the common people, because the only direct and ordinary mode of conveyance was by a boat. </p>
