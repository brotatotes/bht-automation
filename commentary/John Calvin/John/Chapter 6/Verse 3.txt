<p><b>3.</b><i>Jesus therefore went up into a mountain.</i> Christ unquestionably sought a place of retirement till <i>the feast of the Passover</i>; and therefore it is said that he <i>sat down on a mountain with his disciples.</i> Such was undoubtedly the purpose which he formed as man; but the purpose of God was different, which he willingly obeyed. Although, therefore, he avoided the sight of men, yet he permits himself to be led by the hand of God as into a crowded theater; for there was a larger assembly of men <i>in a desert mountain</i> than in any populous city, and greater celebrity arose from the miracle than if it had happened in the open market-place of <i>Tiberias</i> We are therefore taught by this example to form our plans in conformity to the course of events, but in such a manner that, if the result be different from what we expected, we may not be displeased that God is above us, and regulates everything according to his pleasure. </p>
