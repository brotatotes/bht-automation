<p><b>31.</b><i>Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness.</i> Thus we see that Christ put his finger on the sore, when he told them that they came like brute beasts to fill their belly; for they discover this gross disposition, when they demand a Messiah by whom they are to be fed. And as to the magnificent terms in which they extol the grace of God in the<i>manna,</i> they do this cunningly, in order to bury the doctrine of Christ, by which he condemned them for immoderate desire of corruptible food; for they contrast with it the magnificent title bestowed on the <i>manna,</i> when it is called <i>heavenly bread</i> But when the Holy Spirit bestows on the <i>manna</i> the honorable appellation of <i>the bread of heaven</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:24">Psalms 78:24</span>,) it is not with this intention, as if God fed his people, like a herd of swine, and gave them nothing more valuable; and, therefore, they are without excuse, when they wickedly reject the spiritual food of the soul, which God now offers to them. </p>
