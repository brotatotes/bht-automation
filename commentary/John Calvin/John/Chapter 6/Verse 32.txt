<p><b>32.</b><i>Verily, verily, I say to you, Moses gave you not bread from heaven.</i> Christ appears to contradict what was quoted from the psalm, but he speaks only by comparison. The <i>manna</i> <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">מן</span></blu></heb> is called <i>the bread of heaven</i>, but it is for the nourishment of the body; but <i>the bread</i> which ought truly and properly to be reckoned <i>heavenly</i>, is that which gives spiritual nourishment to the soul. Christ therefore makes a contrast here between the world and heaven, because we ought not to seek the incorruptible life but in the kingdom of heaven. In this passage, <i>truth</i> is not contrasted with <i>shadows</i>, as is often done elsewhere; but Christ considers what is the<i>true</i> life of man, or, in other words, what it is that makes him different from brute beasts, and excellent among the creatures. </p>
<p><i>My Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</i> When he adds these words, the meaning is,” <i>The manna which Moses gave to your fathers</i> did not bring <i>heavenly</i> life, but now <i>heavenly</i> life is truly exhibited to you.” True, it is the <i>Father</i> whom he calls <i>the giver of this bread</i>, but he means that it is given by his own hand. Thus the contrast relates, not to Moses and God, but to Moses and Christ. Now, Christ represents his Father rather than himself as the Author of this gift, in order to procure for himself deeper reverence; as if he had said, “Acknowledge me to be the minister of God, by whose hands he wishes to feed you to eternal life.” But, again, this appears to be inconsistent with the doctrine of Paul, who calls the <i>manna</i> — <i>spiritual food</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:3">1 Corinthians 10:3</span>.) I reply, Christ speaks according to the capacity of those with whom he has to deal, and this is not uncommon in Scripture. We see how variously Paul speaks about circumcision. When he writes about the ordinance, he calls it <i>the seal of faith</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:11">Romans 4:11</span>;) but when he has to contend with false apostles, he calls it rather a seal of cursing, and that by taking it with the qualities which they ascribed to it, and according to their opinion. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(143)</sup></span> Let us consider what was the objection made against Christ, namely, that he did not prove himself to be the Messiah, if he did not supply his followers with bodily food. Accordingly, he does not inquire what it was that was prefigured by the <i>manna,</i> but maintains that <i>the bread</i> with which <i>Moses</i> fed their bellies was not <i>true bread.</i> </p>
