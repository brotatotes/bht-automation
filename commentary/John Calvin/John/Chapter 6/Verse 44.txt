<p><b>44.</b><i>No man can come to me, unless the Father, who hath sent me, draw him.</i> He does not merely accuse them of wickedness, but likewise reminds them, that it is a peculiar gift of God to embrace the doctrine which is exhibited by him; which he does, that their unbelief may not disturb weak minds. For many are so foolish that, in the things of God, they depend on the opinions of men; in consequence of which, they entertain suspicions about the Gospel, as soon as they see that it is not received by the world. Unbelievers, on the other hand, flattering themselves in their obstinacy, have the hardihood to condemn the Gospel because it does not please them. On the contrary, therefore, Christ declares that the doctrine of the Gospel, though it is preached to all without exception, cannot be embraced by all, but that a new understanding and a new perception are requisite; and, therefore, that faith does not depend on the will of men, but that it is God who gives it. </p>
<p><i>Unless the Father draw him.</i> To <i>come to Christ</i> being here used metaphorically for <i>believing</i>, the Evangelist, in order to carry out the metaphor in the apposite clause, says that those persons are <i>drawn</i> whose understandings God enlightens, and whose hearts he bends and forms to the obedience of Christ. The statement amounts to this, that we ought not to wonder if many refuse to embrace the Gospel; because no man will ever of himself be able to come to Christ, but God must first approach him by his Spirit; and hence it follows that all are not <i>drawn</i>, but that God bestows this grace on those whom he has elected. True, indeed, as to the kind of <i>drawing</i>, it is not violent, so as to compel men by external force; but still it is a powerful impulse of the Holy Spirit, which makes men willing who formerly were unwilling and reluctant. It is a false and profane assertion, therefore, that none are <i>drawn</i> but those who are willing to be <i>drawn</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(153)</sup></span> as if man made himself obedient to God by his own efforts; for the willingness with which men follow God is what they already have from himself, who has formed their hearts to obey him. </p>
