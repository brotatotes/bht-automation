<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(119)</span> The value of the old French coins passed through so many changes, that all reasoning about them must be involved in uncertainty; but, so far as we have been able to ascertain, the value of a <i>carolus</i> of Tours, in Calvin’s time, was nearly that of a penny sterling, and the <i>denier</i> was the tenth part of it, or nearly a modern <i>centime</i> of Paris. “Four times the <i>carolus</i>, with two <i>deniers</i>, ” would thus be 4 and 1/5 pence sterling, and, multiplying that by 200, we have <i>three pounds</i>, <i>ten shillings</i>. Again, taking <i>the franc</i> (as Cotgrave rates it) at <i>two shillings</i>, 35 francs are also equal to <i>three pounds</i>, <i>ten shillings</i>. This is, at least, a curious coincidence, and the reader may compare it with a computation made from the <i>livre Parisis</i>, (<i>Harmony</i>, volume 2, page 234, n. 2.) It would appear, however, that Budaeus and Calvin had estimated the <i>denarius</i> at little more than half its real value, which was <i>sevenpence halfpenny</i> sterling, taking silver at five shillings per ounce; so that <i>two hundred denarii</i> would be equal to <i>six pounds</i>, <i>five shillings sterling</i>. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
