<p><b>22.</b><i>Therefore Moses gave you circumcision</i> The particle <i>therefore</i> appears to be unsuitable; and, accordingly, some take <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">διὰ τούτο</span></blu></grk> (<i>on this account</i>, or <i>therefore</i>) in the sense of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">διὰ τούτο</span></blu></grk>, (<i>because</i>;) but the Greek syntax is unfavourable to their opinion. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(189)</sup></span> I explain it simply as meaning, that <i>circumcision</i> was enjoined in such a manner that the practice of that symbolical rite was necessary <i>even on the Sabbath-day Therefore</i>, says he; that is, it has in this manner been sufficiently demonstrated to them, that the worship of the Sabbath is not violated by the works of God. And although Christ accommodates the instance of circumcision to the present subject, yet he immediately makes use of a correction, when he says, that Moses was not the first minister of circumcision. But it was enough for his purpose, that Moses, who so rigidly demanded the keeping of <i>the Sabbath</i>, commanded that infants should be circumcised on the eighth day, even though it should fall on <i>the day of Rest</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(190)</sup></span> </p>
