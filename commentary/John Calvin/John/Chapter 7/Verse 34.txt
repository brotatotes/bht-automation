<p><b>34.</b><i>You shall seek me.</i> They <i>sought</i> Christ, to put him to death. Here Christ alludes to the ambiguous signification of the word <i>seek,</i> for soon <i>they shall seek him</i> in another manner; as if he had said, “My presence, which is now irksome and intolerable to you, will last for a short time; but ere long <i>you shall seek me</i> in vain, for, far removed from you, not only by my body, but also by my power, I shall behold from heaven your destruction.” But here a question may be put, of what nature was this <i>seeking</i> of Christ? For it is plain enough that Christ speaks of the reprobate, whose obstinacy in rejecting Christ had reached the utmost point. Some refer it to doctrine, because the Jews, by foolishly pursuing the righteousness of works, <i>did not obtain what they desired</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:31">Romans 9:31</span>.) Many understand it as referring to the person of the Messiah, because the Jews, reduced to extremities, in vain implored a Redeemer. But for my own part, I explain it as merely denoting the groans of distress uttered by the wicked, when, compelled by necessity, they look in some manner towards God. </p>
<p><i>And shall not find me.</i> When they <i>seek</i> him, they do not seek him; for unbelief and obstinacy — by shutting up their hearts, as it were — hinders them from approaching to God. They would desire, indeed, that God should aid them, and should be their Redeemer, but, by impenitence and hardness of heart, they obstruct their path. We have a very striking example <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(192)</sup></span> in Esau, who, on account of having lost his birthright, not only is oppressed with grief, but groans and gnashes his teeth, and breaks out into furious indignation, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:38">Genesis 27:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:17">Hebrews 12:17</span>.) But yet so far is he from the right way of seeking the blessing, that, at the very time when he is seeking it, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(193)</sup></span> he renders himself more unworthy of it. In this manner God usually punishes the contempt of his grace in the reprobate, so that, either afflicted by severe punishments, or oppressed by a conviction of their misery, or reduced to other extremities, they complain, and cry, and howl, but without reaping any advantage; for, being always like themselves, they nourish within their hearts the same cruelty which they formerly displayed, and do not go to God, but rather wish that he were changed, since they cannot destroy him. Hence let us learn that we ought to receive Christ without delay, while he is still present with us, that the opportunity of enjoying him may not pass away from us; for if the door be once shut, it will be vain for us to try to open it. </p>
<p>Seek the Lord, says Isaiah, while he may be found; call upon him, while he is near, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:6">Isaiah 55:6</span>.) </p>
<p>We ought therefore to go to God early, <i>while the time of his good pleasure lasts</i>, as the prophet speaks, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:8">Isaiah 49:8</span>;) for we know not how long God will bear with our negligence. In these words, <i>where I am, you cannot come,</i> he employs the present tense instead of the future, <i>where I shall be</i>, <i>you shall not be able to come</i> </p>
