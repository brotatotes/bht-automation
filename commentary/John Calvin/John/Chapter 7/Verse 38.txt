<p><b>38.</b><i>He who believeth in me.</i> He now points out the manner of coming, which is, that we must approach, not with the feet, but by faith; or rather, <i>to come</i> is nothing else than <i>to believe</i>, at least, if you define accurately the word <i>believe</i>; as we have already said that we <i>believe in</i> Christ, when we embrace him as he is held out to us in the Gospel, full of power, wisdom, righteousness, purity, life, and all the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Besides, he now confirms more plainly and fully the promise which we lately mentioned; for he shows that he has a rich abundance to satisfy us to the full. </p>
<p><i>Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</i> The metaphor appears, no doubt, to be somewhat harsh, when he says that <i>rivers of living water shall flow out of the belly of believers</i>; but there can be no doubt as to the meaning, that they who believe shall suffer no want of spiritual blessings. He calls it <i>living water,</i> the fountain of which never grows dry, nor ceases to flow continually. As to the word <i>rivers</i> being in the plural number, I interpret it as denoting the diversified graces of the Spirit, which are necessary for the spiritual life of the soul. In short, the perpetuity, as well as the abundance, of the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(195)</sup></span> is here promised to us. Some understand the saying — that <i>waters flow out of the belly</i> of believers — to mean, that he to whom the Spirit has been given makes a part <i>to flow</i> to his brethren, as there ought to be mutual communication between us. But I consider it to be a simpler meaning, that whosoever shall believe in Christ shall have a fountain of life springing up, as it were, in himself, as Christ said formerly, </p>
<p>He who shall drink of this water shall never thirst, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:14">John 4:14</span>;) </p>
<p>for while ordinary drinking quenches thirst only for a short time, Christ says that by faith we draw the Spirit, that he may become <i>a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life</i> </p>
<p>Still he does not say that, on the first day, believers are so fully satisfied with Christ, that ever afterwards they neither hunger nor thirst; but, on the contrary, the enjoyment of Christ kindles a new desire of him. But the meaning is, that the Holy Spirit is like a living and continually flowing fountain in believers; as Paul also declares that he is life in us, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10">Romans 8:10</span>,) though we still carry about, in the remains of sin, the cause of death. And, indeed, as every one partakes of the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, according to the measure of his faith, we cannot possess a perfect fullness of them in the present life. But believers, while they make progress in faith, continually aspire to fresh additions of the Spirit, so that the first-fruits which they have tasted carry them forward to perpetuity of life. But we are also reminded by it, how small is the capacity of our faith, since the graces of the Spirit scarcely come into us by drops, which would flow like rivers, if we gave due admission to Christ; that is, if faith made us capable of receiving him. </p>
<p>As the Scripture saith. Some confine this to the former clause, and others to the latter clause; for my own part, I extend it to the entire scope of the discourse. Besides, Christ does not here, in my opinion, point out any particular passage of Scripture, but produces a testimony drawn from the ordinary doctrine of the Prophets. For whenever the Lord, promising an abundance of his Spirit, compares it to living waters, he looks principally to the kingdom of Christ, to which he directs the minds of believers. All the predictions of living waters, therefore, have their fulfillment in Christ, because he alone hath opened and displayed the hidden treasures of God. The reason why the graces of the Spirit are poured out on him is, </p>
<p>that we may all draw out of his fullness, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span>.) </p>
<p>Those persons, therefore, whom Christ so kindly and graciously calls, and who wander in every direction, deserve to perish miserably. </p>
