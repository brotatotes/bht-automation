<p><b>40.</b><i>Many of the multitude.</i> The Evangelist now relates what fruit followed from this last sermon of our Lord Jesus Christ; namely, that some thought one thing and some another, so that <i>a difference of opinion arose among the people</i> It ought to be observed that John does not speak of the open enemies of Christ, or of those who were already filled with deadly hatred <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(200)</sup></span> against sound doctrine, but of the common people, among whom there ought to have been greater integrity. He enumerates three classes of them. </p>
<p><i>He is truly a Prophet.</i> The first acknowledged that Jesus <i>was truly a Prophet</i>, from which we infer that they did not dislike his doctrine. But, on the other hand, how light and trifling this confession was, is evident from the fact, that, while they approve of the Teacher, they neither understand what he means, nor relish what he says; for they could not truly receive him <i>as a Prophet</i>, without, at the same time, acknowledging that he is the Son of God and the Author of their salvation. Yet this is good in them, that they perceive in Christ something Divine, which leads them to regard him with reverence; for this willingness to learn might afterwards give an easy opening to faith. </p>
