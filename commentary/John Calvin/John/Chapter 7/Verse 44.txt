<p><b>44.</b><i>Some of them wished to seize him.</i> By these words the Evangelist means, that they not only despised Christ, but that their wicked rejection of him was accompanied by cruelty and eagerness to do him injury; for superstition is always cruel. That their efforts were unavailing, we ought to ascribe to the providence of God; for since Christâ€™s <i>hour was not yet come</i>, as has been formerly said, guarded by the protection of his Father, on which he relied, he surmounted all dangers. </p>
