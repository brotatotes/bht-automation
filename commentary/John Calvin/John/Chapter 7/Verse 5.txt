<p><b>5.</b><i>For even his brethren did not believe in him.</i> Hence we infer how small is the value of carnal relationship; for the Holy Spirit stamps with a perpetual mark of infamy the relations of Christ, because, though convinced by the testimonies of so many works, they did not even then believe. <i>Therefore</i>, <i>whosoever wishes to be thought to be in Christ</i>, as Paul says, <i>let him be a new creature</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:17">2 Corinthians 5:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:15">Galatians 6:15</span>;) for they who dedicate themselves wholly to God obtain the place of father, and mother, and brethren to Christ, and all others he utterly disavows, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:50">Matthew 12:50</span>.) So much the more ridiculous is the superstition of Papists, who, disregarding everything else in the Virgin Mary, extol her only on the ground of relationship, bestowing on her the title of the Mother of Christ, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(180)</sup></span> as if Christ himself had not reproved the woman who exclaimed from the midst of the crowd, </p>
<p>Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the breasts that suckled thee; for Christ replied, Nay, rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:27">Luke 11:27</span>.) </p>
