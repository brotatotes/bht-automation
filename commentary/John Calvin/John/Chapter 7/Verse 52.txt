<p><b>52.</b><i>Art thou also from Galilee?</i> They say that all who favor Christ are <i>from Galilee</i>, and this is spoken reproachfully, as if he could not have any person among his followers except from the small and unknown corner of <i>Galilee</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(205)</sup></span> The extreme violence to which they are excited against Nicodemus, shows with what furious hatred they burned against Christ; for he had not avowedly undertaken to defend Christ, but had only said that <i>he ought not to be condemned before he was heard</i> Thus among the Papists in our own day, no man can show the slightest token of candour that the Gospel may not be oppressed, but immediately the enemies fly into a passion, and exclaim that he is a heretic. </p>
