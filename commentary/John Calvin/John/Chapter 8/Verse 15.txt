<p><b>15.</b><i>You judge according to the flesh.</i> This may be explained in two ways; either that they<i>judge according to</i> the wicked views of <i>the flesh</i>, or that they <i>judge according</i> to the appearance of the person. For <i>the flesh</i> sometimes denotes the outward appearance of a man; and both meanings agree well with this passage, since wherever either the feelings of <i>the flesh</i> prevail, or a regard to the person regulates the judgment, neither truth nor justice dwells. But I think that the meaning will be more certain, if you contrast <i>the flesh</i> with <i>the Spirit</i>, understanding his meaning to be, that they are not lawful and competent judges, because they have not the Spirit for their guide. </p>
<p><i>I judge no man.</i> Here, too, commentators differ. Some distinguish it thus, that <i>he does not judge</i> as man. Others refer it to the time, that while he was on earth, he did not undertake the office of a <i>Judge</i> Augustine gives both expositions, but does not decide between them. But the former distinction cannot at all apply. For this sentence contains two clauses, that Christ <i>does not judge</i>, and that <i>if he judge</i>, <i>his judgment is solid and just</i>, because it is divine. As to the former clause, therefore, in which he says that <i>he does not judge</i>, I confine it to what belongs peculiarly to this passage. For in order the more fully to convict his enemies of pride, he employs this comparison, that they unjustly assume the liberty to <i>judge,</i> and yet cannot condemn him, while he merely teaches and abstains from performing the office of a <i>judge.</i> </p>
