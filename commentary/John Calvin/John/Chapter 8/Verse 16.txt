<p><b>16.</b><i>And if I judge,</i> He adds this correction, that he may not appear entirely to surrender his right.<i>If I judge,</i> says he,<i>my judgment is true,</i> that is, it is entitled to authority. Now the authority arises from this consideration, that he does nothing but according to the commandment of the Father. </p>
<p><i>For I am not alone.</i> This phrase amounts to an affirmative, that he is not one of the ordinary rank of men, but that he must be considered along with the office which was assigned to him by the Father. But why does he not rather make an open assertion of his Divinity, as he might truly and justly have done? The reason is, that as his Divinity was concealed under the veil of the flesh, he brings forward his Father, in whom it was more manifest. Still, the object of the discourse is, to show that all that he does and teaches ought to be accounted Divine. </p>
