<p><b>35.</b><i>Now the slave remaineth not in the house always.</i> He adds a comparison, taken from the laws and from political law, to the effect that <i>a slave</i>, though he may have power for a time, yet is not the heir of the house; from which he infers that there is no perfect and durable<i>freedom</i>, but what is obtained through<i>the Son</i> In this manner he accuses the Jews of vanity, because they hold but a mask instead of the reality; for, as to their being <i>Abraham</i> ’<i>s offspring</i>, they were nothing but a mask. They held a place in the Church of God, but such a place as Ishmael, <i>a slave</i>, rising up against his <i>freeborn</i> brother, usurped for a short time, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:29">Galatians 4:29</span>.) The conclusion is, that all who boast of being <i>Abraham</i> ’<i>s children</i> have nothing but an empty and deceitful pretense. </p>
