<p><b>36.</b><i>If then the Son shall make you free.</i> By these words he means that the right of <i>freedom</i> belongs to himself alone, and that all others, being born <i>slaves</i>, cannot be delivered but by his grace. For what he possesses as his own by nature he imparts to us by adoption, when we are ingrafted by faith into his body, and become his members. Thus we ought to remember what I said formerly, that the Gospel is the instrument by which we obtain our <i>freedom</i> So then our<i>freedom</i> is a benefit conferred by Christ, but we obtain it by faith, in consequence of which also Christ regenerates us by his Spirit. When he says that they <i>shall be truly free,</i> there is an emphasis on the word <i>truly;</i> for we must supply the contrast with the foolish persuasion by which the Jews were swelled with pride, in like manner as the greater part of the world imagine that they possess a kingdom, while they are in the most wretched bondage. </p>
