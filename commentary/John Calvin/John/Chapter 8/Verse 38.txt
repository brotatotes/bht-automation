<p><b>38.</b><i>I speak what I have seen with my Father.</i> He had already made frequent mention of <i>his Father</i>; and now, by an argument drawn from contrary things, he infers that they are enemies to God, and are <i>the children of the devil</i>, because they oppose his doctrine. “For my part,” says he, “I bring nothing forward, but what I have learned from my Father. How comes it then that the word of God excites you to such fury, but because you have an opposite<i>father</i> ?”He says that he <i>speaks</i>, and they <i>do</i>, because he discharged the office of a teacher, while they labored strenuously to extinguish his doctrine. At the same time, he protects the Gospel against contempt, by showing that it is not wonderful if it be opposed by <i>the children of the devil</i> Instead of <i>you do</i>, some render it, Do you <i>what you have seen with your father</i>; as if Christ had said, “Come, show that you are the children of the devil, by opposing me; for <i>I speak</i> nothing but what God has commanded.” </p>
