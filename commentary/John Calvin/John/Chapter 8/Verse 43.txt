<p><b>43.</b><i>Why do you not understand my language?</i> In this passage, he reproaches the Jews with their obstinacy, which was so great, that <i>they could not even endure to hear him speak</i> Hence he infers, that they are actuated and hurried away by diabolical rage. Some make a distinction here between <i>language</i> and <i>speech</i>, as if <i>speech</i> had a more extensive meaning; but I do not see it; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(239)</sup></span> and besides, it would not be appropriate that the word which means less should be placed first. Many point this verse in such a manner as to make the question close with the word <i>language</i>; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(240)</sup></span> as if the question consisted only of these words, <i>Why do you not understand my language</i> ? So that the reason is immediately assigned, <i>Because you cannot hear my word.</i> But I think that it ought rather to be read in immediate connection, as if he had said, “What is the reason why my speech appears to you barbarous and unknown, so that I gain nothing by speaking to you, and so that you do not even deign to open your ears to receive what I say?” In the former clause, therefore, he reproves their stupidity; in the latter, he reproves their obstinate and ungovernable hatred of his doctrine; and he afterwards assigns a reason for both, when he says, that they are sprung <i>from the devil</i> For by putting the question, he intended to take out of their hands what was the subject of their continual boasting, that they are led by reason and judgment to oppose him. </p>
