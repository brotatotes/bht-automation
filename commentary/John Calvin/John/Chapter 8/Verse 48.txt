<p><b>48.</b><i>Do we not say well?</i> They show more and more how greatly they are stupified by Satan; for, though they are fully convicted, still they are enraged, and are not ashamed to show that they are utterly desperate. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(243)</sup></span> Besides, though they bring a double reproach against Christ, still they wish to do nothing more than to say in a few words, that he is a detestable man, and that he is actuated by a wicked spirit. The Jews reckoned <i>the Samaritans</i> to be apostates and corrupters of the Law; and therefore, whenever they wished to stamp a man with infamy, they called him <i>a Samaritan.</i> Having no crime more heinous, therefore, to reproach Christ with, they seize at random, and without judgment, this vulgar taunt. To express it in a few words, we see that with effrontery they curse him, as men are wont to do when, infuriated like enraged dogs, they cannot find any thing to say. </p>
