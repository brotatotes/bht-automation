<p><b>28.</b><i>Then they upbraided him.</i> It is probable that all the reproaches which were prompted by the violence of their rage and indignation were eagerly cast upon him; but there was this one reproach among men, that they called him an apostate from the Law. For, in their opinion, he could not be a disciple of Christ without revolting from the Law of Moses; and they expressly represent these two things as inconsistent with each other. It is a very plausible pretence, that they are afraid of revolting from the doctrine of Moses. For this is the true rule of piety, that we ought to listen to the prophets, by whom we certainly know that God has spoken; that our faith may not be carried about by any doctrines of men. From this principle they deduce their certainty as to the Law of Moses; but they lie when they say that they are <i>the disciples of Moses,</i> for they have turned aside from the end of the Law. Thus hypocrites are wont to tear God in pieces, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(271)</sup></span> when they wish to shelter themselves under his name. If Christ be the soul of the Law, as Paul tells us, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:4">Romans 10:4</span>,) what will the Law be when separated from him, but a dead body? We are taught by this example, that no man truly hears God, unless he be an attentive hearer of his word, so as to understand what God means and says. </p>
