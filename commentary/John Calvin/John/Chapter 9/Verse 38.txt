<p><b>38.</b><i>And he worshipped him.</i> It may be asked, Did the blind man honor or worship Christ as God? <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(275)</sup></span> The word which the Evangelist employs (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">προσέκυνησει</span></blu></grk>) means nothing more than to express respect and homage by bending the knee, or by other signs. For my own part, certainly, I think that it denotes something rare and uncommon; namely, that the blind man gave far more honor to Christ than to an ordinary man, or even to a prophet. And yet I do not think that at that time he had made such progress as to know that Christ was God manifested in the flesh. What then is meant by <i>worship</i> ? The blind man, convinced that Jesus was <i>the Son of God</i>, nearly lost the command of himself, and, in rapturous admiration, bowed down before him. </p>
