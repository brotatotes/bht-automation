<p><b>8.</b><i>Likewise also these</i>. This comparison is not to be pressed too strictly, as though he compared these whom he mentions in all things to be Sodomites, or to the fallen angels, or to the unbelieving people. He only shews that they were vessels of wrath appointed to destruction, and that they could not escape the hand of God, but that he would some time or another make them examples of his vengeance. For his design was to terrify the godly to whom he was writing, lest they should entangle themselves in their society. </p>
<p>But he begins here more clearly to describe these impostors. And he says first, that they polluted their flesh as it were by dreaming, by which words he denotes their stupid effrontery, as though he had said that they abandoned themselves to all kinds of filth, which the most wicked abhor, except sleep took away shame and also consciousness. It is then a metaphorical mode of speaking, by which he intimates that they were so dull and stupid as to give up themselves without any shame to every kind of baseness. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(195)</sup></span> </p>
<p>There is a contrast to be noticed, when he says that they <i>defiled</i> or <i>polluted the flesh</i>, that is, that they degraded what was less excellent, and that yet they despised as disgraceful what is deemed especially excellent among mankind. </p>
<p>It appears from the second clause that they were seditious men, who sought anarchy, that, being loosed from the fear of the laws, they might sin more freely. But these two things are nearly always connected, that they who abandon themselves to iniquity, do also wish to abolish all order. Though, indeed, their chief object is to be free from every yoke, it yet appears from the words of Jude that they were wont to speak insolently and reproachfully of magistrates, like the fanatics of the present day, who not only grumble because they are restrained by the authority of magistrates, but furiously declaim against all government, and say that the power of the sword is profane and opposed to godliness; in short, they superciliously reject from the Church of God all kings and all magistrates. <i>Dignities</i> or <i>glories</i> are orders or ranks eminent in power or honor. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(195)</span> The “dreaming” is connected with the three things which follow, defiling the flesh, despising government and slandering dignities. Hence the idea conveyed by our version, in which <i>filthy</i> is introduced, is by no means correct. Allusion seems to be made to the pretensions of false prophets in former times. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:25">Jeremiah 23:25</span>. The false prophets taught what they pretended to see in dreams, as dreams as well as visions were vouchsafed to true prophets. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:28">Joel 2:28</span>. It is not improbable that those referred to here pretended that they had received what they taught., by supernatural dreams; for how otherwise could they deceive others, especially respecting errors so gross and palpable as are here mentioned? The eighth verse is, as to its construction, connected with the seventh. The <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὡς</span></blu></grk> and the <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὁμοίως</span></blu></grk> are corresponding terms; “as Sodom and Gomorrha, etc., are set forth for an example, in like manner also these would be.” This is the drift of the passage; — </p>
<p><b>8.</b>“In like manner, indeed, shall also these dreamers be that is, <br>an example of divine vengeance, <br/>who defile the flesh, despise dominion, and revile dignities.” </br></p>
<p>Peter threatened them with “swift destruction,” <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>. There are here three things mentioned which apply to the three instances previously adduced: like the Sodomites they defiled the flesh; like the fallen angels they despised dominion; and like the Israelites in the wilderness, they reviled dignities; for it was especially by opposing the power given to Moses that the Israelites manifested their unbelief. — <i>Ed</i>. </p>
