<p><b>26.</b><i>Now in the sixth month</i> It was a wonderful dispensation of the divine purpose, and far removed from the ordinary judgment of men, that God determined to make the beginning of the generation of the herald more illustrious than that of his own Son. The prophecy respecting John was published in the temple and universally known: Christ is promised to a virgin in an obscure town of Judea, and this prophecy remains buried in the breast of a young woman. But it was proper that, even from the birth of Christ, that saying should be fulfilled, </p>
<p><i>“</i> it pleased God by foolishness to save them that believe,” <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:21">1 Corinthians 1:21</span>.) </p>
<p>The treasure of this mystery was committed by him to a virgin in such a manner, that at length, when the proper time came, it might be communicated to all the godly. It was, I own, a mean kind of guardianship; but whether for trying the humility of faith, or restraining the pride of the ungodly, it was the best adapted. Let us learn, even when the reason does not immediately appear, to submit modestly to God, and let us not be ashamed to receive instruction from her who carried in her womb Christ the eternal <i>“</i> wisdom of God<i>,”</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:24">1 Corinthians 1:24</span>.) There is nothing which we should more carefully avoid than the proud contempt that would deprive us of the knowledge of the inestimable secret, which God has purposely <i>“hid from the wise and prudent, and revealed</i> ” to the humble and <i>“to babes</i>, ” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span>.) </p>
<p>It was, I think, for the same reason that he chose <i>a virgin betrothed to a man</i> There is no foundation for Origen’s opinion, that he did this for the purpose of concealing from Satan the salvation which he was preparing to bestow on men. The marriage was a veil held out before the eyes of the world, that he who was commonly <i>“supposed to be the son of Joseph</i> ” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:23">Luke 3:23</span>) might at length be believed and acknowledged by the godly to be the Son of God. Yet the entrance of Christ into the world was not destitute of glory; for the splendor of his Godhead was manifested from the commencement by his heavenly Father. Angels announced that <i>“a Savior was born,”</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:11">Luke 2:11</span>;) but their voice was only heard by the shepherds, and traveled no farther. One miracle, — everywhere published by <i>“the wise men who came from the east</i>, ” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:1">Matthew 2:1</span>) that they had seen a star which proclaimed the birth of the Highest King,—may have been highly celebrated. Yet we see how God kept his Son, as it were, in concealment, until the time of his full manifestation arrived, and then erected for him a platform, that he might be beheld by all. </p>
<p>The participle <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">μεμνηστευμένην</span></blu></grk>, which is employed by the Evangelist, signifies that the virgin had then been engaged to her bridegroom, but was not yet given as a wife to her husband. For it was customary among Jewish parents to keep their daughters some time at home, after they had been betrothed to men; otherwise, the law relating to the seduction of a <i>“</i> betrothed damsel” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+22:23">Deuteronomy 22:23</span>) would have been unnecessary. Luke says that <i>Joseph was of the house of David;</i> for families are usually reckoned by the names of the men; but on this point we shall speak more fully in another place. </p>
