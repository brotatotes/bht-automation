<p><b>29.</b><i>When she had seen him, she was agitated</i> Luke does not say that <i>she was agitated</i> by the presence of the angel, but <i>by his address.</i> Why then does he also mention his presence? <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(24)</sup></span> The reason, I think, is this. Perceiving in the angel something of heavenly glory, she was seized with sudden dread arising out of reverence for God. <i>She was agitated,</i> because she felt that she had received a salutation, not from a mortal man, but from an angel of God. But Luke does not say that she was so <i>agitated</i> as to have lost recollection. On the contrary, he mentions an indication of an attentive and composed mind; for he afterwards adds, <i>and was considering what that salutation would be:</i> that is, what was its object, and what was its meaning. It instantly occurred to her that the angel had not been sent for a trifling purpose. This example reminds us, first, that we ought not to be careless observers of the works of God; and, secondly, that our consideration of them ought to be regulated by fear and reverence. </p>
