<p><b>3.</b><i>Having carefully examined all things</i> The old translator has it, <i>having followed out all things;</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(20)</sup></span> and the Greek verb <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">παρακολουθεῖν</span></blu></grk> is taken metaphorically from those who tread in the footsteps of others, that nothing may escape them. So that Luke intended to express his close and laborious investigation, just as Demosthenes employs the same word, when, in examining an embassy against which he brings an accusation, he boasts of his diligence to have been such, that he perceived every thing that had been done as well as if he had been a spectator. </p>
