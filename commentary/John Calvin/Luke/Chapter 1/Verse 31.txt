<p><b>31.</b><i>Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb</i> The angel adapts his words, first to Isaiah’s prophecy, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+7:14">Isaiah 7:14</span>,) and next to other passages of the Prophets, with the view of affecting more powerfully the mind of the virgin: for such prophecies were well known and highly esteemed among the godly. At the same time, it ought to be observed that the angel did not merely speak in private to the ear of the virgin, but brought <i>glad tidings, (</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εὐαγγέλιον</span></blu></grk> <i>,)</i> which were shortly afterwards to be published throughout the whole world. It was not without the purpose of God, that the agreement, between ancient prophecies and the present message respecting the manifestation of Christ, was so clearly pointed out. The word <i>conceive</i> is enough to set aside the dream of Marcion and Manichaeus: for it is easy to gather from it that Mary brought forth not an ethereal body or phantom, but the fruit which she had previously conceived in her womb. </p>
<p><i>Thou shalt call his name Jesus</i> The reason of the name is given by Matthew: <i>for he shall save his people from their sins,</i> <b>(</b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span> <b>.)</b>And so the name contains a promise of salvation, and points out the object for which <i>Christ</i> was sent by the Father into the world, as he tells us that he “came not to judge the world, but to save the world,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:47">John 12:47</span>.) Let us remember that not by the will of men, but by the command of God, was this name given to him by the angel, that our faith may have its foundation, not in earth, but in heaven. It is derived from the Hebrew word <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">ישע</span></blu></heb>, salvation, from which comes <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">הושיע</span></blu></heb>, which signifies to save. It is a waste of ingenuity to contend that it differs from the Hebrew name <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">יהושוע</span></blu></heb>, (Jehoshua or Joshua.) The Rabbins everywhere write the word <i>Jesu;</i> and they do this with evident malice, that they may not bestow on Christ an honorable name, but, on the contrary, may insinuate that he is some pretended Jew. Their manner of writing it, accordingly, is of no more importance than the barking of a dog. The objection that it is far beneath the dignity of the Son of God to have a name in common with others, might equally apply to the name <i>Christ,</i> or <i>Anointed</i> But the solution of both is easy. What was exhibited in shadow under the law is fully and actually manifested in the Son of God; or, what was then a figure is in him a substance. There is another objection of as little weight. They assert that the name of Jesus is not worthy of veneration and awe, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9">Philippians 2:9</span>,) if it does not belong exclusively to the Son of God. For Paul does not attribute to him a magical name, as if in its very syllables majesty resided, but his language simply means that Christ has received from the Father the highest authority, to which the whole world ought to submit. Let us then bid adieu to such imaginations, and know, that the name <i>Jesus</i> was given to Christ, in order that believers may be instructed to seek in him what had formerly been shadowed out under the Law. </p>
