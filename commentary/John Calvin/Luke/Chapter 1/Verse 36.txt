<p><b>36.</b><i>And, behold, Elisabeth thy cousin</i> By an instance taken from her own relatives, the angel encourages the faith of Mary to expect a miracle. If neither the barrenness nor the old age of Elisabeth could prevent God from making her a mother, there was no better reason why Mary should confine her view within the ordinary limits of nature, when she beheld such a demonstration of divine power in her <i>cousin</i> He mentions expressly <i>the sixth month;</i> because in the fifth month a woman usually feels the child quicken in the womb, so that the <i>sixth month</i> removes all doubt. True, Mary ought to have placed such a reliance on the bare word of God as to require no support to her faith from any other quarter; but, to prevent farther hesitation, the Lord condescends to strengthen his promise by this new aid. With equal indulgence does he cheer and support us every day; nay, with greater indulgence, because our faith is weaker. That we may not doubt his truth, testimonies to confirm it are brought by him from every direction. </p>
<p>A question arises, how Elisabeth, who was <i>of the daughters of Aaron,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:5">Luke 1:5</span>,) and Mary, who was descended from the stock of David, could be <i>cousins</i> This appears to be at variance with the law, which prohibited women from marrying into a different tribe from their own, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="nu+36:6">Numbers 36:6</span>.) With respect to the law, if we look at its object, it forbade those intermarriages only which might “remove inheritances from tribe to tribe,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="nu+36:7">Numbers 36:7</span>.) No such danger existed, if any woman of the tribe of Judah married a priest, to whom an inheritance could not be conveyed. The same argument would hold if a woman of the tribe of Levi passed into another tribe. It is possible that the mother of the holy virgin might be descended from the family of Aaron, and so her daughter might be <i>cousin</i> to Elisabeth. </p>
