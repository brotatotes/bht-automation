<p><b>37.</b><i>For no word shall be impossible with God</i> If we choose to take <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ῥη̑μα</span></blu></grk>, <i>word,</i> in its strict and native sense, the meaning is, that God will do what he hath promised, for no hinderance can resist his power. The argument will be, God hath promised, and therefore he will accomplish it; for we ought not to allege any impossibility in opposition to his <i>word</i> But as a <i>word</i> often means a <i>thing</i> in the idiom of the Hebrew language, (which the Evangelists followed, though they wrote in Greek,) <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(30)</sup></span> we explain it more simply, that <i>nothing is impossible with God</i> We ought always, in- deed, to hold it as a maxim, that they wander widely from the truth who, at their pleasure, imagine the power of God to be something beyond his <i>word;</i> for we ought always to contemplate his boundless power, that it may strengthen our hope and confidence. But it is idle, and unprofitable, and even dangerous, to argue what God can do unless we also take into account what he resolves to do. The angel does here what God frequently does in Scripture, employs a general doctrine to confirm one kind of promise. This is the true and proper use of a general doctrine, to apply its scattered promises to the present subject, whenever we are uneasy or distressed; for so long as they retain their general form, they make little impression upon us. We need not wonder if Mary is reminded by the angel of the power of God; for our distrust of it diminishes very greatly our confidence in the promises. All acknowledge in words that God is Almighty; but, if he promises any thing beyond what we are able to comprehend, we remain in doubt. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(31)</sup></span> Whence comes this but from our ascribing to his power nothing more than what our senses receive? Thus Paul, commending the faith of Abraham, says, that he </p>
<p>“gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:20">Romans 4:20</span>.) </p>
<p>In another passage, speaking of the hope of eternal life, he sets before him the promise of God. “I know,” says he, </p>
<p>“whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span>.) </p>
<p>This may seem to be a small portion of faith; for no man, however wicked, openly denies God’s claim to be Almighty. But he who has the power of God firmly and thoroughly fixed in his heart will easily surmount the other obstacles which present themselves to faith. It ought to be observed, however, that the power of God is viewed by true faith, if I may use the expression, <i>as efficacious</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(32)</sup></span> For God is and wishes to be acknowledged as powerful, that by the accomplishment itself he may prove his faithfulness. </p>
