<p>Now follows a remarkable and interesting song of the holy virgin, which plainly shows how eminent were her attainments in the grace of the Spirit. There are three clauses in this song. First, Mary offers solemn thanksgiving for that mercy of God which she had experienced in her own person. Next, she celebrates in general terms God’s power and judgments. Lastly, she applies these to the matter in hand, treating of the redemption formerly promised, and now granted to the church. </p>
<p><b>46.</b>My <i>soul magnifieth</i> Here Mary testifies her gratitude, as we have already said. But as hypocrites, for the most part, sing the praises of God with open mouth, unaccompanied by any affection of the heart, Mary says that she praises God from an inward feeling of the mind. And certainly they who pronounce his glory, not from the mind, but with the tongue alone, do nothing more than profane his holy name. The words <i>soul</i> and <i>spirit</i> are used in Scripture in various senses, but, when employed together, they denote chiefly two faculties of the soul; <i>spirit</i> being taken for the understanding, and <i>soul</i> for the seat of the affections. To comprehend the meaning of the holy virgin, it must be observed that what is here placed second is first in order; for the excitement of the will of man to praise God must be preceded by a <i>rejoicing of the spirit,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(47)</sup></span> as James says, “Is any merry? let him sing psalms,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:13">James 5:13</span>.) Sadness and anxiety lock up the soul, and restrain the tongue from celebrating the goodness of God. When the soul of Mary exults with joy, the heart breaks out in praising God. It is with great propriety, in speaking of the joy of her heart, that she gives to God the appellation of <i>Savior</i> Till God has been recognised as a <i>Savior,</i> the minds of men are not free to indulge in true and full joy, but will remain in doubt and anxiety. It is God’s fatherly kindness alone, and the salvation flowing from it, that fill the soul with joy. In a word, the first thing necessary for believers is, to be able to rejoice that they have their salvation in God. The next ought to follow, that, having experienced God to be a kind Father, they may “offer to him thanksgiving,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+50:14">Psalms 50:14</span>.) The Greek word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">σωτὴρ</span></blu></grk>, <i>Savior,</i> has a more extensive signification than the Latin word <i>Servator;</i> for it means not only that he once delivers, but that he is “the Author of eternal salvations” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:9">Hebrews 5:9</span>.) </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(47)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Car avant que la volonte de l’ homme soit mise en train de louer Dieu, il faut qu’il y ait devant une alaigrete et resiouissance d’esprit</span></blu>.” — “For before the will of man is set agoing to praise God, there must be previously a cheerfulness and rejoicing of spirit.” </p>
