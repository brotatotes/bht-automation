<p><b>74.</b><i>That being delivered out of the hand of our enemies</i> His purpose was, that, being redeemed, they might dedicate and consecrate themselves entirely to the Author of their salvation. As the efficient cause of human salvation was the undeserved goodness of God, so its final cause is, that, by a godly and holy life, men may glorify his name. This deserves careful attention, that we may remember our calling, and so learn to apply the grace of God to its proper use. We must meditate on such declarations as these: </p>
<p>“God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness,” <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:7">1 Thessalonians 4:7</span>.) </p>
<p>We are “redeemed with a great price,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:20">1 Corinthians 6:20</span>,) “the precious blood of Christ,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18">1 Peter 1:18</span>,) not that we may serve “the lusts of the flesh,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:18">2 Peter 2:18</span>,) or indulge in unbridled licentiousness, but that Christ may reign in us. We are admitted by adoption into the family of God, that we, on our part, may yield obedience as children to a father. For “the kindness and love (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">φιλανθρωπία</span></blu></grk>) of God our Savior toward man,” (<b>Titus 3:4</b>,) “hath appeared unto all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly,” (<b>Titus 2:11,12</b>.) And so Paul, when he wishes powerfully to exhort believers to consecrate themselves to God, “in newness of life,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>,) and, “putting off, concerning the former conversation, the old man,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22">Ephesians 4:22</span>,) to render to him a “reasonable service,” “beseeches them by the mercies of God,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span>.) Scripture is full of declarations of this nature, which show that we “frustrate the grace” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:21">Galatians 2:21</span>) of Christ, if we do not follow out this design. </p>
<p><i>That we may serve him without fear</i> This deserves our attention: for it implies that we cannot worship God in a proper manner without composure of mind. Those who are ill at ease, who have an inward struggle, whether God is favorable or hostile to them, whether he accepts or rejects their services,—in a word, who fluctuate in uncertainty between hope and fear, will sometimes labor anxiously in the worship of God, but never will sincerely or honestly obey him. Alarm and dread make them turn from him with horror; and so, if it were possible, they would desire that there were, “no God,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:1">Psalms 14:1</span>.) But we know, that no sacrifice is acceptable to God, which is not offered willingly, and with a cheerful heart. Before men can truly worship <i>God,</i> they must obtain peace of conscience, as David speaks, “There is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+130:4">Psalms 130:4</span>:) for those to whom God has given peace are graciously invited and led to approach him willingly and with a cheerful desire to worship him. Hence too Paul deduces that maxim, that “whatsoever is undertaken without faith is sin,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</span>.) But since God reconciles men to himself in Christ, since by his protection he keeps them safe from all fear, since he has committed their salvation to his own hand and guardianship, we are justly declared by Zacharias to be delivered by his grace from fear. And so the prophets describe it as peculiar to his reign, that, </p>
<p>“they shall sit every man under his vine, and under his fig-tree, and none shall make them afraid,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mic+4:4">Micah 4:4</span>.) </p>
