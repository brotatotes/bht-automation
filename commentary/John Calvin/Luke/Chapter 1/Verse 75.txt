<p><b>75.</b><i>In holiness and righteousness</i> As the rule of a good life has been reduced by God to two tables, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+31:18">Exodus 31:18</span>,) so Zacharias here declares, that we serve God in a proper manner, when our life has been framed to <i>holiness and righteousness. Holiness,</i> beyond all question, denotes—as even Plato knew the duties of godliness, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(77)</sup></span> which relate to the first table of the law. <i>Righteousness,</i> again, extends to all the duties of charity: for God requires nothing more from us in the second table of the law, than to render to every one what belongs to him. It is added, <i>before him,</i> to instruct believers, that it is not enough if their lives are decently regulated before the eyes of men, and their hands, and feet, and whole body, restrained from every kind of open wickedness: but they must live according to the will of God, who is not satisfied with professions of holiness, but looks chiefly on the heart. </p>
<p>Lastly, That no man may consider his duties to be at an end, when he has worshipped God for a certain period, Zacharias declares that men have been redeemed on the condition <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(78)</sup></span> that they shall continue to devote themselves to the worship of God <i>all the days of</i> their <i>life</i> And certainly, as redemption is eternal, the remembrance of it ought never to pass away; as God adopts men into his family for ever, their gratitude ought not to be transitory or of short continuance; and, in a word, as “Christ both died and rose, and revived” for them, it is proper that he should be “Lord both of the dead and living,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:9">Romans 14:9</span>.) So Paul, in a passage which I lately quoted, enjoins us to </p>
<p>“live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works,” <br/>(<b>Titus 2:12-14</b>.) </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(78)</span> “<blu>Hac lege redemptas esse homines</blu>.” — “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Zacharie dit que les hommes ont este rachetez a</span></blu> <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">la charge</span></i></blu> <blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">de s’appliquer a servir Dieu tout le temps de leur vie</span></blu>.” — “Zacharias says that men have been redeemed upon condition of applying themselves to serve God <i>all the time of their life.</i> ” </p>
