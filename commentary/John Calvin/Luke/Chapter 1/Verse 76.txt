<p><b>76.</b><i>And thou, child</i> Zacharias again returns to commend the grace of Christ, but does this, as it were, in the person of his son, by describing briefly the office to which he had been appointed as an instructor. Though in a little infant eight days old he does not yet observe prophetical endowments, yet turning his eyes to the purpose of God, he speaks of it as a thing already known. <i>To be called</i> means here to be <i>considered and openly acknowledged</i> as the prophet of God. A secret calling of God had already taken place. It only remained that the nature of that calling should be manifested to men. But as the name <i>Prophet</i> is general, Zacharias, following the revelation brought to him by the angel, affirms that he would be the usher <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(80)</sup></span> or herald of Christ. He says, <i>thou shalt go before the face of the Lord:</i> that is, thou shalt discharge the office of turning men by thy preaching to hear the Lord. The reason why John, when he had nearly finished his course, affirmed that he was not a <i>prophet</i> of God, is explained by me at the proper place, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:21">John 1:21</span>,) and in what manner he was <i>to prepare his ways</i> we shall afterwards see. </p>
