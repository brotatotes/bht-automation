<p><b>78.</b><i>Through the bowels</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(83)</sup></span> <i>of mercy</i> In so great a benefit Zacharias justly extols the mercy of God, and not satisfied with merely calling it the salvation which was brought by Christ, he employs more emphatic language, and says that it proceeded from the very <i>bowels of the mercy</i> of God. He then tells us metaphorically, that the great mercy of God has made the day to <i>give light to those who were sitting in darkness Oriens,</i> in the Latin version of this passage, is not a participle: for the Greek word is <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀνατολή</span></blu></grk> <i>,</i> that is, the Eastern region, as contrasted with the West. Zacharias extols the <i>mercy</i> of God, as manifested in dispelling the darkness of death, and restoring to the people of God the light of life. In this way, whenever our salvation is the subject, we ought to raise our minds to the contemplation of the divine mercy. There appears to be an allusion to a prediction of Malachi, in which Christ is called “the Sun of Righteousness,” and is said to “arise with healing in his wing,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:2">Malachi 4:2</span>,) that is, to bring health in his rays. </p>
