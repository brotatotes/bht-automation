<p><b>17.</b><i>And the seventy returned.</i> It is evident, that the faith of the <i>seventy</i> disciples in the words of Christ had not been full and complete, when they <i>returned,</i> exulting over it as a thing new and unexpected, that they had cast out <i>devils</i> by the power of Christ. Nay, they had received this power accompanied by a command. At the same time, I have no doubt that, when they departed, they were convinced that nothing which the Master had said to them would fail of its accomplishment; but afterwards, when the matter proceeded to an extent which surpassed their expectations, they were astonished at the sight. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(51)</sup></span> And this is frequently the case with believers, that they receive from the word but a slight perception of the Divine power, and are afterwards excited to admiration by actual experience. What was the nature of that joy will more clearly appear from Christ’s reply. </p>
