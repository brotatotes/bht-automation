<p><b>20.</b><i>Your names are written.</i> As it was the design of Christ to withdraw his disciples from a transitory joy, that they might glory in eternal life, he leads them to its origin and source, which is, that they were chosen by God and adopted as his children. He might indeed have commanded them to rejoice that they had been regenerated by the Spirit of God, (<b>Titus 3:5</b>,) and become <i>new creatures in Christ,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:17">2 Corinthians 5:17</span>;) that they had been <i>enlightened</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>) in the hope of salvation, and had received <i>the earnest of the inheritance,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>.) But he intended to point out, that the source from which all these benefits had flowed was the free election of God, that they might not claim any thing for themselves. Reasons for praising God are no doubt furnished by those acts of his kindness which we feel <i>within</i> us; but eternal election, which is <i>without</i> us, shows more clearly that our salvation rests on the pure goodness <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(54)</sup></span> of God. The metaphorical expression, <i>your names are written in heaven,</i> means, that they were acknowledged by God as His children and heirs, as if they had been inscribed in a register. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(55)</sup></span> </p>
