<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:26">Luke 10:26</span></b><b>.</b><i>What is written in the law?</i> He receives from Christ a reply different from what he had expected. And, indeed, no other rule of a holy and righteous life was prescribed by Christ than what had been laid down by the Law of Moses; for the perfect love of God and of our neighbors comprehends the utmost perfection of righteousness. Yet it must be observed, that Christ speaks here about obtaining salvation, in agreement with the question which had been put to him; for he does not teach absolutely, as in other passages, how men may arrive at eternal life, but how they ought to live, in order to be accounted righteous in the sight of God. Now it is certain that in the Law there is prescribed to men a rule by which they ought to regulate their life, so as to obtain salvation in the sight of God. That the Law can do nothing else than condemn, and is therefore called the doctrine of death, and is said by Paul to increase transgressions, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:13">Romans 7:13</span>,) arises not from any fault of its doctrine, but because it is impossible for us to perform what it enjoins. Therefore, though no man is justified by the Law yet the Law itself contains the highest righteousness, because it does not falsely hold out salvation to its followers, if any one fully observed all that it commands. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(72)</sup></span> Nor ought we to look upon this as a strange manner of teaching, that God first demands the righteousness of works, and next offers a gratuitous righteousness without works; for it is necessary that men should be convinced of their righteous condemnation, that they may betake themselves to the mercy of God. Accordingly, Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:5">Romans 10:5</span>) compares both kinds of <i>righteousness,</i> in order to inform us that the reason why we are freely justified by God is, that we have no righteousness of our own. Now Christ in this reply accommodated himself to the <i>lawyer,</i> and attended to the nature of his <i>question;</i> for he had inquired not how salvation must be sought, but by what works it must be obtained. </p>
