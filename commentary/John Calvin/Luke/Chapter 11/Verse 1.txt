<p>It is uncertain whether this form was once only or twice delivered by Christ to his disciples. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(429)</sup></span> Some think that the latter is more probable; because Luke says that he was requested to do it, while Matthew represents him as teaching it of his own accord. But as we have said, that Matthew collects all the leading points of doctrine, in order that the whole amount of them may be more clearly perceived by the readers when they are placed in close succession, it is possible that Matthew may have omitted to mention the occasion which is related by Luke. On this subject, however, I am unwilling to debate with any person. </p>
<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:1">Luke 11:1</span></b><i>As John also taught his diciples.</i> John delivered to his disciples a particular form of prayer; and he did so, in my opinion, because the time required it. The state of affairs among the Jews was, at that time, exceedingly corrupted. Every thing connected with religion had so miserably fallen, that we need not be surprised to find few among them, by whom prayer was offered in a proper manner. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(430)</sup></span> Besides, it was proper, that the minds of believers should be excited, by prayer, to hope and desire the promised redemption, which was at hand. John might, therefore, have collected, out of various passages of Scripture, a certain prayer adapted to the time, and approaching more nearly to the spiritual kingdom of Christ, which had already begun to be revealed. </p>
