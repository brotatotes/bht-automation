<p><b>41.</b><i>But out of what you have, give alms.</i> Christ, according to his custom, withdraws the Pharisees from ceremonies to charity, declaring that it is not water, but liberality, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(285)</sup></span> that cleanses both men and food. By these words he does not disparage the grace of God, or reject the ceremonies of the Law as vain and useless; but addresses his discourse to those who feel confident that God will be amused by mere signs. “It is the lawful use alone,” he says, “that sanctifies food. But food is rightly and properly used by those who supply from their abundance the necessities of the poor. It would therefore be better <i>to give alms out of what you have,</i> than to be careful about washing hands and cups, and to neglect the poor.” </p>
<p>The inference which the Papists draw from these words, that <i>alms</i> are satisfactions, by which we are cleansed from our sins, is too absurd to require a lengthened refutation. Christ does not here inform us by what price we must purchase the forgiveness of sins, but says that those persons eat their bread with cleanness, who bestow a part of it on the poor. I understand the words, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὰ ἐνόντα</span></blu></grk>, to mean “the present supply,” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(286)</sup></span> and not, as Erasmus and the old translator render them, “what remains over.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(287)</sup></span> </p>
<p>The reproofs which immediately follow may be reserved, with greater propriety, for another occasion. I do not think it probable that Christ, while sitting at table, indulged in this continuous strain of invective against <i>scribes and Pharisees,</i> but that Luke has introduced here what was spoken at another time; for the Evangelists, as we have frequently mentioned, paid little attention to the order of dates. </p>
