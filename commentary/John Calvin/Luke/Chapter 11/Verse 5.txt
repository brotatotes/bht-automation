<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:5">Luke 11:5</span></b><b>.</b><i>Which of you shall have a friend, Luke</i> adds this comparison, which is not mentioned by Matthew. The general instruction conveyed by it is this: Believers ought not to be discouraged, if they do not immediately obtain their desires, or if they find them difficult to be obtained: for if, among men, importunity of asking extorts what a person would not willingly do, we have no reason to doubt that God will listen to us, if we persevere constantly in prayer, and if our minds do not slacken through difficulty or delay. </p>
