<p><b>17.</b><i>What shall I do?</i> Wicked men are driven to perplexity in their deliberations, because they do not know how any thing is to be lawfully used; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(269)</sup></span> and, next, because they are intoxicated with a foolish confidence which makes them forget themselves. Thus we find that this <i>rich man</i> lengthens out his expectation of life in proportion to his large income, and drives far away from him the remembrance of death. And yet this pride is accompanied by distrust; for those men, when they have had their fill, are still agitated by insatiable desire, like this <i>rich man,</i> who enlarges his <i>barns,</i> as if his belly, which had been filled with his former <i>barns,</i> had not got enough. At the same time, Christ does not expressly condemn this man for acting the part of a careful householder in storing up his produce, but because his ravenous desire, like a deep whirlpool, swallows up and devours many <i>barns;</i> from which it follows that he does not comprehend the proper use of an abundant produce. </p>
