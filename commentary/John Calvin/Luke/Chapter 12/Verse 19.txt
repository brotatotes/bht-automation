<p><b>19.</b><i>Take thine ease, eat, drink, enjoy thyself.</i> When he exhorts himself to <i>eat and drink,</i> he no longer remembers that he is a man, but swells into pride by relying on his abundance. We daily perceive striking instances of this disdainful conduct <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(270)</sup></span> in irreligious men, who hold up the mass of their riches, as if it were nothing less than a brazen rampart against death. When he says, <i>Eat, my soul, and enjoy thyself,</i> there is an emphatic meaning in this Hebrew idiom; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(271)</sup></span> for he addresses himself in such a manner as to imply, that he has all that is necessary for gratifying all his senses and all his desires. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(270)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">D’une telle mecognoissance et fierte</span></blu>;” — “of such ingratitude and pride.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(271)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">En ceste locution Hebraique il y a une vehemence et proprie plus que les mots n’emportent de prime face</span></blu>;” — “in that Hebrew form of expression there is greater force and propriety than the words at first sight bear.” </p>
