<p><b>21.</b><i>So is he that layeth up for himself.</i> As the two clauses are evidently contrasted, the one must be taken into account for the exposition of the other. Let us ascertain, therefore, what is meant by being <i>rich in God,</i> or, “towards God” or, “with respect to God.” Those who are tolerably acquainted with the Scriptures know that the preposition <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἰς</span></blu></grk> not unfrequently takes the sense of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐν</span></blu></grk>. But whether it be understood in the one sense or in the other, is of little consequence; for the meaning comes to this, that they are <i>rich according to God,</i> who do not trust to earthly things, but depend solely on his providence. It matters not whether they are in abundance or in want, provided that both classes present their sincere prayers to the Lord for their daily bread. The corresponding phrase, <i>layeth up for himself,</i> conveys the idea that this man paid no attention to the blessing of God, but anxiously heaped up an immense store, so that his confidence was shut up in his <i>barns.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(273)</sup></span> Hence we may easily conclude that the parable was intended to show, that vain are the deliberations and foolish attempts of those who, trusting to the abundance of their wealth, do not rely on God alone, and are not satisfied with their own share, or prepared for whatever may befall them; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(274)</sup></span> and, finally, that such persons will suffer the penalty of their own folly. </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(274)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Estans prests a recevoir ce qu’il plaira a Dieu leur envoyer</span></blu>;” — “being prepared to receive what God may be pleased to send to them.” </p>
