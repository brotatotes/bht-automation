<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:29">Luke 12:29</span></b><b>.</b><i>And be not lifted on high</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(460)</sup></span> This clause corresponds to the last sentence in the passage taken from Matthew, Be <i>not anxious about tomorrow</i> Our Lord now charges them with another fault. When men wish to make arrangements in their own favor, they would willingly embrace five centuries. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(461)</sup></span> The verb <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">μετεωρίζεσθαι</span></blu></grk> <i>,</i> which Luke employs, properly signifies <i>to survey from a lofty situation,</i> or, as we commonly say, to make long discourses: <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(462)</sup></span> for the intemperate desires of the flesh are never satisfied without making a hundred revolutions of heaven and earth. The consequence is, that they leave no room for the providence of God. This is a reproof of excessive curiosity; for it leads us to bring upon ourselves uneasiness to no purpose, and voluntarily to make ourselves miserable <i>before the time,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span>.) The expression used by Matthew, <i>its own affliction is sufficient for the day,</i> directs believers to moderate their cares, and not to attempt to carry their foresight beyond the limits of their calling: For, as we have said, it does not condemn every kind of care, but only that which wanders, by indirect and endless circuits, beyond limits. </p>
