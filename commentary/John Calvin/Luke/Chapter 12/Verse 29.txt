Luke 12:29.And be not lifted on high (460) This clause corresponds to the last sentence in the passage taken from Matthew, Be not anxious about tomorrow Our Lord now charges them with another fault. When men wish to make arrangements in their own favor, they would willingly embrace five centuries. (461) The verb μετεωρίζεσθαι , which Luke employs, properly signifies to survey from a lofty situation, or, as we commonly say, to make long discourses: (462) for the intemperate desires of the flesh are never satisfied without making a hundred revolutions of heaven and earth. The consequence is, that they leave no room for the providence of God. This is a reproof of excessive curiosity; for it leads us to bring upon ourselves uneasiness to no purpose, and voluntarily to make ourselves miserable before the time, (Matthew 8:29.) The expression used by Matthew, its own affliction is sufficient for the day, directs believers to moderate their cares, and not to attempt to carry their foresight beyond the limits of their calling: For, as we have said, it does not condemn every kind of care, but only that which wanders, by indirect and endless circuits, beyond limits. (460) “Ne soyez en suspens;” — “be not in suspense.” (461) “Embrasseroyent volontiers beaucoup de cent annees;” — “would willingly embrace many hundreds of years.” (462) “Regarder en haut, et estendre sa veue bien loin: ce qu’on dit communement, Faire de longs discours, ou estre en suspens, comme aussi nous l’avons traduit.” — “To look from on high, and to extend one’s view very far: as we commonly say, To make long discourses, or to be in suspense, as we have also translated it.”
