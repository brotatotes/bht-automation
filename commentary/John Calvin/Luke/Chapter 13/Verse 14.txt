<p><b>14.</b><i>There are six days.</i> This reprover does not venture to pass censure openly on Christ, but points the venom of his dislike to another quarter, and indirectly condemns Christ in the person of the multitude. What an astonishing display of furious malice! <i>Six days,</i> he tells them, were set apart for labor; but how incorrectly and foolishly does he define that <i>work,</i> which is not permitted but on <i>six days!</i> Why does he not likewise forbid them to enter the synagogue, lest they should violate the Sabbath? Why does he not order them to refrain from all the exercises of godliness? But granting that men are restrained from following their own employments on <i>the Sabbath-day,</i> how unreasonable is it that the grace of God should be limited in that manner! </p>
<p><i>On them, therefore, come and you shall be cured.</i> He bids them come on the other days to seek a <i>cure,</i> as if the power of God lay asleep <i>on Sabbath,</i> and were not rather exerted chiefly on that day for the salvation of his people. What purpose is to be served by the holy assemblies, except to give an opportunity to believers for entreating the Divine assistance? That ungodly <i>hypocrite</i> talks as if the lawful observation of <i>the Sabbath</i> interrupted the course of Godâ€™s favors, hindered men from calling upon him, and took away from them all feeling of his kindness. </p>
