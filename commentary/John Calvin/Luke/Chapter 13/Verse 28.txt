<p><b>28.</b><i>When you shall see Abraham</i> The Jews bore no resemblance to the holy fathers, and had no right to boast of being descended from them: yet nothing was more customary than to abuse the title of the Church. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(474)</sup></span> Christ here assures them, that a bastard race, which has departed from the faith and piety of the fathers, has “no inheritance in <i>the kingdom of God,”</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>.) There is a silent but implied reproof, that those who were desirous to have companions in seeking salvation, did not endeavor to associate themselves with <i>Abraham, and the prophets,</i> and the holy fathers, instead of looking around among their contemporaries, who had degenerated greatly from their example into innumerable corruptions. “If you neglect (says he) to <i>enter by the strait gate,</i> because you are kept back by the great number of those who are going astray, do you not see that you are separated from the number of believers, and become involved with unbelievers?” If the aspect of the world now dazzles your eyes, the last day will cure you of this folly, but it will be too late: for you shall then know that you, and others like you, are excluded from <i>the kingdom of God,</i> and have no part with <i>Abraham</i> </p>
