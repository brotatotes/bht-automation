<p><b>14.</b><i>And thou shalt be blessed.</i> Christ pronounces those to be <i>blessed</i> who exercise liberality without any expectation of earthly reward; for they manifestly look to God. Those who constantly keep in view their own advantage, or who are driven by the gale of popularity, have no right to expect a reward from God. </p>
