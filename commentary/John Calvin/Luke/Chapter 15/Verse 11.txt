<p>This parable is nothing else than a confirmation of the preceding doctrine. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(520)</sup></span> In the first part is shown how readily God is disposed to pardon our sins, and in the second part (which we shall afterwards treat in the proper place) is shown the great malignity and obstinacy of those who murmur at his compassion. In the person of a young prodigal who, after having been reduced to the deepest poverty by luxury and extravagance, returns as a suppliant to his father, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(521)</sup></span> to whom he had been disobedient and rebellious, Christ describes all sinners who, wearied of their folly, apply to the grace of God. To the kind father, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(522)</sup></span> on the other hand, who not only pardons the crimes of his son, but of his own accord meets him when returning, he compares God, who is not satisfied with pardoning those who pray to him, but even advances to meet them with the compassion of a father. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(523)</sup></span> Let us now examine the parable in detail. </p>
