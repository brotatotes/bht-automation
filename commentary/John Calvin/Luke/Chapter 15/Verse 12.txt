<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:12">Luke 15:12</span></b><b>.</b><i>And the younger of them said to his father.</i> The parable opens by describing a mark of wicked arrogance in the youth, which appears in his being desirous to leave his father, and in thinking that he cannot be right without being permitted to indulge in debauchery, free from his father’s control. There is also ingratitude in leaving the old man, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(524)</sup></span> and not only withholding the performance of the duties which be owed to him, but crippling and diminishing the wealth of his house. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(525)</sup></span> This is at length followed by wasteful luxury and wicked extravagance, by which he squanders all that he had. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(526)</sup></span> After so many offenses he deserved to find his father implacable. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(527)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Under this image our Lord unquestionably depicts to us the boundless goodness and inestimable forbearance of God, that no crimes, however aggravated, may deter us from the hope of obtaining pardon, There would be some foundation for the analogy, if we were to say that this foolish and insolent youth resembles those persons who, enjoying at the hand of God a great abundance of good things, are moved by a blind and mad ambition to be separated from Him, that they may enjoy perfect freedom; as if it were not more desirable than all the kingdoms of the world to live under the fatherly care and government of God. But as I am afraid that this allusion may be thought overstrained, I shall satisfy myself with the literal meaning; not that I disapprove of the opinion, that under this figure is reproved the madness of those who imagine that it will be advantageous for them to have something of their own, and to be rich apart from the heavenly Father; but that I now confine myself within the limits of a Commentator. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(528)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Christ here describes what usually happens with young men, when they are carried away by their natural disposition. Destitute of sound judgment, and maddened by passion, they are ill fitted for governing themselves, and are not restrained by fear or shame. It is therefore impossible but that they shall abandon themselves to every thing to which their sinful inclination prompts them, and rush on in a disgraceful course, till they are involved in shameful poverty. He afterwards describes the punishment which, in the righteous judgment of God, generally overtakes spendthrifts and prodigals. After having wickedly squandered their means, they are left to pine in hunger, and not having known how to use in moderation an abundant supply of the best bread, they are reduced to eat acorns and <i>husks</i>. In short, they become the companions of <i>swine</i>, and are made to feel that they are unworthy to partake of human food; for it is swinish gluttony <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(529)</sup></span> to squander wickedly what was given for the support of life. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(530)</sup></span> As to the ingenious exposition which some have brought forward, that it is the just punishment of wicked scorn, when those who have rejected delicious bread in the house of our heavenly Father are driven by hunger to eat <i>husks</i>, it is a true and useful doctrine; but in the meantime, we must bear in mind the difference that exists between allegories and the natural meaning. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(531)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>And was desirous to fill his belly.</i> This means that, in consequence of hunger, he no longer thought of his former luxuries, but greedily devoured <i>husks;</i> for of that kind of food he could not be in want, when he was giving it to the <i>swine</i> There is a well-known saying of Cyrus who, having for a long time suffered hunger during a flight, and having been slightly refreshed by eating coarse black bread, declared that he had never tasted savory bread till now; so the young man who is here mentioned was compelled by necessity to betake himself with appetite to <i>husks</i> The reason is added, <i>because no man gave to him;</i> for the copulative conjunction <i>and</i> ( <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καὶ</span></blu></grk>) must, in my opinion, signify <i>because</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(532)</sup></span> and what is here said does not refer to <i>husks</i>, which he had at hand, but I understand the meaning to be, that no man pitied his poverty; for prodigals who throw away the whole of their property are persons whom no man thinks himself bound to relieve, — nay more, as they have been accustomed to squander every thing, men think that nothing ought to be given to them. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(533)</sup></span> </p>
