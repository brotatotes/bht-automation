<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:16">Luke 16:16</span></b><b>.</b><i>The Law and the Prophets were till John</i> Our Lord had said that the earnestness of the people was a prelude to those things which <i>the Prophets</i> had foretold as to the future renovation of the Church. He now compares the ministry of John to <i>the Law and the Prophets</i> “It is not wonderful,” he tells us, “that God should now act so powerfully on the minds of men; for he is not as formerly, seen at a distance under dark shadows, but appears openly and at hand for the establishment of his kingdom.” Hence it follows, that those who obstinately reject <i>John’s</i> doctrine are less excusable than those who despised <i>the Law and the Prophets</i> </p>
