<p><b>22.</b><i>And it happened that the beggar died.</i> Christ here points out the vast change which death effected in the condition of the two men. Death was no doubt common to both; but to be after death <i>carried by angels into Abraham’s bosom</i> was a happiness more desirable than all the kingdoms of the world. On the other hand, to be sentenced to everlasting torments is a dreadful thing, for avoiding which a hundred lives, if it were possible, ought to be employed. In the person of <i>Lazarus</i> there is held out to us a striking proof that we ought not to pronounce men to be accursed by God, because they drag out, in incessant pain, a life which is full of distresses. In him the grace of God was so entirely hidden, and buried by the deformity and shame of the cross, that to the eye of the flesh nothing presented itself except the curse; and yet we see that in a body which was loathsome and full of rottenness there was lodged a soul unspeakably precious, which is <i>carried by angels</i> to a blessed life. It was no loss to him that he was forsaken, and despised, and destitute of every human comfort, when heavenly spirits deign to accompany him on his removal from the prison of the flesh. </p>
<p><i>And the rich man also died, and was buried.</i> In <i>the rich man</i> we see, as in a bright mirror, how undesirable is that temporal happiness which ends in everlasting destruction. It deserves our attention, that Christ expressly mentions the <i>burial of the rich man,</i> but says nothing of what was done to <i>Lazarus.</i> Not that his dead body was exposed to wild beasts, or lay in the open air, but because it was thrown carelessly, and without the slightest attention, into a ditch; for it may naturally be inferred from the corresponding clause, that no more attention was paid to him when he was dead than when he was alive. <i>The rich man,</i> on the other hand, buried magnificently according to his wealth, still retains some remnant of his former pride. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(308)</sup></span> In this respect, we see ungodly men striving, as it were, against nature, by affecting a pompous and splendid funeral for the sake of preserving their superiority after death; but their souls <i>in hell</i> attest the folly and mockery of this ambition. </p>
<p><i>And Lazarus was carried by angels.</i> When he says that <i>Lazarus was carried,</i> it is a figure of speech by which a part is taken for the whole; for the soul being the nobler part of man, properly takes the name of the whole man. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(309)</sup></span> This office is, not without reason, assigned by Christ to angels, who, we are aware, have been appointed to be <i>ministering spirits</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>) to believers, that they may devote their care and labor to their salvation. </p>
<p><i>Into Abraham’s bosom.</i> To detail the variety of speculations about <i>Abraham’s bosom,</i> in which many commentators of Scripture have indulged, is unnecessary, and, in my opinion, would serve no good purpose. It is quite enough that we receive what readers well acquainted with Scripture will acknowledge to be the natural meaning. As Abraham is called <i>the father</i> of believers, because to him was committed the covenant of eternal life, that he might first preserve it faithfully for his own children, and afterwards transmit it to all nations, and as all who are heirs of the same promise are called <i>his children;</i> so those who receive along with him the fruit of the same faith are said, after death, to be collected into his <i>bosom.</i> The metaphor is taken from a father <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(310)</sup></span>, in whose <i>bosom,</i> as it were, the children meet, when they all return home in the evening from the labors of the day. The children of God are scattered during their pilgrimage in this world; but as, in their present course, they follow the faith of their <i>father Abraham,</i> so they are received at death into that blessed rest, in which he awaits their arrival. It is not necessary to suppose that reference is made here to any one place; but the assemblage of which I have spoken is described, for the purpose of assuring believers, that they have not been fruitlessly employed in fighting for the faith under the banner of <i>Abraham,</i> for they enjoy the same habitation in heaven. </p>
<p>It will perhaps be asked, Is the same condition reserved after death for the godly of our own day, or did Christ, when he rose, open his <i>bosom</i> to admit <i>Abraham</i> himself, as well as all the godly? I reply briefly: As the grace of God is more clearly revealed to us in the Gospel, and as Christ himself, <i>the Sun of Righteousness,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:2">Malachi 4:2</span>,) has brought to us that salvation, which the fathers were formerly permitted to behold at a distance and under dark shadows, so there cannot be a doubt that believers, when they die, make a nearer approach to the enjoyment of the heavenly life. Still, it must be understood, that the glory of immortality is delayed till the last day of redemption. So far as relates to the word <i>bosom,</i> that quiet harbor at which believers arrive after the navigation of the present life, may be called either <i>Abraham’s bosom</i> or <i>Christ’s bosom;</i> but, as we have advanced farther than the fathers did under the Law, this distinction will be more properly expressed by saying, that the members of Christ are associated with their Head; and thus there will be an end of the metaphor about <i>Abraham’s bosom,</i> as the brightness of the sun, when he is risen, makes all the stars to disappear. From the mode of expression which Christ has here employed, we may, in the meantime, draw the inference, that the fathers under the Law embraced by faith, while they lived, that inheritance of the heavenly life into which they were admitted at death. </p>
