<p><b>27.</b><i>I beseech thee, father.</i> To bring the narrative into more full accordance with our modes of thinking, he describes <i>the rich man</i> as wishing that his brothers, who were still alive, should be warned by <i>Lazarus.</i> Here the Papists exercise their ingenuity very foolishly, by attempting to prove that the dead feel solicitude about the living. Any thing more ridiculous than this sophistry cannot be conceived; for with equal plausibility I might undertake to prove, that believing souls are not satisfied with the place assigned to them, and are actuated by a desire of removing from it to hell, were it not that they are prevented by <i>a vast gulf.</i> If no man holds such extravagant views, the Papists are not entitled to congratulate themselves on the other supposition. It is not my intention, however, to debate the point, or to defend either one side or another; but I thought it right to advert, in passing, to the futility of the arguments on which they rest their belief that the dead intercede with God on our behalf. I now return to the plain and natural meaning of this passage. </p>
