<p><b>10.</b><i>Two men went up.</i> Christ makes a comparison between the two men, both of whom, by <i>going up to pray,</i> seem to manifest the same ardor of piety, while yet they are exceedingly unlike. <i>The Pharisee,</i> possessing outward sanctity, approaches to God with a commendation which he pronounces on his whole life, and as if he had an undoubted right to offer the sacrifice of praise. <i>The publican,</i> on the other hand, as if he had been some outcast, and knew that he was unworthy to approach, presents himself with trembling and with humble confession. Christ affirms that <i>the Pharisee</i> was rejected, and that the prayers of <i>the publican</i> were acceptable to God. The reasons why the Pharisee was rejected are stated to be these two: <i>he trusted in himself that he was righteous, and despised others</i> </p>
