<p><b>12.</b><i>A certain nobleman. Matthew</i> interweaves this parable with others, without attending to the order of time; but, as his intention was, in the twenty-second chapter, to make a collection of Christ’s latest discourses, readers ought not to trouble themselves greatly with the inquiry which of them was delivered on the first, or the second, or the third day within that short period. But it is proper to observe the difference between <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke;</i> for, while the former touches only on one point, the latter embraces two. This point is common to both, that Christ resembles <i>a nobleman</i>, who, undertaking a <i>long journey</i> for the sake of <i>obtaining a kingdom</i>, has entrusted his <i>money</i> to the management of <i>his servants</i>, and so on. The other point is peculiar to Luke, that the subjects abused the absence of the prince, and raised a tumult in order to shake off his yoke. In both parts Christ intended to show, that the disciples were greatly mistaken in supposing that his royal authority was already established, and that he was coming <i>to Jerusalem</i>, in order to commence immediately a course of prosperity. Thus by taking away the expectation of an immediate <i>kin</i> g<i>dom</i>, he exhorts them to hope and patience; for he tells them that they must long and steadily endure many toils, before they enjoy that glory for which they pant too earnestly. </p>
<p><i>Into a distant country.</i> As the disciples thought that Christ was now about to enter into the possession of his kingdom, he first corrects this mistake by informing them, that he must undertake a<i>long journey</i>, in order <i>to obtain the kingdom</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(686)</sup></span> As to what is meant by the <i>distant country</i>, <i>I</i> leave it to the ingenious expositions of those who are fond of subtleties. For my own part, I think that Christ expresses nothing more than his long absence, which would extend from the time of his death to his last coming. For, though he sits at the right hand of the Father, and holds the government of heaven and earth, and though, from the time that he ascended to heaven, <i>all power was given to him</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span>,) <i>that every knee might bow before him</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+2:10">Philippians 2:10</span>;) yet as he has not yet subdued his enemies — has not yet appeared as Judge of the world, or revealed his majesty — it is not without propriety that he is said to be absent from his people, till he return again, clothed with his new sovereignty. It is true, indeed, that he now reigns, while he regenerates his people to the heavenly life, forms them anew to the image of God, and associates them with angels; while he governs the Church by his word, guards it by his protection, enriches it with the gifts of the Spirit, nourishes it by his grace, and maintains it by his power, and, in short, supplies it with all that is necessary for salvation; while he restrains the fury of Satan and of all the ungodly, and defeats all their schemes. But as this way of reigning is concealed from the flesh, his manifestation is properly said to be delayed till the last day. Since, therefore, the apostles foolishly aimed at the shadow of a kingdom, our Lord declares that he must go to seek a <i>distant</i> kingdom, that, they may learn to endure delay. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(687)</sup></span> </p>
