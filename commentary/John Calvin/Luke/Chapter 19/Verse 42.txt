<p><b>42.</b><i>O if even thou hadst known!</i> The discourse is pathetic, and therefore abrupt; for we know that by those who are under the influence of vehement passion their feelings are not more than half-expressed. Besides, two feelings are here mingled; for not only does Christ bewail the destruction of the city, but he likewise reproaches the ungrateful people with the deepest guilt, in rejecting the salvation which was offered to them, and drawing down on themselves a dreadful judgment of God. The word <i>even</i>, which is interwoven with it, is emphatic; for Christ silently contrasts Jerusalem with the other cities of Judea, or rather, of the whole world, and the meaning is: “If Even <i>thou</i>, who art distinguished by a remarkable privilege above the whole world, — if <i>thou at least,</i> (I say,) who art a heavenly sanctuary in the earth, <i>hadst known ”</i> This is immediately followed by another amplification taken from the time: “Though hitherto thou hast wickedly and outrageously rebelled against God, <i>now at least</i> there is time for repentance.” For he means that the day is now at hand, which had been appointed by the eternal purpose of God for the salvation of Jerusalem, and had been foretold by the prophets. <i>Thus</i> (says Isaiah) <i>is the accepted time</i>, <i>this is the day of salvation</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:8">Isaiah 49:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:2">2 Corinthians 6:2</span>.) </p>
<p>Seek the Lord while he may be found; call upon him while he is near, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:6">Isaiah 55:6</span>.) </p>
<p><i>The things which belong to thy peace</i> Under the word <i>peace</i> he includes, according to the meaning of the Hebrew phrase, all that is essential to happiness. Nor does he simply say, that Jerusalem did not <i>know her peace, but the things which belonged to her peace;</i> for it frequently happens that men are far from being unacquainted with their happiness, but they are ignorant of the way and means, (as we say,) because they are blinded by their wickedness. Now since the compassion is mingled with reproach, let us observe, that men deserve the heavier punishment in proportion to the excellence of the gifts which they have received, because to other sins there is added an impious profanation of heavenly grace. Secondly, let us observe, that the nearer God approaches to us, and holds out the light of sound doctrine, the less excusable are we, if we neglect this opportunity. The gate of salvation, indeed, is always open; but as God is sometimes silent, it is no ordinary privilege, when He invites us to himself with a loud voice, and in a familiar manner, and therefore the contempt will be visited by severer punishment. </p>
<p><i>But now they are hid from thy eyes.</i> This is not said for the purpose of extenuating the guilt of Jerusalem; for, on the contrary, it marks with disgrace the monstrous stupidity of that city, that, when God is present, it does not perceive him. I do acknowledge that it belongs to God alone to open the eyes of the blind, and that no man is qualified for understanding the mysteries of the heavenly kingdom, unless God enlighten him inwardly by his Spirit; but it does not follow from this that they who perish through their own brutal blindness are excusable. Christ intended also to remove an offense, which might otherwise have perplexed the ignorant and weak; for when the eyes of all were directed to that city, his example might have very great influence in both respects, either for evil or for good. That no man then may be perplexed by its unbelief and proud contempt of the Gospel, <i>Jerusalem</i> is condemned for disgraceful blindness. </p>
