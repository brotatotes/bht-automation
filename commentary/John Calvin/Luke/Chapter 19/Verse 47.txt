<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:47">Luke 19:47</span></b><b>.</b><i>And he taught daily in the temple.</i> Mark and Luke point out, <i>first,</i> what was the class of men of which the Church consisted, namely, of the despised multitude; and again, what enemies Christ had, namely, <i>the priests and scribes,</i> and all the <i>rulers.</i> Now this is a part of the folly of the cross, that God, passing by the excellence of the world, chooses what is foolish, weak, and despised. <i>Secondly,</i> they relate that those worthy guardians of the Church of God sought an occasion of putting Christ to death, by which their wicked impiety was discovered; for though there had been good grounds for pursuing Christ, yet they had no right to proceed to murder after the manner of robbers, or secretly to hire assassins. <i>Thirdly,</i> they show that the wicked conspiracy of those men was frustrated, because, by the secret purpose of God, Christ was appointed to the death of the cross. </p>
