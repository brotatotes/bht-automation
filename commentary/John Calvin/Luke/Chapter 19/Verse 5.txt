<p><b>5.</b><i>Zaccheus, make haste, and come down.</i> It is a remarkable instance of favor, that the Lord anticipates <i>Zaccheus</i>, and does not wait for his invitation, but of his own accord asks lodging at his house. We know how hateful, nay, how detestable the name of <i>publican</i> at that time was; and we shall find that this is shortly afterwards mentioned by Luke. It is therefore astonishing kindness in the Son of God to approach a man, from whom the great body of men recoil, and that before he is requested to do so. But we need not wonder, if he bestows this honor on one who was already drawn to him by a secret movement of the Spirit; for it was a more valuable gift to dwell in his heart than to enter his house. But by this expression he made it evident, that he is never sought in vain by those who sincerely desire to know him; for <i>Zaccheus</i> obtained vastly more than he had expected. Besides, the great readiness of <i>Zaccheus</i> to obey, his <i>hastening to come down</i> from the tree, and his <i>joy</i> in <i>receiving</i> Christ, exhibit still more clearly the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit; for, though he did not yet possess a pure faith, yet this submissiveness and obedience must be regarded as the beginning of faith. </p>
