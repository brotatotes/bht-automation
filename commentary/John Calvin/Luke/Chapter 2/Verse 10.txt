<p><b>10.</b><i>Fear not</i> The design of this exhortation is to alleviate their fear. For, though it is profitable for the minds of men to be struck with awe, that they may learn to “give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+29:2">Psalms 29:2</span>;) yet they have need, at the same time, of consolation, that they may not be altogether overwhelmed. For the majesty of God could not but swallow up the whole world, if there were not some mildness to mitigate the terror which it brings. And so the reprobate fall down lifeless at the sight of God, because he appears to them in no other character than that of a judge. But to revive the minds of the shepherds, the angel declares that he was sent to them for a different purpose, to <i>announce to them</i> the mercy of God. When men hear this single word, that God is reconciled to them, it not only raises up those who are fallen down, but restores those who were ruined, and recalls them from death to life. </p>
<p>The angel opens his discourse by saying, that he <i>announces great joy;</i> and next assigns the ground or matter of joy, that <i>a Savior is born</i> These words show us, first, that, until men have peace with God, and are reconciled to him through the grace of Christ, all the joy that they experience is deceitful, and of short duration. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(147)</sup></span> Ungodly men frequently indulge in frantic and intoxicating mirth; but if there be none to make peace between them and God, the hidden stings of conscience must produce fearful torment. Besides, to whatever extent they may flatter themselves in luxurious indulgence, their own lusts are so many tormentors. The commencement of solid joy is, to perceive the fatherly love of God toward us, which alone gives tranquillity to our minds. And this “joy,” in which, Paul tells us, “the kingdom of God” consists, is “in the Holy Spirit,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>.) By calling it <i>great joy,</i> he shows us, not only that we ought, above all things, to rejoice in the salvation brought us by Christ, but that this blessing is so great and boundless, as fully to compensate for all the pains, distresses, and anxieties of the present life. Let us learn to be so delighted with Christ alone, that the perception of his grace may overcome, and at length remove from us, all the distresses of the flesh. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(148)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>Which shall be to all the people</i> Though the angel addresses the shepherds alone, yet he plainly states, that the message of salvation which he brings is of wider extent, so that not only they, in their private capacity, may hear it, but that others may also hear. Now let it be understood, that this joy was common to all people, because, it was indiscriminately offered to all. For God had promised Christ, not to one person or to another, but to the whole seed of Abraham. If the Jews were deprived, for the most part, of the joy that was offered to them, it arose from their unbelief; just as, at the present day, God invites all indiscriminately to salvation through the Gospel, but the ingratitude of the world is the reason why this grace, which is equally offered to all, is enjoyed by few. Although this joy is confined to a few persons, yet, with respect to God, it is said to be common. When the angel says that this <i>joy shall be to all the people,</i> he speaks of the chosen people only; but now that, the middle wall of partition” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:14">Ephesians 2:14</span>) has been thrown down, the same message has reference to the whole human race. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(149)</sup></span> For Christ proclaims peace, not only, to them that are nigh, “but to them that are, far off,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:17">Ephesians 2:17</span>,) to “strangers” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12">Ephesians 2:12</span>) equally with citizens. But as the peculiar covenant with the Jews lasted till the resurrection of Christ, so the angel separates them from the rest of the nations. </p>
