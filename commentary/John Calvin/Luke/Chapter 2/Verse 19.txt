<p><b>19.</b><i>Now Mary kept</i> Mary’s diligence in contemplating the works of God is laid before us for two reasons; first, to inform us, that this treasure was laid up in her heart, for the purpose of being published to others at the proper time; and, secondly, to afford to all the godly an example for imitation. For, if we are wise, it will be the chief employment, and the great object of our life, to consider with attention those works of God which build up our faith. <i>Mary kept all these things</i> This relates to her memory. <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Συμβάλλειν</span></blu></grk> signifies <i>to throw together</i>, — to collect the several events which agreed in proving the glory of Christ, so that they might form one body. For Mary could not wisely estimate the collective value of all those occurrences, except by comparing them with each other. </p>
