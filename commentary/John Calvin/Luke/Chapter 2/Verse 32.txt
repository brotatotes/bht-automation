<p><b>32.</b><i>A light for the revelation of the Gentiles</i> Simeon now points out the purpose for which Christ was to be exhibited by the Father before all nations. It was that he might <i>enlighten the Gentiles,</i> who had been formerly in darkness, and might be <i>the glory of his people Israel</i> There is propriety in the distinction here made between the <i>people Israel</i> and the <i>Gentiles:</i> for by the right of adoption the children of Abraham “were nigh” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:17">Ephesians 2:17</span>) to God, while the <i>Gentiles,</i> with whom God had made no “covenants of promise,” were “strangers” to the Church, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12">Ephesians 2:12</span>.) For this reason, <i>Israel</i> is called, in other passages, not only the son of God, but his<i>first-born,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:9">Jeremiah 31:9</span>;) and Paul informs us, that “Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:8">Romans 15:8</span>.) The preference given to <i>Israel</i> above the Gentiles is, that all without distinction may obtain salvation in Christ. </p>
<p><i>A light for revelation</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(198)</sup></span> means <i>for enlightening the Gentiles</i> Hence we infer, that men are by nature destitute of light, till Christ, “the Sun of Righteousness,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:2">Malachi 4:2</span>,) shine upon them. With regard to <i>Israel,</i> though God had bestowed upon him distinguished honor, yet all his glory rests on this single article, that a Redeemer had been promised to him. </p>
