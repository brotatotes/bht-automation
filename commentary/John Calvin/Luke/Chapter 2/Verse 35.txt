<p><b>35.</b><i>But also a sword shall pierce thy own soul</i> This warning must have contributed greatly to fortify the mind of the holy virgin, and to prevent her from being overwhelmed with grief, when she came to those distressing struggles, which she had to undergo. Though her faith was agitated and tormented by various temptations, yet her sorest battle was with the cross: for Christ might appear to be utterly destroyed. She was not overwhelmed with grief; but it would have required a heart of stone not to be deeply wounded: for the patience of the saints differs widely from stupidity. </p>
<p><i>That the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed</i> There are some who connect this clause with a part of the former verse, that Christ is <i>set for the ruin and for the resurrection of many in Israel;</i> and who include in a parenthesis what we have just now explained about the <i>sword:</i> but it is better, I think, to refer it to the whole passage. The particle <i>that,</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὅπως ἄν</span></blu></grk>, in this passage, does not strictly denote a cause, but merely a consequence. When the light of the Gospel arises, and persecutions immediately spring up, there is, at the same time, a disclosure of affections of the heart, which had been hitherto concealed: for the lurking-places of human dissimulation are so deep, that they easily remain hidden till Christ comes. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(202)</sup></span> But Christ, by his light, discloses every artifice, and unmasks hypocrisy; and to him is properly ascribed the office of laying open the secrets of the heart. But when the cross is added to doctrine it tries the hearts more to the quick. For those who have embraced Christ by outward profession, often shrink from bearing the cross, and, when they see the Church exposed to numerous calamities, easily desert their post. </p>
