<p><b>36.</b><i>And there was Anna, a prophetess</i> Luke mentions not more than two persons who received Christ; and this is intended to teach us, that whatever belongs to God, however small it may <i>be,</i> ought to be preferred by us to the whole world. The scribes and priests, no doubt, were then surrounded by great splendor; but, as the Spirit of God, whose <i>presence</i> was not at all enjoyed by those rulers, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(203)</sup></span> dwelt in <i>Simeon</i> and <i>Anna,</i> those two persons are entitled to greater reverence than an immense multitude of those whose pride is swelled by nothing but empty titles. For this reason, the historian mentions Anna’s <i>age,</i> gives her the designation of <i>prophetess,</i> and, thirdly, bears a remarkable testimony to her piety, and to the holiness and chastity of her life. These are the qualities that justly give to men weight and estimation. And certainly none are led astray by the dazzling and empty magnificence of outward show, but those who are drawn, by the vanity of their own minds, to take pleasure in being deceived. </p>
<p><i>She had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity</i> This is intended to inform us, that she was a widow in the very prime of life. She had married young, and shortly afterwards lost her husband; and the circumstance of her not entering into a second marriage while she was in the rigor of her bodily frame, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(204)</sup></span> is mentioned with the view of heightening the commendation of her chastity. What follows, that <i>she was a widow of about eighty-four years,</i> may be explained in two ways. Either that time had passed in her unmarried state, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(205)</sup></span> or it was the whole period of her life. If you reckon the <i>eighty-four years</i> as the time of her widowhood, it will follow that she was more than a hundred years old: but I leave that matter doubtful. The Spirit of prophecy still shone in a very few, who served as tokens to attest the doctrine of the Law and the Jewish religion, till the coming of Christ. In a state of society so dissolute, the elect of God needed such aids to prevent them from being carried away. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(203)</span> The word <i>rulers (</i> <blu><i>principes</i></blu> <i>)</i> appears to be here used sarcastically; for his own translation is,” <blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">duquel estoyent du tout destituez les autres, combien que ce fussent les gouverneurs</span></blu>;” — “of which the others were entirely destitute, though they were rulers.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(204)</span> “<blu>Quum adhuc vegeto esset corpore</blu>.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(205)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Il y avoit tant de temps que son mari estoit mort</span></blu>;” — “it was so long since her husband died.” </p>
