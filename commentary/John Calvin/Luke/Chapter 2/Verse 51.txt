<p><b>51.</b><i>And he was subject to them</i> It was for our salvation that Christ took upon him this low estate, — that the Lord and head of angels voluntarily became <i>subject to</i> mortal creatures. Such was the purpose of God, that Christ should remain, for some time, under a shadow, beating the name of Joseph. Though this subjection, on the part of Christ, arose from no necessity which he could not have avoided, yet, as he had taken upon him human nature on the condition of being subject to parents, and had assumed the character both of a man and of a servant, — with respect to the office of Redeemer, this was his lawful condition. The more cheerfully, on this account, ought every one to bear the yoke which the Lord has been pleased to lay upon him. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(242)</sup></span> </p>
