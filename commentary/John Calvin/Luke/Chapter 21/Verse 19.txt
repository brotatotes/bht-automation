<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:19">Luke 21:19</span></b><b>.</b><i>In your patience.</i> Here Christ enjoins on his followers a different method of defending their life from what is dictated by carnal reason. For naturally every man desires to place his life in safety; we collect from every quarter those aids which we think will be best, and avoid all danger; and, in short, we do not think that we are alive, if we are not properly defended. But Christ prescribes to us this defense of our life, that we should be always exposed to death, and walk </p>
<p>through fire, and water, and sword, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+66:12">Psalms 66:12</span>.) </p>
<p>And, indeed, no man will commit his soul into the hands of God in a right manner, unless he have learned to live from day to day constantly prepared to die. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(132)</sup></span> In a word, Christ orders us <i>to possess our life</i> both under the cross, and amidst the constant terrors of death. </p>
