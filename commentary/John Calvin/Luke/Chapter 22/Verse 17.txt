<p>As Luke mentions that <i>the cup</i> was twice presented by Christ, we must inquire, in the first place, if it be a repetition, (as the Evangelists are wont frequently to say the same thing twice,) or if Christ, after having tasted the cup, repeated the same thing a second time. This latter conjecture appears to me to be probable; for we know that the holy fathers, during sacrifices, observed the solemn rite of tasting the cup; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(188)</sup></span> and hence those words of the Psalmist, </p>
<p>I will take the cup of salvation,<br>and will call on the name of the Lord, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+116:13">Psalms 116:13</span>.) </br></p>
<p>I have no doubt, therefore, that Christ, according to the ancient custom, tasted <i>the cup</i> in the holy feast, which otherwise could not have been correctly observed; and Luke expressly mentions this, before coming to give an account of the new mystery, which was a totally different institution from the paschal lamb. It was in compliance also with received and ordinary custom, that he is expressly said to have <i>given thanks,</i> after having <i>taken the cup.</i> For at the commencement of the supper, I have no doubt, he prayed, as he was accustomed never to sit down at table without calling on God; but now he wished to discharge once more the same duty, that he might not leave out a ceremony which, I have just now shown, was connected with the sacred act of <i>taking the cup</i> and tasting it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(189)</sup></span> </p>
