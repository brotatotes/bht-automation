<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:28">Luke 22:28</span></b><b>.</b><i>You are they who have continued with me.</i> Although Luke appears to relate a different discourse of Christ, and one which was delivered at a different time, yet I have no doubt that it refers to the same time. For it is not a continued discourse of Christ that is here related, but detached sentences, without any regard to the order of time, as we shall shortly afterwards have occasion to state. But he employs more words than Matthew; for he declares that, as the apostles had accompanied him, and had <i>remained steadfastly in his temptations,</i> they would also be partakers of his glory. It is asked, in what sense does he call them <i>his temptations?</i> I think that he means the contests by which God tried him and the apostles in common. And properly did he use the word <i>temptations;</i> for, according to the feeling of human nature, his faith and patience were actually tried. </p>
