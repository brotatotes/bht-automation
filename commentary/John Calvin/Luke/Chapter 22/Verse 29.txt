<p><b>29.</b><i>And I appoint to you the kingdom.</i> Here he makes them not only judges, but <i>kings;</i> for he shares with them <i>the kingdom</i> which he received from <i>the Father</i> There is an emphasis in the word <i>appoint</i>, that they may not, by warmth and vehemence of desire, hasten too eagerly to possess <i>the kingdom</i> of which he alone has the lawful right to dispose. By his own example, also, he exhorts them to patience; for, though he was ordained by <i>the Father</i> to be a King, yet he was not immediately raised to his glory, but even <i>emptied Himself</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>,) and by the ignominy of the cross obtained kingly honor. To <i>eat and drink at his table</i> is put metaphorically for being made partakers of the same glory. </p>
