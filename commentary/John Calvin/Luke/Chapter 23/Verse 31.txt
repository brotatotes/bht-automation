<p><b>31.</b><i>If they do these things in the green tree.</i> By this sentence Christ confirms what he had stated, that his death will not remain unpunished, and that the Jews, whose iniquity is ripe, or rather half-rotten, will not remain long in their present condition; and by a familiar comparison, he proves it to be impossible but that the fire of the divine wrath shall immediately kindle and devour them. We know that <i>dry</i> wood is wont to be first thrown into the fire; but if what is moist and <i>green</i> be burnt, much less shall <i>the dry</i> be ultimately spared. The phrase, <i>if they do,</i> may be taken indefinitely for <i>if it be done</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(266)</sup></span> and the meaning will be: <i>“If green</i> wood is thrown into the fire before the time, what, think you, shall become of what is <i>dry</i> and old?” But some perhaps will prefer to view it as a comparison of men with God, as if Christ had said: “Wicked men, who resemble <i>dry</i> wood, when they have basely murdered the righteous, will find that their time is prepared by God. For how could they who are already devoted to destruction escape the hand of the heavenly Judge, who grants them so much liberty for a time against the good and innocent?” </p>
<p>Whether you choose to interpret it in the one or the other of these ways, the general meaning is, that the <i>lamentation of the women</i> is foolish, if they do not likewise expect and dread the awful judgment of God which hangs over the wicked. And whenever our distress of mind, arising from the bitterness of the cross, goes to excess, it is proper to soothe it by this consolation, that God, who now permits his own people to be unjustly oppressed, will not ultimately allow the wicked to escape punishment. If we were not sustained by this hope, we must unavoidably sink under our afflictions. Though it be the natural and more frequent practice to make a fire of <i>dry</i> wood rather than of <i>green</i> wood, yet God pursues a different order; for, while he allows tranquillity and ease to the reprobate, he trains his own people by a variety of afflictions, and therefore their condition is more wretched than that of others, if we judge of it from the present appearance. But this is an appropriate remedy, if we patiently look for the whole course of the judgment of God; for thus we shall perceive that the wicked gain nothing by a little delay; for when God shall have humbled his faithful servants by fatherly chastisements, he will rise with a drawn sword against those whose sins he appeared for a time not to observe. </p>
