<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:4">Luke 23:4</span></b><b>.</b><i>And Pilate said to the chief priests and scribes.</i> As Christ was come to bear the punishment of our sins, it was proper that he should first be condemned by the mouth of his judge, that it might afterwards be evident that he was condemned for the sake of others, and not for his own. But as Pilate, from a dread of exciting a tumult, did not venture absolutely to acquit him, he willingly availed himself of the opportunity which presented itself, of submitting him to <i>the jurisdiction of Herod.</i> This <i>Herod</i> was he who bears the surname of Antipas to whom was left the tetrarchy of Galilee, when Archelaus was a prisoner at Vienna, and when Judea had been annexed to the province of Syria. Now though we shall shortly afterwards find Luke relating that this mark of respect pacified <i>Herod,</i> who had formerly been enraged against <i>Pilate,</i> still his design was not so much to obtain <i>Herodâ€™s</i> favor, as to get quit of a disagreeable affair under an honorable excuse, and thus to avoid the necessity of condemning Christ. </p>
