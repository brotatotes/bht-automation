<p><b>40.</b><i>And the other answering.</i> In this wicked man a striking mirror of the unexpected and incredible grace of God is held out to us, not only in his being suddenly changed into a new man, when he was near death, and drawn from hell itself to heaven, but likewise in having obtained in a moment the forgiveness of all the sins in which he had been plunged through his whole life, and in having been thus admitted to heaven before the apostles and first-fruits of the new Church. First, then, a remarkable instance of the grace of God shines in the conversion of that man. For it was not by the natural movement of the flesh that he laid aside his fierce cruelty and proud contempt of God, so as to repent immediately, but he was subdued by the hand of God; as the whole of Scripture shows that repentance is His work. And so much the more excellent is this grace, that it came beyond the expectation of all. For who would ever have thought that a <i>robber,</i> in the very article of death, would become not only a devout worshiper of God, but a distinguished teacher of faith and piety to the whole world, so that we too must receive from his mouth the rule of a true and proper confession? Now the first proof which he gave of his repentance was, that he severely reproved and restrained the wicked forwardness of his companion. He then added a second, by humbling himself in open acknowledgment of his crimes, and ascribing to Christ the praise due to his righteousness. Thirdly, he displayed astonishing faith by committing himself and his salvation to the protection of Christ, while he saw him hanging on the cross and near death. </p>
<p><i>Dost not thou fear God?</i> Though these words are tortured in various ways by commentators, yet the natural meaning of them appears to me to be, What is the meaning of this, that even this <i>condemnation</i> does not compel thee <i>to fear God?</i> For the <i>robber</i> represents it as an additional proof of the hard-heartedness of his companion, that when reduced to the lowest straits, he does not even now begin <i>to fear God.</i> But to remove all ambiguity, it is proper to inform the reader that an impudent and detestable blasphemer, who thought that he might safely indulge in ridicule, is summoned to the judgment-seat of God; for though he had remained all his life unmoved, he ought to have trembled when he saw that the hand of God was armed against him, and that he must soon render an account of all his crimes; It was, therefore, a proof of desperate and diabolical obstinacy, that while God held him bound by the final judgment, he did not even then return to a sound mind; for if there had been the smallest particle of godliness in the heart of that man, he would at least have been constrained to yield to <i>the fear of God.</i> We now perceive the general meaning of his words, that those men, in whom even punishments do not produce amendment, are desperate, and totally destitute of <i>the fear of God.</i> </p>
<p>I interpret the words <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐν τῶ αὐτῷ κρίματι</span></blu></grk> to mean not <i>in the same condemnation,</i> but <i>during the condemnation itself;</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(275)</sup></span> as if the <i>robber</i> had said, Since thou art even now in the jaws of death, thou oughtest to be aroused to acknowledge God as thy Judge. Hence, too<i>,</i> we draw a useful doctrine, that those whom punishments do not train to humility do altogether resist God; for they who possess any <i>fear of God</i> must necessarily be overwhelmed with shame, and struck silent. </p>
