<p><b>19.</b><i>Powerful in deed and in word.</i> Luke has employed nearly the same form of expression in reference to the person of Stephen, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:22">Acts 7:22</span>,) where he says of Moses, by way of commendation, that he was <i>powerful in words and in actions.</i> But in this passage it is uncertain if it is on account of miracles that Christ is said to be powerful in actions, (as if it had been said that he was endued with divine virtues which proved that he was sent from heaven;) or if the phrase is more extensive, and means that he excelled both in ability to teach, and in holiness of life and other remarkable endowments. I prefer the latter of these views. </p>
<p><i>Before God and all the people.</i> The addition of these words ought not to be reckoned superfluous; for they mean that the high excellence of Christ was so well known, and was demonstrated by such undoubted proofs, that he had no hypocrisy or vain ostentation. And hence we may obtain a brief definition of a true <i>Prophet,</i> namely, that to what he speaks he will likewise add <i>power in actions,</i> and will not only endeavor to appear excellent before men, but to act with sincerity as under the eyes of God. </p>
