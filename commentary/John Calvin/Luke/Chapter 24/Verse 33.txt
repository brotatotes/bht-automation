<p><b>33.</b><i>And they arose in the same hour.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(320)</sup></span> The circumstance of the time, and the distance of the places, show with what ardor those two men turned to convey the intelligence to their fellow-disciples. As they entered a lodging towards evening, it is probable that the Lord had not made himself known to them before night came on. To perform a journey of three hours in the dead of night was exceedingly inconvenient; yet they rise that very instant, and return in haste to Jerusalem. And, indeed, if they had only gone thither next day, their tardiness might have exposed them to suspicion; but as they chose rather to deprive themselves of the repose of the night than to allow the slightest delay in making the apostles partakers of their joy, the very haste gave additional credit to their narrative. Now whenLuke says that <i>they arose in the same hour,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(321)</sup></span> it is probable that they came <i>to the disciples</i> about midnight. But, according to the testimony of the same Luke, <i>the disciples</i> were at that time conversing together; and hence we learn their anxiety, and industry, and ardor, in spending almost the whole night without sleep, and unceasingly making inquiries at each other, until the resurrection of Christ was ascertained by a multitude of testimonies. </p>
