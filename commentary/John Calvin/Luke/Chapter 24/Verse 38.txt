<p><b>38.</b><i>Why are you troubled?</i> By these words they are exhorted to lay aside terror, and regain the possession of their minds, that, having returned to the rigor of their senses, they may judge of a matter which is fully ascertained; for so long as men are seized with perturbation, they are blind amidst the clearest light. In order, therefore, that the disciples may obtain undoubted information, they are enjoined to weigh the matter with calmness and composure. </p>
<p><i>And why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</i> In this second clause, Christ reproves another fault, which is, that by the variety of their <i>thoughts</i> they throw difficulties in their own way. By saying that <i>thoughts arise,</i> he means that the knowledge of the truth is choked in them in such a manner, that <i>seeing they do not see,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:14">Matthew 13:14</span>;) for they do not restrain their wicked imaginations, but, on the contrary, by giving them free scope, they permit them to gain the superiority. And certainly we find it to be too true, that as, when the sky has been clear in the morning, clouds afterwards arise to darken the clear light of the sun; so when we allow our reasonings to arise with excessive freedom in opposition to the word of God, what formerly appeared clear to us is withdrawn from our eyes. We have a right, indeed, when any appearance of absurdity presents itself, to inquire by weighing the arguments on both sides; and, indeed, so long as matters are doubtful, our minds must inevitably be driven about in every direction: but we must observe sobriety and moderation, lest the flesh exalt itself more highly than it ought, and throw out its thoughts far and wide against heaven. </p>
