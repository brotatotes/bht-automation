<p><b>44.</b><i>These are the words.</i> Though it will afterwards appear from Matthew and Mark that a discourse similar to this was delivered in Galilee, yet I think it probable that Luke now relates what happened on the day after his resurrection. For what John says of that day, that <i>he breathed on them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:22">John 20:22</span>) agrees with the words of Luke which here immediately follow, that <i>he opened their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures.</i> By these words Christ indirectly reproves their gross and shameful forgetfulness, that, though they had long ago been fully informed of his future resurrection, they were as much astonished as if it had never been mentioned to them. The import of his words is: “Why do you hesitate as if this had been a new and unexpected occurrence, while it is only what I frequently predicted to you? Why do you not rather remember my words? For if hitherto you have reckoned me worthy of credit, this ought to have been known to you from my instructions before it happened.” In short, Christ tacitly complains that his labor has been thrown away on the apostles, since his instruction has been forgotten. </p>
<p><i>All things which are written concerning me.</i> He now rebukes them more sharply for their slowness, by declaring that he brought forward nothing that was new but that he only reminded them of what had been declared by <i>the Law and the Prophets,</i> with which they ought to have been familiar from their childhood. But though they had been ignorant of the whole doctrine of religion, nothing could have been more unreasonable than not to embrace readily what they knew to have undoubtedly proceeded from God; for it was a principle admitted by the whole nation, that there was no religion but what was contained in <i>the Law and the Prophets.</i> The present division of the Scriptures is more copious than what we find in other passages; for besides <i>the Law and the Prophets,</i> he adds, in the third place, <i>the Psalms,</i> which, though they might with propriety have been reckoned among <i>the Prophets,</i> have, something distinct and peculiar to themselves. Yet the division into two par which we have seen elsewhere, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:16">Luke 16:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:45">John 1:45</span>,) embraces notwithstanding the whole of Scripture. </p>
