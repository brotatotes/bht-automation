<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:50">Luke 24:50</span></b><b>.</b><i>And lifted up his hands, and blessed them;</i> by which he showed that the office of <i>blessing,</i> which was enjoined on the priests under the law, belonged truly and properly to himself. When men <i>bless</i> one another it is nothing else than praying in behalf of their brethren; but with God it is otherwise, for he does not merely befriend us by wishes, but by a simple act of his will grants what is desirable for us. But while He is the only Author of all blessing, yet that men might obtain a familiar view of his grace, he chose that at first the priests should <i>bless</i> in his name as mediators. Thus Melchizedek <i>blessed</i> Abraham, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:19">Genesis 14:19</span>,) and in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:23">Numbers 6:23</span>, a perpetual law is laid down in reference to this matter. To this purport also is what we read in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:26">Psalms 118:26</span>, We <i>bless you out of the house of the Lord</i> In short, the apostle has told us that <i>to bless</i> others is a Mark of superiority; for <i>the less,</i> he says, <i>is blessed by the greater,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:7">Hebrews 7:7</span>.) Now when Christ, the true <i>Melchizedek</i> and eternal Priest, was manifested, it was necessary that in him should be fulfilled what had been shadowed out by the figures of the law; as Paul also shows that we are <i>blessed</i> in him by God the Father, that we may be rich in all heavenly blessings, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span>.) Openly and solemnly he once <i>blessed</i> the apostles, that believers may go direct to himself, if they desire to be partakers of his grace. In <i>the lifting up of the hands</i> is described an ancient ceremony which, we know:, was formerly used by the priests. </p>
