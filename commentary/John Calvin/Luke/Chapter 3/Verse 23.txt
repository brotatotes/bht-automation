<p>This was also the reason why he delayed his baptism till <i>the thirtieth year of his age,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:23">Luke 3:23</span>.) Baptism was an appendage to the Gospel: and therefore it began at the same time with the preaching of the Gospel. When Christ was preparing to preach the Gospel, he was introduced by Baptism into his office; and at the same time was endued with the Holy Spirit. When John beholds the Holy Spirit descending upon Christ, it is to remind him, that nothing carnal or earthly must be expected in Christ, but that he comes as a godlike man, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(297)</sup></span> descended from heaven, in whom the power of the Holy Spirit reigns. We know, indeed, that he is <i>God manifested in the flesh,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>:) but even in his character as a servant, and in his human nature, there is a heavenly power to be considered. </p>
<p>The <i>second</i> question is, why did the Holy Spirit appear in the shape of a <i>dove,</i> rather than in that of <i>fire</i> ? The answer depends on the analogy, or resemblance between the figure and the thing represented. We know what the prophet Isaiah ascribes to Christ. </p>
<p>“He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:2">Isaiah 42:2</span>.) </p>
<p>On account of this mildness of Christ, by which he kindly and gently called, and every day invites, sinners to the hope of salvation, <i>the Holy Spirit descended upon him in the appearance of a dove</i> And in this symbol has been held out to us an eminent token of the sweetest consolation, that we may not fear to approach to Christ, who meets us, not in the formidable power of the Spirit, but clothed with gentle and lovely grace. </p>
<p><i>He saw the Spirit of God</i> That is, John <i>saw:</i> for it immediately follows, that <i>the Spirit descended on Christ</i> There now arises a <i>third</i> question, how could John see the Holy Spirit? I reply: As the Spirit of God is everywhere present, and fills heaven and earth, he is not said, in a literal sense, to <i>descend,</i> and the same observation may be made as to his <i>appearance.</i> Though he is in himself invisible, yet he is spoken of as <i>beheld,</i> when he exhibits any visible sign of his presence. John did not see the essence of the Spirit, which cannot be discerned by the senses of men; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(298)</sup></span> nor did he see his power, which is not beheld by human senses, but only by the understanding of faith: but he saw <i>the appearance of a dove,</i> under which God showed the presence of his Spirit. It is a figure of speech, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(299)</sup></span> by which the sign is put for the thing signified, the name of a spiritual object being applied to the visible sign. </p>
<p>While it is foolish and improper to press, as some do, the literal meaning, so as to include both the sign and the thing signified, we must observe, that the connection subsisting between the sign and the thing signified is denoted by these modes of expression. In this sense, the bread of the Lord’s Supper is called <i>the body of Christ,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:16">1 Corinthians 10:16</span>:) not because it is so, but because it assures us, that the body of Christ is truly given to us for food. Meanwhile, let us bear in mind what I have just mentioned, that we must not imagine a descent of the thing signified, so as to seek it in the sign, as if it had a bodily place there, but ought to be abundantly satisfied with the assurance, that God grants, by his secret power, all that he holds out to us by figures. </p>
<p>Another question more curious than useful has been put. Was this <i>dove</i> a solid body, or the appearance of one? Though the words of Luke seem to intimate that it was not the substance of a body, but only <i>a bodily appearance;</i> yet, lest I should afford to any man an occasion of wrangling, I leave the matter unsettled. </p>
