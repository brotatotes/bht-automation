<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:6">Luke 3:6</span></b><i>And all flesh shall see the salvation of God</i> That salvation will not be at all obscure, or experienced by a small number of persons, but will strike every eye, and will be common to all. Hence it follows that this prediction was far from being accomplished, when the people returned from Babylon: <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(250)</sup></span> for though the Lord gave, at that time, a memorable display of his grace, yet he did not reveal his <i>salvation</i> to the whole world. On the contrary, the prophet’s design was, to present the uncommon excellence of the salvation which was to be manifested, in contrast with God’s former benefits, and thus to inform believers, that the dispensations of God towards his Church had never been so remarkable, nor his power so illustriously displayed in their deliverance. <i>Flesh</i> is here put for <i>men,</i> without being intended to denote their depravity. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(251)</sup></span> </p>
