<p>As to the loud and open rebuke, which was administered to them in presence of all, it was for the sake of others; and that is the reason why Luke mentions, that it was addressed to <i>multitudes,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:7">Luke 3:7</span>.) Though the persons whom John reproved were few in number, his design was to strike terror on all; as Paul enjoins us to regard it as the advantage of public rebukes, <i>“</i> that others also may fear,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:20">1 Timothy 5:20</span>.) He addresses directly the Pharisees and Sadducees, and at the same time, addresses, through them, a warning to all, not to hold out a hypocritical appearance of repentance, instead of a true affection of the heart. Besides, it was of great importance to the whole nation to know <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(263)</sup></span> what sort of people the Pharisees and Sadducees were, who had miserably corrupted the worship of God, wasted the church, and overturned the whole of religion; — in a word, who had extinguished the light of God by their corruptions, and infected every thing by their crimes. </p>
<p>It is probable, therefore, that John publicly attacked the Pharisees, for the benefit of the whole church of God, that they might no longer dazzle the eyes of simple men by empty show, or hold the body of the people under oppression by wicked tyranny. In this respect, it was a remarkable display of his firmness, that those, who were highly esteemed by others, were not spared on account of their reputation, but sternly reduced, as they deserved, to their proper rank. And thus ought all godly instructors to be zealous, not to dread any power of man, but boldly strive to “cast down every high thing that exalteth itself” against Christ, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:5">2 Corinthians 10:5</span>.) </p>
<p>If John, the organ of the Holy Spirit, employed such severity of language in his opening address to those who voluntarily came to be baptized, and to make a public profession of the gospel; how ought we now to act towards the avowed enemies of Christ, who not only reject obstinately all that belongs to sound doctrine, but whose efforts to extinguish the name of Christ are violently maintained by fire and sword? Most certainly, if you compare the Pope, and his abominable clergy, with the Pharisees and Sadducees, the mildest possible way of dealing with them will be, to throw them all into one bundle. Those, whose ears are so delicate, that they cannot endure to have any bitter thing said against the Pope, must argue, not with us, but with the Spirit of God. Yet let godly teachers beware, lest, while they are influenced by holy zeal against the tyrants of the Church, they mingle with it the affections of the flesh. And as no vehemence, which is not regulated by the wisdom of the Spirit, can obtain the divine approbation, let them not only restrain their feelings, but surrender themselves to the Holy Spirit, and implore his guidance, that nothing may escape them through inadvertency. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(264)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>Offspring of vipers.</i> He gives them this name, instead of simply calling them <i>vipers,</i> in order to expose the envenomed malice of the whole class: for he intended to condemn, not merely those few persons who were present, but the whole body, and to charge both sects with producing nothing but serpents. They had vehement disputes, no doubt, with each other: but all were agreed in despising God, in a wicked desire to rule, in hatred of sound doctrine, and in a disgusting mass of numerous crimes. </p>
<p><i>Who warned you?</i> As he had suspicions of their repentance, he puts the question with doubt and wonder, if it be possible that they repent sincerely. In this way, he summons them to the inward tribunal of conscience, that they may thoroughly examine themselves, and, laying aside all flattery, may institute a severe investigation into their crimes. <i>Wrath</i> is put here, as in many other places, for the judgment of God: as when Paul says, “The law worketh wrath,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:15">Romans 4:15</span>,) and “Give place to wraths <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(265)</sup></span> ”, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:19">Romans 12:19</span>.) He calls it the <i>wrath to come,</i> which hangs over their heads, that they may not indulge in their wonted carelessness. For, though the wrath of God overflows, and his chastisements strike, the whole world, hypocrites always entertain the hope that they will escape. <i>To flee from the wrath</i> of God, is here taken in a good sense, that is, to seek the means of appeasing God, that he may no longer be angry with us. For a good part of men, in order to escape the wrath of God, withdraw themselves from his guidance and authority. But all that the sinner gains <i>by fleeing</i> from God, is to provoke more and more the wrath of God against him. </p>
