<p><b>24.</b><i>Verily, I say to you</i> He reproaches them with the blame of preventing him from exerting his power among them as he did in other places, by working miracles: for the unbelief of men presents an obstruction to God, and hinders him from working, as might be desired, for their salvation, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:58">Matthew 13:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:5">Mark 6:5</span>.) Christ could not perform any miracle among them, because “they did not believe on him,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:37">John 12:37</span>.) Not that it is in the power of men to bind the hands of God, but that he withholds the advantage of his works from those who are rendered unworthy of them by their infidelity. The answer given by Christ amounts to this: “If you wish to have a share in miracles, why do you not give place to God? or rather, why do you proudly reject the minister of his power? You receive, therefore, a just reward for your contempt, when I pass by you, and give a preference to other places, for proving by miracles, that I am the Messiah of God, who have been appointed to restore the church.” </p>
<p>And, certainly, it was intolerable ingratitude that, when God was pleased to have his Son brought up in their city, such a person, who had been among them from his infancy, was despised. Justly, therefore, did he withdraw his hand, that it might not be exposed to the derision of those wicked despisers. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(326)</sup></span> Hence we learn what value the Lord puts on his word, when, in order to punish for the contempt of it, he takes from the midst of us those favors, which are the testimonies of his presence. With respect to that saying, <i>no prophet is acceptable in his own country,</i> the reader may consult what I have said on a saying of the same import, recorded by the Evangelist John: “A prophet hath no honor in his own country,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:44">John 4:44</span>.) </p>
