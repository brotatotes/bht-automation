<p><b>28.</b><i>Were filled with wrath</i> They perceived that the object of those two examples, which Christ had produced, was to show, that the grace of God would be removed from them to others: <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(327)</sup></span> and therefore they considered that he had spoken to their dishonor. But, instead of having their consciences stung to the quick, and seeking a remedy for their vices by correcting them, they are only driven to madness.
