Its breadth and situation will be more appropriately discussed in another place. Let us now come to the fact here related. </p>
<p>Luke says, that Christ entered into a ship which belonged to Peter, and <i>withdrew to a moderate distance from the land,</i> that he might more conveniently address from it the multitudes, who flocked from various places to hear him; and that, after discharging the office of teaching, he exhibited a proof of his divine power by a miracle. It was no unusual thing, indeed, that fishers cast their nets, on many occasions, with little advantage: and that all their fruitless toil was afterwards recompensed by one successful throw. But it was proved to be a miracle by this circumstance, that they had taken nothing during the whole night, (which, however, is more suitable for catching fish,) and that suddenly <i>a great multitude of fishes</i> was collected into their nets, sufficient to fill the ships. Peter and his companions, therefore, readily conclude that a <i>take,</i> so far beyond the ordinary quantity, was not accidental, but was bestowed on them by a divine interposition. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(338)</span> <i>Chinnereth</i> occurs in Joshua, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jos+19:35">Joshua 19:35</span>,) as the name of an adjoining city, from which the lake probably derived its name. In the French copy, our author gives it <i>Cinerot,</i> or, as we have it, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jos+11:2">Joshua 11:2</span>,) <i>Chinneroth.</i> But that word contains a <i>Vau,</i> which is here wanting: though it must be owned that, when it is connected with a <i>Cholem</i> point, that letter is often inserted, or left out, according to the pleasure of the writer. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
