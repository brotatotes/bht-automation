<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:5">Luke 5:5</span></b><b>.</b><i>Master, toiling all the night, we have taken nothing.</i> The reason why Peter calls him <i>Master</i> unquestionably is, that he knows Christ to be accustomed to discharge the office of a <i>Teacher,</i> and is moved with reverence toward him. But he has not yet made such progress as to deserve to be ranked among his disciples: for our sentiments concerning Christ do not render him sufficient honor, unless we embrace his doctrine by the obedience of faith, and know what he requires from us. He has but a slender perception — if he has any at all — of the value of the Gospel; but the deference which he pays to Christ is manifested by this, that, when worn out by fruitless toil, he commences anew what he had already attempted in vain. Yet it cannot be denied, that he highly esteemed Christ, and had the highest respect for his authority. But a particular instance of faith, rendered to a single command of Christ, would not have made Peter a Christian, or given him a place among the sons of God, if he had not been led on, from this first act of submission, to a full obedience. But, as Peter yielded so readily to the command of Christ, whom he did not yet know to be a Prophet or the Son of God, no apology can be offered for our disgraceful conduct, if, while we call him our <i>Lord,</i> and <i>King,</i> and <i>Judge,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+33:22">Isaiah 33:22</span> <i>,)</i> we do not move a finger to perform our duty, to which we have ten times received his commands. </p>
