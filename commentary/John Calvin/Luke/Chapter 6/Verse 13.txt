<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13">Luke 6:13</span></b><b>.</b><i>Whom also he named Apostles.</i> This may be explained in two ways: either that, at a subsequent period, when he introduced them into their office, he gave them this name, â€” or that, with a view to their future rank, he bestowed on them this title, in order to inform them why they were separated from the ordinary class, and for what purpose they were destined. The latter view agrees well with the words of Mark: for he says, that Christ <i>appointed twelve to be with him, and to send them forth to preach. He</i> intended to make them his companions, that they might afterwards receive a higher rank: for, as I have already explained, when he says, <i>to be with him, and to send them forth to preach,</i> he does not mean that both were to take place at the same time. </p>
