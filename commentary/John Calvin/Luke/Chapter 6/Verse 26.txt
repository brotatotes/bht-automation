<p><b>26.</b><i>Woe to you when all men shall applaud you</i> The last woe is intended to correct ambition: for nothing is more common than to seek the applauses of men, or, at least, to be carried away by them; and, in order to guard his disciples against such a course, he points out to them that the favor of men would prove to be their ruin. This warning refers peculiarly to teachers, who have no plague more to be dreaded than ambition: because it is impossible for them not to corrupt the pure doctrine of God, when they, “seek to please men,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:10">Galatians 1:10</span>.) By the phrase, <i>all men,</i> Christ must be understood to refer to the children of the world, whose applauses are wholly bestowed on deceivers and false prophets: for faithful and conscientious ministers of sound doctrine enjoy the applause and favor of good men. It is only the wicked favor of the flesh that is here condemned: for, as Paul informs us, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:10">Galatians 1:10</span>,) no man who “seeks to please men” can be “the servant of Christ.” </p>
