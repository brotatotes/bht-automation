<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:39">Luke 6:39</span></b><b>.</b><i>And he spake to them a parable.</i> Luke relates this saying without mentioning any occurrence, but states generally, that Christ made use of this <i>parable;</i> as in recording many of Christâ€™s discourses he says nothing as to the occasion on which they were delivered. It is no doubt possible that Christ may have spoken this parable more than once; but, as no place more appropriate was to be found, I have not hesitated to insert here what Luke relates without fixing the time. </p>
