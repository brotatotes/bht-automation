<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:40">Luke 6:40</span></b><b>.</b><i>The disciple is not above his master, but every one shall be conformed to his master</i> Luke gives this sentence without any connection, as if it had been spoken abruptly in the midst of other discourses; but as Matthew explains very clearly, in this passage, to what it relates, I have chosen not to insert it in any other place. With respect to the translation, I have chosen neither to follow Erasmus nor the old translator, and for the following reason: — The participle <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κατηρτισμένος</span></blu></grk>, signifies <i>perfect,</i> but signifies also <i>fit and suitable</i> Now, as Christ is speaking, not about perfection, but about resemblance, and must therefore mean, that nothing is more <i>suitable</i> for a <i>disciple</i> than to be formed after the example of his <i>master,</i> the latter meaning appeared to me to be more appropriate. </p>
