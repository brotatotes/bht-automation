<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:43">Luke 6:43</span></b><b>.</b><i>For the tree is not good</i> This statement, as related by Luke, appears to be a general instruction given by Christ, that by the <i>fruits</i> our opinion of every man ought to be formed, in the same manner as <i>a tree is known by its fruit</i> After having inserted the reproof to hypocrites, who “<i>perceive a straw in the eye of another, but do not see a beam in their own</i>, ” (verses 41,42,) he immediately adds, <i>For the tree is not good which beareth rotten fruit, nor is the tree rotten which beareth good fruit</i> The illative particle <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">γὰρ</span></blu></grk>, <i>for,</i> appears to connect these two sentences. But as it is certain that Luke, in that sixth chapter, records various discourses of Christ, it is also possible that he may have briefly glanced at what is more fully explained by Matthew. I attach no great importance to the word <i>for,</i> which in other passages is often superfiuous, and appears obviously to be so from the concluding statement. </p>
