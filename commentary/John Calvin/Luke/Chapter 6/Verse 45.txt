<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:45">Luke 6:45</span></b><b>.</b><i>A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good</i> Such is the statement with which Luke concludes the discourse; and I have no doubt that he intended to describe, without a figure, the kind of judgment which Christ orders us to make from the <i>fruits</i> Believers ought to examine carefully what kind of doctrine is taught by those who profess to be the servants of God. “Titles (he says) are of little value, till the speaker give actual evidence that he is sent by God.” Yet I am far from saying, that this passage may not be applied to a general doctrine, And certainly the last clause, <i>out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh,</i> has a more extensive reference than to false prophets: for it is a common proverb. Is it objected, that the tongues of men lie, and that men of the worst hearts are often the best speakers? I reply: Christ merely points out here what is a very ordinary occurrence. For, though hypocrites express in words what is different from the feelings of their hearts, that is no reason why we may not justly and appropriately call the tongue the <i>portrait</i> of the mind. </p>
