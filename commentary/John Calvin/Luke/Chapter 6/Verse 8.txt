<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:8">Luke 6:8</span></b><b>.</b><i>But he knew their thoughts</i> If Matthew states the truth, they had openly declared by their language what was in their minds; and therefore Christ replies not to <i>their secret thoughts,</i> but to express words. But both may be true, that they spoke plainly, and yet that Christ discerned their secret <i>thoughts</i>; for they did not openly avow their designs, and Matthew himself tells us that their question was intended to take Christ by surprise; and, consequently, Luke means nothing more than that Christ was aware of their insidious designs, though not expressed in words. </p>
