<p><b>14.</b><i>Young man, I say to thee.</i> By this word Christ proved the truth of the saying of Paul, that <i>God calleth those things which are not, as they were,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:17">Romans 4:17</span>.) He addresses the dead man, and makes himself be heard, so that death is suddenly changed into life. We have here, in the first place, a striking emblem of the future resurrection, as Ezekiel is commanded to say, <i>O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord,</i> [<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:4">Ezekiel 37:4</span>.] Secondly, we are taught in what manner Christ quickens us spiritually by faith. It is when he infuses into his word a secret power, so that it enters into dead souls, as he himself declares, </p>
<p>The hour cometh, when the dead shall hear the voice of <br>the Son of God, and they who hear shall live, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>.) </br></p>
