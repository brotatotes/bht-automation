<p><b>30.</b><i>Despised the counsel of God within themselves. The counsel of God</i> is mentioned by way of respect, as contrasted with the wicked pride of the scribes; for the term <i>counsel</i> carries along with it a dignity, which protects the doctrine of God against the contempt of men. Literally, Luke says, that they <i>despised</i> Against Themselves : and indeed I do not disapprove of the meaning which is preferred by some, that the scribes were rebellious to their own destruction. But as Luke’s narrative is simple, and as the preposition <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἰς</span></blu></grk> is often used in the sense of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐν</span></blu></grk> I have chosen rather to translate it, <i>within themselves;</i> as meaning, that although they did not openly and expressly contradict, yet as they inwardly swelled with hidden pride, they <i>despised within themselves</i> </p>
