<p><b>34.</b><i>The Son of man came.</i> To <i>eat and drink</i> means here nothing more than to live in the customary way; as Christ says that John <i>came neither eating nor drinking,</i> because he confined himself to a peculiar diet, and even abstained from ordinary food. This is more fully expressed by the words of Luke, <i>neither eating bread nor drinking wine.</i> Those who think that the highest perfection consists in outward austerity of life, and who pronounce it to be an angelical life when a person is abstemious, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(26)</sup></span> or mortifies himself by fasting, ought to attend to this passage. On this principle John would rank higher than the Son of God; but, on the contrary, we ought to maintain, that </p>
<p>bodily exercise profiteth little, but godliness <br/>is profitable to all things, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:8">1 Timothy 4:8</span>.) </p>
<p>And yet we must not make this a pretense for giving a loose rein to the flesh, by indulging in luxuries and effeminacy: only we must beware of superstition, lest foolish men, imagining that perfection lies in matters of a purely elementary nature, neglect the spiritual worship of God. Besides, while Christ accommodated himself to the usages of ordinary life, he maintained a sobriety truly divine, and did not encourage the excesses of others by his dissimulation or by his example. </p>
