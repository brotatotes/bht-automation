<p><b>35.</b><i>And Wisdom is justified</i> This passage is variously explained by commentators. Some maintain that <i>Wisdom</i> was <i>acquitted</i> by the Jews, because, conscious of guilt, and judges of their own unbelief, they were compelled to acknowledge, that the doctrine which they rejected was good and holy. By <i>the children of Wisdom</i> they understand the Jews who boasted of that title. Others think that it was spoken in irony: “It is in this manner that you approve of the <i>Wisdom</i> of God, of which you boast that you are the <i>children?</i> ” But as the Greek preposition <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀπό</span></blu></grk> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(27)</sup></span> does not properly relate to an agent, some explain it, that <i>Wisdom is acquitted by her children,</i> and is no longer under obligation to them, in the same manner as when an inheritance is transferred to another. Thus Paul says, that Christ <i>was justified</i> ( <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δεδικαίωται</span></blu></grk>) <i>from sin,</i> ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:7">Romans 6:7</span>,) because the curse of sin had no longer any power over him. </p>
<p>Some interpret it more harshly, and with greater excess of freedom, to mean that <i>Wisdom is estranged from her children</i> But granting that this were the import of the Greek preposition, I look upon the other meaning as more appropriate, that <i>Wisdom,</i> however wickedly she may be slandered by her own sons, loses nothing of her worth or rank, but remains unimpaired. The Jews, and particularly the scribes, gave themselves out as <i>children</i> of the <i>Wisdom</i> of God; and yet, when they trod their mother under their feet, they not only flattered themselves amidst such heinous sacrilege, but desired that Christ should fall by their decision. Christ maintains, on the contrary, that, however wicked and depraved her <i>children</i> may be, <i>Wisdom</i> remains entire, and that the malice of those who wickedly and malignantly slander her takes nothing from her authority. </p>
<p>I have not yet brought forward that meaning which appears to my own mind the most appropriate and natural. First, the words of Christ contain an implied contrast between true <i>children</i> and bastards, who hold but an empty title without the reality; and they amount to this: <i>“Let</i> those who haughtily boast of being the <i>children</i> of <i>Wisdom</i> proceed in their obstinacy: she will, notwithstanding, retain the praise and support of her own <i>children.</i> Accordingly, Luke adds a term of universality, by <i>all her children;</i> which means, that the reluctance of the scribes will not prevent all the elect of God from remaining steadfast in the faith of the Gospel. With respect to the Greek word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀπό</span></blu></grk>, it undoubtedly has sometimes the same meaning as <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑπό</span></blu></grk>. Not to mention other instances, there is a passage in Luke’s Gospel, ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:25">Luke 17:25</span>,) where Christ says, that <i>he must suffer many things,</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καὶ ἀποδοκιμασθὢναι ἀπὸ τὢς γενεᾶς ταύτης</span></blu></grk>, <i>and be rejected</i> B y <i>this generation.</i> Everybody will admit, that the form of expression is the same as in the corresponding clause. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(28)</sup></span> Besides, Chrysostom, whose native language was Greek, passes over this matter, as if there were no room for debate. Not only is this meaning more appropriate, but it corresponds to a former clause, in which it was said, that God was <i>justified</i> by <i>the people,</i> (v. 29.) Although many apostates may revolt from the Church of God, yet, among all the elect, who truly belong to the flock, the faith of the Gospel will always remain uninjured. </p>
