<p><b>37.</b><i>A woman who was a sinner</i> The words stand literally as I have translated them,( <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἥτις ἧν ἁμαζτωλὸς</span></blu></grk>.) <i>Erasmus</i> has chosen to take the pluperfect tense, <i>who Had Been a sinner,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(241)</sup></span> lest any one should suppose that at that time she still <i>was a sinner</i> But by so doing, he departed from the natural meaning; for Luke intended to express the place which the woman held in society, and the opinion universally entertained respecting her. Though her sudden conversion had rendered her a different person in the sight of God from what she had previously been, yet among men the disgrace attaching to her former life had not yet been effaced. She was, therefore, in the general estimation of men <i>a sinner,</i> that is, a woman of wicked and infamous life; and this led <i>Simon</i> to conclude, though erroneously, that Christ had not the Spirit of discernment, since he was unacquainted with that infamy which was generally known. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(242)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(241)</span> <i>“</i> <blu><i>Quoe fuerat peccatrix</i></blu> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(242)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Veu qu’il ne cognoist point l’infamie de la vie de ceste femme qui estoit notoire a un chacun</span></blu>;” — “since he does not know the infamy of the life of this woman, which was notorious to every one.” </p>
