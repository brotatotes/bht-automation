<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:45">Luke 8:45</span></b><b>.</b><i>Who is it that touched me,</i> Mark expresses it still more clearly, when he says that Christ <i>looked around to see</i> who she was. It does appear to be absurd that Christ should pour out his grace without knowing on whom he was bestowing a favor. There is not less difficulty in what he shortly afterwards says, that <i>he perceived that power had gone out from him:</i> as if, while it flowed from him, it was not a free gift bestowed at those times, and on those persons, whom he was pleased to select. Beyond all question, he knowingly and willingly cured the woman; and there is as little doubt that he drew her to himself by his Spirit, that she might obtain a cure: but he puts the question to her, that she may freely and publicly make it known. If Christ had been the only witness of his miracle, his statements might not perhaps have been believed: but now, when the woman, struck with dread, relates what happened to her, greater weight is due to her confession. </p>
