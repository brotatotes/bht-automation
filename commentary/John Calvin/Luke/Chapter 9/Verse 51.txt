<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span></b><b>.</b><i>While the days of his being received up, etc.</i> Luke alone relates this narrative, which, however, is highly useful on many accounts. For, first, it describes the divine courage and firmness of Christ <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(586)</sup></span> in despising death; secondly, what deadly enmities are produced by differences about religion; thirdly, with what headlong ardor the nature of man is hurried on to impatience; next, how ready we are to fall into mistakes in imitating the saints; and, lastly, by the example of Christ we are called to the exercise of meekness. The death of Christ is called his <i>being received up,</i> ( <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀνάληψις</span></blu></grk>) not only because he was then withdrawn from the midst of us, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(587)</sup></span> but because, leaving the mean prison of the flesh, he ascended on high. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(586)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">La magnanimite et constance admirable de Iesus Christ</span></blu>;” — “the wonderful magnanimity and firmness of Jesus Christ.” </p>
