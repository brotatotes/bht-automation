<p><b>54.</b><i>And when His disciples James and John saw it</i>. The country itself had perhaps suggested to them the desire of thundering immediately against the ungodly; for it was there that <i>Elijah</i> had formerly destroyed, by a fire from heaven, the king’s soldiers who had been sent to apprehend him, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ki+1:10">2 Kings 1:10</span>.) It therefore occurred to them that the Samaritans, who so basely rejected the Son of God, were at that time devoted to a similar destruction. And here we see to what we are driven by a foolish imitation <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(591)</sup></span> of the holy fathers. <i>James and John</i> plead the example of <i>Elijah</i>, but they do not consider how far they differ from <i>Elijah</i>; they do not examine properly their own intemperate zeal, nor do they look at the calling of God. Under a pretext equally plausible did the Samaritans cloak their idolatry, <i>our fathers worshipped in this mountain</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:20">John 4:20</span>.) But both were in the wrong; for, neglecting the exercise of judgment, they were apes rather than imitators of the holy fathers. Now though it is doubtful whether they think that they have the power in their own hand, or ask Christ to give it to them, I think it more probable that, elated with foolish confidence, they entertain no doubt that they are able to execute vengeance, provided that Christ give his consent. </p>
