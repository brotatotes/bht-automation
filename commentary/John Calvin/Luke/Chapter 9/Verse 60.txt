<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:60">Luke 9:60</span></b><b>.</b><i>But go thou and proclaim the kingdom of God.</i> Matthew has only the words, <i>Follow me:</i> but Luke states more fully the reason why he was called, which was, that he might be a minister and preacher of the Gospel. Had he remained in a private station, there would have been no absolute necessity for leaving his father, provided he did not forsake the Gospel on his father’s account. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(507)</sup></span> But the preaching of the Gospel does not allow him to remain at home, and therefore Christ properly takes him away from his father. While the amazing goodness of Christ appears in bestowing so honorable an office on a man who was still so weak, it deserves our notice, that the fault which still cleaved to him is corrected, and is not overlooked and encouraged. </p>
