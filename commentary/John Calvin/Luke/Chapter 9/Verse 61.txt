<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:61">Luke 9:61</span></b><b>.</b><i>And another said.</i> Matthew does not mention this third person. It appears that he was too strongly attached to the world, to be ready and prepared to follow Christ. True, he offers to join the family of Christ, but with this reservation, <i>after he has bid farewell to those who are in his house;</i> that is, after he has arranged his business at home, as men are wont to do when preparing for a journey. This is the true reason why Christ reproves him so severely: for, while he was professing in words that he would be a follower of Christ, he turned his back upon him, till he had despatched his worldly business. </p>
