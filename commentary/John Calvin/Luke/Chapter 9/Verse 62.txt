<p><b>62.</b><i>He who, after having put his hand to the plough, shall look back, is unfit for the kingdom of God.</i> We must carefully inquire what this declaration of Christ means. They are said to <i>look back,</i> who become involved in the cares of the world, so as to allow themselves to be withdrawn from the right path; particularly, when they plunge themselves into those employments which disqualify them to follow Christ. </p>
