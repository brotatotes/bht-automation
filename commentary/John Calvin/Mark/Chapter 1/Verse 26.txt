<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:26">Mark 1:26</span></b><i>When the unclean spirit had torn him</i> Luke uses a milder phrase, <i>when the devil had thrown him down:</i> but they agree perfectly as to the meaning; for the design of both was to show, that the devil went out of the man in a violent manner. He threw down the unhappy man, as if he had intended to tear him: but Luke says that the attempt was unsuccessful; for <i>he hurt him nothing</i> Not that the attack was, in no degree whatever, attended by injury, or at least by some feeling of pain; but that the man was afterwards delivered from the devil, and restored to perfect health. </p>
