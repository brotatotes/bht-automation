It is not for the sake of blame, or to lessen its credit, that they speak of it as <i>new.</i> This is rather a part of their admiration, that they pronounce it to be not common or ordinary. Their only fault lies in this, that they remain in their state of hesitation, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(346)</sup></span> whereas the children of God ought to make increasing progress. </p>
