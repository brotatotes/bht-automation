<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:29">Mark 1:29</span></b><b>.</b><i>They came, with James and John, into the house of Simon and Andrew.</i> There is reason to conjecture, that Matthew does not relate this history in its proper order: for Mark expressly states, that there were only four disciples who attended Christ. Besides, when he left the synagogue, he went straight to Peter’s house; which also shows clearly, that Matthew did not observe, with exactness, the order of time. The Evangelists appear to have taken particular notice of this miracle; not that, in itself, it was more remarkable, or more worthy of being recorded, than other miracles, — but because, by means of it, Christ gave to his disciples a private and familiar illustration of his grace. Another reason was, that the healing of one woman gave occasion to many miracles, so that they came to him in great numbers, from every direction, to implore his assistance. A single word, in Luke’s narrative, presents to us more strikingly the power which Christ displayed; for he says, that <i>Simon’s mother-in-law was held by a GREAT fever.</i> It was a clearer and more affecting proof of divine power, that, in a moment, and by a single touch, he removed a strong and violent disease. He might have done it by the slightest expression of his will; but he <i>touched her hand,</i> <b>(</b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:15">Matthew 8:15</span> <b>,)</b>either to mark his affection, or because he was aware that this sign was, at that time, advantageous: for we know, that he freely used outward signs, when the time required them. </p>
