When the leper, at the command of Christ, came into the presence of the priest, this was <i>a testimony to them,</i> which would render them inexcusable, if they refused to receive Christ as the minister of God; and would, at the same time, take away occasion for slander, since Christ did not neglect a single point of the law.
