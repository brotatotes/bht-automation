<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:45">Mark 1:45</span></b><b>.</b><i>So that Jesus could no longer enter openly into cities</i> Hence we learn the reason why Christ did not wish the miracle to be so soon made known. It was that he might have more abundant opportunity and freedom for teaching. Not that his enemies rose against him, and attempted to shut his mouth, but because the common people were so eager to demand miracles, that no room was left for doctrine. He wished that they would all be more attentive to the word than to signs. Luke accordingly says, that <i>he sought retirement in the deserts</i> He avoided a crowd of men, because he saw, that he would not satisfy the wishes of the people, without overwhelming his doctrine by a superfluity of miracles. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(497)</sup></span> </p>
