<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:52">Mark 10:52</span></b><b>.</b><i>Thy faith hath saved thee</i> By the word<i>faith</i> is meant not only a confident hope of recovering sight, but a loftier conviction, which was, that this <i>blind man</i> had acknowledged Jesus to be the Messiah whom God had promised. Nor must we imagine that it was only some confused knowledge; for we have already seen that this confession was taken from the Law and the Prophets. For the <i>blind man</i> did not at random bestow on Christ the name of <i>Son of David</i>, but embraced him as that person whose coming he had been taught by the divine predictions to expect. Now Christ attributes it to faith that <i>the blind man received sight;</i> for, though the power and grace of God sometimes extend even to unbelievers, yet no man enjoys His benefits in a right and profitable manner, unless he receive them by faith; nay, the use of the gifts of God is so far from being advantageous to unbelievers, that it is even hurtful. And therefore, when Christ says, <i>thy faith hath saved thee,</i> the word <i>saved</i> is not limited to an outward <i>cure</i>, but includes also the <i>health</i> and <i>safety</i> of the soul; as if Christ had said, that by <i>faith</i> the blind man obtained that God was gracious to him, and granted his wish. And if it was in regard <i>to faith</i> that God bestowed his favor on the blind man, it follows that he was justified by <i>faith</i> </p>
