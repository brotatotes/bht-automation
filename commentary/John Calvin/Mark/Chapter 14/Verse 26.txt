<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:26">Mark 14:26</span></b><b>.</b><i>When they had sung a hymn.</i> Our three Evangelists leave out those divine discourses, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(198)</sup></span> which John relates to have been delivered by our Lord, both in the house and on the road. For, as we have elsewhere stated, their object was rather to embrace the history of our Lord’s actions than his doctrine. They glance only at the fact, that he went out of his own accord where Judas was to come; and their object is to inform us that he made such an arrangement of his time, as willingly to meet him who betrayed him. </p>
