<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:51">Mark 14:51</span></b><b>.</b><i>And a young man.</i> How some persons have come to dream that this was John <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(221)</sup></span> I know not, nor is it of much importance to inquire. The chief point is, to ascertain for what purpose Mark has related this transaction. I think that his object was, to inform us that those wicked men — as usually happens in riotous assemblies stormed and raved without shame or modesty; which appeared from their seizing <i>a young man</i> who was unknown to them, and not suspected of any crime, so that he had difficulty in escaping out of their hands <i>naked.</i> For it is probable that <i>the young man,</i> who is mentioned, had some attachment to Christ, and, on hearing the tumult by night, without stopping to put on his clothes, and covered only with a linen garment, came either to discover their traps, or, at least, that he might not be wanting in a duty of friendship. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(222)</sup></span> We certainly perceive — as I just now said — that those wicked men raged with cruel violence, when they did not even spare a poor <i>young man,</i> who had left his bed, almost <i>naked,</i> and run, on hearing the noise. </p>
