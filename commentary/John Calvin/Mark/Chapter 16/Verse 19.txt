<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:19">Mark 16:19</span></b><b>.</b><i>And after the Lord had thus spoken to them.</i> The Evangelist Matthew, having extolled in magnificent language the reign of Christ over the whole world, says nothing about his ascension to heaven. Mark, too, takes no notice of the place and the manner, both of which are described by Luke; for he says that <i>the disciples were led out to Bethany,</i> that from <i>the Mount of Olives,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:3">Matthew 24:3</span>,) whence he had descended to undergo the ignominy of the cross, he might ascend the heavenly throne. Now as he did not, after his resurrection, appear indiscriminately to all, so he did not permit all to be the witnesses of his ascension to heaven; for he intended that this mystery of faith should be known by the preaching of the gospel rather than beheld by the eyes. </p>
