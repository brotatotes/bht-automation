<p><b>3.</b><i>And they said among themselves.</i> Mark alone expresses this doubt; but as the other Evangelists relate that <i>the stone was rolled away by the angel,</i> it may easily be inferred, that they remained in perplexity and doubt as to what they should do, until the entrance was opened up by the hand of God. But let us learn from this, that in consequence of having been carried away by their zeal, they came there without due consideration. They had seen <i>a stone</i> placed before the sepulcher, to hinder any one from entering. Why did not this occur to them, when they were at home and at leisure, but because they were seized with such fear and astonishment, that thought and recollection failed them? But as it is a holy zeal that blinds them, God does not charge them with this fault. </p>
