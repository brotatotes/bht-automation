<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:27">Mark 2:27</span></b><b>.</b><i>The Sabbath was made for man.</i> This <i>Fifth</i> argument is related by Mark alone. The general meaning is, that those persons judge amiss who turn to man’s destruction, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(83)</sup></span> the Sabbath which God appointed for his benefit. The Pharisees saw the disciples of Christ employed in a holy work; they saw them worn out with the fatigue of the journey, and partly with want of food; and yet are offended that, when they are hungry, they take a few grains of corn for the support of their wearied bodies. Is not this a foolish attempt to overturn the purpose of God, when they demand to the injury of men that observation of the Sabbath which he intended to be advantageous? But they are mistaken, I think, who suppose that in this passage the Sabbath is entirely abolished; for Christ simply informs us what is the proper use of it. Though he asserted, a little before, that he is <i>Lord of the Sabbath,</i> yet the full time for its abolition <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(84)</sup></span> was not yet come, because <i>the veil of the temple</i> was not yet <i>rent,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:51">Matthew 27:51</span>.) </p>
