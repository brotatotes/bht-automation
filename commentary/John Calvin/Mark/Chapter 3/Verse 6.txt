<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:6">Mark 3:6</span></b><b>.</b><i>The Pharisees took counsel with the Herodians.</i> Now they regarded <i>the Herodians</i> with the fiercest hatred; for their eagerness to be considered the guardians and protectors of public liberty made it necessary for them to make an open profession of mortal hatred to the ministers of that tyrant. And yet this aversion is counteracted by their hatred and fury against Christ, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(88)</sup></span> which makes them not only enter into a conspiracy with foreigners, but insinuate themselves into the good graces of those with whom, on other occasions, they would have shrunk from intercourse. While ungodliness hurries men in various directions, and drives them to different courses, it engages them, with one consent, in a contest with God. No hostilities prevent them from giving their hand to each other for opposing the truth of God. </p>
