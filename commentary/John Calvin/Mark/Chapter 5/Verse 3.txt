<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:3">Mark 5:3</span></b><b>.</b><i>And no man could bind him, not even with chains</i> Naturally, he was not able to break the chains; and hence we infer that Satan is sometimes permitted to make extraordinary movements, the effect of which goes beyond our comprehension and beyond ordinary means. We often perceive in madmen much greater strength than belongs to their natural capacity; and we are not at liberty to deny that, in such cases, the devil does his part when God permits him: but the force, which is described by the Evangelists, was far greater. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(548)</sup></span> It was indeed a sad and shocking exhibition, but may serve to remind us how wretched and alarming it is to be placed under the tyranny of Satan, and also that bodily agony, however violent or cruel, is not more to be dreaded than distress of mind. </p>
