<p><b>37.</b><i>And did not permit any one to follow him.</i> He forbade that they should be allowed to enter, either because they were unworthy to be his witnesses of the miracle, or because he did not choose that the miracle should be overpowered by a noisy crowd around him. It was better that the young woman, whose dead body they had beheld, should suddenly go out before the eyes of men, alive and full of rigor. <i>Mark</i> and <i>Luke</i> tell us that not more than three of the disciples were admitted, and both mention also the parents. <i>Mark</i> alone states that those who had accompanied Jairus when he came to supplicate Christ were admitted. Matthew, who is more concise, takes no notice of this circumstance. </p>
