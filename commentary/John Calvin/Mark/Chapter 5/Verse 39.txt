<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:39">Mark 5:39</span></b><i>The girl sleepeth. Sleep</i> is everywhere in Scripture employed to denote <i>death;</i> and there is no doubt but this comparison, taken from temporal rest, points out a future resurrection. But here Christ expressly makes a distinction between <i>sleep</i> and <i>death,</i> so as to excite an expectation of life. His meaning is, “You will presently see her raised up whom you suppose to be dead.” That he was <i>ridiculed</i> by thoughtless and ignorant people, who were wholly engrossed with profane lamentation, and who did not comprehend his design, ought not to awaken surprise. And yet this very circumstance was an additional confirmation of the miracle, that those persons entertained no doubt whatever as to her death. </p>
