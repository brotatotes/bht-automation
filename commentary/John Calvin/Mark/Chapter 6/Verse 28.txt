But in this way the Lord sometimes gives up his people to the pride of wicked men, till he at length makes it evident that their blood is <i>precious in his sight</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+116:15">Psalms 116:15</span>.) <i>Herodias</i> is delighted with the thought of having gained her wicked purpose, and cruelly triumphs over her reprover; but when afterwards, stripped of her wealth, and not only deprived of the title of queen, but driven from her native country, and destitute of all means of support, she dragged out a wretched life in poverty and banishment, she presented a spectacle gratifying to angels and to all good people. When we perceive that the guests are compelled to pollute their eyes by beholding this detestable exhibition, let us learn from it, that those who sit at the tables of kings are often involved in many crimes; for, granting that the table is not stained by murder, every thing partakes so largely of all sorts of wickedness, that they who approach to it must be at least given up to debauchery. </p>
