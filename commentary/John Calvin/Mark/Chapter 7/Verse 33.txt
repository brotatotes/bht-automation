<p><b>33.</b><i>And when he had taken him aside from the multitude.</i> This was done, partly to afford to those who were ignorant, and not yet sufficiently qualified for becoming witnesses, an opportunity of perceiving at a distance the glory of his Divine nature, and partly that he might have a better opportunity of pouring out earnest prayer. When he <i>looked up to heaven and sighed</i>, it was an expression of strong feeling; and this enables us to perceive the vehemence of his love towards men, for whose miseries he feels so much compassion. Nor can it be doubted, that by conveying the spittle from his own mouth to the mouth of another, and by <i>putting his fingers into his ears,</i> he intended to manifest and express the same feeling of kindness. Yet that he has supreme power to remove all our defects, and restore us to health, is proclaimed by him when he simply orders the tongue and ears <i>to be opened;</i> for it was not without a good reason that Mark inserted that Chaldaic word, ( <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐφφαθά</span></blu></grk>) <i>Ephphatha</i>, <i>be opened</i>, but to testify the divine power of Christ. Among other fooleries with which baptism has been debased by foolish men, the ceremony used by our Lord is turned into a piece of buffoonery; and this instance shows us that there is no end to licentiousness, when men wantonly change at their own pleasure the mysteries of God. </p>
