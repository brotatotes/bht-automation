<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:24">Mark 8:24</span></b><b>.</b><i>I see men.</i> Our Lord had put the question to <i>the blind man</i> for the sake of his disciples, to inform them that the man had received something, but that hitherto nothing more than a slight commencement of the cure had been effected. The reply is, that he <i>sees men</i>, because he perceives some persons <i>walking</i> who are upright <i>like trees</i> By these words he acknowledges that his sight is not yet so clear as to distinguish <i>men</i> from <i>trees</i>, but that he has already obtained some power of seeing, because he conjectures from the motion that those whom he perceives to be in an erect posture are men; and it is in this respect that he says they are <i>like trees</i> We see then that he speaks only by conjecture when he says that he <i>sees men</i> </p>
