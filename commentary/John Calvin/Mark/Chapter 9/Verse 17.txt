<p><b>17.</b><i>Master, I have brought to thee my son.</i> Matthew describes a different sort of disease from what is described by Mark, for he says that the man was <i>lunatic</i> But both agree as to these two points, that he was <i>dumb</i>, and that at certain intervals he became furious. The term <i>lunatic</i> is applied to those who, about the waning of the <i>moon</i>, are seized with epilepsy, or afflicted with giddiness. I do not admit the fanciful notion of Chrysostom, that the word <i>lunatic</i> was invented by a trick of Satan, in order to throw disgrace on the good creatures of God; for we learn from undoubted experience, that the course of the moon affects the increase or decline of these diseases. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(488)</sup></span> And yet this does not prevent Satan from mixing up his attacks with natural means. I am of opinion, therefore, that the man was not naturally <i>deaf</i> and <i>dumb</i>, but that Satan had taken possession of his tongue and ears; and that, as the weakness of his brain and nerves made him liable to epilepsy, Satan availed himself of this for aggravating the disease. The consequence was, that he was exposed to danger on every hand, and was thrown into violent convulsions, which left him lying on the ground, in a fainting state, and like a dead man. </p>
<p>Let us learn from this how many ways Satan has of injuring us, were it not that he is restrained by the hand of God. Our infirmities both of soul and body, which we feel to be innumerable, are so many darts with which Satan is supplied for wounding us. We are worse than stupid, if a condition so wretched does not, arouse us to prayer. But in this we see also an amazing display of the goodness of God, that, though we are liable to such a variety of dangers, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(489)</sup></span> he surrounds us with his protection; particularly if we consider with what eagerness our enemy is bent on our destruction. We ought also to call to remembrance the consoling truth, that Christ has come to bridle his rage, and that we are safe in the midst of so many dangers, because our diseases are effectually counteracted by heavenly medicine. </p>
<p>We must attend also to the circumstance of the time. The father replies, that his son had been subject to this grievous disease from his <i>infancy</i>. If Satan was permitted to exert his power, to such an extent, on a person of that tender age, what reason have not we to fear, who are continually exposing ourselves by our crimes to deadly strokes, who even supply our enemy with darts, and on whom he might justly be permitted to spend his rage, if it were not kept under restraint by the astonishing goodness of God? </p>
