<p><b>21.</b><i>From a child.</i> Hence we infer that this punishment was not inflicted on account of the sins of the individual, but was a secret judgment of God. True indeed, even infants, as soon as they have come out of the womb, are not innocent in the sight of God, or free from guilt; but Godâ€™s chastisements have sometimes hidden causes, and are intended to try our obedience. We do not render to God the honor which is due to Him, unless with reverence and modesty we adore His justice, when it is concealed from us. Whoever wishes to obtain more full information on this point, may consult my <i>Commentary</i> on these words, <i>Neither hath this man sinned</i>, <i>nor his parents</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:3">John 9:3</span>.) </p>
