<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:49">Mark 9:49</span></b><b>.</b><i>Every man shall be salted with fire.</i> I have connected these words of Mark with the passage in Matthew which we have just considered: not that I look upon them to have altogether the same meaning, or to have been spoken at the same place and time, but rather to enable the reader to understand better, by means of comparison, the different applications of the same sentence. According to Mark’s narrative, our Lord, having spoken of eternal <i>fire,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:48">Mark 9:48</span>,) exhorts his own people, on the contrary, to offer themselves now to God to be seasoned <i>with fire and salt,</i> that they may be devoted sacrifices, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(379)</sup></span> and that they may not draw upon themselves, by their sins, that <i>fire</i> which is never extinguished. To be <i>salted with fire</i> is an incorrect phrase; but as <i>salt</i> and <i>fire</i> possess the same quality of purifying and refining, Christ applied the same term to both. Such was the occasion on which this sentiment was uttered. It was, that believers may not refuse to be purified by <i>fire</i> and <i>salt;</i> since, without this seasoning, they cannot be holy to God. He alludes to an enactment of the Law: </p>
<p>“Every oblation of thy meat-offering shalt thou season with salt, neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat-offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt,” <br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+2:13">Leviticus 2:13</span>.) </br></p>
<p>But now he shows, that believers are salted by the word of the Gospel, that they may be sanctified. </p>
<p>He next adds, <i>salt is good</i> This extends generally to all, whom God has once been pleased to season with his own word. He exhorts them to retain always their savor. To give the name of <i>salt</i> to what is <i>salted</i> is rather a harsh metaphor, but it creates no doubt as to the meaning. When men have lost, by their carelessness, that savor which they obtained by the grace of God, there is no farther remedy. Those who lose their faith, by which they were consecrated to God, and become without savor, are in a desperate condition: for the good savor cannot be acquired by any other seasoning. Besides, those who have become corrupted, by making void the grace of God, are worse than unbelievers, as <i>salt</i> spoils <i>the land</i> and the <i>dunghill</i> </p>
