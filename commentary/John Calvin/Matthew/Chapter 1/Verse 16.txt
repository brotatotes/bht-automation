<p><b>16.</b><i>Jesus, who is called Christ</i> By the surname <i>Christ, Anointed,</i> Matthew points out his office, to inform the readers that this was not a private person, but one divinely <i>anointed</i> to perform the office of Redeemer. What that anointing was, and to what it referred, I shall not now illustrate at great length. As to the word itself, it is only necessary to say that, after the royal authority was abolished, it began to be applied exclusively to Him, from whom they were taught to expect a full recovery of the lost salvation.
