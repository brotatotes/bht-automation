<p><b>23.</b><i>His name Immanuel</i> The phrase, <i>God is with us,</i> is no doubt frequently employed in Scripture to denote, that he is present with us by his assistance and grace, and displays the power of his hand in our defense. But here we are instructed as to the <i>manner</i> in which God communicates with men. For out of Christ we are alienated from him; but through Christ we are not only received into his favor, but are made one with him. When Paul says, that the Jews under the law <i>were nigh</i> to God, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:17">Ephesians 2:17</span>,) and that a deadly <i>enmity</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span>) subsisted between him and the Gentiles, he means only that, by shadows and figures, God then gave to the people whom he had adopted the tokens of his presence. That promise was still in force, “The Lord thy God is among you,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+7:21">Deuteronomy 7:21</span>,) and, “This is my rest for ever,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+132:14">Psalms 132:14</span>.) But while the familiar intercourse between God and the people depended on a Mediator, what had not yet fully taken place was shadowed out by symbols. His seat and residence is placed “between the Cherubim,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+80:1">Psalms 80:1</span>,) because the ark was the figure and visible pledge of his glory. </p>
<p>But in Christ the actual presence of God with his people, and not, as before, his shadowy presence, has been exhibited. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(111)</sup></span> This is the reason, why Paul says, that “in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9">Colossians 2:9</span>.) And certainly he would not be a properly qualified Mediator, if he did not unite both natures in his person, and thus bring men into an alliance with God. Nor is there any force in the objection, about which the Jews make a good deal of noise, that the name of God is frequently applied to those memorials, by which he testified that he was present with believers. </p>
<p>For it cannot be denied, that this name, <i>Immanuel,</i> contains an implied contrast between the presence of God, as exhibited in Christ, with every other kind of presence, which was manifested to the ancient people before his coming. If the reason of this name began to be actually true, when Christ appeared in the flesh, it follows that it was not completely, but only in part, that God was formerly united with the Fathers. </p>
<p>Hence arises another proof, that Christ is <i>God manifested in the flesh,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>.) He discharged, indeed, the office of Mediator from the beginning of the world; but as this depended wholly on the latest revelation, he is justly called Immanuel at that time, when clothed, as it were, with a new character, he appears in public as a Priest, to atone for the sins of men by the sacrifice of his body, to reconcile them to the Father by the price of his blood, and, in a word, to fulfill every part of the salvation of men. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(112)</sup></span> The first thing which we ought to consider in this name is the divine majesty of Christ, so as to yield to him the reverence which is due to the only and eternal God. But we must not, at the same time, forget the fruit which God intended that we should collect and receive from this name. For whenever we contemplate the one person of Christ as God-man, we ought to hold it for certain that, if we are united to Christ by faith, we possess God. </p>
<p>In the words, <i>they shall call,</i> there is a change of the number. But this is not at all at variance with what I have already said. True, the prophet addresses the virgin alone, and therefore uses the second person, <i>Thou shalt call</i> But from the time that this name was published, all the godly have an equal right to make this confession, that God has given himself to us to be enjoyed in Christ. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(113)</sup></span> </p>
