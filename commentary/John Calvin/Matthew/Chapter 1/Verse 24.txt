<p><b>24.</b><i>Joseph, being raised from sleep</i> The ready performance, which is here described, serves not less to attest the certainty of Joseph’s faith, than to commend his obedience. For, if every scruple had not been removed, and his conscience fully pacified, he would never have proceeded so cheerfully, on a sudden change of opinion, <i>to take unto him his wife,</i> whose society, he lately thought, would pollute him. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(114)</sup></span> The dream must have carried some mark of Divinity, which did not allow his mind to hesitate. Next followed the effect of faith. Having learned the will of God, he instantly prepared himself to obey. </p>
