<p><b>3.</b><i>Judah begat Pharez and Zarah by Tamar</i> This was a prelude to that emptying of himself, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(89)</sup></span> of which Paul speaks, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>). The Son of God might have kept his descent unspotted and pure from every reproach or mark of infamy. But he came into the world to </p>
<p>“empty himself, and take upon him the form of a servant,” <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>) </p>
<p>to be </p>
<p>“a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people,” <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:6">Psalms 22:6</span>) </p>
<p>and at length to undergo the accursed death of the cross. He therefore did not refuse to admit a stain into his genealogy, arising from incestuous intercourse which took place among his ancestors. Though Tamar was not impelled by lust to seek connection with her father-in-law, yet it was in an unlawful manner that she attempted to revenge the injury which she had received. Judah again intended to commit fornication, and unknowingly to himself, met with his daughter-in-law. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(90)</sup></span> But the astonishing goodness of God strove with the sin of both; so that, nevertheless, this adulterous seed came to possess the scepter. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(91)</sup></span> </p>
