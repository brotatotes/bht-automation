<p><b>10.</b><i>For the laborer is worthy of his food.</i> Christ anticipates an objection that might be made: for it might appear to be a harsh condition to travel through the whole of Judea without any provisions. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(576)</sup></span> Accordingly, Christ tells them, that they have no reason to dread that they will suffer hunger; because, wherever they come, they will at least be <i>worthy of their food</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(577)</sup></span> He calls them <i>laborers,</i> not that they resembled ordinary ministers, who labor in the Lord’s vineyard, and who, by planting and watering, bring it into a state of cultivation; but merely because they were the heralds of a richer and more complete doctrine. They did not at that time receive the office of preaching any farther than to render the Jews attentive to the preaching of the Gospel. </p>
