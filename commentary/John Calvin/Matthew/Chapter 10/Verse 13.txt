<p><b>13.</b><i>If it be not worthy.</i> The import of this mode of expression may be thus stated, — “As their ingratitude makes them unworthy to enjoy the blessing of God which you have supplicated for them, break off every bond of communication.” The <i>word peace</i> refers to the mode of salutation which generally used among the Jews. As the Hebrew word <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">שלום</span></blu></heb>, <i>(shalom,) peace,</i> denotes <i>prosperity,</i> when they desire that any one may be well and happy, and that his affairs may succeed to his wish, they pray that he may have <i>peace</i> I do acknowledge that the apostles brought to men a different kind of peace, but it is too great a refinement of speculation to make this passage refer to the free reconciliation which takes place between God and men. </p>
