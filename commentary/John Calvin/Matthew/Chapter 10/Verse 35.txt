<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:35">Matthew 10:35</span></b><i>To set a man at variance</i> Hence we see more clearly what was stated a little before, that wars and tumults arise, contrary to the nature of the Gospel, through the fault of wicked men. What Malachi says about John the Baptist, [<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:5">Malachi 4:5</span> ] applies to all the ministers of Christ. They are sent for this purpose <i>to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers.</i> But in consequence of the malice of wicked men, those who were formerly combined no sooner hear the voice of Christ than they separate into opposite parties, and proceed so far as to break up the ties of relationship. In a word, Christ foretells that the world will come to such a state of confusion, that all the bonds of kindred will be treated with indifference, and humanity will be no longer regarded. When Micah complains [<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mic+7:6">Micah 7:6</span> ] that <i>a manâ€™s enemies are the men of his own house,</i> he deplores it as a state of extreme and ruinous corruption. Christ declares that the same thing will happen when his doctrine shall be published, which otherwise could not have been believed. At the same time, he does not mean that this will uniformly take place, as certain fretful persons foolishly imagine that it will be impossible for them to be good disciples without forsaking parents, children, and wives. On the contrary, every lawful bond of union is confirmed by unity of faith: only Christ warns his followers, that when it does happen, they must not be alarmed. </p>
