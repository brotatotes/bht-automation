<p><b>41.</b><i>He who receiveth a prophet</i> He begins with the prophets, but at length comes down to the lowest rank, and embraces all his disciples. In this manner he commends all, without exception, who truly worship God and love the gospel. <i>To receive</i> a person <i>in the name of a prophet,</i> or <i>in the name of a righteous man,</i> means to do them good for the sake of honoring their doctrine, or of paying respect to piety. Though God enjoins us to perform offices of kindness to all mankind, yet he justly elevates his people to a higher rank, that they may be the objects of peculiar regard and esteem. </p>
<p><i>Shall receive a prophet’s reward</i> This clause is variously interpreted by commentators. Some think that it denotes a mutual compensation, or, in other words, that spiritual benefits are bestowed on the <i>prophets</i> of God instead of temporal benefits. But if this exposition is admitted, what shall we say is meant by the <i>righteous man’s reward?</i> Others understand it to mean, that those who shall be kind to them will partake of the same <i>reward</i> which is laid up for <i>prophets</i> and <i>righteous</i> men. Some refer it to the intercourse of saints, and suppose it to mean, that as by our kind actions we give evidence that we are one body with the servants of Christ, so in this way we become partakers of all the blessings which Christ imparts to the members of his body. </p>
<p>I consider it simply as denoting the <i>reward</i> which corresponds to the rank of the person to whom kindness has been exercised; for Christ means that this will be a remarkable proof of the high estimation in which he holds his <i>prophets,</i> and indeed all his disciples. The greatness of the reward will make it evident, that not one kind office which was ever rendered to them has been forgotten. </p>
<p>By way of amplification, he promises a reward to the very meanest offices of kindness, such as <i>giving them a cup of cold water,</i> He gives the name of <i>little ones</i> not only to those who occupy the lowest place, or are held in least estimation in the Church, but to all his disciples, whom the pride of the world tramples under foot. </p>
