<p><b>7.</b><i>Preach, saying</i> This is the <i>preaching,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(571)</sup></span> I spoke of, by which Christ intended to arouse the minds of the nation to expect an approaching redemption. <i>The kingdom of heaven is at hand</i> For <i>the kingdom of heaven</i> Luke substitutes <i>the kingdom of God;</i> but the meaning is the same. It was to inform the Jews, first, that they owed their restoration to divine agency, and not to the kindness of men; secondly, that under the reign of God their condition would be prosperous; and, thirdly, that the happiness which had been promised to them was not earthly and fading, but heavenly and eternal. </p>
