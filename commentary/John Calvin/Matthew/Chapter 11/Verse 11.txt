<p><b>11.</b><i>Verily I say to you</i> These words not only maintain the authority of John, but elevate his doctrine above the ancient prophets, that the people may keep in view the right end of his ministry; for they mistook the design of his mission, and, in consequence of this, derived almost no advantage from his discourses. Accordingly, Christ extols and places him above the rank of the prophets, and gives the people to understand that he had received a special and more excellent commission. When he elsewhere says respecting himself that he was <i>not a Prophet,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:21">John 1:21</span>,) this is not inconsistent with the designation here bestowed upon him by Christ. He was, no doubt, a Prophet, like others whom God had appointed in his Church to be expounders of the Law, and messengers of his will; but he was <i>more excellent</i> than the Prophets in this respect, that he did not, like them, make known redemption at a distance and obscurely under shadows, but proclaimed that the time of redemption was now manifest and at hand. Such too is the import of Malachi’s prediction, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:1">Malachi 3:1</span>,) which is immediately added, that the pre-eminence of John consisted in his being the herald and forerunner of Christ; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(14)</sup></span> for although the ancient Prophets spoke of his kingdom, they were not, like John, placed <i>before his face,</i> to point him out as present. As to the other parts of the passage, the reader may consult what has been said on the first chapter of Luke’s Gospel. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(15)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>There hath not arisen</i> Our Lord proceeds farther, and declares that the ministers of the Gospel will be as far superior to John as John was superior to the Prophets. Those who think that Christ draws a comparison between himself and John have fallen into a strange blunder; for nothing is said here about personal rank, but commendation is bestowed on the pre-eminence of office. This appears more clearly from the words employed by Luke, <i>there is not a greater Prophet;</i> for they expressly restrict his eminence to the office of teaching. In a word, this magnificent eulogium is bestowed on John, that the Jews may observe more attentively the commission which he bore. Again, the teachers who were afterwards to follow are placed above him, to show the surpassing majesty of the Gospel above the Law, and above that preaching which came between them. Now, as Christ intended to prepare the Jews for receiving the Gospel, we ought also, in the present day, to be aroused to listen with reverence to Christ speaking to us from the lofty throne of his heavenly glory; lest he take revenge for our contempt of him by that fearful curse which he pronounces on unbelievers by Malachi in the same passage. </p>
<p><i>The kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God</i> denote the new condition of the Church, as in other passages which have already occurred; for it was promised that at the coming of Christ all things would be restored. <i>He that is least in the kingdom.</i> The Greek word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">μικρότερος</span></blu></grk>, which I have rendered <i>least,</i> is in the comparative degree, and signifies <i>less;</i> but the meaning is more clearly brought out, that all the ministers of the Gospel are included. Many of them undoubtedly have received a small portion of faith, and are therefore greatly inferior to John; but this does not prevent their preaching from being superior to his, because it holds out Christ as having rendered complete and eternal satisfaction by his one sacrifice, as the conqueror of death and the Lord of life, and because it withdraws the vail, and elevates believers to the heavenly sanctuary. </p>
