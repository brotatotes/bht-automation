<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:13">Matthew 11:13</span></b><b>.</b><i>All the Prophets and the Law itself Prophesied</i>. The word <i>prophesied</i> is emphatic; for <i>the Law and the Prophets</i> did not present God before the eyes of men, but represented him under figures and shadows as absent. The comparison, we now perceive, is intended to show, that it is highly criminal in men to remain indifferent, when they have obtained a manifestation of the presence of God, who held his ancient people in suspense by predictions. Christ does not class <i>John</i> with the ministers of the Gospel, though he formerly assigned to him an intermediate station between them and <i>the Prophets.</i> But there is no inconsistency here: for although Johnâ€™s preaching was a part of the Gospel, it was little more than a first lesson. </p>
