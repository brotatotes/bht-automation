<p><b>14.</b><i>And if you are willing to receive it</i> He now explains more clearly in what manner John began to preach <i>the kingdom of God</i> It was in the character of that <i>Elijah,</i> who was to be sent before the face of God, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:5">Malachi 4:5</span>.) Our Lord’s meaning therefore is, that <i>the great and dreadful day of the Lord,</i> which Malachi described, is now beheld by the Jews, when <i>Elijah,</i> who was there promised, discharges his office as a herald. Again, by this exception, <i>if you are willing to receive it,</i> he glances at their hardened obstinacy, in maliciously shutting their eyes against the clearest light. But will he cease to be <i>Elijah,</i> if he shall not be <i>received?</i> Christ does not mean that John’s official <i>character</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(17)</sup></span> depends on their approbation; but having declared that he is <i>Elijah,</i> he charges them with carelessness and ingratitude, if he does not obtain that respect to which he is entitled. </p>
