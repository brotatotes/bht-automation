<p><b>23.</b><i>And thou, Capernaum.</i> He expressly addresses the city of <i>Capernaum,</i> in which he had resided so constantly, that many supposed it to be his native place. It was indeed an inestimable honor, that the Son of God, when about to commence his reign and priesthood, had chosen <i>Capernaum</i> for the seat of his palace and sanctuary. And yet it was as deeply plunged in its filth, as if there had never been poured upon it a drop of Divine grace. On this account, Christ declares, that the punishment awaiting it will be the more dreadful, in proportion to the higher favors which it had received from God. It deserves our earnest attention in this passage, that the profanation of the gifts of God, as it involves sacrilege, will never pass unpunished; and that the more eminent any one is, he will be punished with the greater severity, if he shall basely pollute the gifts which God has bestowed upon him; and above all, an awful vengeance awaits us, if, after having received the spiritual gifts of Christ, we treat him and his Gospel with contempt. </p>
<p><i>If they had been done in Sodom.</i> We have already hinted, that Christ speaks after the manner of men, and does not bring forth, as from the heavenly sanctuary, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(45)</sup></span> what God foresaw would happen if he had sent a Prophet to the inhabitants of <i>Sodom.</i> But if quarrelsome persons are not satisfied with this answer, every ground of objection is removed by this single consideration, that although God had a remedy in his power for saving the inhabitants of <i>Sodom,</i> yet in destroying them he was a just avenger. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(46)</sup></span> </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(46)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Que toutesfois, en les destruisant et damnant, il n’a rien fait qui empesche qu’il ne soit tousiours recognue iuste en sa punition et sa vengeance</span></blu>;” — “that notwithstanding, in destroying and condemning them, He has done nothing to prevent Him from being always acknowledged to be righteous in His punishment and in His vengeance.” </p>
