<p><b>26.</b><i>Undoubtedly, O Father</i> This expression removes every pretense for that licentiousness of inquiry, to which we are continually excited. There is nothing which we yield to God with greater difficulty, than that his will shall be regarded by us as the highest reason and justice. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(63)</sup></span> He frequently repeats, that his <i>judgments are a deep abyss,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+36:6">Psalms 36:6</span>;) but we plunge with headlong violence into that depth, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(64)</sup></span> and if there is any thing that does not please us, we gnash our teeth, or murmur against him, and many even break out into open blasphemies. On the contrary, our Lord lays down to us this rule, that whatever God has determined must be regarded by us as right. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(65)</sup></span> This is sober wisdom, to acquiesce in the good pleasure of God as alone equal to a thousand arguments. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(66)</sup></span> Christ might indeed have brought forward the causes of that distinction, if there were any; but he is satisfied with the good pleasure of God, and inquires no farther why he calls to salvation <i>little children</i> rather than others, and composes his kingdom out of an obscure flock. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(67)</sup></span> Hence it is evident, that men direct their fury against Christ, when, on learning that some are freely chosen, and others are reprobated, by the will of God, they storm because they find it unpleasant to yield to God. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(68)</sup></span> </p>
