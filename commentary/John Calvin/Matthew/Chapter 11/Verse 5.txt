<p><b>5.</b><i>The poor receive the message of the Gospel</i> By <i>the poor</i> are undoubtedly meant those whose condition is wretched and despicable, and who are held in no estimation. However mean any person may be, his poverty is so far from being a ground of despair, that it ought rather to animate him with courage to seek Christ. But let us remember that none are accounted <i>poor</i> but those who are really such, or, in other words, who lie low and overwhelmed by a conviction of their poverty. </p>
