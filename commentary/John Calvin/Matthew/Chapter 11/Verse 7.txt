<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:7">Matthew 11:7</span></b><b>.</b><i>And while they were departing</i> Christ praises John before the people, in order that they may state from recollection what they have heard from him, and may give credit to his testimony. For his name was widely celebrated, and men spoke of him in lofty terms: but his doctrine was held in less estimation, and there were even few that waited on his ministrations. Christ reminds them, that those who <i>went out to see him in the wilderness</i> lost their pains, if they did not devoutly apply their minds and faculties to his doctrine. The meaning of the words, <i>you went out into the wilderness,</i> is this: <i>“Your</i> journey would have been an act of foolish and ridiculous levity, if you had not a fixed object in view. But it was neither worldly splendor nor any sort of amusement <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(12)</sup></span> that you were in quest of: your design was, to hear the voice of God from the mouth of the Prophet. If therefore you would reap advantage from your undertaking, it is necessary that what he spoke should remain fixed in your memory.” </p>
