<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:1">Matthew 12:1</span></b><b>.</b><i>Jesus was walking on the Sabbath</i> It was the design of the Evangelists, in this history, to show partly what a malicious disposition the Pharisees had, and partly how superstitiously they were attached to outward and slight matters, so as to make holiness to consist in them entirely. They blame the disciples of Christ for <i>plucking the ears of corn on the Sabbath,</i> during their journey, when they were pressed with hunger, as if, by so doing, they were violating the <i>Sabbath.</i> The keeping of the <i>Sabbath</i> was, indeed, a holy thing, but not such a manner of keeping it as they imagined, so that one could scarcely move a finger without making the conscience to tremble. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(76)</sup></span> It was hypocrisy, therefore, that made them so exact in trifling matters, while they spared themselves in gross superstitions; as Christ elsewhere upbraids them with </p>
<p>paying tithe of mint and anise, and neglecting the <br>important matters of the Law, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:23">Matthew 23:23</span>.) </br></p>
<p>It is the invariable practice of hypocrites to allow themselves liberty in matters of the greatest consequence, and to pay close attention to ceremonial observances. Another reason why they demand that outward rites should be more rigorously observed is, that they wish to make their duty toward God to consist only in carnal worship. But it was malevolence and envy, still more than superstition, that led them to this act of censure; for towards others they would not have been equally stern. It is proper for us to observe the feelings by which they were animated, lest any one should be distressed by the fact, that the very Doctors of the Law were so hostile to Christ. </p>
