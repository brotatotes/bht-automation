<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:16">Matthew 12:16</span></b><b>.</b><i>And he threatened them.</i> The expression used by M<i>ark</i> conveys, in a still more pointed manner, that he restrained the <i>unclean spirits,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(89)</sup></span> who were exclaiming, <i>Thou art the Son of God.</i> We have formerly explained the reason why he did not choose to have such witnesses. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(90)</sup></span> And yet there is no room to doubt, that divine power extorted from the devils this confession; but having made it evident that they were subject to his dominion, Christ properly rejected their testimony. But <i>Matthew</i> goes farther, and states, that Christ discharged them from spreading the fame of the miracles which he was performing. Not that he wished that fame to be wholly repressed, (as we have pointed out on other occasions, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(91)</sup></span> but to allow it to strike root, that it might bring forth abundant fruit at the proper season. We know that Christ did not perform miracles for the purpose of amusement, but had a distinct object in view, which was to prove that he was the Son of God, and the appointed Redeemer of the world. But he was manifested gradually, and by regular steps, and was not revealed in his true character </p>
<p>“until the time appointed by the Father,” <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:2">Galatians 4:2</span>.) </p>
<p>At the same time, it deserves our attention, that when wicked men do their utmost to extinguish the glory of God, they are so far from gaining their wish, that, on the contrary, God turns their rebellious designs in an opposite direction. Though Christ withdrew from a populous district, yet in this very concealment <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(92)</sup></span> his glory continues to shine, and even bursts forth magnificently into its full splendor. </p>
