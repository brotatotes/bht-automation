<p><b>17.</b><i>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken</i> Matthew does not mean that this prediction was entirely fulfilled by Christ’s prohibiting loud and general reports to be circulated respecting his power <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(93)</sup></span>, but that this was an exhibition of that mildness which Isaiah describes in the person of the Messiah. Those wonderful works which Christ performed in presence of a few, and which he did not wish to be announced in pompous terms, were fitted to <i>shake heaven and earth,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:26">Hebrews 12:26</span>.) It was, therefore, no ordinary proof, how widely he was removed from the pomp and ostentation of the world. </p>
<p>But it will be proper for us to examine more closely the design of Matthew. By this circumstance he intended to show, that the glory of Christ’s divinity ought not to be the less admired, because it appeared under a vail of infirmity. This is unquestionably the very object to which the Holy Spirit directed the eyes of the prophet. The flesh is constantly longing for outward display, and to guard believers against seeking any thing of this description in the Messiah, the Spirit of God declared that he would be totally different from earthly kings, who, in order to draw admiration upon themselves, produce great noises wherever they go, and fill cities and towns with commotion. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(94)</sup></span> We now perceive how appropriately Matthew applies the prediction of the prophet to the case in hand. God appointed for his Son a low and mean appearance, and that ignorant persons may not take offense at an aspect which has no attraction, and is fitted to awaken contempt, both the prophet and Matthew come forward to declare, that it is not by accident, but in consequence of a decree of Heaven, that he assumes such a character. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(95)</sup></span> Hence it follows, that deep blame attaches to all who despise Christ, because his outward condition does not correspond to the wishes of the flesh. We are not at liberty to imagine to ourselves a Christ that corresponds to our fancy, but ought simply to embrace him as he is offered by the Father. He who is offended by the low condition of Christ, which God declares to be agreeable to his will, is unworthy of salvation. I now come to examine the words of the prophet, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:1">Isaiah 42:1</span>.) </p>
