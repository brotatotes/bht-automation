<p><b>20.</b><i>Till he send out judgment into victory.</i> The words of the prophet are a little different, <i>he will bring forth the judgment unto truth.</i> But the term employed by Matthew is very emphatic, and is intended to inform us, that <i>justice</i> is not established in the world without a great struggle and exertion. The devil throws all possible difficulties in the way, which cannot be removed without violent opposition. This is confirmed by the word <i>victory,</i> for victory is not obtained in any other way than by fighting. </p>
