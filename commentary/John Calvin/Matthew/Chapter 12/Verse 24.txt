<p><b>24.</b><i>But when the Pharisees heard it.</i> The scribes cannot withhold the acknowledgment of a fact so open and manifest, and yet they maliciously carp <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(105)</sup></span> at what Christ did by Divine power. Not only do they obscure the praise of the miracle, but endeavor to turn it into a reproach, as if it were performed by magical enchantment; and that work, which could not be ascribed to a man, is alleged by them to have the devil for its author. Of the word <i>Beelzebub</i> I have spoken under the Tenth Chapter, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(106)</sup></span> and of <i>the prince of the devils</i> I have said a little under the Ninth Chapter. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(107)</sup></span> The opinion expressed by the scribes, that there is a <i>prince</i> among wicked spirits, did not arise from a mistake of the common people, or from supposition, but from a conviction entertained among the godly, that the reprobate have a head, in the same manner as Christ is the Head of the Church. </p>

The reader must have observed that, when our Author has explained a phrase or illustrated a fact, he seldom repeats what he had said, but refers to the earlier portions of his work, in which the information may be found. It is not improbable that this may have been his leading motive for adopting the plan of a <i>Harmony,</i> instead of writing a separate Commentary on each Gospel. He had made some observations on <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:34">Matthew 9:34</span>, <i>But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils by the prince of the devils;</i> and takes for granted, that the terms which occur in that passage require no farther elucidation. But it would appear to have escaped his recollection that, on the occasion alluded to, he satisfied himself with general remarks on the “wicked slander” of the Pharisees, and took no notice of the phrase, <i>prince of the devils.</i> The deficiency is partly supplied by an explanation which he now makes. -- <i>Ed.</i> </p>
