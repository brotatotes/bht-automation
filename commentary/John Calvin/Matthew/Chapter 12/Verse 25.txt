<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:25">Matthew 12:25</span></b><b>.</b><i>But as Jesus knew their thoughts.</i> Though Christ knew sufficiently well, and had often learned by experience, that the scribes, in the exercise of their malice <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(116)</sup></span> were in the habit of putting an unfavorable construction on every thing that he did, yet Matthew and Luke, I have no doubt, mean that Christ was a discerner of their hearts. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(117)</sup></span> And indeed it is probable, that they spoke so openly against Christ, that their calumnies reached his ears; but Christ knew by his Divine Spirit the dispositions which led them to slander him. For it frequently happens that erroneous judgments are formed by men who do not intentionally, after all, oppose what is right, but err through ignorance; who do not cherish a hidden and concealed venom, but whose rashness carries them headlong. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(118)</sup></span> The meaning therefore is, that Christ reproved them with the greater severity, because he was a witness and judge of their inward malice. </p>
<p><i>Every kingdom divided against itself.</i> In refuting the calumny alleged against him, he first quotes a common proverb. This refutation may appear to be not quite satisfactory. We know what subtle methods Satan sometimes employs, presenting all the while an appearance of discord, in order to entrap the minds of men by superstitions. Thus, for example, the exorcisms of Popery are nothing else than feats of dexterity, in which Satan pretends to fight with himself. But no suspicion of this nature fell on Christ; for he cast out devils in such a manner, as to restore to God the men in whom they dwelt sound and whole. Whenever Satan enters into a collusion with himself, he pretends to be vanquished, and yet it is himself that triumphs. But Christ attacked Satan in open combat, threw him down, and left him nothing remaining. He did not lay him low in one respect, that he might give him greater stability in another, but stripped him completely of all his armor. Christ therefore reasons justly, that there is no community of interest between him and Satan, because that father of cunning <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(119)</sup></span> keeps one object in view — the preservation of his kingdom. </p>
<p>But perhaps it will be objected, that the devils are often hurried along, by giddiness and blind madness, to destroy themselves. The answer is easy. The words of Christ mean nothing more than that it was absurd in the scribes to maintain, that the devil, who endeavors by every method to make men his slaves, should, of his own accord, destroy the power which he possessed over them. Besides, it ought to be remembered, that common proverbs were employed by Christ in such a manner, as to be merely probable conjectures, and not solid arguments; and that, when he speaks of what is known and well attested, he finds it easier to reach the conscience of his adversaries. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(120)</sup></span> Everybody knew that Christ had driven Satan from his possession, and nothing was plainer than that all his miracles tended to this object; and hence it was easy to conclude, that his power, which was so much opposed to Satan, was divine. </p>
