<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:3">Matthew 12:3</span></b><b>.</b><i>Have you not read what David did?</i> Christ employs five arguments to refute their calumny. <i>First,</i> he apologizes for his disciples by pleading the example of <i>David,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1sa+21:6">1 Samuel 21:6</span>.) While David was fleeing from the rage of Saul, he applied for provisions to the high-priest Ahimelech; and there being no ordinary food at hand, he succeeded in obtaining a part of the holy bread. If David’s necessity excused him, the same argument ought to be admitted in the case of others. Hence it follows, that the ceremonies of the Law are not violated where there is no infringement of godliness. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(77)</sup></span> Now Christ takes for granted, that David was free from blame, because the Holy Spirit bestows commendation on the priest who allowed him to partake of the holy bread. When he says, that <i>it was not lawful to eat</i> that bread <i>but for the priests alone,</i> we must understand him to refer to the ordinary law: </p>
<p>they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, <br/>to consecrate and to sanctify them; but a stranger shall not <br/>eat thereof, because they are holy, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:33">Exodus 29:33</span>.) </p>
<p>If David had attempted to do what was contrary to law, it would have been in vain for Christ to plead his example; for what had been prohibited for a particular end no necessity could make lawful. </p>
