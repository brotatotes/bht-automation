<p><b>30.</b><i>He that is not with me.</i> There are two ways of explaining this passage. Some suppose that it is an argument drawn from contraries, and that Christ’s meaning is: <i>“</i> I cannot reign till the devil is overthrown; for the object of all his attempts is, to <i>scatter</i> whatever I <i>gather.”</i> And certainly we see abundant evidence of the earnestness with which that enemy labors to destroy the kingdom of Christ. But I rather agree in opinion with those who explain it to denote, that the scribes are declared to be, in two respects, opposed to the kingdom of God, because they intentionally hinder its progress. <i>“</i> It was your duty to assist me, and to give me your hand in establishing the kingdom of God; for whoever does not assist is, in some measure, opposed to me, or, at least, deserves to be reckoned among enemies. What then shall be said of you, whose furious rage drives you into avowed opposition?<i>”</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(126)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>And he that gathereth not with me scattereth</i> The truth of this is abundantly manifest from what has been already said; for so strong is our propensity to evil, that the justice of God can have no place but in those who apply to it in good earnest. This doctrine has a still more extensive bearing, and implies that they are unworthy to be considered as belonging to the flock of Christ, who do not apply to it all the means that are in their power; because their indolence tends to retard and ruin the kingdom of God, which all of us are called to advance. </p>
