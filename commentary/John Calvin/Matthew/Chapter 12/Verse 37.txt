<p><b>37.</b><i>By thy words thou shalt be justified</i> This was a common proverb, which he applied to the present subject; for I have no doubt that this was a saying which the people had frequently in their mouths, that “every man is condemned or acquitted by his own acknowledgment.” But Christ turns it to a meaning somewhat different, that a wicked speech, being the indication of concealed malice, is enough to condemn a man. The attempt which the Papists make to torture this passage, so as to set aside the righteousness of faith, is childish. A man is <i>justified by his words,</i> not because his <i>speech</i> is the ground of his justification, (for we obtain by faith the favor of God, so that he reckons us to be righteous persons;) but because pure <i>speech</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(142)</sup></span> absolves us in such a manner, that we are not condemned as wicked persons by our tongue. Is it not absurd to infer from this, that men deserve a single drop of righteousness in the sight of God? On the contrary, this passage upholds our doctrine; for, although Christ does not here treat of the ground of our justification, yet the contrast between the two words points out the meaning of the word <i>justify.</i> The Papists reckon it absurd in us to say, that a man is justified by faith, because they explain the word <i>justified</i> to mean, that he becomes, and is, actually righteous; while we understand it to mean, that he is accounted righteous, and is <i>acquitted</i> before the tribunal of God, as is evident from numerous passages of Scripture. And is not the same thing confirmed by Christ, when he draws a contrast between <i>justified</i> and <i>condemned?</i> </p>
