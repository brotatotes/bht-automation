<p><b>42.</b><i>The queen of the south.</i> As Ethiopia lies in a southerly direction from Judea, I willingly concur with Josephus and other writers, who assert that she was the queen of Ethiopia. In sacred history she is called <i>the queen of Sheba,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ch+9:1">2 Chronicles 9:1</span>.) We must not suppose this <i>Sheba</i> to be the country of <i>Saba,</i> which rather lay toward the east, but a town situated in Meroe, an island on the Nile, which was the metropolis of the kingdom. Here, too, we must attend to the points of contrast. A woman who had not been at all educated in the school of God, was induced, by the desire of instruction, to come from a distant region to Solomon, an earthly king; while the Jews, who had been instructed in the divine law, reject their highest and only teacher, the Prince of all the prophets. The word <i>condemn</i> relates not to the persons, but to the fact itself, and the example which it yields. </p>
