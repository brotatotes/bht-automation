<p><b>5.</b><i>That on the Sabbaths the priests profane the Sabbath.</i> This is the <i>second</i> argument by which Christ proves that the violation of the Sabbath, of which the Pharisees complained, was free from all blame; because <i>on the Sabbaths</i> it is lawful to slay beasts for sacrifice, to circumcise infants, and to do other things relating to the worship of God. Hence it follows, that the duties of piety are in no degree inconsistent with each other. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(78)</sup></span> But if <i>the temple</i> sanctifies manual operations connected with sacrifices, and with the whole of the outward service, the holiness of the true and spiritual <i>temple</i> has greater efficacy, in exempting its worshippers from all blame, while they are discharging the duties of godliness. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(79)</sup></span> Now the object which the disciples had in view was, to present to God souls which were consecrated by the Gospel. </p>
<p>Matthew alone glances at this argument. When Christ says, that <i>the priests Profane the Sabbath,</i> the expression is not strictly accurate, and is accommodated to his hearers; for when the Law enjoins men to abstain from their employments, it does not forbid them to perform the services of religion. But Christ admits that to be true which might appear to be so in the eye of ignorant persons, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(80)</sup></span> and rests satisfied with proving, that the labors performed in the temple are not offensive to God. </p>
