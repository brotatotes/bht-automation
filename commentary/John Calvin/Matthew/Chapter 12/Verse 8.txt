<p><b>8.</b><i>For the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath.</i> Some connect this sentence with a preceding statement, <i>that one greater than the temple is in this place,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:6">Matthew 12:6</span>;) but I look upon them as different. In the former case, Christ, by an allusion to <i>the temple,</i> affirmed that whatever was connected with his personal holiness was not a transgression of the Law; but now, he declares that he has received authority to exempt his followers from the necessity of observing the Sabbath. <i>The Son of man,</i> (he says,) in the exercise of his authority, can relax the Sabbath in the same manner as other legal ceremonies. And certainly out of Christ the bondage of the Law is wretched, from which he alone delivers those on whom he bestows the free <i>Spirit of adoption,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(82)</sup></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>.) </p>
