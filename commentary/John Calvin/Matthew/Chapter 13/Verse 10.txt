10.The disciples approaching said to him. From the words of Matthew it is evident, that the disciples did not merely look to themselves, but wished also to consult the benefit of others. Being unable to comprehend the parable, they concluded that it would be as little understood by the people; and, therefore, they complain that Christ employed language from which his hearers could derive no profit. Now though parables are generally found to illustrate the subject of which they treat, yet the uninterrupted course of a metaphor may lead to obscurity. (175) So then Christ, in delivering this parable, intended to wrap up, in an allegory, what he might have said more plainly and fully, without a figure. (176) But now that the exposition is added, the figurative discourse has greater energy and force than if it had been simple: by which is meant, that it is not only fitted to produce a more powerful impression on the mind, but is also more clear. So highly important is the manner in which any thing is said. (177) (175) “Si est-ce toutesfois qu’elles sont obscures et enveloppees, quand on continue tousiours la metaphore sans rien y entremesler;” — “yet they are obscure and involved, when the metaphor is constantly pursued, without any thing being intermingled with it.” (176) “En usant de termes communs;” — “by using ordinary terms.” (177) “Voyla comme il y a bien a regarder comment on couche ou on deduit un propos;” — “this shows us the great attention that is due to the manner in which a discourse is expressed or conveyed.”
