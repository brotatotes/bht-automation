<p><b>12.</b><i>For whosoever hath, it shall be given to him.</i> Christ pursues the subject which I have just mentioned; for he reminds his disciples how kindly God acts towards them, that they may more highly prize his grace, and may acknowledge themselves to be under deeper obligations to his kindness. The same words he afterwards repeats, but in a different sense, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:29">Matthew 25:29</span>;) for on that occasion the discourse relates to the lawful use of gifts. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(183)</sup></span> But here he simply teaches, that more is <i>given</i> to the apostles than to the generality of men, because the heavenly Father is pleased to display in perfection his kindness towards them. </p>
<p>He does not forsake the work of his own hand, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+138:8">Psalms 138:8</span>.) </p>
<p>Those whom he has once begun to form are continually polished more and more, till they are at length brought to the highest perfection. The multiplied favors which are continually flowing from him to us, and the joyful progress which we make, spring from God’s contemplation of his own liberality, which prompts him to an uninterrupted course of bounty. And as his riches are inexhaustible, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(184)</sup></span> so he is never wearied with enriching his children. Whenever he advances us to a higher degree, let us remember that every increase of the favors which we daily receive from him flows from this source, that it is his purpose to complete the work, of our salvation already commenced. On the other hand, Christ declares that the reprobate are continually proceeding from bad to worse, till, at length exhausted, they waste away in their own poverty. </p>
<p><i>And he that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken from him.</i> This may appear to be a harsh expression; but instead of saying, that <i>what</i> the ungodly <i>have not is taken from them,</i> Luke softens the harshness and removes the ambiguity by a slight change of the words: <i>and whosoever hath not, even that which he thinketh that he hath shall be taken from him.</i> And indeed it frequently happens, that the reprobate are endued with eminent gifts, and appear to resemble the children of God: but there is nothing of real value about them; for their mind is destitute of piety, and has only the glitter of an empty show. <i>Matthew</i> is therefore justified in saying that they <i>have nothing;</i> for what they have is of no value in the sight of God, and has no permanency within. Equally appropriate is the statement of <i>Luke,</i> that the gifts, with which they have been endued, are corrupted by them, so that they shine only in the eyes of men, but have nothing more than splendor and empty display. Hence, also let us learn to aim at progress throughout our whole life; for God grants to us the taste of his heavenly doctrine on the express condition, that we feed on it abundantly from day to day, till we come to be fully satiated with it. </p>
<p>The manner in which <i>Mark</i> introduces this sentence has some appearance of confusion. <i>Consider,</i> says our Lord, <i>what you hear;</i> and then, if they make due progress, he holds out the expectation of more plentiful grace: <i>it shall be added to you that hear</i> Lastly, follows the clause which agrees with the words of <i>Matthew,</i> but is inserted in the middle of a sentence which I expounded under the seventh chapter of <i>Matthew;</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(185)</sup></span> for it is not probable that they are here placed in their proper order. The Evangelists, as we have remarked on former occasions, were not very exact in arranging Christ’s discourses, but frequently throw together a variety of sayings uttered by him. <i>Luke</i> mixes this sentence with other discourses of Christ spoken at different times, and likewise points out a different purpose for which Christ used these words. It was that they might be attentive to his doctrine, and not permit the seed of life to pass away unimproved, which ought to be cordially received, and take root in their minds. “Beware,” he says, “lest what has been given be taken away from you, if it yield no fruit.” </p>
