<p><b>14.</b><i>And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah.</i> He confirms his statement by a prediction of <i>Isaiah,</i> that it is far from being a new thing, if many persons derive no advantage from the word of God, which was formerly appointed to the ancient people, for the purpose of inducing greater blindness. This passage of the Prophet is quoted, in a variety of ways, in the New Testament. Paul quotes it (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:26">Acts 28:26</span>) to charge the Jews with obstinate malice, and says that they were blinded by the light of the Gospel, because they were bitter and rebellious against God. There he points out the immediate cause which appeared in the men themselves. But in the Epistle to the Romans (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:7">Romans 11:7</span>) he draws the distinction from a deeper and more hidden source; for he tells us, that <i>the remnant was saved according to the election of grace,</i> and that <i>the rest were blinded, according as it is written.</i> The contrast must there be observed; for if it is <i>the election</i> of God, and an undeserved <i>election,</i> which alone saves any remnant of the people, it follows that all others perish by a hidden, though just, judgment of God. Who are the <i>rest,</i> whom Paul contrasts with the <i>elect remnant,</i> but those on whom God has not bestowed a special salvation? </p>
<p>Similar reasoning may be applied to the passage in John, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:38">John 12:38</span>;) for he says that <i>many believed not,</i> because no man believes, except he to whom God <i>reveals his arm,</i> and immediately adds, that <i>they could not believe, because it is again written, Blind the heart of this people.</i> Such, too is the object which Christ has in view, when he ascribes it to the secret purpose of God, that the truth of the Gospel is not revealed indiscriminately to all, but is exhibited at a distance under obscure forms, so as to have no other effect than to overspread the minds of the people with grosser darkness. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(186)</sup></span> In all cases, I admit, those whom God blinds will be found to deserve this condemnation; but as the immediate cause is not always obvious in the persons of men, let it be held as a fixed principle, that God enlightens to salvation, and that by a peculiar gift, those whom He has freely chosen; and that all the reprobate are deprived of the light of life, whether God withholds his word from them, or keeps their eyes and ears closed, that they do not hear or see. </p>
<p><i>Hearing you shall hear.</i> We now perceive the manner in which Christ applies the prediction of the prophet to the present occasion. He does not quote the prophet’s words, nor was it necessary; for Christ reckoned it enough to show, that it was no new or uncommon occurrence, if many were hardened by the word of God. The words of the prophet were, </p>
<p>Go, blind their minds, and harden their hearts, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:10">Isaiah 6:10</span>.) </p>
<p>Matthew ascribes this to the hearers, that they may endure the blame of their own blindness and hardness; for the one cannot be separated from the other. All who have been <i>given over to a reprobate mind</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:28">Romans 1:28</span>) do voluntarily, and from inward malice, blind and harden themselves. Nor can it be otherwise, wherever the Spirit of God does not reign, by whom the elect alone are governed. Let us, therefore, attend to this connection, that all whom God does not enlighten with the Spirit of adoption are men of unsound mind; and that, while they are more and more blinded by the word of God, the blame rests wholly on themselves, because this blindness is voluntary. Again, the ministers of the word ought to seek consolation from this passage, if the success of their labors does not always correspond to their wish. Many are so far from profiting by their instruction, that they are rendered worse by it. What has befallen them was experienced by a Prophet, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(187)</sup></span> to whom they are not superior. It were, indeed, to be wished, that they should bring all under subjection to God; and they ought to labor and strive for that end. But let them not wonder if that judgment, which God anciently displayed through the ministration of the Prophet, is likewise fulfilled at the present day. At the same time, we ought to be extremely careful, that the fruit of the Gospel be not lost through our negligence. </p>
