<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:15">Matthew 13:15</span></b><b>.</b><i>Lest I should heal them</i> In the word <i>healing,</i> Matthew, as well as the Prophet, includes deliverance from every evil; for a people afflicted by the hand of God is metaphorically compared by them to a sick man. They say that <i>healing</i> is bestowed, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(188)</sup></span> when the Lord releases from punishment. But as this healing depends on the pardon of sins, <i>Mark</i> describes appropriately and justly its cause and source, <i>lest they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them</i> For whence comes the mitigation of chastisements, but because God has been reconciled to us, and makes us the objects of his blessing? Sometimes, no doubt, after removing our guilt, he continues to punish us, either with the view of humbling us the more, or of making us more cautious for the future. And yet, not only does he show evidences of his favor by restoring us to life and health; but as punishments usually terminate when the guilt is removed, <i>healing</i> and <i>forgiveness</i> are properly introduced together. It must not, however, be concluded, that repentance is the cause of pardon, as if God received into his favor <i>converted</i> men, because they deserved it; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(189)</sup></span> for <i>conversion</i> itself is a mark of God’s free favor. Nothing more is expressed than such an order and connection, that God does not forgive the sins of any but those who are dissatisfied with themselves. </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(189)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Il ne faut pas conclurre par cela que la repentance, ou conversion, soit cause de nous faire avoir remission et pardon de nos pechez; comme si Dieu prenoit a merci ceux qui se convertissent, pource qu’ils en sont dignes, et le meritent</span></blu>;” — “we must not therefore conclude, that repentance, or conversion, is the cause of making us have forgiveness and pardon of our sins; as if God exercised mercy towards those who are converted, because they are worthy of it, and deserve it.” </p>
