<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:19">Matthew 13:19</span></b><b>.</b><i>When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not.</i> He mentions, in the first place, the barren and uncultivated, who do not receive the seed within, because there is no preparation in their hearts. Such persons he compares to a stiff and dry soil, like what we find on a public road, which is trodden down, and becomes hard, like a pavement. I wish that we had not occasion to see so many of this class at the present day, who come forward to hear, but remain in a state of amazement, and acquire no relish for the word, and in the end differ little from blocks or stones. Need we wonder that they utterly vanish away? </p>
<p><i>That which was sown in their heart.</i> This expression, which Christ employs, is not strictly accurate, and yet it is not without meaning; for the wickedness and depravity of men do not make the word to lose its own nature, or to cease to have the character of seed. This must be carefully observed, that we may not suppose the favors of God to cease to be what they are, though the good effect of them does not reach us. With respect to God, the word <i>is sown in the hearts,</i> but it is far from being true, that the hearts of all <i>receive with meekness</i> what is planted in them, as James (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:21">James 1:21</span>) exhorts us to <i>receive the word.</i> So then the Gospel is always a fruitful seed as to its power, but not as to its produce. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(199)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Luke adds, that <i>the devil</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(200)</sup></span> <i>taketh away the seed out of their heart, that they may not believe and be saved</i> Hence we infer that, as hungry birds are wont to do at the time of sowing, this enemy of our salvation, as soon as the doctrine is delivered, watches and rushes forth to seize it, before it acquires moisture and springs up. It is no ordinary praise of the word, when it is pronounced to be the cause of our salvation. </p>
