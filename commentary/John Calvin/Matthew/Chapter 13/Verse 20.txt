<p><b>20.</b><i>But he that received the seed thrown into stony places.</i> This class differs from the former; for temporary faith, being a sort of vegetation of the seed, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(201)</sup></span> promises at first some fruit; but their hearts are not so properly and thoroughly subdued, as to have the softness necessary for their continued nourishment. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(202)</sup></span> We see too many of this class in our own day, who eagerly embrace the Gospel, and shortly afterwards fall off; for they have not the lively affection that is necessary to give them firmness and perseverance. Let every one then examine himself thoroughly, that the alacrity which gives out a bright flame may not quickly go out, as the saying is, like a fire of tow; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(203)</sup></span> for if the word does not fully penetrate the whole heart, and strike its roots deep, faith will want the supply of moisture that is necessary for perseverance. Great commendation is due, no doubt, to that promptitude, which receives the word of God with joy, and without delay, as soon as it is published; but let us learn, that nothing has been done, till faith acquires true firmness, that it may not wither in the first blade. </p>
