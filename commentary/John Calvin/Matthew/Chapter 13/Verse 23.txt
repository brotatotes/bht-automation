<p><b>23.</b><i>But he that received the seed into a good soil. None are compared by Christ to a good and fertile soil,</i> but those in whom the word of God not only strikes its roots deep and solid, but overcomes every obstacle that would prevent it from yielding fruit. Is it objected that it is impossible to find any one who is pure and free from thorns? It is easy to reply, that Christ does not now speak of the perfection of faith, but only points out those in whom the word of God yields fruit. Though the produce may not be great, yet every one who does not fall off from the sincere worship of God is reckoned a <i>good and fertile soil</i> We ought to labor, no doubt, to pull out the <i>thorns;</i> but as our utmost exertion will never succeed so well, but that there will always be some remaining behind, let each of us endeavor, at least, to deaden them, that they may not hinder the fruit of the word. This statement is confirmed by what immediately follows, when Christ informs us that all do not yield fruit in an equal degree. </p>
<p><i>Some a hundred-fold, and some sixty-fold, and some thirty-fold.</i> Though the fertility of that soil, which yields a <i>thirty-fold</i> produce, is small, compared with that which yields a <i>hundred-fold,</i> yet we perceive that our Lord classes together all kinds of soil which do not entirely disappoint the labors and expectation of the husbandman. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(206)</sup></span> Hence too we learn, that we have no right to despise those who occupy a lower degree of excellence; for the master of the house himself, though he gives to one the preference above another on account of more abundant produce, yet bestows the general designation, <i>good,</i> even on inferior soils. Those three gradations are absurdly tortured by <i>Jerome,</i> to denote virgins, widows, and married persons; as if that produce which the Lord demands from us belonged to celibacy alone, and as if the piety of married persons did not, in many cases, yield more abundantly every fruit of virtue. It must also be observed, in passing, that what Christ says about a <i>hundred-fold</i> produce is not hyperbolical; for such was at that time the fertility of some countries, as we learn from many historians, who give their report as eye-witnesses. </p>
