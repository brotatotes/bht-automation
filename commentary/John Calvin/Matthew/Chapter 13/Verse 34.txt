<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:34">Matthew 13:34</span></b><b>.</b><i>All these things Jesus spoke in parables.</i> Though Mark expressly says, that Christ <i>spoke the word to them as they were able to bear it,</i> yet I think it probable that he continued to employ <i>parables,</i> not so much for the purpose of instruction, as to keep the attention of his hearers awake till a more convenient time. For why did he explain them familiarly to his disciples when they were apart? Was it because they were more slow of apprehension than the great body of the people? No; but because he wished to convey to them privately a knowledge of his meaning, and to allow others to remain in a state of suspense, till a fitter opportunity should arrive. These were only a sort of introduction to the Gospel, the full brightness and publication of which was delayed till the proper time. </p>
<p>There is an apparent contradiction between this statement of Matthew and the prediction of Isaiah, which was quoted a little before. But this is easily removed; for, though he withdrew the light of doctrine from the reprobate, yet this did not prevent him from accommodating himself to their capacity, so as to render them inexcusable. He therefore adopted a method of teaching which was proper and suitable to hearers, whom he knew to be not yet sufficiently prepared to receive instruction. </p>
