<p><b>35.</b><i>That it might be fulfilled</i> Matthew does not mean, that the psalm, which he quotes, is a prediction which relates peculiarly to Christ, but that, as the majesty of the Spirit was displayed in the discourse of the Prophet, in the same manner was his power manifested in the discourse of Christ. The Prophet, when he is about to speak of God’s covenant, by which he adopted the seed of Abraham, of the benefits which he continued to bestow upon his people, and of the whole government of the Church, introduces his subject in lofty terms, <i>I will open my mouth in parables,</i> ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:2">Psalms 78:2</span>:) that is, “I will not speak of trifling matters, but will handle with becoming gravity subjects of the highest importance.” When he adds, <i>I will utter dark sayings,</i> the meaning is the same; such repetitions being very frequent in the Psalms. The Hebrew word <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">משלים</span></blu></heb>, <i>(Meshalim)</i> signifies <i>comparisons;</i> and it came afterwards to be applied to “weighty sentences,” because <i>comparisons</i> generally impart beauty and energy to a discourse. The word <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">חידות</span></blu></heb> <i>(Chidoth)</i> sometimes denotes <i>“riddles,”</i> and at other times, “short sayings.” </p>
<p>Now though Matthew seems to allude to the word <i>parable,</i> he undoubtedly means, that Christ spoke figuratively, in order that his very style, being more brilliant than ordinary discourse, might carry more weight and dignity. In short, he says that what is contained in the psalm was <i>fulfilled;</i> because the use of allegories and figures tended to show, that Christ was treating of the hidden mysteries of God, and to prevent his doctrine from being despised. Hence, too, we infer, that there was no inconsistency in the various objects which Christ had in view, when he spoke to the people in a dark manner. Though he intended to conceal from the reprobate what he was saying, yet he labored to make them feel, even in the midst of their amazement, that there was something heavenly and divine in his language. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(225)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(225)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Car combien qu’il voulust parler en telle sorte que les reprouvez n’y entendissent rien, il a toutesfois tellement modere son style, qu’en leur stupidite ils ont senti que son parler avoit quelque vertu celeste et Divine</span></blu>;” — “for, though he intended to speak in such a manner, that the reprobate might understand nothing of it, yet he was so regulated in his style that, amidst their stupidity, they felt that his manner of speaking had some Divine and heavenly power.” </p>
