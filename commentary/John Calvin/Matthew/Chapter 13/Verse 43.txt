<p><b>43.</b><i>Then will the righteous shine.</i> What a remarkable consolation! The sons of God, who now lie covered with dust, or are held in no estimation, or even are loaded with reproaches, <i>will then shine</i> in full brightness, as when the sky is serene, and every cloud has been dispelled. The adverb <i>then</i> ( <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τότε</span></blu></grk>) is emphatic; for it contains an implied contrast between their present state and the ultimate restoration, by the expectation of which Christ animates those who believe in him. The meaning therefore is, Though many wicked men now hold a high rank in the Church, yet that blessed day is assuredly to be expected, when the Son of God shall raise his followers on high, and remove every thing that now tends to dim or conceal their brightness. It is no doubt true, that the future glory is promised to none but those in whom the image of God already shines, and who are transformed into it by continued advances of glory. But as the life of the godly is now hidden, and as their salvation is invisible, because it consists in hope, Christ properly directs the attention of believers to heaven, where they will find the glory that is promised to them. </p>
<p>In order to make a deeper impression on his hearers, our Lord unquestionably refers here to a passage in Daniel, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="da+12:3">Daniel 12:3</span>,) </p>
<p>And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament. </p>
<p>“The Prophet,” he seems to say, <i>“when</i> he predicts a future brightness, intimates also that there is a temporary obscurity: and so, if we admit the prediction, we ought to endure patiently that mixture which, for a time, classes the elect of God with the reprobate.” By comparing this glory to <i>the sun,</i> he does not determine that it will be alike in all. As Christ now distributes his gifts variously <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(218)</sup></span> among believers, in like manner will he crown these gifts at the last day. But we must recollect what I have said, that the restoration, which is delayed till the last coming of Christ, is compared with the cloudy state of the world. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(219)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>The kingdom of the Father,</i> as the inheritance of the godly, is contrasted with the earth, to remind them that here they are pilgrims, and therefore ought to look upwards towards heaven. In another passage, <i>the kingdom of God</i> is said to be <i>within us,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:21">Luke 17:21</span> <i>,)</i> but we shall not obtain the full enjoyment of it till <i>God be all in all,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:28">1 Corinthians 15:28</span>.) </p>
