<p>The first two of these parables are intended to instruct believers to prefer <i>the Kingdom of heaven</i> to the whole world, and therefore to deny themselves and all the desires of the flesh, that nothing may prevent them from obtaining so valuable a possession. We are greatly in need of such a warning; for we are so captivated by the allurements of the world, that eternal life fades from our view; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(232)</sup></span> and in consequence of our carnality, the spiritual graces of God are far from being held by us in the estimation which they deserve. Justly, therefore, does Christ speak in such lofty terms of the excellence of eternal life, that we ought not to feel uneasiness at relinquishing, on account of it, whatever we reckon in other respects to be valuable. </p>
<p>First, he says, that <i>the kingdom of heaven is like a hidden treasure.</i> We commonly set a high value on what is visible, and therefore the new and spiritual life, which is held out to us in the Gospel, is little esteemed by us, because it is <i>hidden,</i> and lies in hope. There is the highest appropriateness in comparing it to <i>a treasure,</i> the value of which is in no degree diminished, though it may be buried in the earth, and withdrawn from the eyes of men. These words teach us, that we ought not to estimate the riches of the grace of God according to the views of our flesh, or according to their outward display, but in the same manner as a <i>treasure,</i> though it be <i>hidden,</i> is preferred to a vain appearance of wealth. The same instruction is conveyed by the other parable<i>. One pearl,</i> though it be small, is so highly valued, that a skillful <i>merchant</i> does not hesitate to <i>sell</i> houses and lands in order to purchase it. The excellence of the heavenly life is not perceived, indeed, by the sense of the flesh; and yet we do not esteem it according to its real worth, unless we are prepared to deny, on account of it, all that glitters in our eyes. </p>
<p>We now perceive the leading object of both parables. It is to inform us, that none are qualified for receiving the grace of the Gospel but those who disregard all other desires, and devote all their exertions, and all their faculties, to obtain it. It deserves our attention, also, that Christ does not pronounce the <i>hidden treasure,</i> or the <i>pearl,</i> to be so highly valued by all. The <i>treasure</i> is ascertained to be valuable, after that it has been <i>found</i> and known; and it is the skillful <i>merchant</i> that forms such an opinion about the <i>pearl</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(233)</sup></span> These words denote the knowledge of faith. “The heavenly kingdom,” Christ tells us, “is commonly held as of no account, because men are incapable of relishing it, and do not perceive the inestimable value of that treasure which the Lord offers to us in the Gospel.” </p>
<p>But it is asked, is it necessary that we abandon every other possession, in order that we may enjoy eternal life? I answer briefly. The natural meaning of the words is, that the Gospel does not receive from us the respect which it deserves, unless we prefer it to all the riches, pleasures, honors, and advantages of the world, and to such an extent, that we are satisfied with the spiritual blessings which it promises, and throw aside every thing that would keep us from enjoying them; for those who aspire to heaven must be disengaged from every thing that would retard their progress. Christ exhorts those who believe in him to deny those things only which are injurious to godliness; and, at the same time, permits them to use and enjoy God’s temporal favors, as if they did not use them. </p>
