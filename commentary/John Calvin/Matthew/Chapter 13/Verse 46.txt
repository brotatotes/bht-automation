<p><b>46.</b><i>And bought it.</i> By the word <i>buy</i> Christ does not mean, that men bring any price, with which they may purchase for themselves the heavenly life; for we know on what condition the Lord invites believers in the book of Isaiah, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:1">Isaiah 55:1</span>,) <i>Come and buy wine and milk without money and without price.</i> But though the heavenly life, and every thing that belongs to it, is the free gift of God, yet we are said to <i>buy</i> it, when we cheerfully relinquish the desires of the flesh, that nothing may prevent us from obtaining it; as Paul says, that he </p>
<p>reckoned all things to be loss and dung, that he might gain Christ, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+3:8">Philippians 3:8</span>.) </p>
