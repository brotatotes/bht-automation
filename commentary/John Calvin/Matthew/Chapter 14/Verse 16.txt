<p><b>16.</b><i>Give you to them something to eat.</i> As a fuller exposition of this miracle will be found at the sixth chapter of John’s Gospel, instead of troubling my readers with a repetition of what I have said, I would rather send them to that exposition; but rather than pass over this passage entirely, I shall offer a brief recapitulation. Hitherto Christ had bestowed his whole attention on feeding souls, but now he includes within his duties as a shepherd the care even of their bodies. And in this way he confirms his own saying, that to those who </p>
<p>seek the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, <br>all other things will be added, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:33">Matthew 6:33</span>.) </br></p>
<p>We have no right, indeed, to expect that Christ will always follow this method of supplying the hungry and thirsty with food; but it is certain that he will never permit his own people to want the necessaries of life, but will stretch out his hand from heaven, whenever he shall see it to be necessary to relieve their necessities. Those who wish to have Christ for their provider, must first learn not to long for refined luxuries, but to be satisfied with barley-bread. </p>
<p>Christ commanded that the people should sit down <i>in companies;</i> and he did so, first, that by this arrangement of the ranks the miracle might be more manifest; secondly, that the number of the men might be more easily ascertained, and that, while they looked at each other, they might in their turn bear testimony to this heavenly favor. Thirdly, perceiving that his disciples were anxious, he intended to make trial of their obedience by giving them an injunction which at first sight appeared to be absurd; for, as no provisions were at hand, there was reason to wonder why Christ was making arrangements that resembled a feast. To the same purpose is what follows, that <i>he gave them the loaves,</i> in order that in their hands the astonishing increase might take place, and that they might thus be the ministers of Christ’s divine power; for as if it had been of small importance that they should be eye-witnesses, Christ determined that his power should be handled by them. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(378)</sup></span> <i>Two hundred pence,</i> according to the computation of Budaeus, are worth about thirty-four French <i>livres;</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(379)</sup></span> and so when the disciples speak of what is <i>sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little,</i> they calculate at the rate of a farthing for each individual. Forming so high an estimate of the sum of money that would be required to purchase bread barely sufficient for procuring a morsel to the people, they are entitled to no small praise for their obedience, when they implicitly comply with the command of Christ, and leave the result to his disposal. </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(379)</span> The value of a <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">livre</span></i></blu> was so much affected both by time and by place, that it is not easy to determine with exactness how it was rated by Budaeus or Calvin. Most probably, the reference is to <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">la livre Parisis</span></i></blu> <i>,</i> which was three times the value of a <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">franc</span></i></blu> <i>,</i> or about two shillings and sixpence sterling; and thirty-four of these would amount to <i>four pounds, five shillings, sterling.</i> Now reckoning the Roman <blu><i>denarius</i></blu> <i>,</i> or the eighth part of an ounce of silver, to be worth sevenpence halfpenny of our own money, <blu><i><span lang="fr-FR" style="">une livre Parisis</span></i></blu> must have been equal to four <blu><i>denarii</i></blu> <i>,</i> and therefore <i>two hundred denarii</i> must have been worth—not <i>thirty-four</i> but <i>fifty livres Parisis,</i> or <i>six pounds, five shillings, sterling.</i> —<i>Ed.</i> </p>
