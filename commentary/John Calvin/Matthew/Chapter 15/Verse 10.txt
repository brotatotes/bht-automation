<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:10">Matthew 15:10</span></b><b>.</b><i>And having called the multitudes to him.</i> Here Christ turns <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(404)</sup></span> to those who are ready to receive instruction, and explains more fully the truth at which he had formerly glanced, that <i>the kingdom of God does not consist in meat and drink,</i> as Paul also teaches us, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>;) for, since outward things are by nature pure, the use of them is free and pure, and uncleanness is not contracted from the good creatures of God. It is therefore a general statement, that pollution does not come from without into a man, but that the fountain is concealed within him. Now when he says that all the evil actions which any man performs come <i>out of the mouth of man,</i> he employs a <i>synecdoche;</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(405)</sup></span> for he says so by way of allusion to the subject in hand, and conveys this instruction, that we do not draw uncleanness into our mouth along with <i>meat and drink,</i> but that every kind of defilement proceeds from ourselves. </p>
<p><i>Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended?</i> As the scribes were presumptuous and rebellious, Christ did not take great pains to pacify them, but satisfied himself with repelling their hypocrisy and pride. The offense which they had formerly taken up was doubled, when they perceived that—not through oversight, but seemingly on purpose—Christ despised their <i>washings</i> as trifles. Now when Christ did not hesitate to inflame still more, by keen provocation, wicked and malicious persons, let us learn from his example, that we ought not to be exceedingly solicitous to please every one by what we say and do. His disciples, however—as is usually the case with ignorant and unlearned people—no sooner perceive the result to be unfavorable, than they conclude that Christ’s reply had been unseasonable and improper. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(406)</sup></span> For the object of their advice was, to persuade Christ to soothe the rage of the Pharisees by softening the harsh expression which he had employed. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(407)</sup></span> </p>
<p>It almost always happens with weak persons, that they form an unfavorable judgment about a doctrine, as soon as they find that it is regarded with doubt or meets with opposition. And certainly it were to be wished, that it should give no offense, but receive the calm approbation of all; but, as the minds of many are blinded, and even their hearts are kindled into rage, by Satan, and as many souls are held under the benumbing influence of brutal stupidity, it is impossible that all should relish the true doctrine of salvation. Above all, we ought not to be surprised to behold the rage of those who inwardly nourish the venom of malice and obstinacy. Yet we ought to take care that, so far as may be in our power, our manner of teaching shall give no offense; but it would be the height of madness to think of exercising greater moderation than we have been taught to do by our heavenly Master. We see how his discourse was made an occasion of offense by wicked and obstinate men; and we see at the same time, how that kind of offense which arose from malignity was treated by him with contempt. </p>
