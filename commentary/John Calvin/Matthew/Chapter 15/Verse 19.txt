<p><b>19.</b><i>For out of the heart proceed wicked thoughts</i> Hence we infer that the word <i>mouth,</i> as I have mentioned, was used by Christ in a former verse by way of allusion to the context; for now he makes no mention of <i>the mouth,</i> but merely says that <i>out of the heart</i> of man proceeds all that is sinful and that corrupts by its pollution. Mark differs from Matthew in this respect, that he gives a larger catalogue of sins, such as <i>lusts,</i> or <i>irregular desires.</i> The Greek word ( <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πλεονεξίαι</span></blu></grk>) is by some rendered <i>covetousness;</i> but I have preferred to take it in a general acceptation. Next come <i>fraud</i> and intemperance, and those which immediately follow. Though the mode of expression be figurative, it is enough to understand Christ’s meaning to be, that all sins proceed from the wicked and corrupt affections of the heart. To say that <i>an evil eye</i> proceeds from the heart is not strictly accurate, but it involves nothing that is absurd or ambiguous; for it means, that an unholy heart pollutes the eyes by making them the ministers, or organs, of wicked desires. And yet Christ does not speak as if every thing that is evil in man were confined to open sins; but, in order to show more clearly that the heart of man is the abode of all evils, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(411)</sup></span> he says that the proofs and results appear in the sins themselves. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(411)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Que le coeur de l’homme est le siege et la source de tous maux</span></blu>;” — “that the heart of man is the seat and the source of all evils.” </p>
