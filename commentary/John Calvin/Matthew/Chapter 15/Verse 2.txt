<p><b>2.</b><i>Why do thy disciples transgress?</i> When we speak of human traditions, this question has no reference to political laws, the use and object of which are widely different from enjoining the manner in which we ought to worship God. But as there are various kinds of human traditions, we must make some distinction among them. Some are manifestly wicked, for they inculcate acts of worship which are wicked and diametrically opposed to the word of God. Others of them mingle profane trifles with the worship of God, and corrupt its purity. Others, which are more plausible, and are not chargeable with any remarkable fault, are condemned on this ground., that they are imagined to be necessary to the worship of God; and thus there is a departure from sincere obedience to God alone, and a snare is laid for the conscience. </p>
<p>To this last description the present passage unquestionably relates; for the <i>washing of hands,</i> on which the Pharisees insisted, could not in itself be charged with wicked superstition; otherwise Christ would not have permitted the water-pots to be used at the marriage, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:6">John 2:6</span>,) if it had not been an allowable ceremony; but the fault lay in this, that they did not think that God could be properly worshipped in any other way. It was not without a specious pretext that the practice of <i>washings</i> was first introduced. We know how rigidly the Law of God demands outward cleanness; not that the Lord intended that this should occupy the whole attention of his servants, but that they might be more careful to guard against every spiritual defilement. But in <i>washings</i> the Law preserved some moderation. Next came teachers, who thought that they would not be reckoned sufficiently acute, if they did not make some appendage to the word of God; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(394)</sup></span> and hence arose <i>washings</i> of which no mention was made in the Law. The legislators themselves did not give out that they delivered any thing new, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(395)</sup></span> but only that they administered cautions, which would be of service to assist in keeping the Law of God. But this was immediately followed by great abuse, when ceremonies introduced by men began to be regarded as a part of divine worship; and again, when in matters that were free and voluntary uniformity was absolutely enjoined. For it was always the will of God, as we have already said, that he should be worshipped according to the rule laid down in his word, and therefore no addition to his Law can be endured. Now as he permits believers to have outward ceremonies, by means of which they may perform the exercises of godliness, so he does not suffer them to mix up those ceremonies with his own word, as if religion consisted in them. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(396)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>For they wash not their hands.</i> The ground of offense is explained more fully by Mark; but the substance of his explanation is, that many things were practiced by <i>the scribes,</i> which they had voluntarily undertaken to keep. They were secondary laws invented by the curiosity of men, as if the plain command of God were not enough. God commanded that those who had contracted any defilement should wash themselves, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+11:25">Leviticus 11:25</span>;) and this extended to cups, and pots, and raiment, and other articles of household furniture, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+11:32">Leviticus 11:32</span>,) that they might not touch any thing that was polluted or unclean. But to invent other ablutions was idle and useless. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(397)</sup></span> They were not destitute of plausibility, as Paul tells us that the inventions of men have <i>an appearance of wisdom,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+2:23">Colossians 2:23</span>;) but if they had rested in the Law of God alone, that modesty would have been more agreeable to Him than solicitude about small matters. </p>
<p>They were desirous to warn a person not to take food while he was unclean, through want of consideration; but the Lord reckoned it enough to wash away those defilements of which they were aware. Besides, no end or limit could be set to such cautions; for they could scarcely move a finger without contracting some new spot or stain. But a far worse abuse lay in this, that the consciences of men were tormented with scruples which led them to regard every person as chargeable with pollution, who did not on every occasion wash his body with water. In persons who belonged to a private rank they would perhaps have overlooked the neglect of this ceremony; but as they had expected from Christ and his disciples something uncommon and extraordinary, they reckoned it unbecoming that ceremonies, which were <i>traditions of the elders,</i> and the practice of which was held sacred by <i>the scribes,</i> should not be observed by the disciples of a master who undertook to reform the existing state of things. </p>
<p>It is a great mistake to compare the sprinkling of the water of purification, or, as the Papists call it, <i>blessed water,</i> with the Jewish <i>washing;</i> for, by repeating so frequently the one baptism, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(398)</sup></span> Papists do all that is in their power to efface it. Besides, this absurd sprinkling is used for exorcising. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(399)</sup></span> But if it were lawful in itself, and were not accompanied by so many abuses, still we must always condemn the urgency with which they demand it as if it were indispensable. </p>
