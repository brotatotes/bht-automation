And pollute the man. Instead of the verb pollute, the Greek term is κοινοῖ, make common; as Mark, a little before, ( Mark 7:2,) used the phrase, κοιναῖς χερσὶ, with common hands, for with unclean hands. (412) It is a Hebrew phrase; (413) for, since God had set apart the Jews on the condition that they should separate themselves from all the pollutions of the Gentiles, everything that was inconsistent with this holiness was called common, that is, profane. (412) “Les mains communes pour souillees et non lavees ; ” — “common hands for polluted and not washed.” (413) “C’est une facon de parler propre aux Hebrieux;” — “it is a mode of speaking peculiar to the Hebrews.”
