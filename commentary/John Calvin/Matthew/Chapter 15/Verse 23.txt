<p><b>23.</b><i>But he made no reply to her.</i> In various ways the Evangelists bestow commendation on the faith of this woman. Here they bring before us her unshaken constancy; for the silence of Christ was a sort of refusal, and there is reason to wonder that she was not cast down by this trial, but her continuance in prayer was a proof of her perseverance. This appears, however, to be inconsistent with the nature of <i>faith</i> and of <i>calling upon God,</i> as it is described by Paul, who assures us that no man can pray aright till he has heard the word of God. </p>
<p>How shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? <br>and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:14">Romans 10:14</span>.) </br></p>
<p>Who then will say that this woman had faith, who takes courage from her own feelings, though Christ is silent? But as Christ has two ways of speaking and of being silent, it must be observed, that though he withheld at that time the words of his mouth, yet he spoke within to the mind of the woman, and so this secret inspiration was a substitute for the outward preaching. Besides, her prayer arose out of the <i>hearing of faith,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:17">Romans 10:17</span>;) and, therefore, though Christ does not immediately reply, she continually hears the sound of that doctrine <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(417)</sup></span> which she had already learned, that Christ came as a Redeemer. In this way the Lord often acts towards those who believe in him; he speaks to them, and yet is silent. Relying on the testimonies of Scripture, where they hear him speaking, they firmly believe that he will be gracious to them; and yet he does not immediately reply to their wishes and prayers, but, on the contrary, seems as if he did not hear. We see then that the design of Christ’s silence was not to extinguish the woman’s faith, but rather to whet her zeal and inflame her ardor. But if a small seed of doctrine in <i>a woman of Canaan</i> yielded such abundant fruit, it ill becomes us to be dejected, if at any time he delays and does not immediately grant a favorable answer. </p>
<p><i>Send her away.</i> The disciples present no request in favor of the woman, but as they are annoyed by her importunity, they desire that, in some way or other, she may be dismissed. It is a childish contrivance, which the Papists have endeavored to support by means of this passage, that departed saints are allowed to plead for us; for, granting that this woman solicited the disciples to give her some favor or assistance — which, however, cannot be proved from the passage — still there is a wide difference between the dead and living. It must be also observed, that, if they really intended to aid her by their advocacy, they obtain nothing. </p>
