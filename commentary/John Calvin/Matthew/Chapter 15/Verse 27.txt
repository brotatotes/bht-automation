<p><b>27.</b><i>Certainly, Lord.</i> The woman’s reply showed that she was not hurried along by a blind or thoughtless impulse to offer a flat contradiction <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(420)</sup></span> to what Christ had said. As God preferred the Jews to other nations, she does not dispute with them the honor of adoption, and declares, that she has no objection whatever that Christ should <i>satisfy</i> them according to the order which God had prescribed. She only asks that some <i>crumbs</i> — falling, as it were, accidentally — should come within the reach of <i>the dogs</i> And at no time, certainly, did God shut up his grace among the Jews in such a manner as not to bestow a small taste of them on the Gentiles. No terms could have been employed that would have described more appropriately, or more justly, that dispensation of the grace of God which was at that time in full operation. </p>
