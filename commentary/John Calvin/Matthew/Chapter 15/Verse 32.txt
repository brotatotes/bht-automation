<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:32">Matthew 15:32</span></b><b>.</b><i>I have compassion on the multitude.</i> Here a miracle is related not unlike another which we have lately explained. The only difference is, that on the former occasion Christ satisfied <i>five thousand men</i> with <i>five loaves and two fishes</i>, while, on the present occasion,<i>four thousand men</i> are fed with <i>seven loaves and a few small fishes;</i> and that <i>twelve baskets</i> were then filled with fragments, while out of a greater abundance a smaller portion is left. Let us learn from this, that the power of God is not restricted to means or outward assistance, and that it is all one with Him whether there be much or little, as Jonathan <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(425)</sup></span> said when speaking of his own moderate army and the vast multitude of enemies: </p>
<p>there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1sa+14:6">1 Samuel 14:6</span>.) </p>
<p>As the blessing of God can make one loaf suffice as well as twenty for satisfying a great multitude, so, if that be wanting, a hundred loaves will not be a sufficient meal for ten men; for when <i>the staff of bread is broken</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+26:26">Leviticus 26:26</span>,) though the flour should come in full weight from the mill, and the bread from the oven, it will serve no purpose to stuff the belly. The <i>three days’ fasting,</i> of which Christ speaks, must not be understood to mean that they had eaten nothing for three days; but that in desert places they had few conveniences, and must have wanted their ordinary food. Besides, in those warm countries, hunger is less keen than in our thick and cold atmosphere; and, therefore, we need not wonder that they should abstain longer from food. </p>
