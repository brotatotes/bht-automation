<p><b>5.</b><i>But you say, etc.</i> The mode of expression is defective, and is more fully exhibited by Mark, who adds, <i>you suffer them not to do anything more to their father or to their mother</i> The meaning is, that the scribes were altogether wrong in acquitting those persons who fail to perform their duties to their parents, provided that this deficiency be supplied, on their part, by a voluntary sacrifice, which might have been omitted without offending God. For we must not understand Christ’s words to bear that the scribes had forbidden men to render all proper obedience; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(401)</sup></span> but they were so eager to pursue their own gain, that children were allowed, in the meantime, to neglect their duties to their parents. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(401)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">De faire aucune assistance au pere et a la mere</span></blu>;” — “to grant any relief to their father or mother.” </p>
