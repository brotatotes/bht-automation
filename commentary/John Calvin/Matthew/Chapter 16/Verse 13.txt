<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:13">Matthew 16:13</span></b><b>.</b><i>And when Jesus came to the coasts of Cesarea Philippi.</i> Mark says that this conversation took place during the journey. Luke says that it took place while he was praying, and while there were none in company with him but his disciples. Matthew is not so exact in mentioning the time. All the three unquestionably relate the same narrative; and it is possible that Christ may have stopped at a certain place during that journey to pray, and that afterwards he may have put the question to his disciples. There were two towns called <i>Cesarea</i>, of which the former was more celebrated, and had been anciently called <i>The Tower of Strato;</i> while the latter, which is mentioned here, was situated at the foot of Mount Lebanon, not far from the river Jordan. It is for the sake of distinguishing between these two towns that <i>Philippi</i> is added to the name; for though it is conjectured by some to have been built on the same spot where the town of Dan formerly stood, yet, as it had lately been rebuilt by <i>Philip</i> the Tetrarch, it was called <i>Philippi</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(437)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>Who do men say that I am?</i> This might be supposed to mean, What was the current rumor about the Redeemer, who became <i>the Son of man?</i> But the question is quite different, What do men think about Jesus the Son of Mary? He calls himself, according to custom, <i>the Son of man</i>, as much as to say, Now that clothed in flesh I inhabit the earth like other men, what is the opinion entertained respecting me? The design of Christ was, to confirm his disciples fully in the true faith, that they might not be tossed about amidst various reports, as we shall presently see. </p>
