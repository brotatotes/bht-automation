<p><b>25.</b><i>For he that would save his life shall lose it.</i> It is a most appropriate consolation, that they who willingly suffer death for the sake of Christ <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(467)</sup></span> do actually obtain life; for Mark expressly states this as the motive to believers in dying — <i>for my sake, and for the sake of the Gospel</i> — and in the words of Matthew the same thing must be understood. It frequently happens that irreligious men are prompted by ambition or despair to despise life; and to such persons it will be no advantage that they are courageous in meeting death. The threatening, which is contrasted with the promise, has also a powerful tendency to shake off carnal sloth, when he reminds men who are desirous of the present life, that the only advantage which they reap is, to<i>lose</i> life. There is a contrast intended here between temporal and eternal death, as we have explained under <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:39">Matthew 10:39</span>, where the reader will find the rest of this subject. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(468)</sup></span> </p>
