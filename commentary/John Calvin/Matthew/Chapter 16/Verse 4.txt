<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:4">Matthew 16:4</span></b><b>.</b><i>A wicked and adulterous nation.</i> This passage was explained <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(426)</sup></span> under <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:38">Matthew 12:38</span>. The general meaning is, that the Jews are never satisfied with any <i>signs</i>, but are continually tickled by a wicked desire to tempt God. He does not call them <i>an adulterous nation</i> merely because they demand some kind of sign, (for the Lord sometimes permitted his people to do this,) but because they deliberately provoke God; and therefore he threatens that, after he has risen from the dead, he will be a prophet like Jonah. So Matthew at least says — for Mark does not mention Jonah — but the meaning is the same; for, strictly speaking, this was intended to serve as a <i>sign</i> to them, that Christ, when he had risen from the dead, would in every place cause the voice of his Gospel to be distinctly heard. </p>
