<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:1">Matthew 17:1</span></b><b>.</b><i>And after six days.</i> We must first inquire for what purpose Christ clothed himself with heavenly glory for a short time, and why he did not admit more than three of his disciples to be spectators. Some think that he did so, in order to fortify them against the trial which they were soon to meet with, arising from his death. That does not appear to me to be a probable reason; for why should he have deprived the rest of the same remedy, or rather, why does he expressly forbid them to make known what they had seen till after his resurrection, but because the result of the vision would be later than his death? I have no doubt whatever that Christ intended to show that he was not dragged unwillingly to death, but that he came forward of his own accord, to offer to the Father the sacrifice of obedience. The disciples were not made aware of this till Christ rose; nor was it even necessary that, at the very moment of his death, they should perceive the divine power of Christ, so as to acknowledge it to be victorious on the cross; but the instruction which they now received was intended to be useful at a future period both to themselves and to us, that no man might take offense at the weakness of Christ, as if it were by force and necessity that he had suffered. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(477)</sup></span> It would manifestly have been quite as easy for Christ to protect his body from death as to clothe it with heavenly glory. </p>
<p>We are thus taught that he was subjected to death, because he wished it to be so; that he was crucified, because he offered himself. That same flesh, which was sacrificed on the cross and lay in the grave, might have been exempted from death and the grave; for it had already partaken of the heavenly glory. We are also taught that, so long as Christ remained in the world, bearing the form of a servant, and so long as his majesty was concealed under the weakness of the flesh, nothing had been taken from him, for it was of his own accord that he <i>emptied himself</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>;) but now his resurrection has drawn aside that veil by which his power had been concealed for a time. </p>
<p>Our Lord reckoned it enough to select <i>three witnesses</i>, because that is the number which the Law has laid down for proving any thing; </p>
<p>at the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses, <br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+17:6">Deuteronomy 17:6</span>.) </br></p>
<p>The difference as to time ought not to give us uneasiness. Matthew and Mark reckon <i>six</i> entire <i>days</i>, which had elapsed between the events. Luke says that <i>it happened about eight days afterwards</i>, including both <i>the</i> day on which Christ spake these words, and <i>the day</i> on which he was transfigured. We see then that, under a diversity of expression, there is a perfect agreement as to the meaning. </p>
