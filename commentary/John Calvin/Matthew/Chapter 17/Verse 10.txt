<p><b>10.</b><i>And his disciples asked him, saying.</i> No sooner is the resurrection mentioned than the disciples imagine that the reign of Christ is commenced; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(482)</sup></span> for they explain this word to mean that the world would acknowledge him to be the Messiah. That they imagined the resurrection to be something totally different from what Christ meant, is evident from what is stated by Mark, that <i>they disputed with each other what was the meaning of that expression which he had used, To rise from the dead</i> Perhaps, too, they were already under the influence of that dream which is now held as an undoubted oracle among the Rabbins, that there would be a first and a second coming of the Messiah; that in the first he would be mean and despised, but that this would be shortly afterwards followed by his royal dignity. And, indeed, there is some plausibility in that error, for it springs from a true principle. The Scripture, too, speaks of a first and a second coming of the Messiah; for it promises that he will be a Redeemer, to expiate by his sacrifice the sins of the world <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(483)</sup></span> And such is the import of the following prophecies: </p>
<p>Rejoice, daughter of Zion, behold, thy King cometh, poor, sitting on an ass, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:9">Zechariah 9:9</span>.) </p>
<p>We beheld him, and he had no form or beauty, and he resembled a leper, so that we had no esteem for him, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:3">Isaiah 53:3</span>.) </p>
<p>Again, Scripture represents him as victorious over death, and as subjecting all things to his dominion. But we see how the Rabbins corrupt the pure word of God by their inventions; and as every thing was greatly corrupted in the time of our Lord, it is probable that the people had also embraced this foolish notion. </p>
<p><i>Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?</i> The gross mistakes which they committed as to the person of <i>Elijah</i> have been pointed out on two or three occasions. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(484)</sup></span> Perhaps, too, they cunningly and wickedly endeavored to lessen the authority of Christ by bringing forward <i>Elijah;</i> for as it had been promised that <i>Elijah</i> would come as the forerunner of Messiah, <i>to prepare the way before him</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:1">Malachi 3:1</span>,) it was easy to excite a prejudice against Christ, by saying that he came unaccompanied by <i>Elijah</i> By a trick closely resembling this, the devil enchants the Papists of the present day not to expect the day of judgment till Elijah and Enoch have appeared. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(485)</sup></span> It may not usually be conjectured that this expedient was purposely resorted to by the scribes, in order to represent Christ as unworthy of confidence, because he wanted the legitimate badge of the Messiah. </p>
