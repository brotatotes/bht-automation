<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:19">Matthew 17:19</span></b><b>.</b><i>Then the disciples coming.</i> The disciples wonder that the power which they once possessed has been taken from them; but they had lost it by their own fault. Christ therefore attributes this want of ability to their unbelief, and repeats and illustrates more largely the statement which he had previously made, that <i>nothing is impossible to faith</i> It is a hyperbolical mode of expression, no doubt, when he declares that faith <i>removes trees and mountains;</i> but the meaning amounts to this, that God will never forsake us, if we keep the door open for receiving his grace. He does not mean that God will give us every thing that we may mention, or that may strike our minds at random. On the contrary, as nothing is more at variance with faith than the foolish and irregular desires of our flesh, it follows that those in whom faith reigns do not desire every thing without discrimination, but only that which the Lord promises to give. Let us therefore maintain such moderation as to desire nothing beyond what he has promised to us, and to confine our prayers within that rule which he has laid down. </p>
<p>But it may be objected, that the disciples did not know whether or not the Lord was pleased to cure the <i>lunatic</i> It is easy to reply, that it was their own fault if they did not know; for Christ is now speaking expressly about special <i>faith</i>, which had its secret instincts, as the circumstances of the case required. And this is the <i>faith</i> of which Paul speaks, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:9">1 Corinthians 12:9</span>.) How then came it that the apostles were deprived of the power of the Spirit, which they had formerly exercised in working miracles, but because they had quenched it by their indolence? But what Christ said about special <i>faith</i>, in reference to this particular event, may be extended to the common <i>faith</i> of the whole Church. </p>
