<p><b>2.</b><i>And was transfigured before them.</i> Luke says that this happened <i>while he was praying;</i> and from the circumstances of time and place, we may infer that he had prayed for what he now obtained, that in the brightness of an unusual form his Godhead might become visible; not that he needed to ask by prayer from another what he did not possess, or that he doubted his Fatherâ€™s willingness, but because, during the whole course of his humiliation, he always ascribed to the Father whatever he did as a divine Person, and because he intended to excite us to prayer by his example. </p>
<p>His <i>transfiguration</i> did not altogether enable his disciples to see Christ, as he now is in heaven, but gave them a taste of his boundless glory, such as they were able to comprehend. Then <i>his face shone as the sun;</i> but now he is far beyond the sun in brightness. In his <i>raiment</i> an unusual and dazzling whiteness appeared; but now without <i>raiment</i> a divine majesty shines in his whole body. Thus in ancient times God appeared to the holy fathers, not as He was in Himself, but so far as they could endure the rays of His infinite brightness; for John declares that not until </p>
<p>they are like him will they see him as he is, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>.) </p>
<p>There is no necessity for entering here into ingenious inquiries as to the <i>whiteness</i> of his <i>garments</i>, or the <i>brightness</i> of his <i>countenance;</i> for this was not a complete exhibition of the heavenly glory of Christ, but, under symbols which were adapted to the capacity of the flesh, he enabled them to taste in part what could not be fully comprehended. </p>
