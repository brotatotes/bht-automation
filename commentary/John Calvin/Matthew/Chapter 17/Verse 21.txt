<p><b>21.</b><i>This kind goeth not out</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(492)</sup></span> By this expression Christ reproved the negligence of certain persons, in order to inform them that it was not an ordinary <i>faith</i> which was required; for otherwise they might have replied that they were not altogether destitute of <i>faith</i> The meaning therefore is, that it is not every kind of <i>faith</i> that will suffice, when we have to enter into a serious conflict with Satan, but that vigorous efforts are indispensably necessary. For the weakness of <i>faith</i> he prescribes <i>prayer</i> as a remedy, to which he adds <i>fasting</i> by way of an auxiliary. “You are effeminate exorcist,” said he, “and seem as if you were engaged in a mock-battle got up for amusement; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(493)</sup></span> but you have to deal with a powerful adversary, who will not yield till the battle has been fought out. Your <i>faith</i> must therefore be excited by <i>prayer</i>, and as you are slow and languid in <i>prayer</i>, you must resort to <i>fasting</i> as an assistance.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(494)</sup></span> Hence it is very evident how absurdly the Papists represent <i>fasting</i> to be the specific method of driving away devils, since our Lord refers to it for no other reason than to stimulate the earnestness of prayer. When he says that <i>this kind</i> of devils <i>cannot be cast out in any other way than by prayer and fasting,</i> he means that, when Satan has taken deep root in any one, and has been confirmed by long possession, or when he rages with unbridled fury, the victory is difficult and painful, and therefore the contest must be maintained with all our might. </p>
