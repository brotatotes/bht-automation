<p><b>27.</b><i>Throw a hook.</i> Though I acknowledge that Christ had not always full coffers, yet I think that he was not compelled by poverty to give this order to Peter, but that he did so in order to prove by a miracle, that he had a more extensive dominion than all earthly kings, since he had even <i>fishes</i> for his tributaries. And we do not read that this was done more than once, because one proof was enough for his whole life. <i>Thou wilt find a stater. A stater</i> was of the same value as a shekel, namely, four drachms or two didrachma. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(583)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(583)</span> The <i>didrachmon</i> weighed <i>two drachms</i>, and the <i>stater</i>, which weighed <i>two didrachma</i>, or <i>four drachms</i>, was worth about two shillings and sixpence of our money. â€” Ed. </p>
