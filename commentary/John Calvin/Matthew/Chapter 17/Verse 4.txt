<p><b>4.</b><i>Lord, it is good for us to be here.</i> Luke tells us that Peter uttered these words <i>while Moses and Elijah were departing;</i> and hence we infer that he was afraid lest, at their departure, that pleasant and delightful exhibition should vanish away. We need not wonder that Peter was so captivated by the loveliness of what he beheld, as to lose sight of every other person, and rest satisfied with the mere enjoyment of it; as it is said in the psalm, </p>
<p>In thy presence is fulnessess of joy, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:11">Psalms 16:11</span>.) </p>
<p>But his desire was foolish; first, because he did not comprehend the design of the vision; secondly, because he absurdly put the servants on a level with their Lord; and, thirdly, he was mistaken in proposing to build fading tabernacles <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(479)</sup></span> for men who had been already admitted to the glory of heaven and of the angels. </p>
<p>I have said that he did not understand the design of the vision; for, while he was hearing, from the mouth of <i>Moses and Elijah</i>, that the time of Christ’s death was at hand, he foolishly dreamed that his present aspect, which was temporary, would endure for ever. And what if the kingdom of Christ had been confined in this way to the narrow limits of twenty or thirty feet? Where would have been the redemption of the whole world? Where would have been the communication of eternal salvation? It was also highly absurd to conceive of <i>Moses and Elijah</i> as companions of the Son of God, as if it had not been proper that all should be reduced to a lower rank, that he alone may have the pre-eminence. And if Peter is satisfied with his present condition, why does he suppose that earthly supports were needed by those persons, the very sight of whom, he imagined, was enough to make him happy? </p>
<p>Justly, therefore, is it stated by two of the Evangelists, that he <i>knew not what he said;</i> and Mark assigns the reason, that <i>they were afraid;</i> for God did not intend that the apostles should, at that time, derive any advantage from it beyond that of beholding for a moment, as in a bright mirror, the divinity of his Son. At a later period, he pointed out to them the fruit of the vision, and corrected the error of their judgment. What is stated by Mark must therefore mean, that Peter was carried away by frenzy, and spoke like a man who had lost his senses. </p>
