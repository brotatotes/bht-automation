<p><b>5.</b><i>Lo, a bright cloud overshadowed them.</i> Their eyes were covered by <i>a cloud</i>, in order to inform them, that they were not yet prepared for beholding the brightness of the heavenly glory. For, when the Lord gave tokens of his presence, he employed, at the same time, some coverings to restrain the arrogance of the human mind. So now, with the view of teaching his disciples a lesson of humility, he withdraws from their eyes the sight of the heavenly glory. This admonition is likewise addressed to us, that we may not seek to pry into the secrets which lie beyond our senses, but, on the contrary, that every man may keep within the limits of sobriety, according to the measure of his faith. In a word, this <i>cloud</i> ought to serve us as a bridle, that our curiosity may not indulge in undue wantonness. The disciples, too, were warned that they must return to their former warfare, and therefore must not expect a triumph before the time. </p>
<p><i>And, lo, a voice from the cloud.</i> It deserves our attention, that the <i>voice</i> of God was heard from the <i>cloud</i>, but that neither a body nor a face was seen. Let us therefore remember the warning which Moses gives us, that God has no visible shape, lest we should deceive ourselves by imagining that He resembled a man, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+4:15">Deuteronomy 4:15</span>.) There were, no doubt, various appearances under which God made himself known to the holy fathers in ancient times; but in all cases he refrained from using signs which might induce them to make for themselves idols. And certainly, as the minds of men are too strongly inclined to foolish imaginations, there was no necessity for throwing oil upon the flame. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(480)</sup></span> This manifestation of the glory of God was remarkable above all others. When he makes a cloud to pass between Him and us, and invites us to himself by His voice, what madness is it to attempt to place Him before our eyes by a block of wood or of stone? Let us therefore endeavor to enter by faith alone, and not by the eyes of flesh, into that inaccessible light in which God dwells. <i>The voice</i> came <i>from the cloud</i>, that the disciples, knowing it to have proceeded from God, might receive it with due reverence. </p>
<p><i>This is my beloved Son.</i> I willingly concur with those who think that there is an implied contrast of <i>Moses and Elijah</i> with Christ, and that the disciples of God’s own Son are here charged to seek no other teacher. The word <i>Son</i> is emphatic, and raises him above servants. There are two titles here bestowed upon Christ, which are not more fitted to do honor to him than to aid our faith: a <i>beloved Son</i>, and a Master. The Father calls him my <i>beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased</i>, and thus declares him to be the Mediator, by whom he reconciles the world to himself. When he enjoins us to <i>hear him</i>, he appoints him to be the supreme and only teacher of his Church. It was his design to distinguish Christ from all the rest, as we truly and strictly infer from those words, that by nature he was God’s <i>only Son</i> In like manner, we learn that he alone is <i>beloved</i> by the Father, and that he alone is appointed to be our Teacher, that in him all authority may dwell. </p>
<p>But it will perhaps be objected, Does not God love angels and men? It is easy to reply, that the fatherly love of God, which is spread over angels and men, proceeds from him as its source. The <i>Son</i> is <i>beloved</i> by the Father, not so as to make other creatures the objects of his hatred, but so that he communicates to them what belongs to himself. There is a difference, no doubt, between our condition and that of the angels; for they never were alienated from God, and therefore needed not that he should reconcile them; while we are enemies on account of sin, till Christ procure for us his favor. Still, it is a fixed principle that God is gracious to both, only so far as he embraces us in Christ; for even the angels would not be firmly united to God if Christ were not their Head. It may also be observed that, since the Father here speaks of himself as different from the Son, there is a distinction of persons; for they are one in essence and alike in glory. </p>
<p><i>Hear him.</i> I mentioned a little ago, that these words were intended to draw the attention of the Church to Christ as the only Teacher, that on his mouth alone it may depend. For, though Christ came to maintain the authority of <i>the Law and the Prophets</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17">Matthew 5:17</span>,) yet he holds the highest rank, so that, by the brightness of his gospel, he causes those sparks which shone in the Old Testament to disappear. He is <i>the Sun of righteousness,</i> whose arrival brought the full light of day. And this is the reason why the Apostle says (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1">Hebrews 1:1</span>) that </p>
<p>God, who at sundry times and in various ways spoke formerly by the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken to us by his beloved Son. </p>
<p>In short, Christ is as truly heard at the present day in the Law and in the Prophets as in his Gospel; so that in him dwells the authority of a <i>Master</i>, which he claims for himself alone, saying, <i>One is your Master</i>, <i>even Christ</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:8">Matthew 23:8</span>.) But his authority is not fully acknowledged, unless all the tongues of men are silent. If we would submit to his doctrine, all that has been invented by men must be thrown down and destroyed. He is every day, no doubt, sending out teachers, but it is to state purely and honestly what they have learned from him, and not to corrupt the gospel by their own additions. In a word, no man can be regarded a faithful teacher of the Church, unless he be himself a disciple of Christ, and bring others to be taught by him. </p>
