<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:9">Matthew 17:9</span></b><b>.</b><i>And as they were going down from the mountain.</i> We have said that the time for making known <i>the vision</i> was not yet fully come; and, indeed, the disciples would not have believed it, if Christ had not given a more striking proof of his glory in his resurrection. But after that his divine power had been openly displayed, that temporary exhibition of his glory began to be admitted, so as to make it fully evident that, even during the time that he <i>emptied himself</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>,) he continued to retain his divinity entire, though it was concealed under the veil of the flesh. There are good reasons, therefore, why he enjoins his disciples to keep silence, till he be risen from the dead. </p>
