<p><b>10.</b><i>Beware of despising one of these little ones</i> As pride is the mother of disdain, and as contempt hardens men in giving <i>offense</i>, our Lord, for the purpose of applying an appropriate remedy for curing this disease, forbids his disciples to <i>despise the little ones.</i> And certainly, as we have already hinted, no man who has a proper care for his brethren will ever allow himself, on light grounds, to give them <i>offense</i> This conclusion of our Lord’s discourse has the same tendency as the commencement of it, to remind us that we ought to strive with each other who shall be most submissive and modest; for God embraces with wonderful love the <i>little ones</i> It would be strange indeed that a mortal man should <i>despise</i>, or treat as of no account, those whom God holds in such high esteem. He proves this love from the fact, that angels, who are ministers of their salvation, enjoy intimately the presence of God. Yet I do not think that he intended merely to show what honor God confers on them by appointing <i>angels</i> to be their guardians, but likewise to threaten those who <i>despise</i> them; as if he had said, that it is no light matter to <i>despise</i> those who have <i>angels</i> for their companions and friends, to take vengeance in their behalf. We ought therefore to <i>beware of despising</i> their salvation, which even angels have been commissioned to advance. </p>
<p>The interpretation given to this passage by some commentators, as if God assigned to each believer his own <i>angel</i>, does not rest on solid grounds. For the words of Christ do not mean that a single <i>angel</i> is continually occupied with this or the other person; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(508)</sup></span> and such an idea is inconsistent with the whole doctrine of Scripture, which declares that <i>the angels encamp around</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+34:7">Psalms 34:7</span>) the godly, and that not one <i>angel</i> only, but many, have been commissioned to guard every one of the faithful. Away, then, with the fanciful notion of a good and evil angel, and let us rest satisfied with holding that the care of the whole Church is committed to <i>angels</i>, to assist each member as his necessities shall require. It will perhaps be asked, Do the angels occupy a station inferior to ours, because they have been appointed to be our ministers? I reply, Though by nature they take rank above us, this does not prevent them from rendering service to God <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(509)</sup></span> in dispensing the favor which he freely bestows upon us. For this reason they are called <i>our angels</i>, because their labors are bestowed on us. </p>
