<p><b>19.</b><i>Again I say to you.</i> He confirms the former statement; for not only will God bestow the spirit of wisdom and prudence on those who ask it, but he will also provide that not one thing which they shall do according to his word shall want its power and effect. By uniting <i>agreement</i> with <i>prayer,</i> he reminds us with what moderation and humility believers ought to conduct themselves in all religious acts. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(568)</sup></span> The <i>offender</i> must be admonished, and, if he does not receive correction, he must be excommunicated. Here it is not only necessary to ask counsel at the sacred mouth of God, so that nothing may be determined but by his word, but it is proper at the same time to begin with prayer. Hence appears more clearly what I have formerly stated, that men are not allowed the liberty of doing whatever they please, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(569)</sup></span> but that God is declared to have the sole claim to the government of the <i>Church</i>, so that he approves and ratifies the decisions of which he is himself the Author. Meanwhile, when believers assemble, they are taught to unite their prayers and to pray in common, not only to testify the unity of faith, but that God may listen to the <i>agreement</i> of them all. So then, as God frequently promises in other passages that he will graciously listen to the private requests of each individual, so here Christ makes a remarkable promise to public prayers, in order to invite us more earnestly to the practice of them. </p>
