<p><b>20.</b><i>For where two or three are assembled in my name.</i> This promise is more extensive than the former; for the Lord declares that he will be present, </p>
<p>wherever two or three are met together in his name, <br/>to guide them by his counsel, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+73:24">Psalms 73:24</span>,) </p>
<p>and to conduct to a prosperous result whatever they shall undertake. There is therefore no reason to doubt that those who give themselves up to his direction will derive most desirable advantage from his presence. And since it is an invaluable blessing to have Christ for our director in all our affairs, to bless our deliberations and their results; and since, on the other hand, nothing can be more miserable than to be deprived of his grace, this promise ought to add no small excitement to us to unite with each other in piety and holiness. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(570)</sup></span> For whoever either disregards the holy assemblies, or separates himself from brethren, and takes little interest in the cultivation of unity, by this alone makes it evident that he sets no value on the presence of Christ. </p>
<p>But we must take care, first of all, that those who are desirous to have Christ present with them shall <i>assemble in his name;</i> and we must likewise understand what is the meaning of this expression; for we perceive how ungodly men falsely and impudently, as well as wickedly, cover their conspiracies with his sacred name. If therefore we do not wish to expose Christ to their ridicule, and at the same time to overturn what he has here promised, we must know first of all what is meant by this phrase. It means that those who are <i>assembled together</i>, laying aside every thing that hinders them from approaching to Christ, shall sincerely raise their desires to him, shall yield obedience to his word, and allow themselves to be governed by the Spirit. Where this simplicity prevails, there is no reason to fear that Christ will not make it manifest that it was not in vain for <i>the assembly to meet in his name</i> </p>
<p>In this is displayed the gross ignorance of the Papists, who exclaim that Councils could not err, and that all ought to abide by their decisions, because, <i>as often as two or three are assembled in the name of Christ, he is in the midst of them</i> But we ought first of all to inquire whether those persons, as to whose faith, and doctrine, and dispositions, we are in doubt, were <i>assembled in the name of Christ.</i> When the Papists leave out or perplex this matter, who does not see that they dexteroasly confound the distinction between holy and profane assemblies, so that the power of doing any thing is taken from the Church and conveyed to the sworn enemies of Christ? Let us therefore know that none but the pious worshippers of God, who sincerely seek Christ, are encouraged to entertain the confident hope that he will never leave them. Disregarding the bastard and abortive Councils, which out of their own head have woven a web, let Christ alone, with the doctrine of his Gospel, be always exalted amongst us. </p>
