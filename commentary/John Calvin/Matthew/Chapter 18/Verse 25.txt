<p><b>25.</b><i>His master ordered him to be sold.</i> It would be an idle exercise of ingenuity to examine here every minute clause. For God does not always display severity at first, till, constrained to pray, we implore pardon, but rather meets us with undeserved goodness. But Christ only shows what will become of us, if God shall treat us with the utmost severity; and again, if He shall choose to demand from us what we owe, how necessary it is for us to betake ourselves to prayer, because this is the only refuge that remains for transgressors. We must also attend to the wide difference of the sums; for, since one <i>talent</i> is worth more than <i>a hundred pence</i>, what proportion will <i>a hundred pence</i> bear to <i>ten thousand talents?</i> </p>
