<p><b>14.</b><i>Suffer children.</i> He declares that he wishes to receive <i>children</i>; and at length, <i>taking them in his arms,</i> he not only embraces, but <i>blesses</i> them by the <i>laying on of hand;</i> from which we infer that his grace is extended even to those who are of that age. And no wonder; for since the whole race of Adam is shut up under the sentence of death, all from the least even to the greatest must perish, except those who are rescued by the only Redeemer. To exclude from the grace of redemption those who are of that age would be too cruel; and therefore it is not without reason that we employ this passage as a shield against the Anabaptists. They refuse baptism to <i>infants</i>, because infants are incapable of understanding that mystery which is denoted by it. We, on the other hand, maintain that, since baptism is the pledge and figure of the forgiveness of sins, and likewise of adoption by God, it ought not to be denied to <i>infants</i>, whom God adopts and washes with the blood of his Son. Their objection, that repentance and newness of life are also denoted by it, is easily answered. <i>Infants</i> are renewed by the Spirit of God, according to the capacity of their age, till that power which was concealed within them grows by degrees, and becomes fully manifest at the proper time. Again, when they argue that there is no other way in which we are reconciled to God, and become heirs of adoption, than by faith, we admit this as to adults, but, with respect to <i>infants</i>, this passage demonstrates it to be false. Certainly, the <i>laying on of hands</i> was not a trifling or empty sign, and the prayers of Christ were not idly wasted in air. But he could not present the infants solemnly to God without giving them purity. And for what did he pray for them, but that they might be received into the number of the children of God? Hence it follows, that they were renewed by the Spirit to the hope of salvation. In short, by embracing them, he testified that they were reckoned by Christ among his flock. And if they were partakers of the spiritual gifts, which are represented by Baptism, it is unreasonable that they should be deprived of the outward sign. But it is presumption and sacrilege to drive far from the fold of Christ those whom he cherishes in his bosom, and to shut the door, and exclude as strangers those whom he does not wish to be <i>forbidden to come to him</i> </p>
<p><i>For of such is the kingdom of heaven.</i> Under this term he includes both <i>little children</i> and those who resemble them; for the Anabaptists foolishly exclude children, with whom the subject must have commenced; but at the same time, taking occasion from the present occurrence, he intended to exhort his disciples to lay aside malice and pride, and put on the nature of <i>children</i> Accordingly, it is added by Mark and Luke, that no man <i>can enter into the kingdom of heaven</i> unless he be made to resemble a child. But we must attend to Paulâ€™s admonition, </p>
<p>not to be children in understanding, but in malice,<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:20">1 Corinthians 14:20</span>.) </p>
