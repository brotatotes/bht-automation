<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:23">Matthew 19:23</span></b><b>.</b><i>A rich man will with difficulty enter.</i> Christ warns them, not only how dangerous and how deadly a plague avarice is, but also how great an obstacle is presented by riches. In Mark, indeed, he mitigates the harshness of his expression, by restricting it to those only <i>who place confidence in riches</i> But these words are, I think, intended to confirm, rather than correct, the former statement, as if he had affirmed that they ought not to think it strange, that he made the <i>entrance into the kingdom of heaven so difficult for the rich,</i> because it is an evil almost common to all to <i>trust in their riches</i> Yet this doctrine is highly useful to all; to <i>the rich</i>, that, being warned of their danger, they may be on their guard; to the poor, that, satisfied with their lot, they may not so eagerly desire what would bring more damage than gain. It is true indeed, that <i>riches</i> do not, in their own nature, hinder us from following God; but, in consequence of the depravity of the human mind, it is scarcely possible for those who have a great abundance to avoid being intoxicated by them. So they who are exceedingly <i>rich</i> are held by Satan bound, as it were, in chains, that they may not raise their thoughts to heaven; nay more, they bury and entangle themselves, and became utter slaves to the earth. The comparison of the <i>camel</i>. , which is soon after added, is intended to amplify the <i>difficulty;</i> for it means that <i>the rich</i> are so swelled with pride and presumption, that they cannot endure to be reduced to the straits through which God makes his people to pass. The word <i>camel</i> denotes, I think, a rope used by sailors, rather than the animal so named. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(633)</sup></span> </p>

But he adopted the notion equally unfounded, that Greek writers sometimes used <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κάμηλος</span></blu></grk>, in the sense of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κάμιλος</span></blu></grk>. Had due allowance been made for the boldness of Eastern imagery, the supposed difficulty would have disappeared, and the most refined taste would have been fully gratified. The poet Southey has seized the true spirit of the passage: — “S. The <i>camel</i> and the <i>needle</i>, Is that then in your mind? “T. Even so. The text Is gospel wisdom. I would ride the <i>camel</i>, — Yea leap him flying, through the <i>needle’s eye</i>, As easily as such a pampered soul Could pass the narrow gate.” At one period, critics showed a strong leaning to the idea of <i>cable</i>, which our Author favors, but have now very generally abandoned it, and returned to the true <i>reading</i>. — <i>Ed</i> </p>
