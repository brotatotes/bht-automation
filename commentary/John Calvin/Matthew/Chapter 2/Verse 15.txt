<p><b>15.</b><i>Out of Egypt have I called my Son</i> Matthew says that a prediction was fulfilled. Some have thought, that the intention of the prophet was different from what is here stated, and have supposed the meaning to be, that the Jews act foolishly in opposing and endeavoring to oppress the Son of God, because the Father <i>hath called him out of Egypt</i> In this way, they grievously pervert the words of the prophet, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ho+11:1">Hosea 11:1</span>,) the design of which is, to establish a charge of ingratitude against the Jews, who, from their earliest infancy, and from the commencement of their history, had found God to be a kind and generous Father, and yet were provoking him by fresh offenses. Beyond all question, the passage ought not to be restricted to the person of Christ: and yet it is not tortured by Matthew, but skilfully applied to the matter in hand. </p>
<p>The words of the prophet ought to be thus interpreted: “When Israel was yet a child, I brought him out of that wretched bondage in which he had been plunged. He was formerly like a dead man, and Egypt served him for a grave; but I drew him out of it as from the womb, and brought him into the light of life.” And justly does the Lord speak in this manner; for that deliverance was a sort of birth of the nation. Then were openly produced letters of adoption, when, by the promulgation of the law, they became “the Lord’s portion,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+32:9">Deuteronomy 32:9</span>,) “a royal priesthood, and a holy nation,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>;) when they were separated from the other nations, and when, in short, God “set up his tabernacle” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+26:11">Leviticus 26:11</span>) to dwell in the midst of them. The words of the prophet import, that the nation was rescued from Egypt as from a deep whirlpool of death. Now, what was the redemption brought by Christ, but a resurrection from the dead, and the commencement of a new life? The light of salvation had been almost extinguished, when God begat the Church anew in the person of Christ. Then did the Church come out of Egypt in its head, as the whole body had been formerly brought out. </p>
<p>This analogy prevents us from thinking it strange, that any part of Christ’s childhood was passed in Egypt. The grace and power of God became more illustrious, and his wonderful purpose was more distinctly seen, when light came out of darkness, and life out of hell. Otherwise, the sense of the flesh might have broken out here in contemptuous language, <i>“</i> Truly a Redeemer is to come out of Egypt!” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(210)</sup></span> Matthew therefore reminds us, that it is no strange or unwonted occurrence for God to call his Son out of that country; and that it serves rather to confirm our faith, that, as on a former occasion, so now again, the Church of God comes out of Egypt. There is this difference, however, between the two cases. The whole nation was formerly shut up in the prison of Egypt; while, in the second redemption, it was Christ, the head of the Church alone, who was concealed there, but who carried the salvation and life of all shut up in his own person. </p>
