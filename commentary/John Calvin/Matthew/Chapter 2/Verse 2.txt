<p><b>2.</b><i>Where is he who has been born King?</i> The notion of some commentators, that he is said to have been <i>born King,</i> by indirect contrast with one who has been <i>made</i> or <i>created</i> a king, appears to me too trifling. I rather suppose the <i>Magi</i> to have simply meant, that this king had been recently born, and was still a child, by way of distinguishing him from a king who is of age, and who holds the reins of government: for they immediately add, that they had been drawn, not by the fame of his exploits, or by any present exhibitions of his greatness, but by a heavenly presage of his future reign. But if the sight of a star had so powerful an effect on the <i>Magi,</i> woe to our insensibility, who, now that Christ the King has been revealed to us, are so cold in our inquiries after him! </p>
<p><i>And have come that we may worship him</i> The reason why the <i>star</i> had been exhibited was, to draw the <i>Magi</i> into Judea, that they might be witnesses and heralds of the new King. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(180)</sup></span> So far as respects themselves, they had not come to render to Christ such pious worship, as is due to the Son of God, but intended to salute him, according to the Persian custom, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(181)</sup></span> as a very eminent King. For their views, with regard to him, probably went no farther, than that his power and exalted rank would be so extraordinary as to impress all nations with just admiration and reverence. It is even possible, that they wished to gain his favor beforehand, that he might treat them favorably and kindly, if he should afterwards happen to possess dominion in the east. </p>
