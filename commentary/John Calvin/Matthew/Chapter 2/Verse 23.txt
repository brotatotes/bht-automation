<p><b>23.</b><i>He shall be called a Nazarene</i> Matthew does not derive <i>Nazarene</i> from <i>Nazareth,</i> as if this were its strict and proper etymology, but only makes an allusion. The word <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">נזיר</span></blu></heb>, or <i>Nazarite,</i> signifies <i>holy and devoted to God,</i> and is derived from <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">נזר</span></blu></heb>, <i>to separate.</i> The noun <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">נזר</span></blu></heb>, indeed, signifies a <i>flower:</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(221)</sup></span> but Matthew refers, beyond all doubt, to the former meaning. For we nowhere read that <i>Nazarites</i> meant <i>blooming</i> or <i>flourishing,</i> but persons who were <i>consecrated to God,</i> according to the directions given by the Law, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:1">Numbers 6:1</span>) The meaning is: though it was by fear that Joseph was driven into a corner of Galilee, yet God had a higher design, and appointed <i>the city of Nazareth</i> as the place of Christ’s residence, that he might justly be called a <i>Nazarite</i> But it is asked, who are the prophets that gave this name to Christ? for there is no passage to be found that answers to the quotation. Some think it a sufficient answer, that Scripture frequently calls him <i>Holy:</i> but that is a very poor explanation. For Matthew, as we perceive, makes an express reference to the very word, and to the ancient Nazarites, whose holiness was of a peculiar character. He tells us, that what was then shadowed out in the Nazarites, who were, in some sense, selected as the first-fruits to God, must have been fulfilled in the person of Christ. </p>
<p>But it remains to be seen, in what part of Scripture the prophets have stated that this name would be given to Christ. Chrysostom, finding himself unable to loose the knot, cuts it by saying, that many books of the prophets have perished. But this answer has no probability: for, though the Lord, in order to punish the indifference of his ancient people, deprived them of some part of Scripture, or left out what was less necessary, yet, since the coming of Christ, no part of it has been lost. In support of that view, a strange blunder has been made, by quoting a passage of Josephus, in which he states that Ezekiel left two books: for Ezekiel’s prophecy of a new temple and kingdom is manifestly distinct from his other predictions, and may be said to form a new work. But if all the books of Scripture which were extant in the time of Matthew, remain entire to the present day, we must find somewhere the passage quoted from the prophets. </p>
<p><i>Bucer</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(222)</sup></span> has explained it, I think, more correctly than any other writer. He thinks that the reference is to a passage in the Book of Judges: <i>The child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jdg+13:5">Judges 13:5</span>.) These words, no doubt, were spoken with regard to Samson. But Samson is called the “Redeemer” or “Deliverer” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(223)</sup></span> of the people, only because he was a figure of Christ, and because the salvation, which was accomplished by his instrumentality, was a sort of prelude of the full salvation, which was at length exhibited to the world by the Son of God. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(224)</sup></span> All that Scripture predicts, in a favorable manner, about Samson, may justly be applied to Christ. To express it more clearly, Christ is the original model: Samson is the inferior antitype. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(225)</sup></span> When he assumed the character of a <i>Redeemer,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(226)</sup></span> we ought to understand, that none of the titles bestowed on that illustrious and truly divine office apply so strictly to himself as to Christ: for the fathers did but taste the grace of redemption, which we have been permitted to receive fully in Christ. </p>
<p>Matthew uses the word <i>prophets</i> in the plural number. This may easily be excused: for the Book of Judges was composed by many <i>prophets.</i> But I think that what is here said about <i>the prophets</i> has a still wider reference. For Joseph, who was a temporal Savior of the Church, and was, in many respects, a figure, or rather a lively image of Christ, is called <i>a Nazarite of his brethren,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(227)</sup></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:26">Genesis 49:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+33:16">Deuteronomy 33:16</span>.) God determined that the distinguished honor, of which he had given a specimen in Joseph, should shine again in Samson, and gave him the name of <i>Nazarite,</i> that believers, having received those early instructions, might look more earnestly at the Redeemer who was to come, who was to be <i>separated</i> from all, </p>
<p>“That he might be the first-born among many brethren,” <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>.) </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(221)</span> It would have been more correct to say that the noun <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">נזר</span></blu></heb> signifies <i>a crown</i> than a flower. <i>“Thou</i> shalt put <i>the holy crown,”</i> <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">את</span></blu> <blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">נזר</span></blu> <blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">הקדש</span></blu></heb>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:6">Exodus 29:6</span>.) “Thou hast profaned <i>his crown,”</i> <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">נזרו</span></blu></heb>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:39">Psalms 89:39</span>.) It is satisfactory to have the support of so eminent a critic as Dr Tholuck, who, in his very correct edition of Calvin’s Commentary on the New Testament, after the word florem, <i>flower,</i> places in brackets an emendation similar to what we have suggested: “<blu><i>vel potius, diadematis insigne</i></blu> <i>,”</i> —<i>”</i> or rather, the emblem of a crown.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(223)</span> The remaining words of the passage (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jdg+13:5">Judges 13:5</span>) are: <i>and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hands of the Philistines;</i> which our author interprets as having a prophetic reference to Christ. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(227)</span> In both of the passages quoted above, the words <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">נזיר</span></blu> <blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">אחיו</span></blu></heb> are rendered, in the English version, <i>separated from his brethren.</i> This brings out pretty faithfully the meaning of <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">נזיר</span></blu></heb>, <i>separated,</i> but does not suggest the allusion, which Calvin supposes to be made to the peculiar acceptation given by the ceremonial law to <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">נזיר</span></blu></heb>, from which our word <i>Nazarite</i> is derived. Hebrew scholars must judge for themselves as to the probability of the allusion. Without entering into that inquiry, which would occupy more space than we could easily spare, we have thought it due to our Author to hint, that the two passages which he quotes, and which at first sight appear to have no bearing on his argument, contain the very <i>word</i> in questlon. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
