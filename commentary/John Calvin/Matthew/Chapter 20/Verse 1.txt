<p>As this parable is nothing else than a confirmation of the preceding sentence, <i>the last shall be first,</i> it now remains to see in what manner it ought to be applied. Some commentators reduce it to this general proposition, that the glory of all; will be equal, because the heavenly inheritance is not obtained by the merits of works, but is bestowed freely. But Christ does not here argue either about the equality of the heavenly glory, or about the future condition of the godly. He only declares that those who were first in point of time have no right to boast or to insult others; because the Lord, whenever he pleases, may call those whom he appeared for a time to disregard, and may make them equal, or even superior, to the first. If any man should resolve to sift out with exactness every portion of this parable, his curiosity would be useless; and therefore we have nothing more to inquire than what was the design of Christ to teach. Now we have already said that he had no other object in view than to excite his people by continual spurs to make progress. We know that indolence almost always springs from excessive confidence; and this is the reason why many, as if they had reached the goal, stop short in the middle of the course. Thus Paul enjoins us to <i>forget the things which are behind</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+3:13">Philippians 3:13</span>,) that, reflecting on what yet remains for us, we may arouse ourselves to persevere in running. But there will be no harm in examining the words, that the doctrine may be more clearly evinced. </p>
<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:1">Matthew 20:1</span></b><b>.</b><i>For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder.</i> The meaning is, that such is the nature of the divine calling, as if a man were, early in the morning, to hire laborers for the cultivation of his vineyard at a fixed price, and were afterwards to employ others without an agreement, but to give them an equal hire. He uses the phrase, <i>kingdom of heaven,</i> because he compares the spiritual life to the earthly life, and the reward of eternal life to money which men pay in return for work that has been done for them. There are some who give an ingenious interpretation to this passage, as if Christ were distinguishing between Jews and Gentiles. The Jews, they tell us, were called <i>at the first hour,</i> with an agreement as to the hire; for the Lord promised to them eternal life, on the condition that they should fulfill the law; while, in calling the Gentiles, no bargain was made at least as to works, for salvation was freely offered to them in Christ. But all subtleties of that sort are unseasonable; for the Lord makes no distinction in the bargain, but only in the time; because those who entered <i>last</i>, and in the evening, <i>into the vineyard</i>, receive the same hire with <i>the first</i> Though, in the Law, God formerly promised to the Jews the hire of works, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+18:5">Leviticus 18:5</span>,) yet we know that this was without effect, because no man ever obtained salvation by his merits. </p>
<p>Why then, it will be said, does Christ expressly mention a bargain <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(643)</sup></span> in reference to <i>the first</i>, but make no mention of it in reference to the others? It was in order to show that, without doing injury to any one, as much honor is conferred on <i>the last</i>, as if they had been called at the beginning. For strictly speaking, he owes no man any thing, and from us, who are devoted to his service, he demands, as a matter of right, all the duties which are incumbent on us. But as he freely offers to us a <i>reward</i>, he is said to <i>hire</i> the labors which, on other grounds, were due to him. This is also the reason why he gives the name of <i>a hire</i> to the crown which he bestows freely. Again, in order to show that we have no right to complain of God, if he make us companions in honor with those who followed us after a long interval, he borrowed a comparison from the ordinary custom of men, who bargain about the <i>hire</i>, before they send laborers to their work. </p>
<p>If any man infer from this, that men are created for the purpose of doing something, and that every man has his province assigned him by God, that they may not sit down in idleness, he will offer no violence to the words of Christ. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(644)</sup></span> We are also at liberty to infer, that our whole life is unprofitable, and that we are justly accused of indolence, until each of us regulate his life by the command and calling of God. Hence it follows, that they labor to no purpose, who rashly undertake this or that course of life, and do not wait for the intimation of the call of God. Lastly, we learn from the words of Christ, that those only are pleasing to God, who labor for the advantage of their brethren. </p>
<p><i>A penny</i> (which was rather more than four times the value of a French <i>carolus</i>,) <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(645)</sup></span> was probably the ordinary hire for a day’s work. The <i>third</i>, <i>sixth</i>, and <i>ninth hour</i>, are expressly mentioned, because, while the ancients were wont to divide the day into twelve hours, from sunrise to sunset, there was another division of the day into every three hours; as, again, the night was divided into four <i>watches;</i> and so <i>the eleventh hour</i> means the close of the day. </p>
