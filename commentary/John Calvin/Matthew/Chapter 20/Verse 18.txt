<p><b>18.</b><i>Lo, we go up to Jerusalem.</i> Hence we perceive that Christ was endued with divine fortitude for overcoming the terrors of death, for he knowingly and willingly hastens to undergo it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(649)</sup></span> For why does he, without any constraint, march forward to suffer a shocking murder, but because the invincible power of the Spirit enabled him to subdue fear, and raised him above all human feelings? By a minute detail of the circumstances, he gives a still more evident proof of his Divinity. For he could not — as <i>man</i> — <i>have</i> foreseen that, after having been <i>condemned by the chief priests and scribes</i>, he would be <i>delivered up to the Gentiles,</i> and <i>spat on</i>, and <i>mocked</i> in various ways, and <i>scourged</i>, and at length dragged to the punishment of the <i>cross</i> Yet it must be observed that, though our Lord was fully acquainted with the weakness of his disciples, he does not conceal from them a very grievous offense. For — as we have said on a former occasion <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(650)</sup></span> — nothing could at that time have happened more powerfully calculated to shake the minds of the godly, than to see the whole of the sacred order of the Church opposed to Christ. </p>
<p>And yet he does not spare their weakness by deceiving them, but, candidly declaring the whole matter, points out the way to overcome temptation; namely, by looking forward with certainty to his resurrection. But as it was necessary that His death should go before, he makes their triumph, in the meantime, to consist in hope. </p>
