<p><b>22.</b><i>You know not what you ask.</i> Their ignorance was worthy of blame on two accounts; first, because their ambition led them to desire more than was proper; and, secondly, because, instead of the heavenly kingdom of Christ, they had formed the idea of a phantom in the air. As to the first of those reasons, whoever is not satisfied with the free adoption of God, and desires to raise himself, such a person wanders beyond his limits, and, by unseasonably pressing himself forward beyond what was proper for him to do, is ungrateful to God. Now to estimate the spiritual kingdom of Christ according to the feeling of our flesh is highly perverse. And, indeed, the greater the delight which the mind of man takes in idle speculations, the more carefully ought we to guard against them; as we see that the books of the sophists are stuffed with useless notions of this sort. </p>
<p><i>Can you drink the cup which I shall drink?</i> To correct their ambition, and to withdraw them from this wicked desire, he holds out to them the cross, and all the annoyances which the children of God must endure. As if he had said, “Does your present warfare allow you so much leisure, that you are now making arrangements for a triumphal procession?” For if they had been earnestly employed in the duties of their calling, they would never have given way to this wicked imagination. In these words, therefore, those who are desirous to obtain the prize before the proper time are enjoined by Christ to employ themselves in attending to the duties of piety. And certainly this is an excellent bridle for restraining ambition; for, so long as we are pilgrims in this world, our condition is such as ought to banish vain luxuries. We are surrounded by a thousand dangers. Sometimes the enemy assails us by ambush, and that in a variety of ways; and sometimes he attacks us by open violence. Is he not worse than stupid who, amidst so many deaths, entertains himself at his ease by drawing pictures of a triumph? </p>
<p>Our Lord enjoins his followers, indeed, to feel assured of victory, and to sing a triumphal song in the midst of death; for otherwise they would not have courage to fight valiantly. But it is one thing to advance manfully to the battle, in reliance on the reward which God has promised to them, and to labor with their whole might for this object; and it is another thing to forget the contest, to turn aside from the enemy, to lose sight of dangers, and to rush forward to triumph, for which they ought to wait till the proper time. Besides, this foolish speed, for the most part, draws men aside from their calling; for as in battle the greatest coward is the keenest to seize the booty, so in the kingdom of Christ none are more eager to obtain the superiority than those who shrink from all the annoyance which attends toil. Most properly, therefore, does Christ enjoin those who were puffed up with vain glory to keep by their post. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(655)</sup></span> The sum of the whole is, that for none but him who has fought lawfully is the crown prepared; and especially, that none will be a partaker of the life and the kingdom of Christ who has not previously shared in his sufferings and death. </p>
<p>In the word <i>baptism</i> the force of the metaphor is very evident; for we know that by <i>baptism</i> believers are instructed <i>to deny themselves</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+45:24">Matthew 45:24</span>;) to <i>crucify the old man</i>, ( <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>;) and, in short, to <i>bear the cross</i> It is uncertain if, by the word <i>cup</i>, <i>(</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ποτήριον</span></blu></grk>, <i>)</i> our Lord alluded to the mystery of the Holy Supper; but as it had not yet come into use, I choose to interpret it more simply as denoting the measure of afflictions which God appoints to every one. For as it is his right to lay on every one his own burden according to his pleasure, in the same manner as a householder distributes and allots the portions of the members of his family, so He is said to <i>give them a cup to drink</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(656)</sup></span> </p>
<p>These words contain no ordinary consolation for alleviating the bitterness of <i>the cross</i>, when in <i>the cross</i> Christ associates himself with us. And what could be more desirable than to have every thing in common with the Son of God? for thus are those things which at first sight appear to be deadly made to yield to us salvation and life. On the other hand, how shall he be reckoned among the disciples of Christ, who desires to be wholly exempted from the cross? For such person refuses to submit to the baptism of Christ, which is nothing else than to withdraw from the earliest lessons. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(657)</sup></span> Now whenever baptism is mentioned, let us recollect that we were baptized on this condition, and for this purpose, that the cross may be attached to our shoulders. </p>
<p>The boast made with so much confidence by John and James, that they are prepared <i>to drink the cup</i>, manifests the presumption of the flesh; for, when we are beyond the reach of darts, we think nothing impossible. And not long afterwards, the melancholy result exposed their rashness; but in so far it was good in them that, when they were free to make a choice, they presented themselves to bear the cross. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(655)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">A bon droict done Christ royant ses deux disciples eslevez d’une vaine gloire, les arreste a penser aux choses qui concernent le devoir de leur vocation</span></blu>;” — “with good reason, then, does Christ, seeing his two disciples carried away by vain glory, make them stop to consider the things which belong to the duty of their calling.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(656)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Il est dit pour ceste cause, que Dieu donne la coupe a boire</span></blu>;” — “for this reason it is said that God gives the cup to drink.” </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(657)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Car cela n’est proprement autre chose que se retirer des commencemens, et ne vouloir entrer a la premiere lecon de son eschole</span></blu>;” — “for that is properly nothing else than to withdraw at the beginning, and to refuse to enter into the first lesson of his school.” </p>
