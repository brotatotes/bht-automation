<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:24">Matthew 20:24</span></b><b>.</b><i>And when the ten heard it.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(660)</sup></span> Luke appears to refer this dispute to a different time. But any one who shall carefully examine that twenty-second chapter will plainly see that discourses delivered at different times are there brought together, without any regard to order. The dispute about the primacy, therefore which Luke mentions, flowed from this source, that <i>the sons of Zebedee</i> aspired to the first places in the kingdom of Christ. And yet the displeasure of the rest was far from being well-founded; for, while the foolish ambition of the <i>two disciples</i> was so severely blamed, that they retired from Christ with disgrace, what injury was it to the other <i>ten</i>, that those disciples foolishly wished what they did not obtain? <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(661)</sup></span> For though they had a good right to be offended at the ambition of those disciples, yet when it was put down they ought to have been satisfied. But our Lord intended to seize on this occasion for laying open a disease which was lurking within them; for there was not one of them who would willingly yield to others, but every one secretly cherished within himself the expectation of the primacy; in consequence of which, they envy and dispute with one another, and yet in all there reigns wicked ambition. And if this fault was found to be natural to uneducated men of ordinary rank, and if it broke out on a slight occasion, and almost without any occasion at all, how much more ought we to be on our guard, when there is abundance of fuel to feed a concealed flame? We see then how ambition springs up in any man who has great power and honors, and sends out its flames far and wide, unless the spirit of modesty, coming from heaven, extinguish the pride which has a firm hold of the nature of man. </p>
