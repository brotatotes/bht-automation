<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:29">Matthew 20:29</span></b><b>.</b><i>And while they were departing from Jericho. Osiander</i> has resolved to display his ingenuity by making four blind men out of one. But nothing can be more frivolous than this supposition. Having observed that the Evangelists differ in a few expressions, he imagined that <i>one blind man received sight</i> when they were entering into the city, and that the second, and other two, <i>received sight</i> when Christ <i>was departing from it.</i> But all the circumstances agree so completely, that no person of sound judgment will believe them to be different narratives. Not to mention other matters, when Christ’s followers had endeavored to put the first to silence, and saw him cured contrary to their expectation, would they immediately have made the same attempt with the other three? But it is unnecessary to go into particulars, from which any man may easily infer that it is one and the same event which is related. </p>
<p>But there is a puzzling contradiction in this respect, that <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Mark</i> say that the miracle was performed on <i>one</i> or on <i>two blind men,</i> when Christ had already <i>departed from the city;</i> while Luke relates that it was done before he came to the city. Besides, <i>Mark</i> and <i>Luke</i> speak of not more than <i>one blind man</i>, while <i>Matthew</i> mentions <i>two</i>. But as we know that it frequently occurs in the Evangelists, that in the same narrative one passes by what is mentioned by the others, and, on the other hand, states more clearly what they have omitted, it ought not to be looked upon as strange or unusual in the present passage. My conjecture is, that, while Christ was approaching to the city, the <i>blind man cried out,</i> but that, as he was not heard on account of the noise, he placed himself in the way, <i>as they were departing from the city,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(669)</sup></span> and then was at length called by Christ. And so <i>Luke,</i> commencing with what was true, does not follow out the whole narrative, but passes over Christ’s stay in the city; while the other Evangelists attend only to the time which was nearer to the miracle. There is probability in the conjecture that, as Christ frequently, when he wished to try the faith of men, delayed for a short time to relieve them, so he subjected this <i>blind man</i> to the same scrutiny. </p>
<p>The second difficulty may be speedily removed; for we have seen, on a former occasion, that Mark and <i>Luke</i> speak of <i>one</i> demoniac as having been cured, while <i>Matthew</i>, as in the present instance, mentions <i>two</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:28">Matthew 8:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:2">Mark 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:27">Luke 8:27</span> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(670)</sup></span>) And yet this involves no contradiction between them; but it may rather be conjectured with probability, that at first <i>one blind man</i> implored the favor of Christ, and that another was excited by his example, and that in this way <i>two</i> persons <i>received sight Mark</i> and <i>Luke</i> speak of <i>one</i> only, either because he was better known, or because in him the demonstration of Christ’s power was not less remarkable than it was in both. It certainly appears to have been on account of his having been extensively known that he was selected by <i>Mark</i>, who gives both his own name and that of his father: <i>Bartimeus, son of Timeus</i> By doing so, he does not claim for him either illustrious descent or wealth; for he was a beggar of the lowest class. Hence it appears that the miracle was more remarkable in his person, because his calamity had been generally known. This appears to me to be the reason why <i>Mark</i> and <i>Luke</i> mention him only, and say nothing about the other, who was a sort of inferior appendage. But <i>Matthew</i>, who was an eye-witness, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(671)</sup></span> did not choose to pass by even this person, though less known. </p>
