<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:10">Matthew 21:10</span></b><b>.</b><i>When he entered into Jerusalem.</i> Matthew says that <i>the city was moved,</i> in order to inform us that the transaction did not take place secretly, or by stealth, but in the presence of all the people, and that the priests and scribes were not ignorant of it. Under this despicable aspect of the flesh the majesty of the Spirit was apparent; for how would they have endured that Christ should be conducted into the city, attended by the splendor of royalty, with so great danger to themselves, if they had not been seized with astonishment? The substance of it therefore is, that Christ’s entrance was not made in a private manner, and that his enemies abstained from opposing it, not because they treated him with contempt, but rather because they were restrained by secret fear; for God had struck them with such alarm, that they dare not make any attempt. At the same time, the Evangelist glances at the careless indifference of the city, and commends the piety of those who have just reached it; for when the inhabitants, on hearing the noise, inquire, <i>Who is this?</i> it is manifest that they do not belong to the number of Christ’s followers. </p>
