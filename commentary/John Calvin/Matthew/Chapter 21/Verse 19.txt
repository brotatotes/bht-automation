<p><b>19</b><i>Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth.</i> Let us learn from this what is the meaning of the word <i>curse,</i> namely, that the tree should be condemned to barrenness; as, on the other hand, God <i>blesses,</i> when by his voice he bestows fertility. It appears more clearly from Mark <i>,</i> that the fig-tree did not instantly wither, or, at least, that it was not observed by his disciples, until they saw it next day stripped of <i>leaves.</i> Mark <i>,</i> too, attributes to <i>Peter</i> what Matthew attributes equally to all the disciples; but as Christ replies in the plural number, it may naturally be inferred that one put the question in the name of all. </p>
