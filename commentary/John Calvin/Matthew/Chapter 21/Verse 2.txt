<p><b>2.</b><i>Go into the village.</i> As he was <i>at Bethany</i>, he did not ask for <i>an ass</i> to relieve the fatigue of traveling; for he could easily have performed the rest of the journey on foot. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(714)</sup></span> But as kings are wont to ascend their chariots, from which they may be easily seen, so the Lord intended to turn the eyes of the people on himself, and to place some mark of approbation on the applauses of his followers, lest any might think that he unwillingly received the honor of a king. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(715)</sup></span> </p>
<p>From what place he ordered <i>the ass</i> to be brought is uncertain, except, what may naturally be inferred, that it was some village adjoining to the city; for the allegorical exposition of it, which some give, as applying to Jerusalem, is ridiculous. Not a whit more admissible is the allegory which certain persons have contrived about the <i>ass</i> and the <i>colt</i> “The <i>she-ass,”</i> they tell us, “is a figure of the Jewish nation, which had been long subdued, and accustomed to the yoke of the Law. The Gentiles, again, are represented by <i>the colt, on which no man ever sat.</i> Christ sat first on the <i>ass</i> for this reason, that it was proper for him to begin with the Jews; and afterwards he passed over to the <i>colt</i>, because he was appointed to govern the Gentiles also in the second place.” And indeed Matthew appears to say that he rode on both of them; but as instances of <i>Synecdoche</i> occur frequently in Scripture, we need not wonder if he mentions two instead of one. From the other Evangelists it appears manifestly that the <i>colt</i> only was used by Christ; and all doubt is removed by Zechariah, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:9">Zechariah 9:9</span>,)who twice repeats the same thing, according to the ordinary custom of the Hebrew language. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(716)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>And immediately you will find</i> That the disciples may feel no hesitation about immediate compliance, our Lord anticipates and replies to their questions. First, he explains that he does not send them away at random, and this he does by saying that, at the very entrance into the village, they will find an <i>ass-colt with its mother;</i> and, secondly, that nobody will hinder them from leading him away, if they only reply that He <i>hath need of him</i> In this way he proved his Divinity; for both to know absent matters, and to bend the hearts of men to compliance, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(717)</sup></span> belonged to God alone. It was, no doubt, possible that the owner of the ass, entertaining no unfavorable opinion of Christ, would cheerfully grant it; but to foresee if he would be at home, if it would then be convenient for him, or if he would place confidence in unknown persons, was not in the power of a mortal man. Again, as Christ strengthens the disciples, that they may be more ready to obey, so we see how they, on the other hand, yield submission. The result shows that the whole of this affair was directed by God. </p>
