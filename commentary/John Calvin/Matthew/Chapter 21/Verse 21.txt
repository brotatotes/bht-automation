<p><b>21</b><i>And Jesus answering.</i> The use of the miracle is still farther extended by Christ, in order to excite his disciples to faith and confidence. By Mark <i>,</i> the general exhortation is placed first, <i>to have faith in God;</i> and then follows the promise, that they would obtain by faith whatever they asked from God. <i>To have faith in God</i> means, to expect, and to be fully assured of obtaining, from God whatever we need. But as faith, if we have any, breaks out immediately into prayer, and penetrates into the treasures of the grace of God, which are held out to us in the word, in order to enjoy them, so Christ adds <i>prayer</i> to <i>faith;</i> for if he had only said that we shall have whatever we wish, some would have thought <i>that faith</i> was presumptuous or too careless. And therefore Christ shows that those only are believers who, relying on his goodness and promises, betake themselves to him with humility. </p>
<p>This passage is exceedingly adapted to point out the power and nature of <i>faith;</i> that it is a certainty, relying on the goodness of God, which does not admit of doubt. For Christ does not acknowledge as believers any but those who are fully convinced that God is reconciled to them, and do not doubt that he will give what they ask. Hence we perceive by what a diabolical contrivance the Papists are bewitched, who mingle <i>faith</i> with <i>doubt,</i> and even charge us with foolish presumption, if we venture to appear before God under the conviction of His fatherly regard toward us. But this benefit derived from Christ is that on which Paul chiefly dwells, when he says that </p>
<p>by the faith of him we have boldness<br/>to approach to God with confidence (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:12">Ephesians 3:12</span>). </p>
<p>This passage shows also that the true test of <i>faith</i> lies in <i>prayer.</i> If it be objected, that those prayers are never heard, <i>that mountains should be thrown into the sea,</i> the answer is easy. Christ does not give a loose rein to the wishes of men, that they should desire any thing at their pleasure, when he places <i>prayer</i> after the rule of faith; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(22)</sup></span> for in this way the Spirit must of necessity hold all our affections by the bridle of the word of God, and bring them into obedience. Christ demands a firm and undoubting confidence of obtaining an answer; and whence does the human mind obtain that confidence but from the word of God? We now see then that Christ promises nothing to his disciples, unless they keep themselves within the limits of the good pleasure of God. </p>
