<p><b>32.</b><i>For John came.</i> As <i>John</i> was a faithful servant of God, whatever he taught Christ ascribes to God himself. It might have been more fully expressed thus: God came pointing out <i>the way of righteousness</i> by the mouth of <i>John;</i> but as <i>John</i> spoke in the name of God, and not as a private individual, he is most properly named instead of God. Now this passage gives no small authority to the preaching of the word, when those persons are said to have been disobedient and rebellious against God, who despised the pious and holy warnings of a teacher whom tie had sent. </p>
<p>There are some who give a more ingenious exposition of the word <i>righteousness,</i> and I allow them to enjoy their own opinion; but, for my own part, I think that it means nothing more than that <i>John’s</i> doctrine was pure and right; as if Christ had said, that they had no good reason for rejecting him. When he says that <i>the publicans believed,</i> he does not mean that they assented in words, but that they sincerely embraced what they had heard. Hence we infer, that faith does not consist solely in a person’s giving his assent to true doctrine, but that it embraces something greater and loftier, that the hearer, renouncing himself, devotes his life wholly to God. By saying that they were not moved even by such an example, he presents an aggravated view of their malice; for it was an evidence of the lowest depravity, not even to follow <i>the harlots and the publicans.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(36)</sup></span> </p>
