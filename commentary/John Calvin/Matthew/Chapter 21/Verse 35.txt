<p><b>35.</b><i>And wounded one, and killed another.</i> Here Mark andLuke differ a little from Matthew <i>;</i> for while Matthew mentions many servants, all of whom were ill-treated and insulted, and says that <i>afterwards other servants were sent more numerous than the first, Mark</i> and Luke mention but one at a time, as if the <i>servants</i> had been sent, not two or three together, but one after another. But though all the three Evangelists have the same object in view, namely, to show that the Jews will dare to act towards the Son in the same manner as they have repeatedly done towards the prophets, Matthew explains the matter more at large, namely, that God, by sending a multitude of prophets, contended with the malice of the priests. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(45)</sup></span> Hence it appears how obstinate their malice was, for the correction of which no remedies were of any avail. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(46)</sup></span> </p>
