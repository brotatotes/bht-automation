<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:1">Matthew 22:1</span></b><b>.</b><i>And Jesus answering.</i> Though <i>Matthew</i> relates this parable among other discourses which were delivered by Christ about the time of the last Passover, yet as he does not specify any particular time, and as <i>Luke</i> expressly affirms that Christ delivered this discourse <i>while he sat at table in the house of a Pharisee,</i> I have thought it better to follow this order. The design which Matthew had in view was, to point out the reasons why the scribes were excited to the highest pitch of fury; and therefore he properly placed it in the midst of those discourses which were hateful to them, and interwove it with those discourses, without attending to the order of time. But we must attend to <i>Luke’s</i> narrative, who says that, <i>when one of those who sat at table with him said, Blessed is he that eateth bread in the kingdom of God,</i> Christ took occasion from it to upbraid the Jews with ingratitude. It is by no means probable, that the guest and friend of a Pharisee broke out into this exclamation from any sincere feeling of piety. Still, I do not look upon it as having been spoken in derision; but, as persons who have a moderate knowledge of the faith, and are not openly wicked, are in the habit of indulging, amidst their cups, in idle talk about eternal life, I think that this man threw out a remark about future blessedness, in order to draw out some observation in return from Christ. And his words make it manifest, that he had nothing in view beyond what was gross and earthly; for he did not employ the phrase, <i>eat bread,</i> as a metaphor for <i>enjoy eternal life,</i> but appears to have dreamed of I know not what state, filled with prosperity and abundance of all things. The meaning is, <i>Blessed shall they be who shall eat the bread of God,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(291)</sup></span> after that he has collected his children into <i>his kingdom.</i> </p>
