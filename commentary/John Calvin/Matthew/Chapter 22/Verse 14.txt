<p><b>14.</b><i>For many are called, but few are chosen.</i> The object of the parable is pointed out by the conclusion, that <i>few are chosen,</i> though <i>many are called;</i> from which we infer, that we ought not to attempt an ingenious explanation of every minute clause. But lately, Christ did not threaten that the greater part would be thrown out, but mentioned one man only; and now we learn from him, that out of a large number few will be retained. And certainly, though in the present day a more numerous body of men is collected into the Church by the Gospel than was formerly collected by the Law, it is but a small portion of them whose faith is evinced by newness of life. Let us not flatter ourselves with the empty title of faith, but let every man seriously examine himself, that at the final review he may be pronounced to be one of the lawful guests; for, as Paul reminds us, that <i>the vessels</i> in the Lord’s house are not all of the same kind, so </p>
<p>let every one that calleth on the name of the Lord <br/>depart from iniquity, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:19">2 Timothy 2:19</span>.) </p>
<p>I enter no farther, at present, into the question about the eternal election of God; for the words of Christ mean nothing more than this, that the external profession of faith is not a sufficient proof that God will acknowledge as his people all who appear to have accepted of his invitation. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(293)</sup></span> </p>
