<p><b>16.</b><i>Master, we know that thou art true.</i> This is the <i>righteousness</i> which they counterfeit, when they offer humble subjection to Christ, as if they were desirous to learn, and as if they not only had some relish for piety, but also were fully convinced of his doctrine; for if what they said had been from the heart, this would have been true uprightness. And therefore from their words we may obtain a definition of a good and faithful teacher, such as they pretended to believe Christ to be. They say that he is <i>true, and teaches the way of God;</i> that is, he is a faithful interpreter of God, and that he teaches it <i>in truth;</i> that is, without any corruption. <i>The way of God</i> is contrasted with the inventions of men, and with all foreign doctrines; and <i>truth</i> is contrasted with ambition, covetousness, and other wicked dispositions, which usually corrupt the purity of instruction. So then he ought to be reckoned a <i>true teacher,</i> who does not introduce the contrivances of men, or depart from the pure word of God, but gives out, as it were, with his hands what he has learned from the mouth of God, and who, from a sincere desire of edification, accommodates his doctrine to the advantage and salvation of the people, and does not debase it by any disguise. As to this latter clause, when Paul asserts that he </p>
<p>does not make merchandise of the word of God, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span>,) </p>
<p>he means that there are some persons who use dexterity, and do not openly overturn sound doctrine, or incur the disgrace of holding wicked opinions, but who disguise and corrupt the purity of doctrine, because they are ambitious, or covetous, or easily turned in various directions according to their earnest desire. He therefore compares them to <i>jockeys,</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κυπηλλεύοντες</span></blu></grk>,) because they deprave the pure use of the word of God. </p>
<p><i>For thou regardest not the person of men.</i> It is also worthy of attention, that those hypocrites likewise add, that Christ teaches rightly, <i>because he has no regard for the person of men.</i> Nothing has a more powerful tendency to withdraw teachers from a faithful and upright dispensation of the word than to pay <i>respect</i> to men; for it is impossible that any one who </p>
<p>desires to please men (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:10">Galatians 1:10</span>) </p>
<p>should truly devote himself to God. Some attention, no doubt, is due to men, but not so as to obtain their favor by flattery. In short, in order to walk uprightly, we must necessarily put away <i>respect of persons,</i> which <i>obscures the light and perverts right judgment,</i> as God frequently inculcates in the <i>Law,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+1:16">Deuteronomy 1:16</span>,) and as experience also points out. Thus Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:24">John 7:24</span>) contrasts <i>acceptance of persons</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">προσωποληψίαν</span></blu></grk>) and <i>sound judgment</i> as things totally different. </p>
