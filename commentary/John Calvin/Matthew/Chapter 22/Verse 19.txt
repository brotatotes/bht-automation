<p><b>19.</b><i>Show me the tribute-money.</i> When Christ orders them to bring forward a coin, though at first sight it appears to be of no great importance, yet it is sufficient for breaking their snares. In this way they had already made an acknowledgment of subjection, so that Christ did not find it necessary to enjoin upon them any thing new. The coin was stamped with <i>Caesar’s likeness;</i> and thus the authority of the Roman government had been approved and admitted by the general practice. Hence it was evident that the Jews themselves had voluntarily come under obligation to pay tribute for they had given up to the Romans the power of the sword; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(62)</sup></span> and there was no propriety in making a separate dispute about <i>the tribute-money,</i> for that question depended on the general arrangements of the government. </p>
