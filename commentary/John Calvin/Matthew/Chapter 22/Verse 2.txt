<p><b>2.</b><i>The kingdom of heaven is like a human king</i> As it was long ago said by a Spartan, that the Athenians knew what was right, but did not choose to practice it; so Christ now brings it as a reproach against the Jews, that they gave utterance to beautiful expressions about <i>the kingdom of God,</i> but, when God kindly and gently invited them, they rejected his grace with disdain. There is no room to doubt that the discourse is expressly levelled against the Jews, as will more plainly appear a little afterwards. </p>
<p><i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke</i> differ in this respect, that <i>Matthew</i> details many circumstances, while <i>Luke</i> states the matter summarily, and in a general manner. Thus, <i>Matthew</i> says that <i>a king made a marriage for his son: Luke</i> only mentions <i>a great supper</i> The former speaks of <i>many servants,</i> while the latter refers to no more than <i>one servant;</i> the former describes <i>many</i> messages, the latter mentions <i>one</i> only; the former says that some of the servants were <i>abused</i> or slain, the latter speaks only of their being treated with contempt. Lastly, the former relates that a man was cast out, who <i>had gone in to the marriage without a wedding garment,</i> of which Luke makes no mention. But we have formerly pointed out a similar distinction, that <i>Matthew,</i> in explaining the same thing, is more copious, and enters into fuller details. There is a remarkable agreement between them on the main points of the parable. </p>
<p>God bestowed on the Jews distinguished honor, by providing for them, as it were, a hospitable table; but they despised the honor which had been conferred upon them. The marriage of the king’s son is explained by many commentators to mean, that <i>Christ is the end of the Law,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:4">Romans 10:4</span>.) and that God had no other design in his covenant, than to make him the Governor of his people, and to unite the Church to him by the sacred bond of a spiritual marriage. I have no objection to that view. But when he says, that the <i>servants were sent to call those who were invited,</i> these words are intended to point out a double favor which the Jews had received from God; first, in being preferred to other nations; and, secondly, in having their adoption made known to them by the prophets. The allusion is to a practice customary among men, that those who intended to <i>make a marriage</i> drew up a list of the persons whom they intended to have as guests, and afterwards sent invitations to them by their servants. In like manner, God elected the Jews in preference to others, as if they had been his familiar friends, and afterwards <i>called them</i> by the prophets to partake of the promised redemption, which was, as it were, to feast <i>at a marriage</i> It is true that those who were first invited did not live till the coming of Christ; but we know that all received an offer of the same salvation, of which they were deprived by their ingratitude and malice; for from the commencement, God’s invitation was impiously despised by that people. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(292)</sup></span> </p>
