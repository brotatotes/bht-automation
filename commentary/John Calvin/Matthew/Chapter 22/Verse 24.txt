<p><b>24.</b><i>Master, Moses said.</i> As it was enough to mention the bare fact, why do they make use of this preface? They cunningly employ the name of <i>Moses,</i> for the purpose of proving that they were lawful marriages, which had been contracted not by the will of men, but by the command and appointment of God himself. But that God should contradict Himself is impossible. Their sophistry therefore is this: “If God shall one day collect believers into His kingdom, He will restore whatever He had given to them in the world. What then shall become of the woman, whom God assigned to seven husbands?” Thus all ungodly persons and heretics forge their calumnies, that by means of them they may disfigure the true doctrine of godliness, and put to shame the servants of Christ. Nay, the Papists are restrained by no shame from openly ridiculing God and his word, when they attempt to take us by surprise. And not without reason, therefore, does Paul enjoin a teacher to be furnished with armor for repelling the adversaries of the truth, (<b>Titus 1:9</b>.) With respect to the law, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+25:5">Deuteronomy 25:5</span>,) by which God commanded the relatives, who were nearest of kin, to succeed the dead in marriage, if the first had died without children, the reason was, that the woman who had married into a particular family should leave offspring in it. But if there had been children by the first marriage, a marriage within the degrees forbidden by the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+18:16">Leviticus 18:16</span>) would have been incestuous. </p>
