<p><b>29.</b><i>You err, not knowing the Scriptures.</i> Though Christ addresses <i>the Sadducees,</i> yet this reproof applies generally to all inventors of false doctrines. For, since God makes known His will clearly in <i>the Scriptures,</i> the want of acquaintance with them is the source and cause of all errors. But this is no ordinary consolation to the godly, that they will be safe from the danger of <i>erring,</i> so long as they humbly, modestly, and submissively inquire from <i>the Scriptures</i> what is right and true. As to <i>the power of God</i> being connected by Christ with the word, it refers to the present occasion. For, since <i>the resurrection</i> far exceeds the capacity of the human senses, it will be incredible to us, till our minds rise to the contemplation of the boundless power of God, <i>by which,</i> as Paul tells us, </p>
<p>he is able to subdue all things to himself, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>.) </p>
<p>Besides, <i>the Sadducees</i> must have been void of understanding, when they committed the error of estimating the glory of the heavenly life according to the present state. In the meantime, we learn that those men form and express just and wise sentiments respecting the mysteries of the heavenly kingdom, who join <i>the power of God</i> with <i>the Scriptures.</i> </p>
