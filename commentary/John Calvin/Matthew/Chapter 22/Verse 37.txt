<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:37">Matthew 22:37</span></b><b>.</b><i>Thou shalt love the Lord thou God.</i> According to Mark, the preface is inserted, that <i>Jehovah alone is the God of Israel;</i> by which words God supports the authority of his law in two ways. For, first, it ought to be a powerful excitement to the worship of God, when we are fully convinced that we worship the actual Creator of heaven and earth, because indifference is naturally produced by doubt; and, secondly, because it is a pleasing inducement to <i>love</i> him, when he freely adopts us as his people. So then, that they may not hesitate, as usually happens in cases of uncertainty, the Jews are informed that the rule of life is prescribed to them by the true and only God; and, on the other hand, that they may not be kept back by distrust, God approaches to them in a familiar manner, and reminds them of his gracious covenant with them. And yet there is no reason to doubt that the Lord distinguishes himself from all idols, that the Jews may not be drawn aside from him, but may adhere to the pure worship of God himself. Now if uncertainty does not keep back the wretched worshippers of idols from being carried away to the love of them by impetuous zeal, what excuse is left for the hearers of the Law, if they remain indifferent, after that God has revealed himself to them? </p>
<p>What follows is an abridgment of the Law, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(73)</sup></span> which is also found in the writings of Moses, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+6:5">Deuteronomy 6:5</span>.) For, though it is divided into two tables, the first of which relates to the worship of God, and the second to charity, Moses properly and wisely draws up this summary, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(74)</sup></span> that the Jews may perceive what is the will of God in each of the commandments. And although we ought to love God far more than men, yet most properly does God, instead of worship or honor, require <i>love</i> from us, because in this way he declares that no other worship is pleasing to Him than what is voluntary; for no man will actually obey God but he who <i>loves</i> Him. But as the wicked and sinful inclinations of the flesh draw us aside from what is right, Moses shows that our life will not be regulated aright till the <i>love</i> of God fill all our senses. Let us therefore learn, that the commencement of godliness is the <i>love</i> of God, because God disdains the forced services of men, and chooses to be worshipped freely and willingly; and let us also learn, that under the <i>love</i> of God is included the reverence due to him. </p>
<p>Moses does not add the <i>mind,</i> but mentions only the <i>heart,</i> and the <i>soul,</i> and the <i>strength;</i> and though the present division into four clauses is more full, yet it does not alter the sense. For while Moses intends to teach generally that God ought to be perfectly <i>loved,</i> and that whatever powers belong to men ought to be devoted to this object, he reckoned it enough, after mentioning the <i>soul</i> and the <i>heart,</i> to add the <i>strength,</i> that he might not leave any part of us uninfluenced by the <i>love</i> of God; and we know also that under the word <i>heart</i> the Hebrews sometimes include the <i>mind,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(75)</sup></span> particularly when it is joined to the word <i>soul</i> What is the difference between the <i>mind</i> and the heart, both in this passage and in Matthew, I do not trouble myself to inquire, except that I consider the <i>mind</i> to denote the loftier abode of reason, from which all our thoughts and deliberations flow. </p>
<p>It now appears from this summary that, in the commandments of the Law, God does not look at what men can do, but at what they ought to do; since in this infirmity of the flesh it is impossible that perfect <i>love</i> can obtain dominion, for we know how strongly all the senses of our soul are disposed to vanity. Lastly, we learn from this, that God does not rest satisfied with the outward appearance of works, but chiefly demands the inward feelings, that from a good root good fruits may grow. </p>
