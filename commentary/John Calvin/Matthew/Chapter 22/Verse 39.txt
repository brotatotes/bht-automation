<p><b>39.</b><i>And the second is like it.</i> He assigns the <i>second</i> place to mutual kindness among men, for the worship of God is <i>first</i> in order. The <i>commandment</i> to love our neighbors, he tells us, is <i>like</i> the first, because it depends upon it. For, since every man is devoted to himself, there will never be true charity towards <i>neighbors,</i> unless where the love of God reigns; for it is a mercenary love <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(76)</sup></span> which the children of the world entertain for each other, because every one of them has regard to his own advantage. On the other hand, it is impossible for the love of God to reign without producing brotherly kindness among men. </p>
<p>Again, when Moses commanded us to love our neighbors as ourselves, he did not intend to put the <i>love</i> of <i>ourselves</i> in the first place, so that a man may first love <i>himself</i> and then love his <i>neighbors;</i> as the sophists of the <i>Sorbonne</i> are wont to cavil, that a rule must always go before what it regulates. But as we are too much devoted to ourselves, Moses, in correcting this fault, places our neighbors in an equal rank with us; thus forbidding every man to pay so much attention to himself as to disregard others, because kindness unites all in one body. And by correcting the <i>self-love</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">φιλαυτίαν</span></blu></grk>) which separates some persons from others, he brings each of them into a common union, and—as it were—into a mutual embrace. Hence we conclude, that charity is justly pronounced by Paul to be </p>
<p>the bond of perfection, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+3:14">Colossians 3:14</span>,) </p>
<p>and, in another passage, the </p>
<p>fulfilling of the law, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:10">Romans 13:10</span>;) </p>
<p>for all the commandments of the second table must be referred to it. </p>
