<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:40">Matthew 22:40</span></b><b>.</b><i>On these two commandments.</i> I now return to Matthew, where Christ says that <i>all the Law and the prophets depend on these two commandments;</i> not that he intends to limit to them <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(78)</sup></span> all the doctrine of Scripture, but because all that is anywhere taught as to the manner of living a holy and righteous life must be referred to these two leading points. For Christ does not treat generally of what <i>the Law and the Prophets</i> contain, but, in drawing up his reply, states that nothing else is required in <i>the Law and the prophets</i> than that every man should <i>love God</i> and his <i>neighbors;</i> as if he had said, that the sum of a holy and upright life consists in the worship of God and in charity to men, as Paul states that charity is </p>
<p>the fulfilling of the law, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:10">Romans 13:10</span>.) </p>
<p>And therefore some ill-informed persons are mistaken in interpreting this saying of Christ, as if we ought to seek nothing higher in <i>the Law and the Prophets.</i> For as a distinction ought to be made between the promises and the commandments, so in this passage Christ does not state generally what we ought to learn from the word of God, but explains, in a manner suited to the occasion, the end to which all the commandments are directed. Yet the free forgiveness of sins, by which we are reconciled to God, — confidence in calling on God, which is the earnest of the future inheritance, — and all the other parts of faith, though they hold the first rank in the Law, do not <i>depend on these two commandments;</i> for it is one thing to demand what we owe, and another thing to offer what we do not possess. The same thing is expressed in other words by Mark, that <i>there is no other commandment greater than these.</i> </p>
