<p><b>9.</b><i>Go therefore to the highways.</i> Having shown that they are unworthy of the grace of God who disdainfully reject it when offered to them, he now says that their place is supplied by others, by the mean and despised common people. And here is described the calling of the Gentiles, which is to excite the Jews to jealousy, as we have it in the Song of Moses; </p>
<p>They have provoked me by those who are not gods, and I will provoke them by that which is not a people, and by a foolish nation will I enrage them, <br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+32:21">Deuteronomy 32:21</span>.) </br></p>
<p>Having been first elected, they imagined that the grace of God was bound to them, as if God could not want them; and how haughtily they despised all others is well known. Thus by way of admission, he compares the Gentiles <i>to the poor, the blind,</i> and <i>the lame.</i> He says that they are called from the <i>cross-roads,</i> and from the <i>streets,</i> as strangers and unknown persons; but yet declares that they will occupy that place which friends and domestics had treated with indifference. What the prophets had obscurely foretold about creating a new church is now plainly expressed. This dishonor was the completion of the divine vengeance on the Jews, when God </p>
<p>cut them off, and ingrafted wild branches into <br/>the stock of the olive-tree, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:17">Romans 11:17</span>;) </p>
<p>when he threw them off, and received the polluted and filthy Gentiles into his house. But if at that time <i>he spared not the natural branches,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:21">Romans 11:21</span>,) the same punishment will this day be inflicted on us, if we do not answer to his call. The supper which had been prepared for us will not be lost, but God will invite other guests. </p>
