<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:16">Matthew 23:16</span></b><b>.</b><i>Woe to you, blind guides,</i> As ambition is almost always connected with hypocrisy, so the superstitions of the people are usually encouraged by the covetousness and rapacity of pastors. The world has, indeed, a natural propensity to errors, and even draws down upon itself, as if on purpose, every kind of deceit and imposture; but improper modes of worship come to gain a footing only when they are confirmed by the rulers <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(100)</sup></span> themselves. And it generally happens, that those who possess authority not only, by their connivance, fawn upon errors, because they perceive that they are a source of gain to them, but even assist in fanning the flame. Thus we see that the superstitions of Popery were heightened by innumerable expedients, while the priests opened their mouths for the prey; and even now they daily contrive many things by which they delude still more the foolish multitude. And when minds have once fallen under the darkening influence of the enchantments of Satan, nothing is so absurd or monstrous as not to be eagerly swallowed. </p>
<p>It was on this account that the Jews had more reverence for <i>the gold of the temple,</i> and for the sacred <i>offerings,</i> than for <i>the temple</i> and <i>the altar.</i> But the sacredness of the <i>offerings</i> depended on <i>the temple</i> and <i>the altar,</i> and was only something inferior and accessory. It may readily be believed that this dream proceeded from the scribes and priests, because it was a scheme well fitted for collecting prey. And this was not only a foolish but a highly dangerous error, because it led the people into ridiculous fancies. There is nothing to which men are more prone than to fall away from the pure worship of God: and therefore, under the covering of this veil, it was easy for Satan to withdraw from the contemplation of God those who were too strongly inclined to foolish imaginations. This is the reason why Christ so severely chastises that error. And yet the Papists were not ashamed to prostitute the sacred name of God to a mockery still more detestable; for they reckon it of more importance to touch a morsel of a stinking carcass, than to peruse the sacred volume of the Old and New Testaments, or even to raise their hands towards heaven. And in this way arises a carnal worship of God, by which the proper fear of God is gradually obliterated. </p>
<p><i>It is nothing.</i> By this phrase he does not mean that they entirely took away the honor of <i>the temple,</i> but he speaks comparatively. For when they represented in extravagant terms the sacredness of <i>offerings,</i> the common people were led to entertain such veneration for them, that the majesty of <i>the temple</i> and of <i>the altar</i> was undervalued, and they reckoned it a less heinous crime to violate it by perjuries than to <i>swear by the sacred offerings</i> with too little reverence. </p>
