<p><b>37.</b><i>Jerusalem, Jerusalem.</i> By these words, Christ shows more clearly what good reason he had for indignation, that <i>Jerusalem,</i> which God had chosen to be his sacred, and — as we might say — heavenly abode, not only had shown itself to be unworthy of so great an honor, but, as if it had been a den of robbers, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+7:11">Jeremiah 7:11</span>,) had been long accustomed to suck the blood of the prophets. Christ therefore utters a pathetic exclamation at a sight so monstrous, as that the holy city of God should have arrived at such a pitch of madness, that it had long endeavored to extinguish the saving doctrine of God by shedding <i>the blood of the prophets.</i> This is also implied in the repetition of the name, because impiety so monstrous and incredible deserves no ordinary detestation. </p>
<p><i>Thou who killest the prophets.</i> Christ does not reproach them with merely one or another murder, but says that this custom was so deeply rooted, that the city did not care to slay every one of <i>the prophets</i> that were sent to it. For the participle, (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀποκτείνουσα τοὺς προφήτας</span></blu></grk>), (<i>killing the prophets,)</i> is put for an epithet; as if Christ had said, “Thou who oughtest to have been a faithful guardian of the word of God, a teacher of heavenly wisdom, the light of the world, the fountain of sound doctrine, the seat of divine worship, a pattern of faith and obedience, art a murderer of <i>the prophets,</i> so that thou hast acquired a certain habit of sucking their blood.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(113)</sup></span> Hence it is evident, that they who had so basely profaned the sanctuary of God deserved every kind of reproaches. Yet Christ had likewise the intention to obviate the scandal which soon after arose, that believers, when they saw him basely put to death at Jerusalem, might not be confounded by the novelty of such an exhibition. For by these words they were already warned that it was not wonderful if a city, which had been accustomed to strangle or stone <i>the prophets,</i> should cruelly put to death its own Redeemer. This shows us what value we should attach to places. There never certainly was a city in the world on which God bestowed such magnificent titles, or such distinguished honor; and yet we see how deeply it was sunk by its ingratitude. </p>
<p>Let the Pope now compare the abode of his robbery with that holy city; what will he find worthy of equal honor? His hired flatterers boast to us that the faith flourished there in ancient times. But admitting this to be true, if it is evident that it has now, by wicked rebellion, revolted from Christ, and is full of innumerable deeds of sacrilege, what folly is it in them to maintain that the honor of primacy belongs to it? Let us, on the contrary, learn from this memorable example, that when any place has been exalted by uncommon instances of the favor of God, and thus has been removed from the ordinary rank, if it degenerate, it will not only be stripped of its ornaments, but will become so much the more hateful and detestable, because it has basely profaned the glow of God by staining the beauty of his favors. </p>
<p><i>How often would I have gathered together thy children.</i> This is expressive of indignation rather than of compassion. The city itself, indeed, over which he had lately wept, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:41">Luke 19:41</span>,) is still an object of his compassion; but towards the scribes, who were the authors of its destruction, he uses harshness and severity, as they deserved. And yet he does not spare the rest, who were all guilty of approving and partaking of the same crime, but, including all in the same condemnation, he inveighs chiefly against the leaders themselves, who were the cause of all the evils. We must now observe the vehemence of the discourse. If in <i>Jerusalem</i> the grace of God had been merely rejected, there would have been inexcusable ingratitude; but since God attempted to draw the Jews to himself by mild and gentle methods, and gained nothing by such kindness, the criminality of such haughty disdain was far more aggravated. There was likewise added unconquerable obstinacy; for not once and again did God <i>wish to gather them together,</i> but, by constant and uninterrupted advances, he sent to them <i>the prophets,</i> one after another, almost all of whom were rejected by the great body of the people. </p>
<p><i>As a hen collecteth her brood under her wings.</i> We now perceive the reason why Christ, speaking in the person of God, compares himself to <i>a hen.</i> It is to inflict deeper disgrace on this wicked nation, which had treated with disdain invitations so gentle, and proceeding from more than maternal kindness. It is an amazing and unparalleled instance of love, that he did not disdain to stoop to those blandishments, by which he might tame rebels into subjection. A reproof nearly similar is employed by Moses, that God, like </p>
<p>an eagle with outspread wings, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+32:11">Deuteronomy 32:11</span>,) </p>
<p>embraced that people. And though in more than one way God <i>spread out his wings</i> to cherish that people, yet this form of expression is applied by Christ, in a peculiar manner, to one class, namely, that <i>prophets</i> were sent to <i>gather together</i> the wandering and dispersed into the bosom of God. By this he means that, whenever the word of God is exhibited to us, he opens his bosom to us with maternal kindness, and, not satisfied with this, condescends to the humble affection of <i>a hen</i> watching over her <i>chickens.</i> Hence it follows, that our obstinacy is truly monstrous, if we do not permit him to <i>gather us together.</i> And, indeed, if we consider, on the one hand, the dreadful majesty of God, and, on the other, our mean and low condition, we cannot but be ashamed and astonished at such amazing goodness. For what object can God have in view in abasing himself so low on our account? When he compares himself to a mother, he descends very far below his glory; how much more when he takes the form of <i>a hen,</i> and deigns to treat us as his <i>chickens?</i> </p>
<p>Besides, if this charge was justly brought against the ancient people, who lived under the Law, it is far more applicable to us. For though the statement—which I quoted a little ago from Moses—was always true, and though the complaints which we find in Isaiah are just, that </p>
<p>in vain did God spread out his hands every day to embrace a hard-hearted and rebellious people, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:2">Isaiah 65:2</span>) </p>
<p>that, though he rose up early, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+7:13">Jeremiah 7:13</span>) he gained nothing by his incessant care of them; yet now, with far greater familiarity and kindness, he invites us to himself by his Son. And, therefore, whenever he exhibits to us the doctrine of the Gospel, dreadful vengeance awaits us, if we do not quietly hide ourselves under his wings, by which he is ready to receive and shelter us. Christ teaches us, at the same time, that all enjoy safety and rest who, by the obedience of faith, are <i>gathered together</i> to God; because <i>under his wings</i> they have an impregnable refuge. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(114)</sup></span> </p>
<p>We must attend likewise to the other part of this accusation, that God, notwithstanding the obstinate rebellion of his ancient people, was not all at once so much offended by it, as to lay aside a father’s love and a mother’s anxiety, since he did not cease to send <i>prophets</i> after <i>prophets</i> in uninterrupted succession; as in our own day, though he has experienced a marvelous depravity in the world, he still continues to dispense his grace. But these words contain still deeper instruction, namely, that the Jews, as soon as the Lord <i>gathered them together,</i> immediately left him. Hence came dispersions so frequent, that they scarcely remained at rest for a single moment <i>under the wings</i> of God, as we see in the present day a certain wildness in the world, which has indeed existed in all ages; and, therefore, it is necessary that God should recall to himself those who are wandering and going astray. But this is the crowning point of desperate and final depravity, when men obstinately reject the goodness of God, and refuse to come <i>under his wings.</i> </p>
<p>I said formerly that Christ speaks here in the person of God, and my meaning is, that this discourse belongs properly to his eternal Godhead; for he does not now speak of what he began to do since he was manifested in the flesh, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>,) but of the care which he exercised about the salvation of his people from the beginning. Now we know that the Church was governed by God in such a manner that Christ, as the Eternal Wisdom of God, presided over it. In this sense Paul says, not that God the Father was tempted in the wilderness, but that Christ himself was tempted, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(115)</sup></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:9">1 Corinthians 10:9</span>.) </p>
<p>Again, when the sophists seize on this passage, to prove free will, and to set aside the secret predestination of God, the answer is easy. “God <i>wills</i> to gather all men,” say they; “and therefore all are at liberty to come, and their <i>will</i> does not depend on the election of God.” I reply: The <i>will</i> of God, which is here mentioned, must be judged from the result. For since by his word he calls all men indiscriminately to salvation, and since the end of preaching is, that all should betake themselves to his guardianship and protection, it may justly be said that he <i>wills</i> to gather all to himself. It is not, therefore, the secret purpose of God, but his <i>will,</i> which is manifested by the nature of the word, that is here described; for, undoubtedly, whomsoever he efficaciously <i>wills</i> to <i>gather,</i> he inwardly draws by his Spirit, and does not merely invite by the outward voice of man. </p>
<p>If it be objected, that it is absurd to suppose the existence of two <i>wills</i> in God, I reply, we fully believe that his <i>will</i> is simple and one; but as our minds do not fathom the deep abyss of secret election, in accommodation to the capacity of our weakness, the <i>will</i> of God is exhibited to us in two ways. And I am astonished at the obstinacy of some people, who, when in many passages of Scripture they meet with that figure of speech <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(116)</sup></span> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀνθρωποπάθεια</span></blu></grk>) which attributes to God human feelings, take no offense, but in this case alone refuse to admit it. But as I have elsewhere treated this subject fully, that I may not be unnecessarily tedious, I only state briefly that, whenever the doctrine, which is the standard of union, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(117)</sup></span> is brought forward, God <i>wills</i> to <i>gather</i> all, that all who do not come may be inexcusable. </p>
<p><i>And you would not.</i> This may be supposed to refer to the whole nation, as well as to the <i>scribes;</i> but I rather interpret it in reference to the latter, by whom the <i>gathering together,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(118)</sup></span> was chiefly prevented. For it was against them that Christ inveighed throughout the whole of the passage; and now, after having addressed <i>Jerusalem</i> in the singular number, it appears not without reason that he immediately used the plural number. There is an emphatic contrast between God’s <i>willing</i> and their <i>not willing;</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(119)</sup></span> for it expresses the diabolical rage of men, who do not hesitate to contradict God. </p>
