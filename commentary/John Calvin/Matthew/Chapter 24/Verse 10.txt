<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:10">Matthew 24:10</span></b><b>.</b><i>Then will many be offended.</i> He now enumerates the temptations which will arise from bad examples. Now this is an exceedingly violent temptation, and difficult to overcome; for Christ is to many <i>a stone of offense,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:8">1 Peter 2:8</span>,) on which some dash themselves, or by meeting which some are thrown back, and others fall away. In this expression Christ appears to me to include many kinds of troubles; for not only do they that had entered into the right course fall away, but many are exasperated against Christ; others, forgetful of moderation and justice, break out into rage; others grow profane, and lose every feeling of piety; and others, amidst the confusion which prevails, take upon themselves a liberty to commit crimes. </p>
