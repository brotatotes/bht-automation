<p><b>25.</b><i>Lo, I have foretold it to you. Mark</i> expresses our Lordâ€™s meaning more fully. <i>But take heed: lo, I have foretold you all things.</i> By these words we are taught that they who are dismayed by the stumbling-blocks which Christ predicted are altogether inexcusable; for since the will of God ought to be our rule, it is sufficient that we have received timely warning that such is his pleasure. Again, as he declares that </p>
<p>he is faithful, and will not suffer us to be tempted beyond <br/>what we are able to bear, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:13">1 Corinthians 10:13</span>,) </p>
<p>we shall never be in want of strength to resist, provided that our weakness be not nourished by indifference. </p>
