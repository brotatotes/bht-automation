By these words we are taught that they who are dismayed by the stumbling-blocks which Christ predicted are altogether inexcusable; for since the will of God ought to be our rule, it is sufficient that we have received timely warning that such is his pleasure. Again, as he declares that he is faithful, and will not suffer us to be tempted beyond what we are able to bear, (1 Corinthians 10:13,) we shall never be in want of strength to resist, provided that our weakness be not nourished by indifference.
