<p><b>28</b><i>Wheresoever the carcass is.</i> The meaning is, that by whatever methods Satan endeavors to scatter the children of God in various directions, still in Christ himself is the sacred bond of union, by which they must be kept united. For whence comes the dispersion, but that many depart from Christ, in whom alone our strength lies? Here then is a method laid down for promoting a holy union, that the separations produced by errors may not tear in pieces the body of the Church; and that method is, when we remain united to Christ. This ought to be carefully observed; for Christ does not restrict us either to the primacy of the Roman See, or to any other foolery, but employs this method alone for binding his Church together, that all in every quarter should look to him as the only head. Hence it follows, that those who are united to him by pure faith are beyond the risk of schism. Let the adherents of Rome now go, and exclaim that all are schismatics who do not allow themselves to be separated from Christ, that they may transfer their allegiance to a robber. </p>
<p><i>There also will the eagles be gathered together.</i> When the Papists interpret the word <i>carcass</i> to denote the company of those who profess the same faith, and allegorically explain <i>the eagles</i> to represent acute and sagacious men, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(149)</sup></span> it is excessively absurd, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(150)</sup></span> for Christ had manifestly no other design than to call to himself, and to retain in union to him, the children of God, wherever they were scattered. Nor does Christ simply employ the word <i>body,</i> but (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πτῶμα</span></blu></grk>) <i>carcass;</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(151)</sup></span> and he ascribes nothing to <i>eagles</i> but what we might apply to <i>crows</i> or <i>vultures,</i> according to the nature of the country which we inhabit. I attach as little value to the ingenuity of other commentators, who say that the death of Christ had a sweet savor, to draw the elect to God; for, in my opinion, Christ intended to argue from the less to the greater, that if birds have so great sagacity as to flock in great numbers from distant places to a single <i>carcass,</i> it would be disgraceful in believers not to assemble to the Author of life, from whom alone they derive their actual nourishment. </p>
