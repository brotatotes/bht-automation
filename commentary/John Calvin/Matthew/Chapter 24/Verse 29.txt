<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span></b><b>.</b><i>And immediately after the tribulation of those days.</i> Christ comes now to speak of the full manifestation of his kingdom, about which he was at first interrogated by the disciples, and promises that, after they have been tried by so many distressing events, the redemption will arrive in due time. The principal object of his reply was, to confirm his disciples in good hope, that they might not be dismayed on account of the troubles and confusion that would arise. For this reason, he does not speak of <i>his coming</i> in simple terms, but employs those modes of expression which were common among the prophets, by which, the more attentively they were considered, so much the more severe would be the contest of temptation experienced by the reader, in consequence of the opposite character of the event. For what could be more strange than to see the kingdom of Christ not only despised, but oppressed by the cross, loaded with many reproaches, and overwhelmed by every kind of <i>tribulation, that</i> kingdom which the prophets had frequently described in such magnificent language? Might it not be asked, where was that majesty which would darken <i>the sun, and moon, and stars,</i> shake the whole frame of the world, and change the ordinary course of nature? Our Lord now meets these temptations, declaring that, though these predictions are not immediately fulfilled, they will at length be fully justified by the event. The meaning therefore is, that the predictions which had been formerly made about the miraculous <i>shaking of heaven and earth,</i> ought not to be restricted to the commencement of redemption, because the prophets had embraced the whole course of it, till it should arrive at perfection. </p>
<p>Having now ascertained Christ’s intention, we shall have no difficulty in perceiving the meaning of the words to be, that <i>heaven</i> will not be <i>darkened</i> immediately, but after that the Church shall have passed through the whole course of its <i>tribulations.</i> Not that the glory and majesty of the kingdom of Christ will not appear till his last coming, but because till that time is delayed the accomplishment of those things which began to take place after his resurrection, and of which God gave to his people nothing more than a taste, that he might lead them farther on in the path of hope and patience. According to this argument, Christ keeps the minds of believers in a state of suspense till the last day, that they may not imagine those declarations which the prophets made, about the future restoration, to have failed of their accomplishment, because they lie buried for a long period under the thick <i>darkness</i> of <i>tribulations.</i> </p>
<p><i>The tribulation of those days</i> is improperly interpreted by some commentators to mean the destruction of Jerusalem; for, on the contrary, it is a general recapitulation (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀνακεφαλαίωσις</span></blu></grk>) of all the evils of which Christ had previously spoken. To encourage his followers to patience, he employs this argument, that the <i>tribulations</i> will at length have a happy and joyful result. As if he had said, “So long as the Church shall continue its pilgrimage in the world, there will be dark and cloudy weather; but as soon as an end shall have been put to those distresses, a day will arrive when the majesty of the Church shall be illustriously displayed.” In what manner <i>the sun will be darkened</i> we cannot now conjecture, but the event will show. He does not indeed mean that <i>the stars</i> will actually fall, but according to the apprehension of men; and accordingly Luke only predicts that <i>there will be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars.</i> The meaning therefore is, that there will be such a violent commotion of the firmament of heaven, that <i>the stars</i> themselves will be supposed <i>to fall.</i> Luke also adds that there will be a dreadful commotion of the sea, <i>the sea and the waves roaring, so that men will faint through fear</i> and alarm. In a word, all the creatures above and below will be, as it were, heralds to summon men to that tribunal, which they will continue to treat with ungodly and wanton contempt till the last day. </p>
