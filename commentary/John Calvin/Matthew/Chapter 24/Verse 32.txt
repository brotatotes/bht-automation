<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:32">Matthew 24:32</span></b><b>.</b><i>Now learn a similitude from the fig-tree.</i> I do not suppose the meaning of this to be merely that, during the state of confusion which has been mentioned, there will be as evident a sign that the coming of Christ is <i>nigh</i>, as that by which we know with certainty that the summer is at hand, when the trees begin to grow green; but, in my opinion, Christ expresses something else. For as in winter the trees, contracted by the severity of the cold, show greater vigor, but in spring lose their toughness, and appear more feeble, and are even cleft asunder to open up passage for fresh twigs, so the afflictions by which, according to the perception of the flesh, the Church is softened, do not in any way impair its vigor. As the inward sap diffused through the whole tree, after having produced this softness, collects strength to throw itself out for renovating what was dead, so the Lord draws from the corruption of the outward man the perfect restoration of his people. The general instruction conveyed is, that the weak and frail condition of the Church ought not to lead us to conclude that it is dying, but rather to expect the immortal glory for which the Lord prepares his people by the cross and by afflictions; for what Paul maintains in reference to each of the members must be fulfilled in the whole body, that </p>

<p>What Matthew and Mark had stated more obscurely, <i>know you that it is nigh at the door,</i> is more fully explained by Luke, <i>know you that the kingdom of God is at hand;</i> and in this passage <i>the kingdom of God</i> is not represented—as in many other passages—at its commencement, but at its perfection, and that according to the views of those whom Christ was teaching. For they did not view <i>the kingdom of God</i> in the Gospel as consisting in the <i>peace</i> and <i>joy</i> of faith and in spiritual <i>righteousness,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>,) but sought that blessed rest and glory which is concealed under hope till the last day. </p>
