<p><b>40.</b><i>Two men shall then be in the field.</i> Before mentioning this, Luke inserts some sentences; the first of which is presented by Matthew as belonging to the destruction of Jerusalem, <i>Let not him who shall be on the house-top go down into his house to carry away his furniture.</i> But it is possible that Christ applied the same words to various subjects. Luke states also a warning, that the disciples should <i>remember Lot’s wife;</i> that is, that they should <i>forget those things which are behind,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+3:13">Philippians 3:13</span>) and advance towards the end of the heavenly calling. For <i>Lot’s wife</i> was changed into <i>a pillar of salt,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:26">Genesis 19:26</span>,) because, hesitating whether there were good reasons for departing from the city, she <i>looked behind her,</i> by which she gave the lie to the heavenly oracle. Perhaps, too, regret at leaving her nest, in which she had dwelt with comfort, induced her to turn her head. Since, therefore, God intended that she should remain as an everlasting demonstration, our minds ought to be strengthened by the constancy of faith, that they may not hesitate and give way in the middle of the course; and they ought also to be trained to perseverance, in order that, bidding adieu to the fascinations of a transitory life, they may rise cheerfully and willingly towards heaven. </p>
<p>Luke adds a third sentence, <i>whosoever shall seek to save his soul will lose it,</i> that the desire of an earthly life may not prevent believers from passing rapidly through the midst of death, to the salvation laid up for them in heaven. And Christ employs a strong expression to denote the frailty of the present life, when he says that souls (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Ζωογονοῦνται</span></blu></grk>)<i>,</i> — that is, <i>are begotten into life</i> —<i>when</i> they are <i>lost.</i> His meaning is the same as if he had declared that inch do not <i>live</i> in the world, because the commencement of that life which is real, and which is worthy of the name, is, to leave the world. Luke afterwards adds what we find also in Matthew, that husbands and wives will then be separated, that the tics by which human beings are bound to each other in the world may not hinder or retard the godly; for it frequently happens that, while men are paying attention to each other, not one of them advances a step. In order, therefor that every man in his own department, freed from every bond and impediment, may run with cheerfulness, Christ informs us that, out of a single couple, <i>one</i> partner <i>will be taken,</i> while <i>the other is left.</i> Not that all who are united must of necessity be thus separated; for the sacred bond of piety will cause a believing wife to cleave to a believing husband, and will cause children to accompany their father. But Christ only intended, in order to cut off every occasion of delay, to enjoin every one to make haste, that those who already prepared may not waste their time in waiting for their companions. Immediately afterwards Luke adds, <i>where the carcass is, there will the eagles also be gathered together;</i> which must not, however, be restricted to the last day, but as the disciples had asked, <i>Where, Lord?</i> that is, “How shall we stand erect amidst so great shaking? and how shall we remain safe amidst such dangerous storms? and to what places of concealment shall we resort for protection, when we are united?” Christ declares, as we find in Matthew—that he is the banner of solid union, and in which all the children of God must be gathered. </p>
