<p><b>8.</b><i>But all these things are the beginnings of sorrows.</i> Not that believers, who always have abundant consolations in calamities, should consume themselves with grief, but that they should lay their account with a long exercise of patience. Luke adds likewise <i>earthquakes, and signs from heaven,</i> with respect to which, though we have no authentic history of them, yet it is enough that they were predicted by Christ. The reader will find the rest in Josephus, (Wars of the Jews, VI. 5:3.) </p>
