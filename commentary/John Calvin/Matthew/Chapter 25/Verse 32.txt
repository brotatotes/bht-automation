<p><b>32.</b><i>And all nations shall be assembled before him.</i> He employs large and splendid titles for extolling his kingdom, that the disciples may learn to expect a different kind of happiness from what they had imagined. For they were satisfied with this single consideration, that their nation was delivered from the miseries with which it was then oppressed, so that it would be manifest that God had not in vain established his covenant with Abraham and his posterity. But Christ extends much farther the benefit of the redemption brought by him, for he will be the Judge of the whole world. Again, in <i>order</i> to persuade believers to holiness of life, he assures them that the good and the bad will not share alike; because he will bring with him the reward which is laid up for both. In short, he declares that his kingdom will be fully established, when the righteous shall have obtained a crown of glory, and when the wicked shall have received the reward which they deserved. </p>
<p><i>As a shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats.</i> When our Lord says that the <i>separation of the sheep from the goats</i> is delayed till that day, he means that the wicked are now mixed with the good and holy, so that they live together in the same flock of God. The comparison appears to be borrowed from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:18">Ezekiel 34:18</span>, where the Lord complains of the fierceness of <i>the goats,</i> which attack with their horns the poor <i>sheep,</i> and destroy the pastures, and pollute the water; and where the Lord expressly declares that he will take vengeance. And therefore Christâ€™s discourse amounts to this, that believers ought not to think their condition too hard, if they are now compelled to live with <i>the goats,</i> and even to sustain many serious attacks and annoyances from them; secondly, that they ought to beware of being themselves infected by the contagion of their vices; and, thirdly, to inform them that in a holy and innocent life their labor is not thrown away, for the difference will one day appear. </p>
