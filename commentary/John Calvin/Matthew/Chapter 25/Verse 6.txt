<p><b>6.</b><i>At midnight a cry arose.</i> With respect to the <i>cry</i> I view it as taken metaphorically for his sudden arrival; for we know, that when any thing new and unexpected happens, men are wont to make a loud noise. True, indeed, our Lord <i>cries</i> daily, that <i>he will come quickly,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="re+22:20">Revelation 22:20</span>;) but at that, time, the whole frame of the world will resound with the <i>cry,</i> and his dreadful majesty will fill heaven and earth in such a manner, as not only to awaken those who are <i>asleep,</i> but to bring the dead <i>out of their graves,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:28">John 5:28</span>.) </p>
