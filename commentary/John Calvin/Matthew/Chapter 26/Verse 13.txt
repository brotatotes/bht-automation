<p><b>13.</b><i>Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached.</i> He says that this action will do honor to <i>Mary,</i> because it will be praised by the doctrine of the gospel. Hence we infer, that we ought to estimate our works not by the opinion of men, but by the testimony of the word of God. When he says that she will be held in honorable <i>remembrance throughout the whole world,</i> by this comparison he indirectly censures his disciples; for among strangers, and in distant parts of the world, all nations, with one consent, will applaud this action, which the members of his own household condemned with such bitterness. Christ gently reproves the disciples also, for not entertaining sufficiently honorable views of his future reign; but at the same time, by this expression he bears testimony to the calling of the Gentiles, on which our salvation is founded. In what sense <i>the gospel must be preached throughout the whole world,</i> we have explained under <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:14">Matthew 24:14</span> </p>
