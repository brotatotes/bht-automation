<p><b>20.</b><i>When the evening was come, he sat down at table.</i> Not to eat <i>the passover,</i> which they were bound to do standing, as travelers, when they are in haste, are wont to take food hastily, </p>
<p>with shoes on their feet, and a staff in their hand,<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:11">Exodus 12:11</span>;) </p>
<p>but I consider the meaning to be, that after having observed the solemn rite, he <i>sat down at table</i> to supper. Accordingly, the Evangelists say, <i>when the evening was come:</i> for, at the commencement of the evening, they killed the lamb, and ate the flesh of it roasted. </p>
