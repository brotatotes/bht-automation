<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:21">Matthew 26:21</span></b><b>.</b><i>One of you will betray me.</i> To render the treachery of Judas more detestable, he points out the aggravated baseness of it by this circumstance, that he was meditating the act of <i>betraying</i> him while he <i>sat with him at the</i> holy <i>table.</i> For if a stranger had done this, it would have been more easily endured; but that one of his intimate friends should form such a design, and — what is more — that, after having entered into an infamous bargain, he should be present at the sacred banquet, was incredibly monstrous. And therefore Luke employs a connecting particle which marks a contrast: <i>but yet</i>, (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πλὴν</span></blu></grk>) <i>lo, the hand of him that betrayeth me.</i> And though Luke adds this saying of Christ after the supper was finished, we cannot obtain from it any certainty as to the order of time, which, we know, was often disregarded by the Evangelists. Yet I do not deny that it is probable that Judas was present, when Christ distributed to his disciples the symbols of his flesh and blood. </p>
