<p><b>23.</b><i>But he answering said.</i> Christ, by his reply, neither removes their doubt, nor points out the person of Judas, but only confirms what he said a little before, that <i>one of his friends sitting at the table</i> is the traitor. And though they thought it hard to be left in suspense and perplexity for a time, that they might employ themselves in contemplating the atrocity of the crime, it was afterwards followed by another advantage, when they perceived that the prediction of the psalm was fulfilled, </p>
<p>He that ate pleasant food with me <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(184)</sup></span> <br/>hath lifted up his heel against me, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+41:10">Psalms 41:10</span>.) </p>
<p>Besides, in the person of Judas, our Lord intended to admonish his followers in all ages, not to be discouraged or faint on account of intimate friends proving to be traitors; because the same thing that was experienced by Him who is the Head of the whole Church, must happen to us who are members of it. </p>
