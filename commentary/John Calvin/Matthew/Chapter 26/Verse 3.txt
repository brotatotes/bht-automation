<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:3">Matthew 26:3</span></b><b>.</b><i>Then were assembled the chief priests. Matthew</i> does not mean that they assembled during the <i>two days,</i> but introduces this narrative to show, that Christ was not led by any opinion of man to fix the day of his death; for by what conjectures could he have been led to it, since his enemies themselves had resolved to delay for a time? The meaning therefore is, that by the spirit of prophecy he spoke of his own death, which no man could have suspected to be so near at hand. John explains the reason why the scribes and priests held this meeting: it was because, from day to day, the people flocked to Christ in greater multitudes, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:48">John 11:48</span>.) And at that time it was decided, at the instigation of <i>Caiaphas,</i> that he should be put to death, because they could not succeed against him in any other way. </p>
