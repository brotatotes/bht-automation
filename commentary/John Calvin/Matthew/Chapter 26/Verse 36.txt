<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:36">Matthew 26:36</span></b><b>.</b><i>Then Jesus cometh with them.</i> Luke mentions <i>the mountain of Olives</i> only. Mark and Matthew add a more minute description of the place. But Luke expresses what is still more to the purpose, that Christ came there <i>according to his custom.</i> Hence we infer, that he did not seek retirement for the purpose of concealing himself, but, as if he had made an assignation with his enemies, he presented himself to death. On this account John says (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:2">John 18:2</span>) that <i>the place was known</i> to the traitor, <i>because Jesus was wont to come there frequently.</i> In this passage, therefore, his obedience is again described to us, because he could not have appeased the Father but by a voluntary death. </p>
<p><i>Sit here.</i> By leaving the disciples at a distance, he spares their weakness; as if a man, perceiving that he would soon be in extreme danger in battle, were to leave his wife and children in a situation of safety. But though he intended to place them all beyond arrow-shot, yet he took three of them who accompanied him more closely than the rest, and these were the flower and choice, in which there was greater rigor. And yet he did not take them, as if he believed that they would be able to sustain the attack, but that they might afford a proof of the defect which was common to them all. </p>
