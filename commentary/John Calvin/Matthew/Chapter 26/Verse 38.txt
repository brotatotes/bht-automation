<p><b>38.</b><i>My soul is sorrowful.</i> He communicates to them his <i>sorrow,</i> in order to arouse them to sympathy; not that he was unacquainted with their weakness, but in order that they might afterwards be more ashamed of their carelessness. This phrase expresses a deadly wound of grief; as if he had said, that he fainted, or was half-dead, with <i>sorrow.</i> Jonah (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jon+4:9">Jonah 4:9</span>) makes use of a similar phrase in replying to the Lord; <i>I am angry even to death.</i> I advert to this, because some of the ancient writers, in handling this passage with a misapplication of ingenuity, philosophize in this way, that <i>the soul</i> of Christ was not <i>sorrowful in death</i> but only <i>even to death.</i> And here again we ought to remember the cause of so great <i>sorrow;</i> for <i>death</i> in itself would not have so grievously tormented the mind of the Son of God, if he had not felt that he had to deal with the judgment of God. </p>
