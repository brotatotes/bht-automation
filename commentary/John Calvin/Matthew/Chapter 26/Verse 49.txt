<p><b>49.</b><i>Hail, Rabbi.</i> I have no doubt that Judas, as if trembling for his Master’s danger, pretended by these words to have some feeling of compassion; and, accordingly, in Mark a pathetic repetition is expressed, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(213)</sup></span> <i>Rabbi, Rabbi.</i> For though he was impressed with the majesty of Christ, still the devil so fascinated his mind, that he felt assured that his treachery was concealed by <i>a kiss,</i> and by soothing words. This salutation, or exclamation, therefore, was a pretense of compassion. I offer the same opinion about the <i>kiss;</i> for though it was a very common practice among the Jews to welcome friends with <i>a kiss,</i> yet as Judas had left Christ but a little before, he seems now — as if he had become suddenly alarmed at his danger — to give the last <i>kiss</i> to his Master. Thus he excels the rest in the appearance of affection, when he appears to be deeply grieved at being separated from his Master; but how little he gained by his deception is evident from Christ’s reply. </p>
