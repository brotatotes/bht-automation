<p><b>6.</b><i>And when Jesus was in Bethany.</i> What the Evangelist now relates had happened a little before Christ came to Jerusalem, but is here introduced seasonably, in order to inform us what was the occasion that suddenly drove the priests to make haste. They did not venture to attack Christ by open violence, and to oppress him by stratagem was no easy matter; but now that Judas suggests to them a plan of which they had not thought, the very facility of execution leads them to adopt a different opinion. As to some slight diversity between John’s narrative and that of Matthew and Mark, it is easy to remove the apparent inconsistency, which has led some commentators erroneously to imagine that it is a different narrative. <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:3">John 12:3</span> expresses the name of the woman who anointed Christ, which is omitted by the other two Evangelists; but he does not mention the person who received Christ as a guest, while <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:6">Matthew 26:6</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:3">Mark 14:3</span> expressly state that he was then at supper <i>in the house of Simon the leper.</i> As to its being said by John that his <i>feet</i> were <i>anointed,</i> while the other two Evangelists say that she <i>anointed his head,</i> this involves no contradiction. Unquestionably we know that <i>anointments</i> were not poured on the <i>feet;</i> but as it was then poured in greater abundance than usual, John, by way of amplification, informs us that Christ’s very <i>feet</i> were moistened with the oil. Mark too relates, that <i>she broke the alabaster-box, and poured</i> the whole of the ointment on <i>his head;</i> and it agrees very well with this to say that it flowed down to his <i>feet.</i> Let us therefore hold it to be a settled point, that all the three Evangelists relate the same narrative. </p>
