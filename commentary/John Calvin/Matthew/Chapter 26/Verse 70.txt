<p><b>70.</b><i>But he denied before them all.</i> This circumstance aggravates the criminality of Peter, that, in denying his Master, he did not even dread a multitude of witnesses. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(236)</sup></span> And the Spirit intended expressly to state this, that even the presence of men may excite us to hold fast the confession of faith. For if we deny Christ before the weak, they are shaken by our example, and give way; and thus we destroy as many souls as we can; but if, in presence of those who wickedly despise God and oppose the Gospel, we withhold from Christ the testimony which is due to him, we expose his sacred name to the ridicule of all. In short, as a bold and open confession edifies all the godly, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(237)</sup></span> and puts unbelievers to shame, so apostasy draws along with it the public ruin of faith in the Church, and the reproach of sound doctrine. The more eminent a man is, therefore, he ought to be the more careful to be on his guard; for his elevation makes it impossible for him to fall from it without doing greater harm. </p>
<p><i>I know not what thou sayest.</i> The form of denial, which is here set down, shows sufficiently that the wretched sophists, who endeavor to escape by ambiguous expressions, which they turn to a. variety of meanings, when they are called to give an account of their faith, gain nothing by their dexterity in fraud. <i>Peter</i> does not absolutely <i>deny</i> the whole doctrine of the Gospel; he only <i>denies</i> that he <i>knew the man;</i> but, because in the person of Christ he indirectly buries the light of the promised redemption, he is charged with base and shameful treachery. But lately he had heard from the mouth of the Lord, that the confession of faith is a sacrifice acceptable to God; and therefore a mode of <i>denying,</i> which withholds from God his lawful worship, and from Christ the honor that is due to him, admits of no excuse. Let us therefore hold:, that as soon as we depart from a plain and candid profession of Christ, we deprive him of the testimony to which he has a lawful claim. </p>
