<p><b>71.</b><i>Another maid saw him.</i> From the words of Mark we are rather led to conjecture that it was the same <i>maid;</i> at least he doesn’t state that it was a different maid from the former one. But there is no contradiction here; for it is probable that the statement which proceeded from one maid, flew from the lips of one to those of another, so that the first maid pointed him out to many persons and at several times, and others joined her in asserting that he was the person, and in spreading the discovery of him more widely. John even relates (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:25">John 18:25</span>) that, at the second time, the question was put to Peter, not by <i>a maid,</i> but by a multitude of men; from which it is evident that the word, which had been pronounced by the <i>maid,</i> was caught by the men standing by, who attacked Peter. </p>
<p>There is another difference between Mark and the other three Evangelists; for he mentions that <i>the cock crew twice,</i> while they say that <i>the cock crew</i> not until after Peter had thrice denied our Lord. But this difficulty is easily obviated; for Mark says nothing that is inconsistent with the narrative of the other Evangelists, but explains more fully what they pass by in silence. Indeed, I have no doubt that, when Christ said to Peter, <i>before the cock crow,</i> he meant the <i>cock-crowing,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(238)</sup></span> which includes many <i>crowings;</i> for <i>cocks</i> do not merely <i>crow</i> once, but repeat their <i>crowings</i> many times; and yet all the <i>crowings</i> of a single watch are called but one <i>cock-crowing.</i> So then, Matthew, Luke, and John, say that Peter thrice denied our Lord before the <i>cock-crowing</i> was ended. Mark states more distinctly one circumstance, that within a short space of time Peter was brought even to the <i>third</i> denial, and that, though he had been warned by the first <i>crowing,</i> he did not repent. None of us will say that profane historians are inconsistent with each other, when some one of them relates what the others have not touched; and, therefore, though Mark’s narrative is different, still it does not contradict the others. </p>
