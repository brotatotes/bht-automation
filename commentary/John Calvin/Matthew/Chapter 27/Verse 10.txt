<p><b>10.</b><i>As the Lord appointed me.</i> By this clause Matthew confirms the statement, that this was not done without the providence of God; because, while they have a different object in view, they unconsciously fulfill an ancient prediction. For how could it have occurred to them to <i>purchase a field</i> from <i>a potter,</i> if the Lord had not turned their blameworthy conduct so as to carry into execution his own purpose? </p>
