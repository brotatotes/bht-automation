<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:11">Matthew 27:11</span></b><b>.</b><i>Now Jesus stood before the governor.</i> Though it was a shocking exhibition, and highly incompatible with the majesty of the Son of God, to be dragged before the judgment-seat of a profane man, to be tried on the charge of a capital offense, as a malefactor in chains; yet we ought to remember that; our salvation consists in the doctrine of the cross, which is </p>
<p>folly to the Greeks, and an offense to the Jews, <br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:23">1 Corinthians 1:23</span>.) </br></p>
<p>For the Son of God chose to stand bound before an earthly judge, and there to receive sentence of death, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(253)</sup></span> in order that we, delivered from condemnation, may not fear to approach freely to the heavenly throne of God. If, therefore, we consider what advantage we reap from Christ having been tried before Pilate, the disgrace of so unworthy a subjection will be immediately washed away. And certainly none are offended at the condemnation of Christ, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(254)</sup></span> but those who are either proud hypocrites, or stupid and gross despisers of God, who are not ashamed of their own iniquity. </p>
<p>So then, the Son of God <i>stood,</i> as a criminal, before a mortal man, and there permitted himself to be accused and condemned, that we may <i>stand</i> boldly before God. His enemies, indeed, endeavored to fasten upon him everlasting infamy; but we ought rather to look at the end to which the providence of God directs us. For if we recollect how dreadful is the judgment-seat of God, and that we could never have been acquitted there, unless Christ had been pronounced to be guilty on earth, we shall never be ashamed of glorying in his chains. Again, whenever we hear that Christ <i>stood before</i> Pilate with a sad and dejected countenance, let us draw from it grounds of confidence, that, relying on him as our intercessor, we may come into the presence of God with joy and alacrity. To the same purpose is what immediately follows: <i>he did not answer him a single word.</i> Christ was silent, while the priests were pressing upon him on every hand; and it was, in order that he might open our mouth by his silence. For hence arises that distinguished privilege of which Paul speaks in such magnificent terms, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>,) <i>that we can boldly cry, Abba, Father;</i> to which I shall immediately refer again. </p>
<p><i>Art thou the King of the Jews?</i> Although they attempted to overwhelm Christ by many and various accusations, still it is probable that they maliciously seized on the title of <i>King,</i> in order to excite greater odium against him on the part of Pilate. For this reason Luke expressly represents them as <i>saying, we have found him subverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to caesar, saying that he is the Christ, A King</i> Nothing could have been more odious than this crime to Pilate, whose greatest anxiety was to preserve the kingdom in a state of quietness. From the Evangelist John we learn that he was accused on various grounds; but it is evident from the whole of the narrative that this was the chief ground of accusation. In like manner, even at the present day, Satan labors to expose the Gospel to hatred or suspicion on this plea, as if Christ, by erecting his kingdom, were overturning all the governments of the world, and destroying the authority of kings and magistrates. Kings too are, for the most part, so fiercely haughty, that they reckon it impossible for Christ to reign without some diminution of their own power; and, therefore, they always listen favorably to such an accusation as that which was once brought unjustly against Christ. </p>
<p>On this account Pilate, laying aside all the other points, attends chiefly to the sedition; because, if he had ascertained that Christ had in any way disturbed the public peace, he would gladly have condemned him without delay. This is the reason why he <i>asks him about the kingdom.</i> According to the three Evangelists, the answer of Christ is ambiguous; but we learn from John (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:36">John 18:36</span>) that Christ made an open acknowledgment of the fact which was alleged against him; but, at the same time, that he vindicated himself from all criminality by denying that he was an earthly king. But as he did not intend to take pains to vindicate himself, as is usually the case with criminals, the Evangelists put down a doubtful reply; as if they had said, that he did not deny <i>that he was a king,</i> but that he indirectly pointed out the calumny which his enemies unjustly brought against him. </p>
