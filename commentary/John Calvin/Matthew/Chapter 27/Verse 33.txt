<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:33">Matthew 27:33</span></b><b>.</b><i>And they came to the place.</i> Jesus was <i>brought to the place</i> where it was customary to execute criminals, that his death might be more ignominious. Now though this was done according to custom, still we ought to consider the loftier purpose of God; for he determined that his Son should be cast out of the city as unworthy of human intercourse, that he might admit us into his heavenly kingdom with the angels. For this reason the apostle, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:12">Hebrews 13:12</span>,) refers it to an ancient figure of the law. For as God commanded his people to <i>burn without the camp</i> the bodies of those animals, the blood of which was carried into the sanctuary to make atonement for sins, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:14">Exodus 29:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+16:27">Leviticus 16:27</span>;) so he says that Christ went out of the gate of the city, that, by taking upon him the curse which pressed us down, he might be regarded as accursed, and might in this manner atone for our sins. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(272)</sup></span> Now the greater the ignominy and disgrace which he endured before the world, so much the more acceptable and noble a spectacle did he exhibit in his death to God and to the angels. For the infamy of the place did not hinder him from erecting there a splendid trophy of his victory; nor did the offensive smell of the carcasses which lay there hinder the sweet savor of his sacrifice from diffusing itself throughout the whole world, and penetrating even to heaven. </p>
