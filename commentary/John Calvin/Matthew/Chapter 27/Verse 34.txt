<p><b>34.</b><i>And they gave him vinegar.</i> Although the Evangelists are not so exact in placing each matter in its due order, as to enable us to fix the precise moment at which the events occurred; yet I look upon it as a probable conjecture that, before our Lord was elevated on the cross, there was offered to him in a cup, according to custom, <i>wine mingled with myrrh,</i> or some other mixture, which appears to have been compounded of <i>gall and vinegar.</i> It is sufficiently agreed, indeed, among nearly all interpreters, that this draught was different from that which is mentioned by John, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:29">John 14:29</span>,) and of which we shall speak very soon. I only add, that I consider the cup to have been offered to our Lord when he was about to be crucified; but that after the cross was lifted up, <i>a sponge</i> was then dipped and given to him. At what time he began to ask something to drink, I am not very anxious to inquire; but when we compare all the circumstances, it is not unreasonable to suppose that, after he had refused that bitter mixture, it was frequently in derision presented to his lips. For we shall find Matthew afterwards adding that the soldiers, while they were giving him to drink, upbraided him for not being able to rescue himself from death. Hence we infer that, while the remedy was offered, they ridiculed the weakness of Christ, because he had complained that he was forsaken by God, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:49">Matthew 27:49</span>.) </p>
<p>As to the Evangelist Johnâ€™s narrative, it is only necessary to understand that Christ requested that some ordinary beverage might be given him to assuage his thirst, but that <i>vinegar, mingled with myrrh and gall,</i> was attempted to be forced upon him for hastening his death. But he patiently bore his torments, so that the lingering pain did not lead him to desire that his death should be hastened; for even this was a part of his sacrifice and obedience, to endure to the very last the lingering exhaustion. </p>
<p>They are mistaken, in my opinion, who look upon the <i>vinegar</i> as one of the torments which were cruelly inflicted on the Son of God. There is greater probability in the conjecture of those who think that this kind of beverage had a tendency to promote the evacuation of blood, and that on this account it was usually given to malefactors, for the purpose of accelerating their death. Accordingly, Mark calls it <i>wine mingled with myrrh.</i> Now Christ, as I have just now hinted, was not led to refuse the <i>wine</i> or <i>vinegar</i> so much by a dislike of its bitterness, as by a desire to show that he advanced calmly to death, according to the command of the Father, and that he did not rush on heedlessly through want of patience for enduring pain. Nor is this inconsistent with what John says, that the Scripture was fulfilled, <i>In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</i> For the two accounts perfectly agree with each other; that a remedy was given to him in order to put an end to the torments of a lingering death, and yet that Christ was in every respect treated with harshness, so that the very alleviation was a part, or rather was an augmentation, of his pain. </p>
