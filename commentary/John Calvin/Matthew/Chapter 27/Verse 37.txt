<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:37">Matthew 27:37</span></b><b>.</b><i>And placed over his head.</i> What is briefly noticed by Matthew and Mark is more fully related by Luke, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:38">Luke 23:38</span>,) that the inscription was written in three languages. John also describes it <i>more</i> largely, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:19">John 14:19</span>.) Under this passage my readers will find what I pass over here for the sake of brevity. I shall only say, that it did not happen without the providence of God, that the death of Christ was made known in three languages. Though Pilate had no other design than to bring reproach and infamy on the Jewish nation, yet God had a higher end in view; for by this presage he caused it to be widely known that the death of his Son would be highly celebrated, so that all nations would everywhere acknowledge that he was <i>the King</i> promised to <i>the Jews.</i> This was not, indeed, the lawful preaching of the Gospel, for Pilate was unworthy to be employed by God as a witness for his Son; but what was afterwards to be accomplished by the true ministers was prefigured in Pilate. In short, we may look upon him to be a herald of Christ in the same sense that Caiaphas was a prophet, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:51">John 11:51</span>.) </p>
