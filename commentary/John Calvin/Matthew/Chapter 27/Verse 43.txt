<p><b>43.</b><i>He trusted in God.</i> This, as I said a little ago, is a very sharp arrow of temptation which Satan holds in his hand, when he pretends that God has forgotten us, because He does not relieve us speedily and at the very moment. For since God watches over the safety of his people, and not only grants them seasonable aid, but even anticipates their necessities, (as Scripture everywhere teaches us,) he appears not to love those whom he does not assist. Satan, therefore, attempts to drive us to despair by this logic, that it is in vain for us to feel assured o the love of God, when we do not clearly perceive his aid. And as he suggests to our minds this kind of imposition, so he employs his agents, who contend that God has sold and abandoned our salvation, because he delays to give his assistance. We ought, therefore, to reject as false this argument, that God does not love those whom he appears for a time to forsake; and, indeed, nothing is more unreasonable than to limit his love to any point of time. God has, indeed, promised that he will be our Deliverer; but if he sometimes wink at our calamities, we ought patiently to endure the delay. It is, therefore, contrary to the nature of faith, that the word <i>now</i> should be insisted on by those whom God is training by the cross and by adversity to obedience, and whom he entreats to pray and to call on his name; for these are rather the testimonies of his fatherly love, as the apostle tells us, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:6">Hebrews 12:6</span>.) But there was this peculiarity in, Christ, that, though he was the <i>well-beloved Son,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>,) yet he was not delivered from death, until he had endured the punishment which we deserved; because that was the price by which our salvation was purchased. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(273)</sup></span> Hence it follows again that the priests act maliciously, when they infer that he is not the Son of God, because he performs the office which was enjoined upon him by the Father. </p>
