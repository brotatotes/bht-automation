<p><b>53.</b><i>And went into the holy city.</i> When Matthew bestows on Jerusalem the honorable designation of <i>the holy city,</i> he does not intend to applaud the character of its inhabitants, for we know that it was at that time full of all pollution and wickedness, so that it was rather <i>a den of robbers,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+7:11">Jeremiah 7:11</span>.) But as it had been chosen by God, its <i>holiness,</i> which was founded on Godâ€™s adoption, could not be effaced by any corruptions of men, till its rejection was openly declared. Or, to express it more briefly, on the part of man it was profane, and on the part of God it was <i>holy,</i> till the destruction or pollution of the temple, which happened not long after the crucifixion of Christ. </p>
