<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:59">Matthew 27:59</span></b><b>.</b><i>And having taken the body.</i> The three Evangelists glance briefly at the burial; and therefore they say nothing about the aromatic ointments which John alone mentions, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:39">John 19:39</span>) only they relate that <i>Joseph purchased a clean linen cloth;</i> from which we infer, that Christ was honorably buried. And, indeed, there could be no doubt that <i>a rich man,</i> when he gave up his <i>sepulcher</i> to our Lord, made provision also, in other respects, for suitable magnificence and splendor. And this, too, was brought about by the secret providence of God, rather than by the premeditated design of men, that a new sepulcher, <i>in which no man had ever yet been laid,</i> was obtained by our Lord, who is <i>the first-born from the dead,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>,) and <i>the first-fruits of them that rise,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:20">1 Corinthians 15:20</span>.) God intended, therefore, by this Mark to distinguish his Son from the remainder of the human race, and to point out by the <i>sepulcher</i> itself his newness of life. </p>
