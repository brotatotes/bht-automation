<p><b>10.</b><i>Then Jesus saith to them.</i> We conclude, that it was an improper <i>fear,</i> from which Christ again delivers them; for though it arose out of admiration, still it was opposed to the tranquillity of faith. That they may raise themselves to Christ, the Conqueror of death, they are commanded to be cheerful. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(308)</sup></span> But by those words we are taught that we never know aright our Lord’s resurrection, until, through the firm assurance which we have conceived in our hearts, we venture to rejoice that we have been made partakers of the same life. Our faith ought, at least, to proceed so far that fear shall not predominate. </p>
<p><i>Go, tell my brethren.</i> When Christ ordered them to <i>tell</i> this to the disciples, by this message he again collected and raised up the Church, which was scattered and fallen down. For as it is chiefly by the faith of the resurrection that we are now quickened, so at that time it was proper that the disciples should have that life restored to them from which they had fallen. Here, to it is proper to remark the astonishing kindness of Christ, in deigning to bestow the name of <i>brethren</i> on deserters who had basely forsaken him. Nor can it be doubted that he intentionally employed so kind an appellation, for the purpose of soothing the grief by which he knew that they were grievously tormented. But as the Apostles were not the only persons who were acknowledged by him as <i>brethren,</i> let us know that this message was conveyed by the recommend of Christ, in order that it might afterwards come to us. And, therefore, we ought not to listen with indifference to the narrative of the resurrection, when Christ, with his own mouth, kindly invites us to receive the fruit of it on the ground of our being related to him as <i>brethren.</i> As to the interpretation which some have given to the word <i>brethren,</i> as denoting the cousins and other relatives of Christ, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(309)</sup></span> their mistake is abundantly refuted by the context; for John expressly says that <i>Mary came and told the disciples,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:18">John 20:18</span>;) and Luke immediately adds, that <i>the women told these things to the apostles.</i> Mark also agrees with them; for he says that <i>Mary came and told it to the apostles, while they were mourning and weeping.</i> </p>
