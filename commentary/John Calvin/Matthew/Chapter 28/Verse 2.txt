<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:2">Matthew 28:2</span></b><b>.</b><i>And, lo, a great earthquake.</i> By many signs the Lord showed the presence of his glory, that he might more fully prepare the hearts of the holy women to reverence the mystery. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(304)</sup></span> For since it was not a matter of little consequence to know that the Son of God had obtained a victory over death, (on which the principal point of our salvation is founded,) it was necessary to remove all doubts, that the divine majesty might be openly and manifestly presented to the eyes of the women. Matthew says, therefore, that <i>there was an earthquake,</i> by which the divine power which I have mentioned might be perceived. And by this prodigy, it was proper that the women should be allowed to expect nothing human or earthly, but to raise their minds to a work of God which was new, and surpassed the expectations of men. </p>
<p>The <i>raiment</i> and <i>the countenance</i> of the angel, too, might be said to be rays by which the splendor of Godhead was diffused, so as to enable them to perceive that it was not a mortal man that stood near them, having the face of a man. For though <i>dazzling light,</i> or <i>the whiteness of snow,</i> is nothing in comparison of the boundless glory of God, but rather, if we wish to know him aright, we ought not to imagine to ourselves any color; yet when he makes known by outward signs that he is present, he invites us to him, as far as our weakness can endure. Still we ought to know that the visible signs of his presence are exhibited to us, that our minds may conceive of him as invisible; and that, under bodily forms, we obtain a taste of his spiritual essence, that we may seek him spiritually. Yet it cannot be doubted that, together with outward signs, there was an inward power, which engraved on the hearts of the women an impression of Deity. For though at first they were struck with amazement, yet it will appear, from what follows, that they gathered courage, and were gradually instructed in such a manner, that they perceived the hand of God to be present. </p>
<p>Our three Evangelists, from a desire of brevity, leave out what is more fully related by John, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:1">John 20:1</span>) which, we know, is not unusual with them. There is also this difference, that Matthew and Mark mention but <i>one angel,</i> while John and Luke speak of <i>two.</i> But this apparent contradiction also is easily removed; for we know how frequently in Scripture instances occur of that figure of speech by which a part is taken for the whole. There were <i>two angels,</i> therefore, who appeared first to Mary, and afterwards to her other companions; but as the attention of the women was chiefly directed to the angel who spoke, Matthew and Mark have satisfied themselves with relating his message. Besides, when Matthew says that <i>the angel sat on a stone,</i> there is in his words (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὕστερον πρότερον</span></blu></grk>), <i>an inversion of the order of events;</i> or, at least, that order was disregarded by him; for <i>the angel</i> did not immediately appear, but while the women were held in suspense and anxiety by an event so strange and astonishing. </p>
