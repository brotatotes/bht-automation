<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:13">Matthew 3:13</span></b><b>.</b><i>That he might be baptized by him.</i> For what purpose did the Son of God wish to be baptized? This may be learned, in some measure, from his answer. We have already assigned a special reason. He received the same baptism with us, in order to assure believers, that they are ingrafted into his body, and that they are “buried with him in baptism,” that they may rise to “newness of life,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>.) But the end, which he here proposes, is more <i>extensive: for thus it became him to fulfill all righteousness,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:15">Matthew 3:15</span>.) The word <i>righteousness</i> frequently signifies, in Scripture, the observation of the law: and in that sense we may explain this passage to mean that, since Christ had voluntarily subjected himself to the law, it was necessary that he should keep it in every part. But I prefer a more simple interpretation. “Say nothing for the present,” said our Lord, “about my rank: <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(292)</sup></span> for the question before us is not, which of us deserves to be placed above the other. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(293)</sup></span> Let us rather consider what our calling demands, and what has been enjoined on us by God the Father.” The general reason why Christ received baptism was, that he might render full obedience to the Father; and the special reason was, that he might consecrate baptism in his own body, that we might have it in common with him. </p>
