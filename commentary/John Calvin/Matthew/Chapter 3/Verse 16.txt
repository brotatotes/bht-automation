<p><b>16.</b><i>And, lo, the heavens were opened to him. The opening of the heavens</i> sometimes means a manifestation of heavenly glory; but here it means also a <i>cleft, or opening,</i> of the visible heaven, so that John could see something beyond the planets and stars. The words of Mark can have no other meaning, <i>he saw the heavens cleft asunder</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(296)</sup></span> An exact inquiry into the way in which this opening was made, would be of no importance, nor is it necessary. It is sufficient for us to believe, that it was a symbol of the Divine presence. As the Evangelists say that John saw the Holy Spirit, it is probable that the <i>opening of the heavens</i> was chiefly on his account. Yet I do not hesitate to admit that Christ also, so far as he was man, received from it additional certainty as to his heavenly calling. This appears to be the tendency of the words of Luke: <i>while Jesus was praying, the heaven was opened</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:21">Luke 3:21</span>:) for, though his prayers were always directed towards the benefit of others, yet as man, when he commenced a warfare of so arduous a description, he needed to be armed with a remarkable power of the Spirit. </p>
<p>But here two questions arise. The <i>first</i> is, why did the Spirit, who had <i>formerly</i> dwelt in Christ, descend upon <i>him at that time?</i> This question is answered by a passage of the prophet Isaiah, which will be handled in another place. </p>
<p>“The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord God hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span>.) </p>
<p>Though the grace of the Spirit was bestowed on Christ in a remarkable and extraordinary manner, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:34">John 3:34</span>,) yet he remained at home as a private person, till he should be called to public life by the Father. Now that the full time is come, for preparing to discharge the office of Redeemer, he is clothed with a new power of the Spirit, and that not so much for his own sake, as for the sake of others. It was done on purpose, that believers might learn to receive, and to contemplate with reverence, his divine power, and that the weakness of the flesh might not make him despised. </p>
