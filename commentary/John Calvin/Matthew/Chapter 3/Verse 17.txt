<p><b>17.</b>And, <i>lo, a voice from heaven</i> From that <i>opening of the heavens,</i> which has been already mentioned, a loud voice was heard, that its majesty might be more impressive. The public appearance of Christ, to undertake the office of Mediator, was accompanied by this announcement, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(300)</sup></span> in which he was offered to us by the Father, that we may rely on this pledge of our adoption, and boldly call God himself our Father. The designation of <i>Son</i> belongs truly and naturally to Christ alone: but yet he was declared to be the Son of God in our flesh, that the favor of Him, whom he alone has a right to call <i>Father,</i> may be also obtained for us. And thus when God presents Christ to us as Mediator, accompanied by the title of <i>Son,</i> he declares that he is the <i>Father of us all,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:6">Ephesians 4:6</span>.) </p>
<p>Such, too, is the import of the epithet <i>beloved:</i> for in ourselves we are hateful to God, and his fatherly love must flow to us by Christ. The best expounder of this passage is the Apostle Paul, when he says </p>
<p>“who hath predestinated us into adoption by Jesus Christ in himself, according to the good pleasure of his will; to the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he hath accepted us in the Beloved,” <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:5">Ephesians 1:5</span>) </p>
<p>that is, in his beloved Son. It is still more fully expressed by these words, in <i>whom I am well pleased</i> They imply, that the love of God rests on Christ in such a manner, as to diffuse itself from him to us all; and not to us only, but even to the angels themselves. Not that they need reconciliation, for they never were at enmity with God: but even they become perfectly united to God, only by means of their <i>Head,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:22">Ephesians 1:22</span>.) For the same reason, he is also called “the first-born of every creature,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>;) and Paul likewise states that Christ came </p>
<p>“to reconcile all things to himself, both those which are on earth, and those which are in heavens,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20">Colossians 1:20</span>.) </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(300)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Avec ce tesmoignage et recommandation</span></blu>;” — “with this testimony and recommendation.” </p>
