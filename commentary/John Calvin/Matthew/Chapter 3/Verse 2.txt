<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span></b><b>.</b><i>Repent ye</i> Matthew differs from the other two Evangelists in this respect, that he relates the substance of John’s doctrine, as uttered by John himself, while they relate it in their own words; though Mark has one word more than Luke: for he says, <i>he came Baptizing, and preaching the baptism of repentance</i> But in substance there is the most perfect agreement: for they all connect <i>repentance</i> with <i>the forgiveness of sins.</i> The<i>kingdom of God</i> among men is nothing else than a restoration to a happy life; or, in other words, it is true and everlasting happiness. When John says, that <i>the kingdom of God is at hand,</i> his meaning is, that men, who were alienated from the righteousness of God, and banished from <i>the kingdom of heaven,</i> must be again gathered to God, and live under his guidance. This is accomplished by a free adoption and <i>the forgiveness of sins,</i> by which he reconciles to himself those who were unworthy. In a word, the kingdom of heaven is nothing else than “newness of life,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>,) by which God restores us to the hope of a blessed immortality. Having rescued us from the bondage of sin and death, he claims us as his own; that, even while our pilgrimage on earth continues, we may enjoy the heavenly life by faith: for he </p>
<p>“hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ,” <br>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span>.) </br></p>
<p>Though we are like dead men, yet we know that our life is secure; for it “is hid with Christ in God,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+3:3">Colossians 3:3</span>.) </p>
<p>From this doctrine, as its source, is drawn the exhortation to <i>repentance.</i> For John does not say, “Repent ye, and in this way <i>the kingdom of heaven</i> will afterwards be <i>at hand;”</i> but first brings forward the grace of God, and then exhorts men to <i>repent</i> Hence it is evident, that the foundation of repentance is the mercy of God, by which he restores the lost. In no other sense is it stated by Mark and Luke, that he <i>preached repentance for the forgiveness of sins</i> Repentance is not placed first, as some ignorantly suppose, as if it were the ground of the forgiveness of sins, or as if it induced God to begin to be gracious to us; but men are commanded to repent, that they may receive the reconciliation which is offered to them. Now, as the undeserved love of God — by which he receives into his favor wretched men, “not imputing their trespasses unto them,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19">2 Corinthians 5:19</span>) — is first in order; so it must be observed, that pardon of sins is bestowed upon us in Christ, not that God may treat them with indulgence, but that he may heal us from our sins. And, indeed, without hatred of sin and remorse for transgressions, no man will taste the grace of God. But a definition of <i>repentance</i> and <i>faith</i> may explain more fully the manner in which both are connected; which leads me to handle this doctrine more sparingly. </p>
<p>With regard to the meaning of the present passage, it is proper to observe, that the whole Gospel consists of two parts, —<i>forgiveness of sins,</i> and <i>repentance</i> Now, as Matthew denominates the first of these <i>the kingdom of heaven,</i> we may conclude, that men are in a state of deadly enmity with God, and altogether shut out from the heavenly kingdom, till God receives them into favor. Though John, when he introduces the mention of the grace of God, exhorts men to repentance, yet it must not be forgotten that repentance, not less than the inheritance of the heavenly kingdom, is the gift of God. As he freely pardons our sins, and delivers us, by his mercy, from the condemnation of eternal death, so also does he form us anew to his image, that we may live unto righteousness. As he freely adopts us for his sons, so he regenerates us by his Spirit, that our life may testify, that we do not falsely, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(245)</sup></span> address him as our Father. In like manner, Christ washes away our sins by his blood, and reconciles our Heavenly Father to us by the sacrifice of his death; but, at the same time, in consequence of </p>
<p>“our old man being crucified with him, and the body of sin destroyed,” <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>) </p>
<p>he makes us “alive” unto righteousness. The sum of the Gospel is, that God, through his Son, takes away our sins, and admits us to fellowship with him, that we, <i>“denying ourselves</i> ” and our own nature, may “live soberly, righteously, and godly,” and thus may exercise ourselves on earth in meditating on the heavenly life. </p>
