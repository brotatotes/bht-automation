<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:3">Matthew 3:3</span></b><b>.</b><i>The yoke of one crying in the wilderness</i> Though this passage of the prophet Isaiah (40:3) ought not to be limited exclusively to John, yet he is one of the number of those to whom it certainly refers. After having spoken of the destruction of the city, and of the awful calamities that would befall the people, he promises a restoration that would follow. His words are, </p>
<p>“Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God,” <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:1">Isaiah 40:1</span>.) </p>
<p>When the temple had been thrown down, and sacrifices abolished, and the people led away into captivity, their affairs seemed to be desperate. And as their ears had been deaf to the uninterrupted voice of the prophets, the Lord kept silence for a time. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(247)</sup></span> That pious minds may not be cast down during this melancholy silence, the prophet announces, that other preachers of grace will yet arise, to awaken in the people a hope of salvation. Such were Zechariah, Haggai, Malachi, and the like. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(248)</sup></span> But as the restoration promised is perpetual, and not for a time only, and as Isaiah refers chiefly to the redemption, which was to be expressed at the coming of Christ, John the Baptist is justly considered the chief minister of consolation. </p>
<p>Next follows in the words of the prophet, <i>The voice of one crying</i> That <i>voice</i> is contrasted with the temporary silence, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(249)</sup></span> which I have just mentioned: for the Jews were to be deprived, for a time, of the instruction, which they had wickedly despised. The word <i>wilderness</i> is here used metaphorically for <i>desolation,</i> or the frightful ruin of the nation, such as existed in the time of the captivity. It was so dismally shattered, that it might well be compared to a <i>wilderness</i> The prophet magnifies the grace of God. “Though the people,” says he, “have been driven far from their country, and even excluded from the society of men, yet the voice of God will yet be heard in <i>the wilderness,</i> to revive the dead with joyful consolation.” When John began to preach, Jerusalem was in this sense a <i>wilderness:</i> for all had been reduced to wild and frightful confusion. But the very sight of a visible <i>wilderness</i> must have had a powerful effect on stupid and hardened men, leading them to perceive that they were in a state of death, and to accept the promise of salvation, which had been held out to them. We now see, that this prediction actually relates to John, and is most properly applied to him. </p>
<p><i>Prepare the way of the Lord</i> The prophet undoubtedly addresses Cyrus and the Persians, whose agency the Lord employed in this matter. The meaning is: by his wonderful power, God will open a way to his people through impassable forests, through broken rocks, through a sandy desert; for he will have at hand the ministers of his grace, to remove all hindrances out of the way. But that was a shadowy anticipation of redemption. When the spiritual truth is about to appear, John is sent to remove obstacles. And even now the same voice sounds in our ears, that we may <i>prepare the way of the Lord:</i> that is, that we may take out of the way those sins which obstruct the kingdom of Christ, and thus may give access to his grace. To the same purpose are the following words of the prophet: <i>the crooked shall be made straight,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:4">Isaiah 40:4</span>.) All that they mean is: there are intricate and crooked windings in the world, but through such appalling difficulties the Lord makes a way for himself, and breaks through, by incredible means, to accomplish our salvation. </p>
