<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:4">Matthew 3:4</span></b><b>.</b><i>And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair</i> The Evangelist does not desire us to reckon it as one of John’s chief excellencies, that he followed a rough and austere way of living, or even that he avoided a moderate and ordinary degree of elegance: but, having already stated that he was an inhabitant of the mountains, he now adds, that his food and clothing were adapted to his residence. And he mentions this, not only to inform us, that John was satisfied with the food and dress of the peasants, and partook of no delicacies; but that, under a mean and contemptible garb, he was held in high estimation by men of rank and splendor. Superstitious persons look upon righteousness as consisting almost entirely of outward appearances, and have commonly thought, that abstinence of this kind was the perfection of holiness. Nearly akin to this is the error, of supposing him to be a man who lived in solitude, and who disdained the ordinary way of living; as the only superiority of hermits and monks is, that they differ from other people. Nay<i>,</i> gross ignorance has gone so far that, out of <i>camel’s hair</i> they have made an entire skin. </p>
<p>Now, there can be no doubt, that the Evangelist here describes a man of the mountains, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(252)</sup></span> widely distant from all the refinement and delicacies of towns,—not only satisfied with such food as could be procured, but eating only what was fit to be used in its natural state, such as <i>wild honey,</i> which is supplied by that region in great abundance, and <i>locusts,</i> with which it also abounds. Or he may have intended to point out that, when a man of mean aspect, and without any polite accomplishments, appeared in public life, it was attended by this advantage, that the majesty of God shone alone in him, and yet struck all with admiration. For we must observe what is added, that there was a great concourse of people from all directions; from which we infer, that his fame was very widely spread. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(253)</sup></span> Or the Evangelist may have signified the design of God, to present, in the person of John, a singular instance of frugality, and, in this manner, to fill the Jews with reverence for his doctrine, or at least to convince them of ingratitude, according to that saying of our Lord, <i>John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:33">Luke 7:33</span>.) </p>
