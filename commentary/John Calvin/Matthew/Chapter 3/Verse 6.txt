In <i>Baptism,</i> he declares that our sins are forgiven, and calls us to repentance. That men may come forward, in a right manner, to be baptized, <i>confession of sins</i> is demanded from them: otherwise the whole performance would be nothing but an idle mockery <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(254)</sup></span> Let it be observed, that we are here speaking of adults, who ought not, we. are aware, to be admitted indiscriminately into the Church, or introduced by Baptism into the body of Christ, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(255)</sup></span> till an examination has been previously made. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(256)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Hence it is obvious, how absurdly this passage has been tortured by the Papists, to support auricular confession. There were no priests at hand, in whose ears each individual might privately mutter <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(257)</sup></span> his sins; nor is it said that they enumerated all their sins; nor are we told that John left in charge to his disciples an ordinary rule for confession. Even granting to Papists all that they ask, confession will belong to Catechumens alone, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(258)</sup></span> and will have no place after Baptism. At all events, the law which they lay down for confession after Baptism, derives no countenance from John’s example. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(259)</sup></span> </p>
