Matthew 3:8; Luke 3:8.Yield therefore fruits worthy of repentance. He confirms what I have already said, that the repentance, which is attested by words, is of no value, unless it be proved by the conduct: for it is too important a matter to be estimated lightly, or at random. And so John affirms, that the solemn declaration, which they made, is not enough, but that, in process of time, their works will make it evident, whether or not they have seriously repented. (266) It ought to be observed, that good works (Titus 3:8) are here called fruits of repentance: for repentance is an inward matter, which has its seat in the heart and soul, but afterwards yields its fruits in a change of life. (267) But as the whole of this part of doctrine has been grievously corrupted by Popery, we must attend to this distinction, that repentance is an inward renewal of the man, which manifests itself in the outward life, as a tree produces its fruit. (266) “Si leur repentance est vraye, et si c’est it bon escient qu’ils vienent k luy.” — “If their repentance is true, and if it is in good earnest that they come to him.” (267) “Par le changement et amendement de vie;” — “by the change and amendment of life.”
