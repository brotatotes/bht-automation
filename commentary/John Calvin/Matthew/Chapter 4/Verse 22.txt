<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:22">Matthew 4:22</span></b><b>.</b><i>And they immediately left the ship.</i> The <i>first</i> thing that strikes us here is the power of Christâ€™s voice. Not that his voice alone makes so powerful an impression on the hearts of men: but those whom the Lord is pleased to lead and draw to himself, are inwardly addressed by his Spirit, that they may obey his voice. The <i>second</i> is, the commendation bestowed on the docility and ready obedience of his disciples, who prefer the call of Christ to all worldly affairs. The ministers of the Word ought, in a particular manner, to be directed by this example, to lay aside all other occupations, and to devote themselves unreservedly to the Church, to which they are appointed. </p>
