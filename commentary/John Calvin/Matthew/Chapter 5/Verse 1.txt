<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span></b><b>.</b><i>He went up into a mountain.</i> Those who think that Christ’s sermon, which is here related, is different from the sermon contained in the sixth chapter of Luke’s Gospel, rest their opinion on a very light and frivolous argument. Matthew states, that Christ spoke to his disciples on a mountain, while Luke seems to say, that the discourse was delivered on a plain. But it is a mistake to read the words of Luke, <i>he went down with them, and stood in the plain,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:17">Luke 6:17</span>,) as immediately connected with the statement that, <i>lifting up his eyes on the disciples,</i> he spoke thus. For the design of both Evangelists was, to collect into one place the leading points of the doctrine of Christ, which related to a devout and holy life. Although Luke had previously mentioned a <i>plain,</i> he does not observe the immediate succession of events in the history, but passes from miracles to doctrine, without pointing out either time or place: just as Matthew takes no notice of the time, but only mentions the place. It is probable, that this discourse was not delivered until Christ had chosen the twelve: but in attending to the order of time, which I saw that the Spirit of God had disregarded, I did not wish to be too precise. Pious and modest readers ought to be satisfied with having a brief summary of the doctrine of Christ placed before their eyes, collected out of his many and various discourses, the first of which was that in which he spoke to his disciples about true happiness. </p>
