<p><b>19.</b><i>Whoever then shall break</i> Christ here speaks expressly of the commandments of life, or the ten words, which all the children of God ought to take as the rule of their life. He therefore declares, that they are false and deceitful teachers, who do not restrain their disciples within obedience to the law, and that they are unworthy to occupy a place in the Church, who weaken, in the slightest degree, the authority of the law; and, on the other hand, that they are honest and faithful ministers of God, who recommend, both by word and by example, the keeping of the law. <i>The least commandments</i> is an expression used in accommodation to the judgment of men: for though they have not all the same weight, (but, when they are compared together, some are less than others,) yet we are not at liberty to think any thing <i>small,</i> on which the heavenly Legislator has been pleased to issue a command. For what sacrilege is it to treat contemptuously any thing which has proceeded from his sacred mouth? This is to sink his majesty to the rank of creatures. Accordingly, when our Lord calls them <i>little commandments,</i> it is a sort of concession. <i>He shall be called the least</i> This is an allusion to what he had just said about the <i>commandments:</i> but the meaning is obvious. Those who shall pour contempt on the doctrine of the law, or on a single syllable of it, will be rejected as the lowest of men. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(384)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>The kingdom of heaven</i> means the renovation of the Church, or the prosperous condition of the Church, such as was then beginning to appear by the preaching of the Gospel. In this sense, Christ tells us, that <i>“</i> he who is least <i>in the kingdom of God</i> is greater than John,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:28">Luke 7:28</span>.) The meaning of that phrase is, that God, restoring the world by the hand of his Son, has completely established his kingdom. Christ declares that, when his Church shall have been renewed, no teachers must be admitted to it, but those who are faithful expounders of the law, and who labor to maintain its doctrine entire. But it is asked, were not ceremonies among <i>the commandments</i> of God, the <i>least of which</i> we are now required to observe? I answer, We must look to the design and object of the Legislator. God enjoined ceremonies, that their outward use might be temporal, and their meaning eternal. That man does not <i>break</i> ceremonies, who omits what is shadowy, but retains their effect. But if Christ banishes from his <i>kingdom</i> all who accustom men to any contempt of the law how monstrous must be their stupidity, who are not ashamed to remit, by a sacrilegious indulgence, what God strictly demands, and, under the pretense of venial sin, to overthrow the righteousness of the law. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(385)</sup></span> Again, we must observe the description he gives of good and holy teachers: that not only by words, but chiefly by the example of life, they exhort <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(386)</sup></span> men to keep the law. </p>
