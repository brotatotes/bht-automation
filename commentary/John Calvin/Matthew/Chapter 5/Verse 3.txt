<p><b>3.</b><i>Happy are the poor in spirit.</i> <b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:20">Luke 6:20</span></b><b>.</b><i>Happy (are ye) poor.</i> Luke gives nothing more than a simple metaphor: but as the poverty of many is accursed and unhappy, Matthew expresses more clearly the intention of Christ. Many are pressed down by distresses, and yet continue to swell inwardly with pride and cruelty. But Christ pronounces those to be happy who, chastened and subdued by afflictions, submit themselves wholly to God, and, with inward humility, betake themselves to him for protection. Others explain <i>the poor in spirit</i> to be those who claim nothing for themselves, and are even so completely emptied of confidence in the flesh, that they acknowledge their poverty. But as the words of Luke and those of Matthew must have the same meaning, there can be no doubt that the appellation <i>poor</i> is here given to those who are pressed and afflicted by adversity. The only difference is, that Matthew, by adding an epithet, confines the happiness to those only who, under the discipline of the cross, have learned to be humble. </p>
<p><i>For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</i> We see that Christ does not swell the minds of his own people by any unfounded belief, or harden them by unfeeling obstinacy, as the Stoics do, but leads them to entertain the hope of eternal life, and animates them to patience by assuring them, that in this way they will pass into the heavenly kingdom of God. It deserves our attention, that he only who is reduced to nothing in himself, and relies on the mercy of God, is <i>poor in spirit:</i> for they who are broken or overwhelmed by despair murmur against God, and this proves them to be of a proud and haughty <i>spirit.</i> </p>
