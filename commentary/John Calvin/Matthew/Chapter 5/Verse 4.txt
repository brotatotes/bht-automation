<p><b>4.</b><i>Happy are they that mourn.</i> This statement is closely connected with the preceding one, and is a sort of appendage or confirmation of it. The ordinary belief is, that calamities render a man unhappy. This arises from the consideration, that they constantly bring along with them <i>mourning</i> and grief. Now, nothing is supposed to be more inconsistent with happiness than <i>mourning.</i> But Christ does not merely affirm that <i>mourners</i> are not unhappy. He shows, that their very <i>mourning</i> contributes to a <i>happy</i> life, by preparing them to receive eternal joy, and by furnishing them with excitements to seek true <i>comfort</i> in God alone. Accordingly, Paul says, </p>
<p>“We glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation produces patience, and patience experience, and experience hope: and hope maketh not ashamed,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:3">Romans 5:3</span>.) </p>
