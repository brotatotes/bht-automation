<p><b>1.</b><i>Beware</i> In this passage, Christ exhorts his people to devote themselves sincerely to good works; that is, to endeavor, with simplicity, to do what is right before God, and not to make a parade before men. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(424)</sup></span> A very necessary admonition; for in all virtues the entrance of ambition is to be dreaded, and there is no work so laudable, as not to be in many instances corrupted and polluted by it. Under one class he lays down, by a <i>synecdoche,</i> a general doctrine: for he speaks of <i>alms</i> only, as he speaks shortly afterwards about <i>prayers:</i> though some copies, instead of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐλεημοσύνην</span></blu></grk>, <i>alms,</i> read <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δικαιοσύνην</span></blu></grk> <i>, righteousness,</i> which is also the rendering of the old translator. But the difference is of little moment: for in either way there is no room to doubt, that the design is, to correct the disease of ambition, when, in doing what is right, we seek glory from men. </p>
