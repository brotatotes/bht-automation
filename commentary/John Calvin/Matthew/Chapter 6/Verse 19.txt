<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19">Matthew 6:19</span></b><b>.</b><i>Lay not up.</i> This deadly plague reigns everywhere throughout the world. Men are grown mad with an insatiable desire of gain. Christ charges them with folly, in collecting wealth with great care, and then giving up their happiness to <i>moths</i> and to <i>rust,</i> or exposing it as a prey to thieves. What is more unreasonable than to place their property, where it may perish of itself, or be carried off by men? <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(450)</sup></span> Covetous men, indeed, take no thought of this. They lock up their riches in well-secured chests, but cannot prevent them from being exposed to <i>thieves</i> or to <i>moths</i> They are blind and destitute of sound judgment, who give themselves so much toil and uneasiness in amassing wealth, which is liable to putrefaction, or robbery, or a thousand other accidents: particularly, when God allows us a place <i>in heaven for laying up a treasure,</i> and kindly invites us to enjoy riches which never perish. </p>
