<p><b>21.</b><i>Where your treasure shall be</i> By this statement Christ proves that they are unhappy men who have their treasures laid up on the earth: because their happiness is uncertain and of short duration. Covetous men cannot be prevented from breathing in their hearts a wish for heaven: but Christ lays down an opposite principle, that, wherever men imagine the greatest happiness to be, there they are surrounded and confined. Hence it follows, that they who desire to be happy in the world <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(451)</sup></span> renounce heaven. We know how carefully the philosophers conducted their inquiries respecting the supreme good. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(452)</sup></span> It was the chief point on which they bestowed their labor, and justly: for it is the principle on which the regulation of our life entirely depends, and the object to which all our senses are directed. If honor is reckoned the supreme good, the minds of men must be wholly occupied with ambition: if money, covetousness will immediately predominate: if pleasure, it will be impossible to prevent men from sinking into brutal indulgence. We have all a natural desire to pursue happiness; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(453)</sup></span> and the consequence is, that false imaginations carry us away in every direction. But if we were honestly and firmly convinced that our happiness is in heaven, it would be easy for us to trample upon the world, to despise earthly blessings, (by the deceitful attractions of which the greater part of men are fascinated,) and to rise towards heaven. For this reason Paul, with the view of exciting believers to look upwards, and of exhorting them to meditate on the heavenly life, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+3:1">Colossians 3:1</span>,) presents to them Christ, in whom alone they ought to seek perfect happiness; thus declaring, that to allow their souls to grovel on the earth would be inconsistent and unworthy of those whose <i>treasure is in heaven</i> </p>

In examining the principles of Epicurus, he professes to feel very much at ease, but approaches the Stoics with greater respect, and acknowledges the ability with which they had conducted their argument. The perusal of the whole treatise will gratify a reader prepared to accompany powerful minds in their most intricate researches, or to hail abstruse disquisition clothed in the choicest language by one who, as Robert Hall said of Pascal, “can invest the severest logic with the charms of the most beautiful composition, and render the most profound argumentation as entertaining as a romance.” But those studies have a far higher value. When we see the greatest minds tasked to their utmost strength, and yet utterly failing to discover, by unassisted reason, the path which leads to happiness, we appreciate more highly Leland’s argument “On the advantage and necessity of Divine Revelation,” and bless the name of the Great Prophet, <i>who hath brought life and immortality to light by the Gospel,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:10">2 Timothy 1:10</span>.) — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
