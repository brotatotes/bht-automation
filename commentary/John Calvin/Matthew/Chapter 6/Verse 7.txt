<p><b>7.</b><i>Use not vain repetitions</i> He reproves another fault in prayer, a multiplicity of words. There are two words used, but in the same sense: for <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">βαττολογία</span></blu></grk> is “a superfluous and affected repetition,” and <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πολυλογία</span></blu></grk> is “unmeaning talk.” Christ reproves the folly of those who, with the view of persuading and entreating God, pour out a superfluity of words. This doctrine is not inconsistent with the praises everywhere bestowed in Scripture on earnestness in prayer: for, when prayer is offered with earnest feeling, the tongue does not go before the heart. Besides, the grace of God is not obtained by an unmeaning flow of words; but, on the contrary, a devout heart throws out its affections, like arrows, to pierce heaven. At the same time, this condemns the superstition of those who entertain the belief, that they will secure the favor of God by long murmurings. We find Popery to be so deeply imbued with this error, that it believes the efficacy of prayer to lie chiefly in talkativeness. The greater number of words that a man mutters, the more diligently he is supposed to have prayed. Long and tedious chanting also, as if it were to soothe the ears of God, continually resounds in their cathedrals. </p>
