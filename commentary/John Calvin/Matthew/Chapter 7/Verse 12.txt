<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:12">Matthew 7:12</span></b><b>.</b><i>All things whatsoever you would wish</i> The word <i>therefore</i> (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">οὖν</span></blu></grk>) is superfluous, as we often find such particles occurring, and without any addition to the sense, in detached sentences. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(467)</sup></span> I have already said, that Matthew does not give here a single discourse, but a summary of doctrine collected out of many sermons. We must, therefore, read this sentence by itself. It is an exhortation to his disciples to be just, and contains a short and simple definition of what justice means. We are here informed, that the only reason why so many quarrels exist in the world, and why men inflict so many mutual injuries on each other, is, that they knowingly and willingly trample justice under their feet, while every man rigidly demands that it shall be maintained towards himself. </p>
<p>Where our own advantage is concerned, there is not one of us, who cannot explain minutely and ingeniously what ought to be done. And since every man shows himself to be a skillful teacher of justice for his own advantage, how comes it, that the same knowledge does not readily occur to him, when the profit or loss of another is at stake, but because we wish to be wise for ourselves only, and no man cares about his neighbors? What is more, we maliciously and purposely shut our eyes upon the rule of justice, which shines in our hearts. Christ therefore shows, that every man may be a rule of acting properly and justly towards his neighbors, if he do to others what he requires to be done to him. He thus refutes all the vain pretenses, which men contrive for hiding or disguising their injustice. Perfect justice would undoubtedly prevail among us, if we were as faithful in learning <i>active</i> charity, (if we may use the expression,) as we are skillful in teaching <i>passive</i> charity. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(468)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>For this is the law and the prophets</i> Our Lord does not intend to say, that this is the only point of doctrine laid down in <i>the law and the prophets,</i> but that all the precepts which they contain about charity, and all the laws and exhortations found in them about maintaining justice, have a reference to this object. The meaning is, that the second table of the law is fulfilled, when every man conducts himself in the same manner towards others, as he wishes them to conduct themselves towards him. There is no need, he tells us, of long and involved debates, if this simplicity is preserved, and if men do not, by inordinate self-love, efface the rectitude which is engraven on their hearts. </p>

The fact chiefly to be noticed here is, that such particles came to be regarded as a part of the proverb, and were hardly ever separated from it: though their use must originally have been elliptical, like that of<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">γὰρ,</span></blu></grk> which opens many a reply in Greek dialogues. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
