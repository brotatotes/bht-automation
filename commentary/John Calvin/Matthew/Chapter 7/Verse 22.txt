<p><b>22.</b><i>Many will say to me</i> Christ again summons hypocrites to his judgment-seat, as we showed a little ago from Luke. So long as they hold a place in his Church, they both flatter themselves and deceive others. He therefore declares, that a day is coming, when he will cleanse his barn, and separate the chaff and straw from the pure wheat. <i>To prophesy in the name of Christ</i> is, to discharge the office of teacher by his authority, and, as it were, under his direction. <i>Prophecy</i> is here, I think, taken in a large sense, as in the fourteenth chapter of the Epistle to the Corinthians. He might have simply used the word <i>preach,</i> but purposely employed the more honorable appellation, in order to show more clearly, that an outward profession is nothing, whatever may be its brilliancy in the eyes of men. <i>To do wonderful works in the name of Christ</i> is nothing else than to perform miracles by his power, authority, command, and direction: for, though the word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὁμολογήσω</span></blu></grk>, <i>powers,</i> is sometimes confined to one class of miracles, yet in this and many other passages it denotes every kind of miracles. </p>
