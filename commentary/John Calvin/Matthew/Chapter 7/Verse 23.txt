<p><b>23.</b><i>And then will I confess to them</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(482)</sup></span> By using the word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὁμολογήσω</span></blu></grk> <i>, I will confess,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(483)</sup></span> Christ appears to allude to the vain boasting, by which hypocrites now vaunt themselves. <i>“</i> They indeed have <i>confessed</i> me with the tongue, and imagine that they have fully discharged their duty. The <i>confession</i> of my name is now heard aloud from their tongue. But I too will <i>confess</i> on the opposite side, that their profession is deceitful and false.” And what is contained in Christ’s <i>confession?</i> That he never reckoned them among his own people, even at the time when they boasted that they were the pillars of the church. </p>
<p><i>Depart from me.</i> He orders those persons to go out from his presence, who had stolen, under a false title, an unjust and temporary possession of his house. From this passage in our Lord’s discourse Paul seems to have taken what he says to Timothy, </p>
<p>The Lord knoweth who are his: and, let every one who calleth on the name of Christ depart from iniquity, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:19">2 Timothy 2:19</span>.) </p>
<p>The former clause is intended to prevent weak minds from being alarmed or discouraged by the desertion of those who had a great and distinguished reputation: <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(484)</sup></span> for he declares that they were disowned by the Lord, though by a vain show they captivated the eyes of men. He then exhorts all those who wish to be reckoned among the disciples of Christ, to <i>withdraw</i> early from <i>iniquity,</i> that Christ may not drive them from his presence, when he shall <i>“separate the sheep from the goats</i>, ” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:33">Matthew 25:33</span>.) </p>
