<p><b>28.</b><i>When Jesus had finished these sayings</i> By <i>these sayings</i> I understand not only the discourse which he delivered when he came down from the mountain, but the rest of the doctrine, which had already been made known to the people. The meaning therefore is, that, where he had given the people, on all sides, a taste of his doctrine, all were seized with astonishment, because a strange, indescribable, and unwonted majesty drew to him the minds of men. What is meant by his <i>teaching them as having authority, and not as the scribes,</i> I have already explained. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(486)</sup></span> </p>
