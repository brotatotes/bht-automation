<p><b>9.</b><i>Is there any man among you?</i> It is a comparison from the less to the greater. First, our Lord contrasts the malice of men with the boundless goodness of God. Self-love (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">φιλαυτία</span></blu></grk>) renders us malicious: for every man is too much devoted to himself, and neglects and disregards others. But this vice yields to the stronger feelings of a father’s love, so that men forget themselves, and give to their children with overflowing liberality. Whence comes this, but because God, of <i>whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:15">Ephesians 3:15</span>,) drops into their hearts a portion of his goodness? But if the little drops produce such an amount of beneficence, what ought we to expect from the inexhaustible ocean? Would God, who thus opens the hearts of men, shut his own? Let us also remember that passage of Isaiah, “Though a mother forget her children,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:15">Isaiah 49:15</span>,) yet the Lord will be like himself, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(466)</sup></span> and will always show himself to be a Father. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(466)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Le Seigneur ne changera point</span></blu>;” — “the Lord will not change.” </p>
