<p><b>21.</b><i>Lord, permit me to go first and bury my father.</i> We have said, that the scribe was rejected by Christ as a follower, because he made his offer without consideration, and imagined that he would enjoy an easy life. The person whom Christ retains had an opposite fault. He was prevented from immediately obeying the call of Christ by the weakness of thinking it a hardship to leave his father. It is probable that his father was in extreme old age: for the mode of expression, <i>Permit me to bury,</i> implies that he had but a short time to live. Luke says that Christ ordered him to <i>follow;</i> while <i>Matthew</i> says that he was <i>one of his disciples</i> But he does not refuse the calling: he only asks leave for a time to discharge a duty which he owes to his father. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(506)</sup></span> The excuse bears that he looked upon himself as at liberty till his father’s death. From Christ’s reply we learn, that children should discharge their duty to their parents in such a manner that, whenever God calls them to another employment, they should lay this aside, and assign the first place to the command of God. Whatever duties we owe to men must give way, when God enjoins upon us what is immediately due to himself. All ought to consider what God requires from them as individuals, and what is demanded by their particular calling, that earthly parents may not prevent the claims of the highest and only Father of all from remaining entire. </p>
