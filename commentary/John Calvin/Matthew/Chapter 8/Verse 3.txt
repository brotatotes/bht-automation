<p><b>3.</b><i>Having stretched out his hand, he touched</i> Under the Law, the <i>touch</i> of a <i>leper</i> was infectious; but as Christ possesses such purity as to repel all filth and defilement, he does not, by touching, either pollute himself with leprosy, or become a transgressor of the law. When he took upon him our flesh, he did not only deign to touch as with his hand, but was united to one and the same body with ourselves, that we might be <i>flesh of his flesh,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:23">Genesis 2:23</span>.) Nor did he only stretch out his arm to us, but descended from heaven even to hell, and yet contracted no stain from it, but, retaining his innocence, took away all our impurities, and sprinkled us with his holiness. By his word alone he might have healed the <i>leper;</i> but he applied, at the same time, the touch of his hand, to express the feeling of compassion. Nor ought this to excite our wonder, since he chose to take upon him our flesh, that he might cleanse us from our sins. <i>The stretching out of his hand</i> was therefore an expression and token of infinite grace and goodness. What we indolently read, and coldly pass by, cannot be duly weighed without great astonishment. The Son of God was so far from disdaining to talk to a leper, that he even <i>stretched out his hand to touch</i> that uncleanness. </p>
