<p><b>4.</b><i>And Jesus saith to him, See that thou tell it not to any one</i> Some persons, by way of excusing the <i>leper,</i> think that Christ did not seriously forbid him to publish the miracle, but rather gave him an additional excitement to do so. Others more justly consider the reason of the prohibition to have been, that the full “time was not yet come,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:6">John 7:6</span>.) I do acknowledge, that to have suppressed this miracle would have been improper: but our Lord had a particular reason for wishing that the report of it should not be immediately spread, or, at least, not by the <i>leper</i> The <i>leper</i> was so far from deserving praise for the disorderly exhibition of his regard, that he ought, in my opinion, to be condemned for not obeying Christ’s injunction. If he wished to express his gratitude to him to whom he was indebted for his cure, no better method could have been found than <i>obedience,</i> which God prefers to all <i>sacrifices,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:22">1 Samuel 15:22</span>,) and which is the origin and foundation of lawful worship. This example shows us, that those who allow themselves to be guided by inconsiderate zeal act improperly, because the more eager they are to please God, the greater progress do they make in rebellion to his commands. </p>
<p><i>Show thyself to the priest</i> As the ceremonies of the law had not yet been repealed, Christ did not wish that they should be despised or neglected. Now, God had commanded in the law that, if any man had been cleansed from leprosy, he should present himself to the priest with a sacrifice of thanksgiving, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+14:2">Leviticus 14:2</span>.) The design <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(492)</sup></span> was, that the priest, by his decision, might attest the benefit received from God; and that the person who had been healed might give an expression of his gratitude. Christ, therefore, by sending the leper <i>to the priest,</i> proves that he had no other object in view than to display the glory of God. The <i>showing to the priest</i> was for the purpose of examination, and the <i>offering</i> was the expression of thanksgiving. He wishes that the priests should examine the man, to make the divine favor manifest and undoubted; and that the <i>leper,</i> on the other hand, should acknowledge that God had healed him. Meanwhile, as I have just mentioned, he commands them to observe the ceremonies prescribed by the law, till the time when it should be repealed. </p>
<p>The attempt of the Papists to produce this passage, as an authority for their own <i>confession,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(493)</sup></span> is highly foolish. <i>Leprosy,</i> they allege, is put allegorically for <i>sin;</i> and <i>the priests,</i> who are consecrated by the Pope, are the judges of spiritual leprosy. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(494)</sup></span> Even granting that this authority was conferred on the priests under the law, for the purpose of informing the people, that all their cleanness, and the decision respecting it, depended on the priesthood, still this is impiously claimed for themselves by the Popish priests. All the honor that belonged to the ancient priests is now claimed by Christ alone as his own. He alone is appointed to be the judge of spiritual leprosy, and entitled to receive, from those who have been cured, the offering for their cleansing. Under the law, a sacrifice was employed as the seal of cleanness, because satisfaction made by the shedding of blood is the only way in which men are cleansed. To transfer to another that right, which God has declared to be the prerogative of his own Son, is a detestable sacrilege. When the ministers of the Gospel, by the command of Christ, declare to sinners that they are cleansed from their sins, this must not be tortured into the pretended jurisdiction, which the priests imagine, of pronouncing a decision about leprosy. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(495)</sup></span> </p>
