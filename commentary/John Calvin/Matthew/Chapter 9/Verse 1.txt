<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:1">Matthew 9:1</span></b><b>.</b><i>And came into his own city.</i> This passage shows, that <i>Capernaum</i> was generally believed to be the birth-place of Christ, because his visits to it were frequent: for there is no room to doubt, that it is the same history which is related by the three Evangelists, though some circumstances may be more exactly related by one of them than by another. Luke says that scribes had come from various parts of Judea, who were spectators when Christ <i>healed</i> the p<i>aralytic;</i> and at the same time states indirectly, that there were others who also received <i>healing</i> through the grace of Christ. For, before he comes to the <i>paralytic,</i> he speaks in the plural number, and says, that the power of God was displayed for healing <i>their</i> diseases; <i>the power of the Lord was present to heal them</i> The glory of this miracle was very remarkable. A man destitute of the use of all his limbs, lying on a bed, and lowered by cords, suddenly rises up in health, vigor, and agility. Another special reason why the Evangelists dwell more on this miracle than on others is, that the scribes were offended at Christ for claiming power and <i>authority to forgive sins;</i> while Christ intended to confirm and seal that authority by a visible sign. </p>
