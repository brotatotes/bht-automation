<p><b>13.</b><i>But rather go and learn</i> He dismisses and orders them to depart, because he saw that they were obstinate and unwilling to learn. Or rather he explains to them, that they are contending with God and the Prophet, when, in pride and cruelty, they are offended at relief which is given to the wretched, and at medicine which is administered to the sick. This quotation is made from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:6">Hosea 6:6</span>: </p>
<p>For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; <br/>and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings. </p>
<p>The subject of the prophet’s discourse had been the vengeance of God against the Jews. That they might not excuse themselves by saying that they were performing the outward worship of God, (as they were wont to boast in a careless manner about their ceremonies,) he declares that God has no delight in <i>sacrifices,</i> when their minds are destitute of piety, and when their conduct is at variance with uprightness and righteousness. That the statement, I <i>desired not sacrifice,</i> must be understood comparatively, is evident from the second clause, that <i>the knowledge of God is better than burnt-offerings</i> By these words he does not absolutely reject <i>burnt-offerings,</i> but places them in a rank inferior to piety and faith. We ought to hold, that faith and spiritual worship are in themselves pleasing to God, and that charity and the duties of humanity towards our neighbors are in themselves required; but that <i>sacrifices</i> are but appendages, so to speak, which are of no value or estimation, where substantial truth is not found. On this subject I have treated more fully at the tenth chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews. It ought to be observed that there is a <i>synecdoche</i> in the word <i>mercy:</i> for under one head the prophet embraces all the kindness which we owe to our brethren. </p>
<p><i>For I came not</i> Though this was spoken for the purpose of reproving the pride and hypocrisy of the scribes, yet it contains, in a general form, a very profitable doctrine. We are reminded that the grace of Christ is of no advantage to us, unless when, conscious of our sins, and groaning under their load, we approach to him with humility. There is also something here which is fitted to elevate weak consciences to a firm assurance: for we have no reason to fear that Christ will reject sinners, to call whom he descended from his heavenly glory. But we must also attend to the expression, <i>to repentance:</i> which is intended to inform us that pardon is granted to us, not to cherish our sins, but to recall us to the earnestness of a devout and holy life. He reconciles us to the Father on this condition, that, being redeemed by his blood, we may present ourselves true sacrifices, as Paul tells us: </p>
<p>The grace of God, which bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, and righteously, and devoutly in this world, (<b>Titus 2:11,12</b>.) </p>
