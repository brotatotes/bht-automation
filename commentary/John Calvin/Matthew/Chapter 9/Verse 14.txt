<p><b><span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:14">Matthew 9:14</span></b><b>.</b><i>Then come to him the disciples of John.</i> Luke represents the <i>Pharisees</i> as speaking: Mark appears to connect both. And, indeed, there is no room to doubt that the <i>Pharisees</i> maliciously endeavored, by this stratagem, to draw <i>the disciples of John</i> to their party, and to produce a quarrel between them and the disciples of Christ. A resemblance in <i>prayers and fastings</i> was a plausible pretext for associating at this time: while the different manner in which Christ acted was an occasion of enmity and dislike to men whose temper was unamiable, and who were excessively devoted to themselves. </p>
<p>This example reminds us, that prudence and caution are necessary to prevent wicked and cunning men from sowing divisions among us on any slight grounds. Satan has a wonderful dexterity, no doubt, in laying those snares; and it is an easy matter to distress us about a trifle. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(523)</sup></span> But we ought especially to beware lest the unity of faith be destroyed, or the bond of charity broken, on account of outward ceremonies. Almost all labor under the disease of attaching undue importance to the ceremonies and <i>elements of the world,</i> as Paul calls them, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:3">Galatians 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+2:8">Colossians 2:8</span>;) and accordingly they do not hesitate, for the most part, to prefer the merest rudiments to the highest perfection. This is followed by another evil arising out of fastidiousness and pride, when every man would willingly compel the whole world to copy his example. If any thing pleases us, we forthwith desire to make it a law, that others may live according to our pleasure. </p>
<p>When we read that <i>the disciples of John</i> were caught by these snares of Satan, let us first learn not to place holiness in outward and indifferent matters, and at the same time to restrain ourselves by moderation and equity, that we may not desire to restrict others to what we approve, but may allow every one to retain his freedom. As to <i>fasting</i> and <i>prayers,</i> it ought to be understood, that <i>John</i> gave his <i>disciples</i> a particular training, and that for this purpose they had stated days for <i>fastings,</i> a settled form, and fixed hours of prayer. Now, I reckon those <i>prayers</i> among outward observances. For, though calling on God holds the first rank in spiritual worship, yet that method of doing it was adapted to the unskilfulness of men, and is justly reckoned among ceremonies and indifferent matters, the observance of which ought not to be too strictly enjoined. Of the reason why John’s discipline was more severe than that of Christ we have already spoken, and a more convenient opportunity for treating of it will again occur. </p>
