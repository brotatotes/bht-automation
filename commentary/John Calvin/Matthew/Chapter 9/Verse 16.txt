<p><b>16.</b><i>And no man putteth a piece of fresh cloth.</i> He supports the preceding statement by two comparisons, one of which is taken from <i>garments,</i> and the other from vessels of <i>wine</i> Those who think that he compares worn-out garments and decayed bottles to the Pharisees, and new wine and fresh cloth to the doctrine of the gospel, have no probability on their side. The comparison is beautifully adapted to the matter in hand, if we explain it as referring to the weak and tender disciples of Christ, and to a discipline more strict than they were able to bear. Nor is it of any consequence that the idea of being <i>old</i> does not agree with scholars who were only commencing: for, when Christ compares his disciples to <i>old bottles</i> and <i>torn garments,</i> he does not mean that they were wasted by long use, but that they were weak and wanted strength. The amount of the statement is, that all must not be compelled indiscriminately to live in the same manner, for there is a diversity of natural character, and all things are not suitable to all; and particularly, we ought to spare the weak, that they may not be broken by violence, or crushed by the weight of the burden. Our Lord speaks according to the custom of the country, when he uses the word <i>bottles</i> instead of <i>tuns</i> or <i>casks</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(525)</sup></span> </p>
