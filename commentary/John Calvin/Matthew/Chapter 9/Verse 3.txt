<p><b>3.</b><i>And, lo, some of the scribes</i> They accuse Christ of blasphemy and sacrilege, because he claims for himself what is God’s prerogative. The other two Evangelists tell us also that they said, <i>Who can forgive sins but God alone? It</i> is beyond all question, that their eagerness to slander drove them to this wicked conclusion. If they think that there is any thing which deserves blame, why do they not inquire into it? <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(510)</sup></span> Besides, as the expression admits of more than one meaning, and as Christ said nothing more than what the Prophets frequently say when they announce the grace of God, why do they take in a bad sense what admits of a favorable interpretation? They must have been already poisoned by malice and envy, otherwise they would not so eagerly have seized an occasion of blaming Christ. They remain silent, but <i>think in their hearts,</i> that they may slander him when absent among people of their own class. It is no doubt true, that God alone has power and <i>authority to forgive sins:</i> but they are wrong in concluding that it does not belong to Christ, for he is <i>God manifested in the flesh,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>.) They had a right to inquire on what grounds Christ laid claim to such <i>authority:</i> but, without any inquiry, they suppose him to be one of the common rank of men, and proceed rashly to condemn him. </p>
