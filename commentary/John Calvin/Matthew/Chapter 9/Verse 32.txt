<p><b>32.</b><i>They brought to him a dumb man</i> It is probable that this man was not naturally <i>dumb,</i> but that, after he had been given up to the devil, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(531)</sup></span> he was deprived of the use of speech: for all <i>dumb</i> persons are not <i>demoniacs</i> He was afflicted in such a manner as to make it evident, by visible signs, that his tongue was held bound by a wicked spirit. The exclamation of the multitudes, on his being cured, that <i>nothing like it had ever been seen in Israel,</i> appears to be hyperbolica1: <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(532)</sup></span> for God had formerly revealed his glory among that people by greater miracles. But perhaps they look to the design of the miracle, as the minds of all were at that time prepared to expect the coming of the Messiah. They intended, no doubt, to exalt this instance of the grace of God, without detracting any thing from what had formerly happened. Besides, it ought to be observed, that this was not a premeditated statement, but a sudden burst of admiration. </p>
