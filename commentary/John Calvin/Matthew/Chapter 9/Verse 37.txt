<p><b>37.</b><i>The harvest is indeed abundant</i> By this metaphor he intimates, that many of the people are ripe for receiving the gospel. Though the greater number afterwards rejected basely and with vile ingratitude the salvation offered to them, yet the limited number of the elect, who were mixed with unbelievers, is compared to an <i>abundant harvest,</i> because God values a small band of his own people more highly than the rest of the world. Though there were at that time many who assumed this character, yet as few of them discharged it faithfully, he does not rank them among <i>laborers:</i> for he employs the word <i>laborers</i> in a good sense. When Paul complains (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:13">2 Corinthians 2:13</span>) of bad <i>laborers,</i> he refers to their boasting: for he would not have bestowed the designation of <i>laborers</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(534)</sup></span> on those who devoted all their exertions to ruin and waste the flock, had it not been that they gloried in the false pretense. </p>
