<p><b>4.</b><i>And when Jesus saw their thoughts</i> He now gives a proof of his Divinity in bringing to light their secret thoughts: <i>for who knoweth the things of a man but the spirit of man which is in him?</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:11">1 Corinthians 2:11</span>.) And so Mark adds, that <i>Jesus knew by his Spirit:</i> which means, that what was concealed in their hearts could not be perceived by man, but that Christ by his Divine Spirit knew it thoroughly. <i>Why do you think evil?</i> This does not imply that it gave them pain to see a mortal man assuming what God claims as his own prerogative, but that they proudly and wickedly rejected God, who was openly manifested to them. </p>
