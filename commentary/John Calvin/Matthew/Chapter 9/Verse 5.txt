<p><b>5.</b><i>Whether is it easier to say?</i> The meaning is, that, as it is not easier to quicken by a word a body which is nearly dead than to forgive <i>sins,</i> there is no reason to wonder that he <i>forgives sins,</i> when he has accomplished the other. The argument which our Lord uses may appear to be not well-founded: for, in proportion as the soul is more excellent than the body, the forgiveness of sins is a greater work than the healing of the body. But the reply is easy. Christ adapts his discourse to their capacity: for, being carnal, they were more powerfully affected by outward signs, than by all the spiritual power of Christ, which related to eternal salvation. Thus he proves the efficacy of the Gospel for quickening men from the fact, that at the last day he will raise the dead by his voice out of their graves. </p>
<p>Wonder not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all who are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth, <br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:28">John 5:28</span>.) </p>
<p>This was a sufficiently powerful argument to refute those who reckoned a visible miracle of more importance than all things else. They could not say that he had no right to <i>forgive the sins</i> of the paralytic, when he restored to him health and rigour: for this was a result which followed from the forgiveness of sins. </p>
