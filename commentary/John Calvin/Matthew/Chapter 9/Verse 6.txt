<p><b>6.</b><i>That the Son of man hath authority on earth.</i> This <i>authority</i> is very different from what was given to the apostles, and from what is now exercised by the pastors of the Church: for they cannot so properly be said to <i>pardon sins,</i> as to declare that they are pardoned, when they deliver the commission which is entrusted to them. By these words Christ declares that he is not only the minister and witness, but likewise the author, of this grace. But what means this restriction, <i>on earth?</i> Of what avail will it be to us to have obtained pardon here, if it be not ratified in heaven? Christâ€™s meaning was, that forgiveness of sins ought not to be sought from a distance: for he exhibits it to men in his own person, and as it were in his hands. So strong is our inclination to distrust, that we never venture to believe that God is merciful to us, till he draws near, and speaks familiarly to us. Now, as Christ descended to earth for the purpose of exhibiting to men the <i>grace</i> of God as present, he is said to <i>forgive sins</i> visibly, because in him and by him the will of God was revealed which, according to the perception of the flesh, had been formerly hidden above the clouds. </p>
