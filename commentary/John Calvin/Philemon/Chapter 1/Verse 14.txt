<p><b>14.</b><i>That thy benefit might not be by constraint</i>. This is drawn from the general rule, that no sacrifices are acceptable to God but those which are freely offered. Paul speaks of almsgiving in the same manner. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:7">2 Corinthians 9:7</span>.)<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Τό ἀγαθον</span></blu></grk> is here put for “acts of kindness,” and willingness is contrasted with constraint, when there is no other opportunity of putting to the test a generous and cheerful act of the will; for that duty which is generously performed, and not through influence exercised by others, is alone entitled to full praise. It is also worthy of observation, that Paul, while he acknowledges that Onesimus was to blame in past time, affirms that he is changed; and lest Philemon should have any doubt that his slave returns to him with a new disposition and different conduct, Paul says that he has made full trial of his repentance by personal knowledge. </p>
