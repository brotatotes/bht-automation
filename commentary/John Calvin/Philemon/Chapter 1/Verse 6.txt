<p><b>6.</b><i>That the communication of thy faith may be effectual</i>. This clause is somewhat obscure; but I shall endeavor to elucidate it in such a manner that my readers may somewhat understand Paul’s meaning. First, it ought to be known that the Apostle is not continuing to give the praise of Philemon, but that, on the contrary, he expresses those blessings for which he prays to God. These words are connected with what he had formerly said, that he “makes mention of him in his prayers.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="+1:4"> 1:4</span>.) What blessing then did he ask for Philemon? That his faith, exercising itself by good works, might be proved to be true, and not unprofitable. He calls it “the communication of faith,” because it does not remain inactive and concealed within, but is manifested to men by actual effects. Although faith has a hidden residence in the heart, yet it communicates itself to men by good works. It is, therefore, as if he had said, “That thy faith, by communicating itself, may demonstrate its efficacy in every good thing.” </p>
<p><i>The knowledge of every good thing</i> denotes experience. He wishes that, by its effects, faith may be proved to be effectual. This takes place, when the men with whom we converse know our godly and holy life; and therefore, he says, <i>of every good thing which is in you</i>; for everything in us that is good makes known our faith. </p>
<p><i>Towards Christ Jesus.</i> The phrase<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἰς Χριστόν</span></blu></grk> may be explained to mean “through Christ.” But, for my own part, if I were at liberty, I would rather translate it as equivalent to<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐν Χριστῶ,</span></blu></grk> “in Christ;” for the gifts of God dwell in us in such a manner, that nevertheless, we are partakers of them only so far as we are members of Christ. Yet because the words <i>in you</i> go before, I am afraid that the harshness of the expression would give offense. Accordingly, I have not ventured to make any alteration in the words, but only wished to mention it to my readers, that, after full consideration, they may choose either of those meanings which they prefer. </p>
