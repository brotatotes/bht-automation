<p><b>13</b><i>So that my bonds</i> He employs the expression — <i>in Christ</i>, to mean, in the <i>affairs,</i> or in the <i>cause</i> of Christ, for he intimates that his bonds had become illustrious, so as to promote the honor of Christ. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(55)</sup></span> The rendering given by some — <i>through Christ</i>, seems forced. I have also employed the word <blu><i>illustria</i></blu> <i>(illustrious)</i> in preference to <blu><i>manifesta</i></blu> , <i>(manifest,)</i> — as having ennobled the gospel by their fame. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(56)</sup></span> “Satan, indeed, has attempted it, and the wicked have thought that it would turn out so, that the gospel would be destroyed; but God has frustrated both the attempts of the former and the expectations of the latter, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(57)</sup></span> and that in two ways, for while the gospel was previously obscure and unknown, it has come to be well known, and not only so, but has even been rendered honorable in the <blu><i>Praetorium</i></blu> , no less than in the rest of the city.” By the <blu><i>praetorium</i></blu> I understand the hall and palace of Nero, which Fabius <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(58)</sup></span> and writers of that age call <blu><i>Augustale</i></blu> , (<i>the Augustal.</i>) For as the name <blu>praetor</blu> was at first a general term, and denoted all magistrates who held the chief sway, (hence it came that the dictator was called the sovereign praetor, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(59)</sup></span>) it, consequently, became customary to employ the term <blu><i>praetorium</i></blu> in war to mean the tent, either of the consul, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(60)</sup></span> or of the person who <i>presided</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(61)</sup></span> while in the city it denoted the palace of Caesar, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(62)</sup></span> from the time that the Cesars took possession of the monarchy. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(63)</sup></span> Independently of this, the bench of praetor is also called the <blu><i>praetorium</i></blu> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(64)</sup></span> </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(58)</span> Our author has most probably in view an expression which occurs in the writings of <i>Quinctilian</i>, (Instit. Orator., lib. 8, 2, 8,) — “<blu>tabernaculum ducis Augustale</blu>;” — (“a general’s tent is called the Augustal.”) In the best editions of Quinctilian, however, the reading of <blu><i>Augurale</i></blu> , as synonymous with <blu><i>auguraculum</i></blu> , or <blu><i>auguratorium</i></blu> ; — (<i>an apartment for the augur’s taking omens.</i>) — <i>Ed.</i> </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(61)</span> “<blu><i>Praeibat</i></blu> ” — There is manifestly an allusion here to the etymology of praetor, as being derived from <i>praeire</i>, to <i>go before</i>, or <i>preside</i>. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(62)</span> “At Rome it “(the term <blu><i>praetorium</i></blu> )” signified the public hall where causes were tried by the praetor; but more usually it denoted the camp or quarters of the praetorian cohorts without the city..... The name of <blu><i>praetorium</i></blu> was, in the provinces, given to the palace of the governors, both because they administered justice, and had their guards stationed in their residence. Hence it is inferred that, although the Apostle was at Rome when he wrote this, and although the circumstances to which he refers occurred in that city, yet, writing to persons residing in the provinces, he uses the word <i>praetorium</i> in the provincial sense, and means by it the <i>emperor’s palace</i>. ” — <i>Illustrated Commentary</i>. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(63)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Depuis que les empereurs usurperent la monarchie</span></blu>;” — “From the time that the emperors usurped the monarchy.” </p>
