<p><b>3</b><i>I give thanks</i>. He begins with thanksgiving <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(31)</sup></span> on two accounts — <i>first</i>, that he may by this token shew his love to the Philippians; and secondly, that, by commending them as to the past, he may exhort them, also, to perseverance in time to come. He adduces, also, another evidence of his love — the anxiety which he exercised in supplications. It is to be observed, however, that, whenever he makes mention of things that are joyful, he immediately breaks forth into thanksgiving — a practice with which we ought also to be familiar. We must, also, take notice, what things they are for which he gives thanks to God, — the fellowship of the Philippians in the gospel of Christ; for it follows from this, that it ought to be ascribed to the grace of God. When he says, <i>upon every remembrance of you</i>, he means, “As often as I remember you.” </p>
