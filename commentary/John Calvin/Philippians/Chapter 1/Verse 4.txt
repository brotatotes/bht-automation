<p><b>4</b><i>Always in every prayer</i>. Connect the words in this manner: “<i>Always presenting prayer for you all in every prayer of mine.</i> ” For as he had said before, that the remembrance of them was an occasion of joy to him, so he now subjoins, that they come into his mind as often as he prays. He afterwards adds, that it is <i>with joy</i> that he presents prayer in their behalf. <i>Joy</i> refers to the past; <i>prayer</i> to the future. For he rejoiced in their auspicious beginnings, and was desirous of their perfection. Thus it becomes us always to rejoice in the blessings received from God in such a manner, as to remember to ask from him those things that we are still in need of. </p>
