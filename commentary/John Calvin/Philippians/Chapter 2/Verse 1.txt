<p><b>1</b><i>If there is therefore any consolation</i>. There is an extraordinary tenderness in this exhortation, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(93)</sup></span> in which he entreats by all means the Philippians mutually to cherish harmony among themselves, lest, in the event of their being torn asunder by intestine contentions, they should expose themselves to the impostures of the false apostles. For when there are disagreements, there is invariably a door opened for Satan to disseminate impious doctrines, while agreement is the best bulwark for repelling them. </p>
<p>As the term <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">παρακλήσεως</span></blu></grk> is often taken to mean <i>exhortation</i>, the commencement of the passage might be explained in this manner: “If an exhortation which is delivered in the name and by the authority of Christ, has any weight with you.” The other meaning, however, corresponds better with the context: “If there is among you <i>any consolation of Christ</i>, ” by means of which you may alleviate my griefs, and if you would afford me <i>any consolation</i> and relief, which you assuredly owe me in the exercise of love; if you take into view that <i>fellowship of the Spirit</i>, which ought to make us all one; if any feeling of humanity and mercy resides in you, which might stir you up to alleviate my miseries, <i>fulfill ye my joy</i>, <i>etc.</i> From this we may infer, how great a blessing unity in the Church is, and with what eagerness pastors should endeavor to secure it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(94)</sup></span> We must also at the same time take notice, how he humbles himself by beseechingly imploring their pity, while he might have availed himself of his paternal authority, so as to demand respect from them as his sons. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(95)</sup></span> He knew how to exercise authority when it was necessary, but at present he prefers to use entreaties, because he knew that these would be better fitted to gain an entrance into their affections, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(96)</sup></span> and because he was aware that he had to do with persons who were docile and compliant. In this manner the pastor must have no hesitation to assume different aspects for the sake of the Church. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(97)</sup></span> </p>
