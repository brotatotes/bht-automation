<p><b>13</b><i>It is God that worketh</i>. This is the true engine for bringing down all haughtiness — this the sword for putting an end to all pride, when we are taught that we are utterly nothing, and can do nothing, except through the grace of God alone. I mean supernatural grace, which comes forth from the spirit of regeneration. For, considered as men, we already <i>are, and live and move in God.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:28">Acts 17:28</span>.) But Paul reasons here as to a kind of <i>movement</i> different from that universal one. Let us now observe how much he ascribes to God, and how much he leaves to us. </p>
<p>There are, in any action, two principal departments — the inclination, and the power to carry it into effect. Both of these he ascribes wholly to God; what more remains to us as a ground of glorying? Nor is there any reason to doubt that this division has the same force as if Paul had expressed the whole in a single word; for the inclination is the groundwork; the accomplishment of it is the summit of the building brought to a completion. He has also expressed much more than if he had said that God is the Author of the beginning and of the end. For in that case sophists would have alleged, by way of cavil, that something between the two was left to men. But as it is, what will they find that is in any degree peculiar to us? They toil hard in their schools to reconcile with the grace of God free-will — of such a nature, I mean, as they conceive of — which might be capable of turning itself by its own movement, and might have a peculiar and separate power, by which it might co-operate with the grace of God. I do not dispute as to the name, but as to the thing itself. In order, therefore, that free-will may harmonize with grace, they divide in such a manner, that God restores in us a free choice, that we may have it in our power to <i>will</i> aright. Thus they acknowledge to have received from God the power of willing aright, but assign to man a good inclination. Paul, however, declares this to be a work of God, without any reservation. For he does not say that our hearts are simply turned or stirred up, or that the infirmity of a good will is helped, but that a good inclination is wholly the work of God. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(119)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Now, in the calumny brought forward by them against us — that we make men to be like stones, when we teach that they have nothing good, except from pure grace, they act a shameless part. For we acknowledge that we have from nature an inclination, but as it is depraved through the corruption of sin, it begins to be good only when it has been renewed by God. Nor do we say that a man does anything good without willing it, but that it is only when his inclination is regulated by the Spirit of God. Hence, in so far as concerns this department, we see that the entire praise is ascribed to God, and that what sophists teach us is frivolous — that grace is offered to us, and placed, as it were, in the midst of us, that we may embrace it if we choose; for if God did not work in us efficaciously, he could not be said to produce in us a good inclination. As to the second department, we must entertain the same view. “God,” says he, “is <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">̔Ο ἐνεργῶν το ἐνεργεῖν</span></blu></grk> <i>he that worketh in us to do.</i> ” He brings, therefore, to perfection those pious dispositions which he has implanted in us, that they may not be unproductive, as he promises by Ezekiel, — </p>
<p>“I will cause them to walk in my commandments.”<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eze+11:20">Ezekiel 11:20</span>.) </p>
<p>From this we infer that perseverance, also, is his free gift. </p>
<p><i>According to his good pleasure.</i> Some explain this to mean — the good intention of the mind. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(120)</sup></span> I, on the other hand, take it rather as referring to God, and understand by it his benevolent disposition, which they commonly call <blu><i>beneplacitum</i></blu> , (<i>good pleasure</i>.) For the Greek word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εὐδοκία</span></blu></grk> is very frequently employed in this sense; and the context requires it. For Paul has it in view to ascribe everything to God, and to take everything from us. Accordingly, not satisfied with having assigned to God the production both of <i>willing</i> and of <i>doing</i> aright, he ascribes both to his unmerited mercy. By this means he shuts out the contrivance of the sophists as to <i>subsequent grace</i>, which they imagine to be the reward of merit. Hence he teaches, that the whole course of our life, if we live aright, is regulated by God, and that, too, from his unmerited goodness. </p>
<p><i>With fear and trembling</i>. From this Paul deduces an exhortation — that they must <i>with fear work out their own salvation</i>. He conjoins, as he is accustomed, <i>fear</i> and <i>trembling</i>, for the sake of greater intensity, to denote — serious and anxious fear. He, accordingly, represses drowsiness as well as confidence. By the term <i>work</i> he reproves our indolence, which is always ingenious in seeking advantages. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(121)</sup></span> Now it seems as if it had in the grace of God a sweet occasion of repose; for if He <i>worketh in us</i>, why should we not indulge ourselves at our ease? The Holy Spirit, however, calls us to consider, that he wishes to work upon living organs, but he immediately represses arrogance by recommending <i>fear</i> and <i>trembling</i> </p>
<p>The inference, also, is to be carefully observed: “You have,” says he, “all things from God; therefore be solicitous and humble.” For there is nothing that ought to train us more to modesty and fear, than our being taught, that it is by the grace of God alone that we stand, and will instantly fall down, if he even in the slightest degree withdraw his hand. Confidence in ourselves produces carelessness and arrogance. We know from experience, that all who confide in their own strength, grow insolent through presumption, and at the same time, devoid of care, resign themselves to sleep. The remedy for both evils is, when, distrusting ourselves, we depend entirely on God alone. And assuredly, that man has made decided progress in the knowledge, both of the grace of God, and of his own weakness, who, aroused from carelessness, diligently seeks <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(122)</sup></span> God’s help; while those that are puffed up with confidence in their own strength, must necessarily be at the same time in a state of intoxicated security. Hence it is a shameless calumny that Papists bring against us, — that in extolling the grace of God, and putting down free-will, we make men indolent, shake off the fear of God, and destroy all feeling of concern. It is obvious, however, to every reader, that Paul finds matter of exhortation here — not in the doctrine of Papists, but in what is held by us. “God,” says he, “<i>works all things in us;</i> therefore submit to him with <i>fear</i>. ” I do not, indeed, deny that there are many who, on being told that there is in us nothing that is good, indulge themselves the more freely in their vices; but I deny that this is the fault of the doctrine, which, on the contrary, when received as it ought to be, produces in our hearts a feeling of concern. </p>
<p>Papists, however, pervert this passage so as to shake the assurance of faith, for the man that trembles <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(123)</sup></span> is in uncertainty. They, accordingly, understand Paul’s words as if they meant that we ought, during our whole life, to waver as to assurance of salvation. If, however, we would not have Paul contradict himself, he does not by any means exhort us to hesitation, inasmuch as he everywhere recommends confidence and (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πληροφορίαν</span></blu></grk>) <i>full assurance</i>. The solution, however, is easy, if any one is desirous of attaining the true meaning without any spirit of contention. There are two kinds of fear; the one produces anxiety along with humility; the other hesitation. The <i>former</i> is opposed to fleshly confidence and carelessness, equally as to arrogance; the latter, to assurance of faith. Farther, we must take notice, that, as believers repose with assurance upon the grace of God, so, when they direct their views to their own frailty, they do not by any means resign themselves carelessly to sleep, but are by <i>fear</i> of dangers stirred up to prayer. Yet, so far is this <i>fear</i> from disturbing tranquillity of conscience, and shaking confidence, that it rather confirms it. For distrust of ourselves leads us to lean more confidently upon the mercy of God. And this is what Paul’s words import, for he requires nothing from the Philippians, but that they submit themselves to God with true self-renunciation. </p>
<p><i>Work out your own salvation</i>. As Pelagians of old, so Papists at this day make a proud boast of this passage, with the view of extolling man’s excellence. Nay more, when the preceding statement is mentioned to them by way of objection, <i>It is God that worketh in us, etc.</i>, they immediately by this shield ward it off (so to speak) — <i>Work out your own salvation</i>. Inasmuch, then, as the work is ascribed to God and man in common, they assign the half to each. In short, from the word <i>work</i> they derive free-will; from the term <i>salvation</i> they derive the merit of eternal life. I answer, that <i>salvation</i> is taken to mean the entire course of our calling, and that this term includes all things, by which God accomplishes that perfection, to which he has predestinated us by his gracious choice. This no one will deny, that is not obstinate and impudent. We are said to perfect it, when, under the regulation of the Spirit, we aspire after a life of blessedness. It is God that calls us, and offers to us salvation; it is our part to embrace by faith what he gives, and by obedience act suitably to his calling; but we have neither from ourselves. Hence we act only when he has prepared us for acting. </p>
<p>The word which he employs properly signifies — to continue until the end; but we must keep in mind what I have said, that Paul does not reason here as to how far our ability extends, but simply teaches that God acts in us in such a manner, that he, at the same time, does not allow us to be inactive, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(124)</sup></span> but exercises us diligently, after having stirred us up by a secret influence. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(125)</sup></span> </p>
