For he has formerly taught them that death would be <i>gain</i> to himself, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="php+1:21">Philippians 1:21</span>;) here, on the other hand, he is chiefly concerned that his death may not disconcert the Philippians. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(143)</sup></span> He, accordingly, declares that it is no ground of sorrow; nay, that they have occasion of joy, inasmuch as they will find it to be productive of advantage. For, although it was in itself a serious loss to be deprived of such a teacher, it was no slight compensation that the gospel was confirmed by his blood. In the mean time, he lets them know that to himself personally death would be matter of joy. The rendering of Erasmus, taking it in the present tense, <i>Ye rejoice</i>, is altogether unsuitable. </p>
