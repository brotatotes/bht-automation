<p><b>22</b><i>But the proof</i>. It is literally, <i>ye know the proof of him</i>, unless you prefer to understand it in the imperative mood, <i>know ye</i>; (for there had scarcely been opportunity during that short time to make trial,) but this is not of great moment. What is chiefly to be noticed is, that he furnishes Timothy with an attestation of fidelity and modesty. In evidence of his fidelity, he declares, that he had <i>served with him in the gospel</i>, for such a connection was a token of true sincerity. In evidence of his modesty, he states, that he had <i>submitted to him as to a father</i>. It is not to be wondered, that this virtue is expressly commended by Paul, for it has in all ages been rare. At the present day, where will you find one among the young that will give way to his seniors, even in the smallest thing? to such an extent does impertinence triumph and prevail in the present age! In this passage, as in many others, we see how diligently Paul makes it his aim to put honor upon pious ministers, and that not so much for their own sakes, as on the ground of its being for the advantage of the whole Church, that such persons should be loved and honored, and possess the highest authority. </p>
