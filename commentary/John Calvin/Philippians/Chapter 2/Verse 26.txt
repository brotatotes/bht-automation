<p><b>26.</b><i>He longed after you</i>. It is a sign of a true pastor, that while he was at a great distance, and was willingly detained by a pious engagement, he was nevertheless affected with concern for his flock, and a longing after them; and on learning that his sheep were distressed on his account, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(154)</sup></span> he was concerned as to their grief. On the other hand, the anxiety of the Philippians for their pastor is here discovered. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(154)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Pour l’amour de luy</span></blu>;” — “From love to him.” </p>
