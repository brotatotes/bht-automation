<p><b>7</b><i>Emptied himself.</i> This <i>emptying</i> is the same as the abasement, as to which we shall see afterwards. The expression, however, is used, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ευμφατικωτέρως</span></blu></grk>, (<i>more emphatically</i>,) to mean, — being brought to nothing. Christ, indeed, could not divest himself of Godhead; but he kept it concealed for a time, that it might not be seen, under the weakness of the flesh. Hence he laid aside his glory in the view of men, not by lessening it, but by concealing it. </p>
<p>It is asked, whether he did this as man? Erasmus answers in the affirmative. But where was the <i>form of God</i> before he became man? Hence we must reply, that Paul speaks of Christ wholly, as he was <i>God manifested in the flesh</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>;) but, nevertheless, this <i>emptying</i> is applicable exclusive to his humanity, as if I should say of man, “Man being mortal, he is exceedingly senseless if he thinks of nothing but the world,” I refer indeed to man wholly; but at the same time I ascribe mortality only to a part of him, namely, to the body. As, then, Christ has one person, consisting of two natures, it is with propriety that Paul says, that he who was the Son of God, — in reality equal to God, did nevertheless lay aside his glory, when he in the flesh manifested himself in the appearance of a servant. </p>
<p>It is also asked, secondly, how he can be said to be <i>emptied</i>, while he, nevertheless, invariably proved himself, by miracles and excellences, to be the Son of God, and in whom, as John testifies, there was always to be seen a glory worthy of the Son of God? (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>.) I answer, that the abasement of the flesh was, notwithstanding, like a vail, by which his divine majesty was concealed. On this account he did not wish that his transfiguration should be made public until after his resurrection; and when he perceives that the hour of his death is approaching, he then says, <i>Father, glorify thy Son</i>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span>.) Hence, too, Paul teaches elsewhere, that he was <i>declared to be the Son of God</i> by means of his resurrection. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>.) He also declares in another place, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:4">2 Corinthians 13:4</span>,) that he <i>suffered through the weakness of the flesh</i>. In fine, the image of God shone forth in Christ in such a manner, that he was, at the same time, abased in his outward appearance, and brought down to nothing in the estimation of men; for he carried about with him <i>the form of a servant</i>, and had assumed our nature, expressly with the view of his being a servant of the Father, nay, even of men. Paul, too, calls him the <i>Minister of the Circumcision</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:8">Romans 15:8</span>;) and he himself testifies of himself, that he <i>came to minister</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>;) and that same thing had long before been foretold by Isaiah — <i>Behold my servant</i>, etc. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(108)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>In the likeness of men</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Γενόμενος</span></blu></grk> is equivalent here to <blu><i>constitutus</i></blu> — (<i>having been appointed.</i>) For Paul means that he had been brought down to the level of mankind, so that there was in appearance nothing that differed from the common condition of mankind. The Marcionites perverted this declaration for the purpose of establishing the phantasm of which they dreamed. They can, however, be refuted without any great difficulty, inasmuch as Paul is treating here simply of the manner in which Christ manifested himself, and the condition with which he was conversant when in the world. Let one be truly man, he will nevertheless be reckoned unlike others, if he conducts himself as if he were exempt from the condition of others. Paul declares that it was not so as to Christ, but that he lived in such a manner, that he seemed as though he were on a level with mankind, and yet he was very different from a mere man, although he was truly man. The Marcionites therefore shewed excessive childishness, in drawing an argument from similarity of condition for the purpose of denying reality of nature. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(109)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>Found</i> means here, <i>known</i> or <i>seen</i>. For he treats, as has been observed, of estimation. In other words, as he had affirmed previously that he was truly God, the equal of the Father, so he here states, that he was reckoned, as it were, abject, and in the common condition of mankind. We must always keep in view what I said a little ago, that such abasement was voluntary. </p>
