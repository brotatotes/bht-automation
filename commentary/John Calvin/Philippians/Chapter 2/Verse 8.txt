Even this was great humility — that from being Lord he became a servant; but he says that he went farther than this, because, while he was not only immortal, but the Lord of life and death, he nevertheless became obedient to his Father, even so far as to endure death. This was extreme abasement, especially when we take into view the kind of death, which he immediately adds, with the view of enhancing it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(110)</sup></span> For by dying in this manner he was not only covered with ignominy in the sight of God, but was also accursed in the sight of God.
