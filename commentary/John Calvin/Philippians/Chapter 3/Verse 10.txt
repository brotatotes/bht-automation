<p><b>10</b><i>That I may know him</i> He points out the efficacy and nature of faith — that it is the knowledge of Christ, and that, too, not bare or indistinct, but in such a manner that the power of his resurrection is felt. <i>Resurrection</i> he employs as meaning, the completion of redemption, so that it comprehends in it at the same time the idea of death. But as it is not enough to know Christ as crucified and raised up from the dead, unless you experience, also, the fruit of this, he speaks expressly of efficacy. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(188)</sup></span> Christ therefore is rightly known, when we feel how powerful his death and resurrection are, and how efficacious they are in us. Now all things are there furnished to us — expiation and destruction of sin, freedom from condemnation, satisfaction, victory over death, the attainment of righteousness, and the hope of a blessed immortality. </p>
<p><i>And the fellowship of his sufferings</i> Having spoken of that freely-conferred righteousness, which was procured for us through the resurrection of Christ, and is obtained by us through faith, he proceeds to treat of the exercises of the pious, and that in order that it might not seem as though he introduced an inactive faith, which produces no effects in the life. He also intimates, indirectly, that these are the exercises in which the Lord would have his people employ themselves; while the false Apostles pressed forward upon them the useless elements of ceremonies. Let every one, therefore, who has become through faith a partaker of all Christ’s benefits, acknowledge that a condition is presented to him — that his whole life be conformed to his death. </p>
<p>There is, however, a twofold participation and fellowship in the death of Christ. The <i>one</i> is inward — what the Scripture is wont to term the <i>mortification of the flesh,</i> or the <i>crucifixion of the old man,</i> of which Paul treats in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:0">Romans 6:0</span>; the <i>other</i> is outward — what is termed the <i>mortification of the outward man.</i> It is the endurance of the Cross, of which he treats in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:0">Romans 8:0</span> of the same Epistle, and here also, if I do not mistake. For after introducing along with this the <i>power of his resurrection,</i> Christ crucified is set before us, that we may follow him through tribulations and distresses; and hence the resurrection of the dead is expressly made mention of, that we may know that we must die before we live. This is a continued subject of meditation to believers so long as they sojourn in this world. </p>
<p>This, however, is a choice consolation, that in all our miseries we are partakers of Christ’s Cross, if we are his members; so that through afflictions the way is opened up for us to everlasting blessedness, as we read elsewhere, </p>
<p>If we die with him, we shall also live with him; if we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:11">2 Timothy 2:11</span>,) </p>
<p>We must all therefore be prepared for this — that our whole life shall represent nothing else than the image of death, until it produce death itself, as the life of Christ is nothing else than a prelude of death. We enjoy, however, in the mean time, this consolation — that the end is everlasting blessedness. For the death of Christ is connected with the resurrection. Hence Paul says, that he is conformed to his death, that he may attain the glory of the resurrection. The phrase, <i>if by any means,</i> does not indicate doubt, but expresses difficulty, with a view to stimulate our earnest endeavor <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(189)</sup></span> for it is no light contest, inasmuch as we must struggle against so many and so serious hinderances. </p>
