As, however, profligates of this description, by means of show and various artifices, frequently dazzle the eyes of the simple for a time, in such a manner that they are preferred even to the most eminent servants of Christ, the Apostle declares, with great confidence <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(199)</sup></span>, that the glory with which they are now puffed up will be exchanged for ignominy. </p>
<p><i>Whose god is the belly</i> As they pressed the observance of circumcision and other ceremonies, he says that they did not do so from zeal for the law, but with a view to the favor of men, and that they might live peacefully and free from annoyance.
