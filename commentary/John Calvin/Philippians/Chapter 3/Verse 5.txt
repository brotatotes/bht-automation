<p><b>5.</b><i>Circumcised on the eighth day</i> It is literally— “The <i>circumcision of the eighth day.”</i> There is no difference, however, in the sense, for the meaning is, that he was circumcised in the proper manner, and according to the appointment of the law <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(173)</sup></span>. Now this customary circumcision was reckoned of superior value; and, besides, it was a token of the race to which he belonged; on which he touches immediately afterwards. For the case was not the same as to foreigners, for after they had become <i>proselytes</i> they were circumcised in youth, or when grown up to manhood, and sometimes even in old age. He says, accordingly, that he is of the <i>race of Israel</i> He names the tribe <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(174)</sup></span>, — not, in my opinion, on the ground that the <i>tribe of Benjamin</i> had a superiorityof excellence above others, but for shewing more fully that he belonged to the race of Israel, as it was the custom that every one was numbered according to his particular tribe. With the same view he adds still farther, that he is an <i>Hebrew of the Hebrews</i> For this name was the most ancient, as being that by which Abraham himself is designated by Moses. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:13">Genesis 14:13</span>.) <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(175)</sup></span> The sum, therefore, is this — that Paul was descended from the seed of Jacob from the most ancient date, so that he could reckon up grandfathers and great-grandfathers, and could even go still farther back. </p>
<p><i>According to the law, a Pharisee</i> Having spoken of the nobility of his descent, he now proceeds to speak of special endowments of persons, as they are called. It is very generally known, that the sect of the Pharisees was celebrated above the others for the renown in which it was held for sanctity and for doctrine. He states, that he belonged to that sect. The common opinion is, that the Pharisees were so called from a term signifying <i>separation</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(176)</sup></span> <i>;</i> but I approve rather of what I learned at one time from Capito, a man of sacred memory <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(177)</sup></span>, that it was because they boasted that they were endowed with the gift of <i>interpreting</i> Scripture, for <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">פרש</span></blu></heb> <i>(parash,)</i> among the Hebrews, conveys the idea of <i>interpretation.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(178)</sup></span> While others declared themselves to be <i>literals</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(179)</sup></span> <i>,</i> they preferred to be regarded as <i>Pharisees</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(180)</sup></span> <i>,</i> as being in possession of the interpretations of the ancients. And assuredly it is manifest that, under the pretext of antiquity, they corrupted the whole of Scripture by their inventions; but as they, at the same time, retained some sound interpretations, handed down by the ancients, they were held in the highest esteem. </p>
<p>But what is meant by the clause, <i>according to the law?</i> For unquestionably nothing is more opposed to the law of God than sects, for in it is communicated the truth of God, which is the bond of unity. Besides this, Josephus tells us in the 13th book of his Antiquities, that all the sects took their rise during the high priesthood of Jonathan. Paul employs the term <i>law,</i> not in its strict sense, to denote the doctrine of religion, however much corrupted it was at that time, as Christianity is at this day in the Papacy. As, however, there <i>were</i> many that were in the rank of teachers, who were less skillful, and exercised <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(181)</sup></span> he makes mention also of his <i>zeal.</i> It was, indeed, a very heinous sin on the part of Paul to <i>persecute the Church,</i> but as he had to dispute with unprincipled persons, who, by mixing up Christ with Moses, <i>pretended</i> zeal for the law, he mentions, on the other hand, that he was so keen a zealot of the law, that on that ground <i>he persecuted the Church</i> </p>
