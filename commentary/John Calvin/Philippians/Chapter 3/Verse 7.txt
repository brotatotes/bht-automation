<p><b>7.</b><i>What things were gain to me</i> He says, that those things were gain to him, for ignorance of Christ is the sole reason why we are puffed up with a vain confidence. Hence, where we see a false estimate of oneâ€™s own excellence, where we see arrogance, where we see pride, <i>there</i> let us be assured that Christ is not known. On the other hand, so soon as Christ shines forth all those things that formerly dazzled our eyes with a false splendor instantly vanish, or at least are disesteemed. Those things, accordingly, which had been <i>gain</i> to Paul when he was as yet blind, or rather had imposed upon him under an appearance of <i>gain,</i> he acknowledges to have been <i>loss</i> to him, when he has been enlightened. Why <i>loss?</i> Because they were hinderances in the way of his coming to Christ. What is more hurtful than anything that keeps us back from drawing near to Christ? Now he speaks chiefly of his own <i>righteousness,</i> for we are not received by Christ, except as naked and emptied of our own righteousness. Paul, accordingly, acknowledges that nothing was so injurious to him as his own righteousness, inasmuch as he was by means of it shut out from Christ. </p>
