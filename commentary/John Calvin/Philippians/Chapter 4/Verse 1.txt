<p><b>1.</b><i>Therefore, my brethren</i> He concludes his doctrine, as he is wont, with most urgent exhortations, that he may fix it the more firmly in the minds of men. He also insinuates himself into their affections by endearing appellations <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(208)</sup></span>, which at the same time are not dictated by flattery, but by sincere affection. He calls them his <i>joy</i> and <i>crown;</i> because, delighted to see those who had been gained over through his instrumentality persevering in the faith <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(209)</sup></span>, he hoped to attain that triumph, of which we have spoken <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(210)</sup></span>, when the Lord will reward with a <i>crown</i> those things which have been accomplished under his guidance. </p>
<p>When he bids them <i>so stand fast in the Lord,</i> he means that their condition is approved of by him. At the same time, the particle <i>so</i> might be taken as referring to the doctrine going before; but the former view is more suitable, so that, by praising their present condition, he exhorts them to perseverance. They had already, it is true, given some evidence of their constancy. Paul, however, well knowing human weakness, reckons that they have need of confirmation for the future. </p>
