<p><b>19</b><i>My God will supply</i> Some read <blu><i>impleat</i></blu> — in the <i>optative</i> — <i>May he supply.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(258)</sup></span> While I do not reject this reading, I approve more of the other. He expressly makes mention of God as <i>his,</i> because he owns and acknowledges as done to himself whatever kindness is shewn to his servants. They had therefore been truly sowing in the Lord’s field, from which a sure and abundant harvest might be expected. Nor does he promise them merely a reward in the future life, but even in respect of the necessities of the present life: <i>“</i> Do not think that you have impoverished yourselves; God, whom I serve, will abundantly furnish you with everything necessary for you.” The phrase, <i>in glory,</i> ought to be taken in place of the adverb <i>gloriously,</i> as meaning <i>magnificently,</i> or <i>splendidly.</i> He adds, however, <i>by Christ,</i> in whose name everything that we do is acceptable to God. </p>
