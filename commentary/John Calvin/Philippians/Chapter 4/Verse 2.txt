<p><b>2.</b><i>I exhort Euodias and Syntyche</i> It is an almost universally received opinion that Paul was desirous to settle a quarrel, I know not of what sort, between those two women. While I am not inclined to contend as to this, the words of Paul do not afford ground enough for such a conjecture to satisfy us that it really was so. It appears, from the testimony which he gives in their favor, that they were very excellent women; for he assigns to them so much honor as to call them fellow-soldiers in the gospel <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(211)</sup></span>. Hence, as their agreement was a matter of great moment <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(212)</sup></span>, and, on the other hand, there would be great danger attendant on their disagreement, he stirs them up particularly to concord. </p>
<p>We must take notice, however, that, whenever he speaks of agreement, he adds also the bond of it—<i>in the Lord.</i> For every combination will inevitably be accursed, if apart from the Lord, and, on the other hand, nothing is so disjoined, but that it ought to be reunited in Christ. </p>
