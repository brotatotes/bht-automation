It is also the more to be admired, in proportion as it is a rare thing for holiness to reign in the courts of sovereigns. The conjecture formed by some, that Seneca is here referred to among others, has no appearance of foundation; for he never gave any evidence, even the smallest, of his being a Christian; nor did he belong to the <i>household of Caesar,</i> but was a senator, and had at one time held the office of praetor. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(261)</sup></span> </p>

Clarke, “that <i>Seneca,</i> the preceptor of Nero, and the poet <i>Lucan</i>, were converted by St. Paul; and there are still extant, and in a MS. now before me, letters which profess to have passed between Paul and <i>Seneca;</i> but they are worthy of neither. They have been printed in some editions of <i>Seneca’s</i> works.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
