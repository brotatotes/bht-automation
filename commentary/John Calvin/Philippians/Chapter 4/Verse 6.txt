<p><b>6</b><i>But in all things</i> It is the singular number that is made use of by Paul, but is the neuter gender; the expression, therefore, is equivalent to <blu><i>omni negotio</i></blu> <i>, (in every matter,</i>) for (<i>prayer</i>) and (<i>supplication</i>) are feminine nouns. In these words he exhorts the Philippians, as David does all the pious in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+55:22">Psalms 55:22</span>, and Peter also in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:7">1 Peter 5:7</span>, to <i>cast all their care upon the Lord.</i> For we are not made of iron, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(234)</sup></span> so as not to be shaken by temptations. But this is our consolation, this is our solace — to deposit, or (to speak with greater propriety) to disburden in the bosom of God everything that harasses us. Confidence, it is true, brings tranquillity to our minds, but it is only in the event of our exercising ourselves in prayers. Whenever, therefore, we are assailed by any temptation, let us betake ourselves forthwith to prayer, as to a sacred asylum. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(235)</sup></span> </p>
<p>The term <i>requests</i> he employs here to denote desires or wishes. He would have us make these known to God by prayer and supplication, as though believers poured forth their hearts before God, when they commit themselves, and all that they have, to Him. Those, indeed, who look hither and thither to the vain comforts of the world, may appear to be in some degree relieved; but there is one sure refuge — leaning upon the Lord. </p>
<p><i>With thanksgiving</i> As many often pray to God amiss, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(236)</sup></span> full of complaints or of murmurings, as though they had just ground for accusing him, while others cannot brook delay, if he does not immediately gratify their desires, Paul on this account conjoins thanksgiving with prayers. It is as though he had said, that those things which are necessary for us ought to be desired by us from the Lord in such a way, that we, nevertheless, subject our affections to his good pleasure, and give thanks while presenting petitions. And, unquestionably, gratitude <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(237)</sup></span> will have this effect upon us — that the will of God will be the grand sum of our desires. </p>
