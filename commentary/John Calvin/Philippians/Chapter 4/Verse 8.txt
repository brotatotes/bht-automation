<p><b>8.</b><i>Finally</i> What follows consists of general exhortations which relate to the whole of life. In the <i>first</i> place, he commends <i>truth,</i> which is nothing else than the integrity of a good conscience, with the fruits of it: <i>secondly, gravity,</i> or <i>sanctity,</i> for <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὸ σεμνόν</span></blu></grk> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(240)</sup></span> denotes both — an excellence which consists in this, that we walk in a manner <i>worthy of our vocation,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>,) keeping at a distance from all profane filthiness: <i>thirdly, justice,</i> which has to do with the mutual intercourse of mankind — that we do not injure any one, that we do not defraud any one; and, <i>fourthly, purity,</i> which denotes chastity in every department of life. Paul, however, does not reckon all these things to be sufficient, if we do not at the same time endeavor to make ourselves agreeable to all, in so far as we may lawfully do so in the Lord, and have regard also to our good name. For it is in this way that I understand the words — </p>
<p>If any praise, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(241)</sup></span> that is, <i>anything praiseworthy</i>, for amidst such a corruption of manners there is so great a perversity in men’s judgments that praise is often bestowed <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(242)</sup></span> upon what is blameworthy, and it is not allowable for Christians to be desirous even of true praise among men, inasmuch as they are elsewhere forbidden to glory, except in God alone. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:31">1 Corinthians 1:31</span>.) Paul, therefore, does not bid them try to gain applause or commendation by virtuous actions, nor even to regulate their life according to the judgments of the people, but simply means, that they should devote themselves to the performance of good works, which merit commendation, that the wicked, and those who are enemies of the gospel, while they deride Christians and cast reproach upon them, may, nevertheless, be constrained to commend their deportment. </p>
<p>The word, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">προσφιλὢ καὶ εὔφημα</span></blu></grk> however, among the Greeks, is employed, like <blu><i>cogitare</i></blu> among the Latins, to mean, meditate. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(243)</sup></span> Now meditation comes first, afterwards follows action. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(240)</span> The word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">σεμνὸν</span></blu></grk> means that which has <i>dignity</i> connected with it. Hence <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">σεμνὸς</span></blu></grk> and <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">μεγαλοπρεπη</span></blu></grk>; are joined together by <i>Aristotle,</i> as quoted by <i>Wetstein,</i> and in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ma+8:15">2 Maccabees 8:15</span>.” — <i>Storr.</i> See <i>Biblical Cabinet,</i> vol. 40, p. 178, <i>note;</i> — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
