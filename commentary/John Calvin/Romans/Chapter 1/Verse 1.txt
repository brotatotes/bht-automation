<p><b>1.</b><i>Paul, etc.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(11)</sup></span> — With regard to the word Paul, as it is a subject of no such moment as ought to detain us, and as nothing can be said which has not been mentioned by other expounders, I should say nothing, were it not proper to satisfy some at small expense without being tedious to others; for the subject shall be despatched in a very few words. </p>
<p>They who think that the Apostle attained this name as a trophy for having brought Sergius, the proconsul, to the faith of Christ, are confuted by the testimony of Luke, who shows that he was so called before that time. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:7">Acts 13:7</span>.) Nor does it seem probable to me, that it was given him when he was converted to Christ; though this idea so pleased [<u>Augustine</u> ], that he took occasion refinedly to philosophize on the subject; for he says, that from a proud Saul he was made a very little (<blu><i>parvulum</i></blu> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(12)</sup></span>) disciple of Christ. More probable is the opinion of [<u>Origen</u> ], who thought that he had two names; for it is not unlikely to be true, that his name, Saul, derived from his kindred, was given him by his parents to indicate his religion and his descent; and that his other name, Paul, was added, to show his right to Roman citizenship; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(13)</sup></span> they would not have this honor, then highly valued, to be otherwise than made evident; but they did not so much value it as to withhold a proof of his Israelitic descent. But he has commonly taken the name Paul in his Epistles, and it may be for the following reasons: because in the churches to which he wrote, it was more known and more common, more acceptable in the Roman empire, and less known among his own nation. It was indeed his duty to avoid the foolish suspicion and hatred under which the name of a Jew then labored among the Romans and in their provinces, and to abstain from inflaming the rage of his own countrymen, and to take care of himself. </p>
<p><i>A servant of Jesus Christ, etc.</i> — He signalizes himself with these distinctions for the purpose of securing more authority to his doctrine; and this he seeks to secure by two things — first, by asserting his call to the Apostleship; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(14)</sup></span> and secondly, by showing that his call was not unconnected with the Church of Rome: for it was of great importance that he should be deemed an Apostle through God’s call, and that he should be known as one destined for the Roman Church. He therefore says, that he was a <i>servant</i> of Christ, and called to the office of an Apostle, thereby intimating that he had not presumptuously intruded into that office. He then adds, that he was <i>chosen</i>, (<blu>selectum</blu> — selected, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(15)</sup></span>) by which he more fully confirms the fact, that he was not one of the people, but a particular Apostle of the Lord. Consistently with this, he had before proceeded from what was general to what was particular, as the Apostleship was an especial service; for all who sustain the office of teaching are to be deemed Christ’s servants, but Apostles, in point of honor, far exceed all others. But the <i>choosing</i> for the gospel, etc., which he afterwards mentions, expresses the end as well as the use of the Apostleship; for he intended briefly to show for what purpose he was called to that function. By saying then that he was servant of Christ, he declared what he had in common with other teachers; by claiming to himself the title of an Apostle, he put himself before others; but as no authority is due to him who willfully intrudes himself, he reminds us, that he was appointed by God. </p>
<p>Then the meaning is, — that Paul was a servant of Christ, not any kind of servant, but an Apostle, and that by the call of God, and not by presumptuous intrusion: then follows a clearer explanation of the Apostolic office, — it was ordained for the preaching of the Gospel. For I cannot agree with those who refer this call of which he speaks to the eternal election of God; and who understand the separation, either that from his mother’s womb, which he mentions in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:15">Galatians 1:15</span>, or that which Luke refers to, when Paul was appointed for the Gentiles: but I consider that he simply glories in having God as the author of his call, lest any one should think that he had through his own rashness taken this honor to himself. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(16)</sup></span> </p>
<p>We must here observe, that all are not fitted for the ministry of the word; for a special call is necessary: and even those who seem particularly fitted ought to take heed lest they thrust themselves in without a call. But as to the character of the Apostolic and of the Episcopal call, we shall consider it in another place. We must further observe, that the office of an Apostle is the preaching of the gospel. It hence appears what just objects of ridicule are those dumb dogs, who render themselves conspicuous only by their mitre and their crook, and boast themselves to be the successors of the Apostles! </p>
<p>The word, <i>servant</i>, imports nothing else but a minister, for it refers to what is official. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(17)</sup></span> I mention this to remove the mistake of those who too much refine on this expression and think that there is here to be understood a contrast between the service of Moses and that of Christ. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(11)</span> “The inscription of the Pauline Epistles,” says [<u>Turrettin</u> ], “is according to the manner of the ancients, both Greeks and Romans. They were wont to prefix their name; and to those to whom they wrote they added their good wishes.” We have an example in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:26">Acts 23:26</span>. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(12)</span> Thereby expressing the meaning of Paulus, which in Latin is little. “Paul,” says the quaint [<u>Elnathan Parr</u> ], “as signifies little, and indeed not unfitly, for he is reported to have been low in stature, and to have had a very small voice,” which is thought to have been objected to him in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span> — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(13)</span> Most writers agree in this view, regarding <i>Saul</i> as his Hebrew name and <i>Paul</i> as his Roman name. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(14)</span> “A called Apostle — <blu>vocatus apostolus</blu><grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">— κλητὸς απόστολος;</span></blu></grk> ” our version is, “called <i>to be</i> an Apostle”. Most consider “called” here in the sense of chosen or elected, “a chosen Apostle.” Professor [<u>Stuart</u> ] observes, that<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κλητὸς</span></blu></grk> in the writings of Paul has always the meaning of efficient calling, and signifies not only the invited, but the effectually invited. He refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span>; compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:15">Galatians 1:15</span> </p>
<p>He was an Apostle by a call, or as [<u>Beza</u> ] renders it, “by the call <i>of God</i> — <blu>ex</blu> <blu><i>Dei</i></blu> <blu>vocatione apostolus</blu>.” The meaning is the same as what he himself expresses it in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span>. [<u>Turrettin</u> ] renders it, “<blu>Apostolus vocatione divina</blu> — an Apostle by divine vocation.” </p>
<p>The difference between “a called Apostle” and “called to be an Apostle,” is this, that the first conveys the idea that he obeyed the call, and the other does not. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(15)</span><grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Αφωρισμένος</span></blu></grk> separated, set apart; “<blu>segregatus</blu>,” <i>Vulgate</i>; “<blu>separatus</blu>, [<u>Beza</u> ]. “The Pharisees,” says [<u>Leigh</u> ], “were termed<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀφωρισμένος</span></blu></grk> we may English them <i>Separatists:</i> they separated themselves to the study of the law, in which respect they might be called<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀφωρισμένος εἰς τὸν νόμον,</span></blu></grk> separated to the law. In allusion to this, saith [<u>Drusius</u> ], the Apostle is thought to have styled himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span><grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, ἀφωρισμένον εἰς ἐυαγγέλιον,</span></blu></grk> separated unto the Gospel, when he was called from being a Pharisee to be a preacher of the Gospel.” <i>Separated</i> is the word adopted both by [<u>Doddridge</u> ] and [<u>Macknight</u> ], as well as by our own version. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(16)</span> Some combine the four separations. “Set apart in the eternal counsel of God, and from his mother’s womb, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:15">Galatians 1:15</span>, and by the special commandment of the Holy Ghost, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2">Acts 13:2</span>, confirmed by constitution of the Church, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:3">Acts 13:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>.” — <i>Parr</i>. But the object here seems to have been that stated by [<u>Calvin</u> ] : nor is it just or prudent to connect any other idea with the word except that which the context requires; for to do so only tends to create confusion. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(17)</span> Moses, Joshua, David, Nehemiah, etc., where, in a similar sense, called servants; and also our Savior. They were officially servants. — <i>Ed</i> </p>
