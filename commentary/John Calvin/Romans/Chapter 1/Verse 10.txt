<p><b>10.</b><i>Requesting, if by any means, etc.</i> As it is not probable that we from the heart study his benefit, whom we are not ready to assist by our labors, he now adds, after having said that he was anxious for their welfare, that he showed by another proof his love to them, as before God, even by requesting that he might be able to advance their interest. That you may, therefore, perceive the full meaning, read the words as though the word <i>also</i> were inserted, <i>requesting also, if by any means</i>, <i>etc.</i> By saying, <i>A prosperous journey by the will of God</i> he shows, not only that he looked to the Lordâ€™s favor for success in his journey, but that he deemed his journey prosperous, if it was approved by the Lord. According to this model ought all our wishes to be formed. </p>
