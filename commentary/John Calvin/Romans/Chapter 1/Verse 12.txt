<p><b>12.</b>Being not satisfied with this modest statement, he qualifies it, and shows, that he did not so occupy the place of a teacher, but that he wished to learn also from them; as though he said, “I desire so to confirm you according to the measure of grace conferred on me, that your example may also add courage (<blu><i>alacritatem</i></blu> — alacrity) to my faith, and that we may thus mutually benefit one another.” </p>
<p>See to what degree of modesty his pious heart submitted itself, so that he disdained not to seek confirmation from unexperienced beginners: nor did he speak dissemblingly, for there is no one so void of gifts in the Church of Christ, who is not able to contribute something to our benefit: but we are hindered by our envy and by our pride from gathering such fruit from one another. Such is our high-mindedness, such is the inebriety produced by vain reputation, that despising and disregarding others, every one thinks that he possesses what is abundantly sufficient for himself. I prefer to read with Bucer, <i>exhortation</i> (<blu><i>exhortationem</i></blu> — encouragement) rather than <blu><i>consolatim</i></blu> ; for it agrees better with the former part. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(35)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(35)</span> The verb is<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">συμπαρακληθὢναι,</span></blu></grk> which [<u>Grotius</u> ] connects with<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">επιποθῶ</span></blu></grk> in the preceding verse; and adds, “He softens what he had said, by showing, that he would not only bring some joy to them, but they also to him.” “<blu>Ut percipiam consolationem</blu> — that I may receive consolation,” [<u>Piscator</u> ] <i>;</i> — “<blu>Ut unà recreemur</blu> — that we may be together refreshed,” [<u>Castelio</u> ]. “<blu>Ad communem exhortationem percipiendam</blu> — in order to receive common exhortation,” [<u>Beza</u> ]; “<blu>Ut gaudium et voluptatem ex vobis precipiam</blu> — that I may receive joy and pleasure from you;” <blu>vel</blu>, “<blu>Ut mutuo solatio invicem nos erigamus atque firmemus</blu> — that by mutual comfort we may console and strengthen one another,” [<u>Schleusner</u> ] </p>
<p>The verb with the prefix<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, συμ,</span></blu></grk> is only found here; but the verb<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">παρακαλέω</span></blu></grk> frequently occurs, and its common meaning is, to beseech, to exhort to encourage, and by these means to comfort. </p>
<p>With regard to this passage, Professor [<u>Stuart</u> ] says, “I have rendered the word, <i>comfort</i>, only because I cannot find any English word which will convey the full sense of the original.” </p>
<p>“The word rendered <i>to comfort</i>, ” says Professor [<u>Hodge</u> ], “means <i>to invite</i>, <i>to exhort</i>, <i>to instruct</i>, <i>to console</i>, etc. Which of these senses is to be preferred here, it is not easy to decide. Most probably the Apostle intended to use the word in a wide sense, as expressing the idea, that he might be excited, encouraged, and comforted by his intercourse with his Christian brethren.” — The two verses may be thus rendered: — </p>
<p><b>11.</b>For I desire much to see you, that I may impart to you spiritual </p>
<p><b>12.</b>benefit, so that you may be strengthened: this also is what <i>I desire</i>, to be encouraged together with you, through the faith which is in both, even in you and in me. </p>
