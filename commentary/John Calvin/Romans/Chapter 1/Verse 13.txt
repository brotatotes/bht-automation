<p><b>13.</b><i>I would not that you should be ignorant</i>. What he has hitherto testified — that he continually requested of the Lord that he might visit them, might have appeared a vain thing, and could not have obtained credit, had he neglected to seize the occasion when offered: he therefore says, that the effort had not been wanting, but the opportunity; for he had been prevented from executing a purpose often formed. </p>
<p>We hence learn that the Lord frequently upsets the purposes of his saints, in order to humble them, and by such humiliation to teach them to regard his Providence, that they may rely on it; though the saints, who design nothing without the Lord’s will, cannot be said, strictly speaking, to be driven away from their purposes. It is indeed the presumption of impiety to pass by God, and without him to determine on things to come, as though they were in our own power; and this is what James sharply reprehends in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:13">James 4:13</span>. </p>
<p>But he says that he was <i>hindered</i>: you must take this in no other sense, but that the Lord employed him in more urgent concerns, which he could not have neglected without loss to the Church. Thus the hinderances of the godly and of the unbelieving differ: the latter perceive only that they are hindered, when they are restrained by the strong hand of the Lord, so as not to be able to move; but the former are satisfied with an hinderance that arises from some approved reason; nor do they allow themselves to attempt any thing beyond their duty, or contrary to edification. </p>
<p><i>That I might obtain some fruit</i>, <i>etc.</i> He no doubt speaks of that fruit, for the gathering of which the Lord sent his Apostles, </p>
<p>“I have chosen you, that ye may go and bring forth fruit,<br/>and that your fruit may remain.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:16">John 15:16</span>.) </p>
<p>Though he gathered it not for himself, but for the Lord, he yet calls it his own; for the godly have nothing more as their own than the work of promoting the glory of the Lord, with which is connected all their happiness. And he records what had happened to him with respect to <i>other nations</i>, that the Romans might entertain hope, that his coming to them would not be unprofitable, which so many nations had found to have been attended with so much benefit. </p>
