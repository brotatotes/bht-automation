<p><b>19.</b><i>Inasmuch as what may be known of God, etc.</i> He thus designates what it behoves us to know of God; and he means all that appertains to the setting forth of the glory of the Lord, or, which is the same thing, whatever ought to move and excite us to glorify God. And by this expression he intimates, that God in his greatness can by no means be fully comprehended by us, and that there are certain limits within which men ought to confine themselves, inasmuch as God accommodates to our small capacities what he testifies of himself. Insane then are all they who seek to know of themselves what God is: for the Spirit, the teacher of perfect wisdom, does not in vain invite our attention to what <i>may be known</i>, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὸ γνωστὸν</span></blu></grk>; and by what means this is known, he immediately explains. And he said, <i>in them</i> rather than <i>to them</i>, for the sake of greater emphasis: for though the Apostle adopts everywhere Hebrew phrases, and <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">ב</span></blu></heb>, <i>beth</i>, is often redundant in that language, yet he seems here to have intended to indicate a manifestation, by which they might be so closely pressed, that they could not evade; for every one of us undoubtedly finds it to be engraven on his own heart, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(45)</sup></span> By saying, that <i>God has made it manifest,</i> he means, that man was created to be a spectator of this formed world, and that eyes were given him, that he might, by looking on so beautiful a picture, be led up to the Author himself. </p>
