<p><b>28.</b><i>And as they chose not, etc.</i> There is an evident comparison to be observed in these words, by which is strikingly set forth the just relation between sin and punishment. As they chose not to continue in the knowledge of God, which alone guides our minds to true wisdom, the Lord gave them a perverted mind, which can choose nothing that is right. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(53)</sup></span> And by saying, that they chose not, (<blu>non probasse</blu> - approved not,) it is the same as though he had said, that they pursued not after the knowledge of God with the attention they ought to have done, but, on the contrary, turned away their thoughts resignedly from God. He then intimates, that they, making a depraved choice, preferred their own vanities to the true God; and thus the error, by which they were deceived, was voluntary. </p>
<p><i>To do those things which were not meet</i> As he had hitherto referred only to one instance of abomination, which prevailed indeed among many, but was not common to all, he begins here to enumerate vices from which none could be found free: for though every vice, as it has been said, did not appear in each individual, yet all were guilty of some vices, so that every one might separately be accused of manifest depravity. As he calls them in the first instance <i>not meet</i>, understand him as saying, that they were inconsistent with every decision of reason, and alien to the duties of men: for he mentions it as an evidence of a perverted mind, that men addicted themselves, without any reflection, to those vices, which common sense ought to have led them to renounce. </p>
<p>But it is labor in vain so to connect these vices, as to make them dependent one on another, since this was not Paul’s design; but he set them down as they occurred to his mind. What each of them signifies, we shall very briefly explain. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(53)</span> There is a correspondence between the words<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">οὐκ ἐδοκίμασαν</span></blu></grk> — they did not approve, or think worthy, and<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀδόκιμον</span></blu></grk> — unapproved, or worthless, which is connected with<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">νοῦν,</span></blu></grk> mind. The verb means to <i>try</i> or <i>prove</i> a thing, as metal by fire, then to<i>distinguish</i> between what is genuine or otherwise, and also to <i>approve</i> of what is good and valuable. To <i>approve</i> or think fit or worthy seems to be the meaning here. Derived from this verb is<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀδόκιμος,</span></blu></grk> which is applied to unapproved or adulterated money, — to men <i>unsound,</i> not able to bear the test, not genuine as Christians, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:5">2 Corinthians 13:5</span>, — to the earth that is <i>unfit</i> to produce fruits, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:8">Hebrews 6:8</span>. The nearest alliteration that can perhaps be presented is the following, “And as they did not deem it worth while to acknowledge God, God delivered them up to a worthless mind,” that is, a mind unfit to discern between right and wrong. [<u>Beza</u> ] gives this meaning, “<blu>Mentem omnis judicii expertem</blu> — a mind void of all judgment.” [<u>Locke</u> ] <i>’s</i> “unsearching mind,” and [<u>Macknight</u> ] ’s “unapproving mind,” and [<u>Doddridge</u> ] ’s “undiscerning mind,” do not exactly convey the right idea, though the last comes nearest to it. It is an unattesting mind, not capable of bringing things to the test<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">— δοκίμιον</span></blu></grk> not able to distinguish between things of the most obvious nature. </p>
<p>“To acknowledge God” is literally “to have God in recognition<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὸν θεὸν ἔχειν ἐν ἐπιγνώσει.</span></blu></grk> ” [<u>Venema</u> ] says, that this is a purely Greek idiom, and adduces passages from [<u>Herodotus</u> ] and [<u>Xenophon</u> ] <i>;</i> from the first, the following phrase<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, ἐν αλογίῃ ἔχειν</span></blu></grk> — to have in contempt, <i>i.e.,</i> to contemn or despise. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
