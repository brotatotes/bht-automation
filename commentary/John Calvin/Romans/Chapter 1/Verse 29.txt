<p><b>29.</b>Understand by <i>unrighteousness,</i> the violation of justice among men, by not rendering to each his due. I have rendered <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πονηρίαν</span></blu></grk>, according to the opinion of Ammonium, <i>wickedness;</i> for he teaches us that <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πονηρον</span></blu></grk>, the wicked, is <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δραστίκον κακου</span></blu></grk>, the doer of evil. The word (<blu><i>nequitia</i></blu> ) then means practiced wickedness, or licentiousness in doing mischief: but maliciousness (<blu><i>malitia</i></blu> ) is that depravity and obliquity of mind which leads us to do harm to our neighbour. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(54)</sup></span> For the word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πορνείαν</span></blu></grk>, which Paul uses, I have put lust, (<blu><i>libidinem</i></blu> .) I do not, however, object, if one prefers to render it fornication; but he means the inward passion as well as the outward act. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(55)</sup></span> The words <i>avarice</i>, <i>envy</i>, and <i>murder</i>, have nothing doubtful in their meaning. Under the word <i>strife</i>, (<blu><i>contentione</i></blu> ,) <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(56)</sup></span> he includes quarrels, fightings, and seditions. We have rendered <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κακοηθείαν</span></blu></grk>, <i>perversity</i>, (<blu><i>perversitatem</i></blu> ;) <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(57)</sup></span> which is a notorious and uncommon wickedness; that is, when a man, covered over, as it were, with hardness, has become hardened in a corrupt course of life by custom and evil habit. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(54)</span> The two words are<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πονηρία</span></blu></grk> and κακία [<u>Doddridge</u> ] renders them “mischief and malignity.” [<u>Pareus</u> ] says that<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κακία</span></blu></grk> is vice, opposed to <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τη αρετη</span></blu></grk> — virtue. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(55)</span><grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">“Πορνεία</span></blu></grk> has an extended sense, comprehending <i>all illicit intercourse</i>, whether fornication, adultery, incest, or any other <blu><i>venus illicita</i></blu> .” — [<u>Stuart</u> ] </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(56)</span> Improperly rendered “debate” in our version<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">— ἔριδος,</span></blu></grk> “strife”, by [<u>Macknight</u> ] <i>,</i> and “contention,” by [<u>Doddridge</u> ]. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(57)</span> In our versions “malignity;” by [<u>Macknight</u> ] <i>,</i> “bad disposition;” and by [<u>Doddridge</u> ], “inveteracy of evil habits.” [<u>Schleusner</u> ] thinks that it means here “malevolence.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
