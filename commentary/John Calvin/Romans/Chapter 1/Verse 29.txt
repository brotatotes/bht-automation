29.Understand by unrighteousness, the violation of justice among men, by not rendering to each his due. I have rendered πονηρίαν, according to the opinion of Ammonium, wickedness; for he teaches us that πονηρον, the wicked, is δραστίκον κακου, the doer of evil. The word (nequitia ) then means practiced wickedness, or licentiousness in doing mischief: but maliciousness (malitia ) is that depravity and obliquity of mind which leads us to do harm to our neighbour. (54) For the word πορνείαν, which Paul uses, I have put lust, (libidinem .) I do not, however, object, if one prefers to render it fornication; but he means the inward passion as well as the outward act. (55) The words avarice, envy, and murder, have nothing doubtful in their meaning. Under the word strife, (contentione ,) (56) he includes quarrels, fightings, and seditions. We have rendered κακοηθείαν, perversity, (perversitatem ;) (57) which is a notorious and uncommon wickedness; that is, when a man, covered over, as it were, with hardness, has become hardened in a corrupt course of life by custom and evil habit. (54) The two words areπονηρία and κακία [Doddridge ] renders them “mischief and malignity.” [Pareus ] says thatκακία is vice, opposed to τη αρετη — virtue. — Ed. (55)“Πορνεία has an extended sense, comprehending all illicit intercourse, whether fornication, adultery, incest, or any other venus illicita .” — [Stuart ] (56) Improperly rendered “debate” in our version— ἔριδος, “strife”, by [Macknight ] , and “contention,” by [Doddridge ]. — Ed. (57) In our versions “malignity;” by [Macknight ] , “bad disposition;” and by [Doddridge ], “inveteracy of evil habits.” [Schleusner ] thinks that it means here “malevolence.” — Ed.
