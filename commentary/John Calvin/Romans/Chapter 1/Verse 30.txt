<p><b>30.</b>The word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">θεοστυγεῖς</span></blu></grk>, means, no doubt, <i>haters of God</i>; for there is no reason to take it in a passive sense, (hated of God,) since Paul here proves men to be guilty by manifest vices. Those, then, are designated, who hate God, whose justice they seem to resist by doing wrong. <i>Whisperers</i> (<blu><i>susurrones</i></blu> ) and <i>slanderers</i> (<blu><i>obtrectatores</i></blu> ) <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(58)</sup></span> are to be thus distinguished; the former, by secret accusations, break off the friendships of good men, inflame their minds with anger, defame the innocent, and sow discords; and the latter through an innate malignity, spare the reputation of no one, and, as though they were instigated by the fury of evilspeaking, they revile the deserving as well as the undeserving We have translated <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑβριστὰς</span></blu></grk>, <i>villanous</i>, (<blu><i>maleficos</i></blu> ;) for the Latin authors are wont to call notable injuries villanies, such as plunders, thefts, burnings, and sorceries; and these where the vices which Paul meant to point out here. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(59)</sup></span> I have rendered the word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑπερήφανους</span></blu></grk>, used by Paul, <i>insolent</i>, (<blu><i>contumeliosos</i></blu> <i>;</i>) for this is the meaning of the Greek word: and the reason for the word is this, — because such being raised, as it were, on high, look down on those who are, as it were, below them with contempt, and they cannot bear to look on their equals. <i>Haughty</i> are they who swell with the empty wind of overweeningness. <i>Unsociable</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(60)</sup></span> are those who, by their iniquities, unloose the bands of society, or those in whom there is no sincerity or constancy of faith, who may be called truce-breakers. </p>

The<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑβρισται</span></blu></grk> are those who treat others petulantly, contumeliously, or insultingly “Insolent,” as given by [<u>Macknight</u> ], is the most suitable word. The<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑπερηφάνος</span></blu></grk> is one who sets himself to view above others, the high and elevated, who exhibits himself as superior to others. The<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">αλαζων</span></blu></grk> is the boaster, who assumes more than what belongs to him, or promises more than what he can perform.
