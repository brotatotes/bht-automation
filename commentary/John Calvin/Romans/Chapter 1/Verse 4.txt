<p><b>4.</b><i>Declared</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(19)</sup></span> <i>the Son of God</i>, <i>etc.</i>: or, if you prefer, determined (<blu>definitus</blu>); as though he had said, that the power, by which he was raised from the dead, was something like a decree by which he was proclaimed the Son of God, according to what is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span>, “I have this day begotten thee:” for this begetting refers to what was made known. Though some indeed find here three separate evidences of the divinity of Christ — “power,” understanding thereby miracles — then the testimony of the Spirit — and, lastly, the resurrection from the dead — I yet prefer to connect them together, and to reduce these three things to one, in this manner — that Christ was declared the Son of God by openly exercising a real celestial power, that is, the power of the Spirit, when he rose from the dead; but that this power is comprehended, when a conviction of it is imprinted on our hearts by the same Spirit. The language of the Apostle well agrees with this view; for he says that he was declared by power, because power, peculiar to God, shone forth in him, and uncontestably proved him to be God; and this was indeed made evident by his resurrection. Paul says the same thing in another place; having stated, that by death the weakness of the flesh appeared, he at the same time extols the power of the Spirit in his resurrection; (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:4">2 Corinthians 13:4</span>) This glory, however, is not made known to us, until the same Spirit imprints a conviction of it on our hearts. And that Paul includes, together with the wonderful energy of the Spirit, which Christ manifested by rising from the dead, the testimony which all the faithful feel in their hearts, is even evident from this — that he expressly calls it the Spirit of Holiness; as though he had said, that the Spirit, as far as it sanctifies, confirms and ratifies that evidence of its power which it once exhibited. For the Scripture is wont often to ascribe such titles to the Spirit, as tend to illustrate our present subject. Thus He is called by our Lord the Spirit of Truth, on account of the effect which he mentions; (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:17">John 14:17</span>) </p>
<p>Besides, a divine power is said to have shone forth in the resurrection of Christ for this reason — because he rose by his own power, as he had often testified: </p>
<p>“Destroy this temple, and in three days<br>I will raise it up again,” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span>;) </br></p>
<p>“No man taketh it from me,” etc.; (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:18">John 10:18</span>) </p>
<p>For he gained victory over death, (to which he yielded with regard to the weakness of the flesh,) not by aid sought from another, but by the celestial operation of his own Spirit. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(19)</span> “Declaratus<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">,” ὁρισθέντος.</span></blu></grk> Some of the ancients, such as [<u>Origen</u> ], [<u>Chrysostom</u> ], [<u>Cyril</u> ], and others, have given to this verb the meaning of is “proved<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">— δειχθέντος;</span></blu></grk> ” demonstrated — <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀποφανθέντος;</span></blu></grk> ” “exhibited —<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀποδειχθώντος;</span></blu></grk> ”etc. But it is said that the word has not this meaning in the New Testament, and that it means, limited, determined, decreed, constituted. Besides here, it is found only in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:22">Luke 22:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:42">Acts 10:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:29">Acts 11:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:26">Acts 17:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:7">Hebrews 4:7</span>. The word, <i>determined</i>, or <i>constituted</i>, if adopted here, would amount to the same thing, that is, that Christ was visibly determined or constituted the Son of God through the resurrection, or by that event. It was that which fixed, settled, determined, and manifestly exhibited him as the Son of God, clothed and adorned with his own power. Professor [<u>Stuart</u> ] has conjured a number of difficulties in connection with this verse, for which there seems to be no solid reason. The phrase, <i>the Son of God</i>, is so well known from the usage of Scripture, that there is no difficulty connected with it: the full phrase is the <i>only-begotten Son</i>. To say that Christ’s resurrection was no evidence of his divine nature, as Lazarus and others had been raised from the dead, appears indeed very strange. Did Lazarus rise through his own power? Did Lazarus rise again for our justification? Was his resurrection an attestation of any thing he had previously declared? The Revelation A. [<u>Barnes</u> ] very justly says, that the <i>circumstances</i> connected with Christ were those which rendered his resurrection a proof of his divinity. </p>
<p>Professor [<u>Hodge</u> ] gives what he conceives to be the import of the two verses in these words, “Jesus Christ was, as to his human nature, the Son of David; but he was clearly demonstrated to be, as to his divine nature, the Son of God, by the resurrection from the dead.” This view is taken by many, such as [<u>Pareus</u> ], [<u>Beza</u> ], [<u>Turrettin</u> ], etc. But the words, “according to the Spirit of Holiness<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">” — κατὰ πνεῦμα ἁγιωσύνης,</span></blu></grk> are taken differently by others, as meaning the Holy Spirit. As the phrase is nowhere else found, it may be taken in either sense. That the divine nature of Christ is called Spirit, is evident. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:17">2 Corinthians 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:18">1 Peter 3:18</span> [<u>Doddridge</u> ], [<u>Scott</u> ], and [<u>Chalmers</u> ], consider The Holy Spirit to be intended. The last gives this paraphrase: — “<i>Declared</i>, or determinately marked out to be the Son of God and with power. The thing was demonstrated by an evidence, the exhibition of which required a putting forth of power, which Paul in another place represents as a very great and strenuous exertion, ‘According to the working of his mighty power when he raised him from the dead.’ — <i>The Spirit of Holiness</i>, or the Holy Spirit. It was through the operation of the Holy Spirit that the divine nature was infused into the human at the birth of Jesus Christ; and the very same agent, it is remarkable, was employed in the work of the resurrection. ‘Put to death in the flesh,’ says Peter, and ‘quickened by the Spirit.’ We have only to do with the facts of the case. He was demonstrated to be the Son of God by the power of the Holy Spirit having been put forth in raising him from the dead.” As to the genitive case after “resurrection,” see a similar instance in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:32">Acts 17:32</span> </p>
<p>The idea deduced by [<u>Calvin</u> ], that he is called here “the Spirit of Holiness,” on account of the holiness he works in us, seems not well-founded, though advanced by [<u>Theodoret</u> ] and [<u>Augustine</u> ]. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
