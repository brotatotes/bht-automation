<p><b>8</b><i>.

What he states respecting them is, the celebrity of their faith; for he intimates that they being honored with the public approbation of the churches, could not reject an Apostle of the Lord, without disappointing the good opinion entertained of them by all; and such a thing would have been extremely uncourteous and in a manner bordering on perfidy. As then this testimony justly induced the Apostle, by affording him an assurance of their obedience, to undertake, according to his office, to teach and instruct the Romans; so it held them bound not to despise his authority. With regard to himself, he disposes them to a teachable spirit by testifying his love towards them: and there is nothing more effectual in gaining credit to an adviser, than the impression that he is cordially anxious to consult our wellbeing. </p>
<p>The first thing worthy of remark is, that he so commends their faith, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(29)</sup></span> that he implies that it had been received from God. We are here taught that faith is God’s gift; for thanksgiving is an acknowledgment of a benefit. He who gives thanks to God for faith, confesses that it comes from him. And since we find that the Apostle ever begins his congratulations with thanksgiving, let us know that we are hereby reminded, that all our blessings are God’s free gifts. It is also needful to become accustomed to such forms of speaking, that we may be led more fully to rouse ourselves in the duty of acknowledging God as the giver of all our blessings, and to stir up others to join us in the same acknowledgment. If it be right to do this in little things, how much more with regard to faith; Which is neither a small nor an indiscriminate (<blu><i>promiscua</i></blu> ) gift of God. We have here besides an example, that thanks ought to be given <i>through Christ,</i> according to the Apostle’s command in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:15">Hebrews 13:15</span>; inasmuch as in his name we seek and obtain mercy from the Father. — I observe in the last place, that he calls him <i>his God</i>. This is the faithful’s special privilege, and on them alone God bestows this honor. There is indeed implied in this a mutual relationship, which is expressed in this promise, </p>
<p>“I will be to them a God;<br/>they shall be to me a people.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jer+30:22">Jeremiah 30:22</span>.) </p>
<p>I prefer at the same time to confine this to the character which Paul sustained, as an attestation of his obedience to the end in the work of preaching the gospel. So Hezekiah called God the God of Isaiah, when he desired him to give him the testimony of a true and faithful Prophet. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+37:4">Isaiah 37:4</span>.) So also he is called in an especial manner the God of Daniel. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="da+6:20">Daniel 6:20</span>.) </p>
<p><i>Through the whole world.</i> The eulogy of faithful men was to Paul equal to that of the whole world, with regard to the faith of the Romans; for the unbelieving, who deemed it detestable, could not have given an impartial or a correct testimony respecting it. We then understood that it was by the mouths of the faithful that the faith of the Romans was proclaimed through the whole world; and that they were alone able to judge rightly of it, and to pronounce a correct opinion. That this small and despised handful of men were unknown as to their character to the ungodly, even at Rome, was a circumstance he regarded as nothing; for Paul made no account of their judgment. </p>
