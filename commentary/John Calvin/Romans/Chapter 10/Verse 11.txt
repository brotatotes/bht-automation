<p><b>11.</b><i>For the Scripture saith, etc.</i> Having stated the reasons why God had justly repudiated the Jews, he returns to prove the calling of the Gentiles, which is the other part of the question which he is discussing. As then he had explained the way by which men obtain salvation, and one that is common and opened to the Gentiles no less than to the Jews, he now, having first hoisted an universal banner, extends it expressly to the Gentiles, and then invites the Gentiles by name to it: and he repeats the testimony which he had before adduced from Isaiah, that what he said might have more authority, and that it might also be evident, how well the prophecies concerning Christ harmonize with the law. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(328)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(328)</span> As in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:33">Romans 11:33</span>, the Apostle quotes from the <i>Septuagint</i>; for to “make haste,” as the Hebrew is, conveys the same idea as “to be ashamed:” for he who hastens, acts for the most part foolishly and brings himself to shame, as Saul did, when he did not wait for Samuel, but hastened to sacrifice, and thereby brought shame on himself. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
