<p><b>13.</b><i>For to you Gentiles I speak, etc.</i> He confirms by a strong reason, that nothing shall be lost by the Gentiles, were the Jews to return again to favor with God; for he shows, that the salvation of both is so connected, that it can by the same means be promoted. For he thus addresses the Gentiles, — “Though I am peculiarly destined to be your Apostle, and ought therefore with special care to seek your salvation, with which I am charged, and to omit as it were all other things, and to labor for that only, I shall yet be faithfully discharging my office, by gaining to Christ any of my own nation; and this will be for the glory of my ministry, and so for your good.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(352)</sup></span> For whatever served to render Paul’s ministry illustrious, was advantageous to the Gentiles, whose salvation was its object. </p>
<p>And here also he uses the verb <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">παραζηλῶσαι</span></blu></grk>, <i>to provoke to emulation</i>, and for this purpose, that the Gentiles might seek the accomplishment of Moses’ prophecy, such as he describes, when they understood that it would be for their benefit. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(352)</span> The meaning attached here to the words<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὴν διακονίαν μου δοξάζω,</span></blu></grk> is somewhat different from what is commonly understood. Its classical sense, “highly to estimate,” is what is generally given here to the verb: but [<u>Calvin</u> ] takes it in a sense in which it is mostly taken in Scripture, as meaning, “to render illustrious,” or eminent, “to render glorious.” The construction of the two <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:13">Romans 11:13</span> and 14, is somewhat difficult, and the meaning is not very clear. To include the words, “as I am indeed the Apostle of the Gentiles,” in a parenthesis, as it is done by some, would render the sense more evident, and to add “this” after “say,” and “that” before “I render.” The version then would be as follows, — </p>
<p><b>13.</b>For I say <i>this</i> to you Gentiles (as I am indeed the Apostle of the Gentiles,) <i>that</i> I render my ministry glorious, </p>
<p><b>14.</b>If I shall by any means excite to emulation my own flesh and save some of them. </p>
<p>The sentiment in the last clause is the same as that at the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:11">Romans 11:11</span>. The<i>Vulgate</i>, and some of the Latin Fathers, and also [<u>Luther</u> ], read<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δοξάσω</span></blu></grk> in the future tense; which would make the passage read better, — “<i>that</i> I shall render,” etc. These two verses are not necessarily connected with the Apostle’s argument; for in the following verse he resumes the subject of <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:12">Romans 11:12</span>, or rather, as his usual manner is, he states the same thing in other words and in more explicit and stronger terms. So that the<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">γὰρ</span></blu></grk> in the next verse may very properly be rendered “yea,” or as an illative, “then.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
