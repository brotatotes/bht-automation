<p><b>35.</b><i>Who has first given to him, etc.</i> Another reason, by which God’s righteousness is most effectually defended against all the accusations of the ungodly: for if no one retains him bound to himself by his own merits, no one can justly expostulate with him for not having received his reward; as he, who would constrain another to do him good, must necessarily adduce those deeds by which he has deserved a reward. The import then of Paul’s words is this — “God cannot be charged with unrighteousness, except it can be proved, that he renders not to every one his due: but it is evident, that no one is deprived by him of his right, since he is under obligation to none; for who can boast of any thing of his own, by which he has deserved his favor?” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(376)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Now this is a remarkable passage; for we are here taught, that it is not in our power to constrain God by our good works to bestow salvation on us, but that he anticipates the undeserving by his gratuitous goodness. But if we desire to make an honest examination, we shall not only find, that God is in no way a debtor to us, but that we are all subject to his judgment, — that we not only deserve no layout, but that we are worthy of eternal death. And Paul not only concludes, that God owes us nothing, on account of our corrupt and sinful nature; but he denies, that if man were perfect, he could bring anything before God, by which he could gain his favor; for as soon as he begins to exist, he is already by the right of creation so much indebted to his Maker, that he has nothing of his own. In vain then shall we try to take from him his own right, that he should not, as he pleases, freely determine respecting his own creatures, as though there was mutual debt and credit. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(376)</span> There is a passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="job+41:11">Job 41:11</span>, (in the Hebrew Bible,) of which this verse seems to be a translation, made by the Apostle himself, as totally another meaning is given in the <i>Septuagint</i>. The person is alone changed. The Hebrew is literally this, </p>
<p>Who has anticipated me,<sup><br/></sup>And I will repay? </p>
<p>To “anticipate” means here with favor or gift; for the remainder of the verse is the following, — </p>
<p><i>Everything</i> under the whole heaven, mine it is. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
