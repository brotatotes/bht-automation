<p><b>6.</b><i>If through grace, it is no more by works, etc.</i> This amplification is derived from a comparison between things of an opposite character; for such is the <i>case</i> between God’s grace and the merit of works, that he who establishes the one overturns the other. </p>
<p>But if no regard to works can be admitted in election, without obscuring the gratuitous goodness of God, which he designed thereby to be so much commended to us, what answer can be given to Paul by those infatuated persons, <i>(</i> <blu><i>phrenetici</i></blu> — <i>insane,)</i> who make the cause of election to be that worthiness in us which God has foreseen? For whether you introduce works future or past, this declaration of Paul opposes you; for he says, that grace leaves nothing to works. Paul speaks not here of our reconciliation with God, nor of the means, nor of the proximate causes of our salvation; but he ascends higher, even to this, — why God, before the foundation of the world, chose only some and passed by others: and he declares, that God was led to make this difference by nothing else, but by his own good pleasure; for if any place is given to works, so much, he maintains, is taken away from grace. </p>
<p>It hence follows, that it is absurd to blend foreknowledge of works with election. For if God chooses some and rejects others, as he has foreseen them to be worthy or unworthy of salvation, then the grace of God, the reward of works being established, cannot reign alone, but must be only in part the cause of our election. For as Paul has reasoned before concerning the justification of Abraham, that where reward is paid, there grace is not freely bestowed; so now he draws his argument from the same fountain, — that if works come to the account, when God adopts a certain number of men unto salvation, reward is a matter of debt, and that therefore it is not a free gift. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(343)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Now, though he speaks here of election, yet as it is a general reasoning which Paul adopts, it ought to be applied to the whole of our salvation; so that we may understand, that whenever it is declared that there are no merits of works, our salvation is ascribed to the grace of God, or rather, that we may believe that the righteousness of works is annihilated, whenever grace is mentioned. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(343)</span> The last half of this verse is considered spurious by [<u>Griesbach</u> ], being not found in the greatest number of MSS., nor in the <i>Vulgate</i>, nor in the Latin Fathers; but it is found in some of the Greek Fathers, [<u>Theodoret</u> ], [<u>Oecumenius</u> ], [<u>Photius</u> ], and in the text, though not in the comment of [<u>Chrysostom</u> ], and in [<u>Theophylact</u> ], with the exception of the last clause, “Otherwise work,” etc. The <i>Syriac</i> and <i>Arabic</i> versions also contain the whole verse. The argument is complete without the last portion, which is, in fact, a repetition of the first in another form. But this kind of statement is wholly in unison with the character of the Apostle’s mode of writing. He often states a thing positively and negatively, or in two different ways. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:4">Romans 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:1">Romans 9:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span>. Then an <i>omission</i> more probable than an <i>addition</i>. [<u>Beza</u> ], [<u>Pareus</u> ], [<u>Wolfius</u> ], etc., regard it as genuine, and [<u>Doddridge</u> ] and [<u>Macknight</u> ] have retained it in their versions. Every reason, except the number of MSS., is in favor of its genuineness. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
