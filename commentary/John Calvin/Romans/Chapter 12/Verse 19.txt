<p><b>19.</b><i>Avenge not yourselves, etc.</i> The evil which he corrects here, as we have reminded you, is more grievous than the preceding, which he has just stated; and yet both of them arise from the same fountain, even from an inordinate love of self and innate pride, which makes us very indulgent to our own faults and inexorable to those of others. As then this disease begets almost in all men a furious passion for revenge, whenever they are in the least degree touched, he commands here, that however grievously we may be injured, we are not to seek revenge, but to commit it to the Lord. And inasmuch as they do not easily admit the bridle, who are once seized with this wild passion, he lays, as it were, his hand upon us to restrain us, by kindly addressing us as <i>beloved</i> </p>
<p>The <i>precept;</i> then is, — that we are not to revenge nor seek to revenge injuries done to us. The manner is added, a <i>place</i> is to be <i>given to wrath.</i> To give place to wrath, is to commit to the Lord the right of judging, which they take away from him who attempt revenge. Hence, as it is not lawful to usurp the office of God, it is not lawful to revenge; for we thus anticipate the judgment of God, who will have this office reserved for himself. He at the same time intimates, that they shall have God as their defender, who patiently wait for his help; but that those who anticipate him leave no place for the help of God. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(397)</sup></span> </p>
<p>But he prohibits here, not only that we are not to execute revenge with our own hands, but that our hearts also are not to be influenced by a desire of this kind: it is therefore superfluous to make a distinction here between public and private revenge; for he who, with a malevolent mind and desirous of revenge, seeks the help of a magistrate, has no more excuse than when he devises means for self-revenge. Nay, revenge, as we shall presently see, is not indeed at all times to be sought from God: for if our petitions arise from a private feeling, and not from pure zeal produced by the Spirit, we do not make God so much our judge as the executioner of our depraved passion. </p>
<p>Hence, we do not otherwise give place to wrath, than when with quiet minds we wait for the seasonable time of deliverance, praying at the same time, that they who are now our adversaries, may by repentance become our friends. </p>
<p><i>For it is written, etc.</i> He brings proof, taken from the song of Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+32:35">Deuteronomy 32:35</span>, where the Lord declares that he will be the avenger of his enemies; and God’s enemies are all who without cause oppress his servants. “He who touches you,” he says, “touches the pupil of mine eye.” With this consolation then we ought to be content, — that they shall not escape unpunished who undeservedly oppress us, — and that we, by enduring, shall not make ourselves more subject or open to the injuries of the wicked, but, on the contrary, shall give place to the Lord, who is our only judge and deliverer, to bring us help. </p>
<p>Though it be not indeed lawful for us to pray to God for vengeance on our enemies, but to pray for their conversion, that they may become friends; yet if they proceed in their impiety, what is to happen to the despisers of God will happen to them. But Paul quoted not this testimony to show that it is right for us to be as it were on fire as soon as we are injured, and according to the impulse of our flesh, to ask in our prayers that God may become the avenger of our injuries; but he first teaches us that it belongs not to us to revenge, except we would assume to ourselves the office of God; and secondly, he intimates, that we are not to fear that the wicked will more furiously rage when they see us bearing patiently; for God does not in vain take upon himself the office of executing vengeance. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(397)</span> Many have been the advocates of this exposition, [<u>Chrysostom</u> ], [<u>Theophylact</u> ], [<u>Luther</u> ], [<u>Beza</u> ], [<u>Hammond</u> ], [<u>Macknight</u> ], [<u>Stuart</u> ], etc. But there is no instance of the expression, “to give place,” having this meaning. In the two places where it occurs, it means to give way, to yield. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:9">Luke 14:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:27">Ephesians 4:27</span>. Then to give place to wrath, is to yield to and patiently to endure the wrath of the man who does the wrong. Some have maintained that the meaning is, that the injured man is to give place to his own wrath, that is, allow it time to cool: but this view comports not with the passage. The subject is, that a Christian is not to retaliate, or to return wrath for wrath, but to endure the wrath of his enemy, and to leave the matter in the hand of God. With this sense the quotation accords as much as with that given by [<u>Calvin</u> ]. Not a few have taken this view, [<u>Basil</u> ], [<u>Ambrose</u> ], [<u>Drusius</u> ], [<u>Mede</u> ], [<u>Doddridge</u> ], [<u>Scott</u> ], etc. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
