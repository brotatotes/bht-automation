<p><b>2.</b><i>And conform ye not to this world, etc.</i> The term <i>world</i> has several significations, but here it means the sentiments and the morals of men; to which, not without cause, he forbids us to conform. For since the whole world lies in wickedness, it behooves us to put off whatever we have of the old man, if we would really put on Christ: and to remove all doubt, he explains what he means, by stating what is of a contrary nature; for he bids us to be transformed into a newness of mind. These kinds of contrast are common in Scripture; and thus a subject is more clearly set forth. </p>
<p>Now attend here, and see what kind of renovation is required from us: It is not that of the flesh only, or of the inferior part of the soul, as the Sorbonists explain this word; but of the mind, which is the most <i>excellent</i> part of us, and to which philosophers ascribe the supremacy; for they call it <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἡγεμονικὸν</span></blu></grk>, the leading power; and reason is imagined to be a most wise queen. But Paul pulls her down from her throne, and so reduces her to nothing by teaching us that we must be renewed in mind. For how much soever we may flatter ourselves, that declaration of Christ is still true, — that every man must be born again, who would enter into the kingdom of God; for in mind and heart we are altogether alienated from the righteousness of God. </p>
<p><i>That ye may prove,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(380)</sup></span> <i>etc.</i> Here you have the purpose for which we must put on a new mind, — that bidding adieu to our own counsels and desires, and those of all men, we may be attentive to the only will of God, the knowledge of which is true wisdom. But if the renovation of our mind is necessary, in order that we may prove what is the will of God, it is hence evident how opposed it is to God. </p>
<p>The epithets which are added are intended for the purpose of recommending God’s will, that we may seek to know it with greater alacrity: and in order to constrain our perverseness, it is indeed necessary that the true glory of justice and perfection should be ascribed to the will of God. The world persuades itself that those works which it has devised are good; Paul exclaims, that what is good and right must be ascertained from God’s commandments. The world praises itself, and takes delight in its own inventions; but Paul affirms, that nothing pleases God except what he has commanded. The world, in order to find perfection, slides from the word of God into its own devices; Paul, by fixing perfection in the will of God, shows, that if any one passes over that mark he is deluded by a false imagination. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(380)</span> <blu><i>Ut probetis</i></blu> <i>,</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἰς τὸ δοκιμάζειν ὑμᾶς;</span></blu></grk> “<blu>ut noscatis</blu> — that ye may know,” [<u>Theophylact</u> ]; “<blu>ut diligenter scrutemini</blu> — that ye may carefully search,” [<u>Jerome</u> ], “That ye may experimentally know,” [<u>Doddridge</u> ]; “that ye may learn,” [<u>Stuart</u> ]. The verb means chiefly three things, — to <i>test</i>, i.e., metals by fire, to <i>try</i>, to <i>prove</i>, to <i>examine</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:19">Luke 14:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:5">2 Corinthians 13:5</span>, — to <i>approve</i> what is proved, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:22">Romans 14:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:3">1 Corinthians 16:3</span>, — and also to <i>prove</i> a thing so as to make a proper distinction, to <i>discern</i>, to <i>understand</i>, to <i>distinguish</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:56">Luke 12:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:18">Romans 2:18</span>. The last idea is the most suitable here, “in order that ye may understand what the will of God is, even that which is good and acceptable and perfect.” </p>
<p>What [<u>Stuart</u> ] says on the last clause seems just, that it is to be taken by itself, and that the words do not agree with “will,” but stand by themselves, being in the neuter gender. Otherwise we cannot affix any idea to “acceptable;” for it would be unsuitable to say that God’s will is “acceptable” to him, that being self-evident. </p>
<p>“Good<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">,” ἀγαθὸν,</span></blu></grk> is useful, advantageous, beneficial; “acceptable<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">,” εὐαρεστον,</span></blu></grk> is what is pleasing to and accepted by God; and “perfect<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">,” τέλειον,</span></blu></grk> is complete, entire, without any defect, or just and right. </p>
<p>It ought to be borne in mind, as [<u>Pareus</u> ] observes, that in order to discern, and rightly to understand God’s will, the Apostle teaches us, that “the renewing of the mind” is necessary; otherwise, as he adds, “our corrupt nature will fascinate our eyes that they may not see, or if they see, will turn our hearts and wills, that they may not approve, or if they approve, will hinder us to follow what is approved.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
