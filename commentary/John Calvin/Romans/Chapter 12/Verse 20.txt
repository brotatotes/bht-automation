<p><b>20.</b><i>If therefore, etc.</i> He now shows how we may really fulfill the precepts of not revenging and of not repaying evil, even when we not only abstain from doing injury but when we also do good to those who have done wrong to us; for it is a kind of an indirect retaliation when we turn aside our kindness from those by whom we have been injured. Understand as included under the words <i>meat</i> and <i>drink,</i> all acts of kindness. Whatsoever then may be thine ability, in whatever business thy enemy may want either thy wealth, or thy counsel, or thy efforts, thou oughtest to help him. But he calls him our enemy, not whom we regard with hatred, but him who entertains enmity towards us. And if they are to be helped according to the flesh, much less is their salvation to be opposed by imprecating vengeance on them. </p>
<p><i>Thou shalt heap coals of fire, etc.</i> As we are not willing to lose our toil and labor, he shows what fruit will follow, when we treat our enemies with acts of kindness. But some by <i>coals</i> understand the destruction which returns on the head of our enemy, when we show kindness to one unworthy, and deal with him otherwise than he deserves; for in this manner his guilt is doubled. Others prefer to take this view, that when he sees himself so kindly treated, his mind is allured to love us in return. I take a simpler view, that his mind shall be turned to one side or another; for doubtless our enemy shall either be softened by our benefits, or if he be so savage that nothing can tame him, he shall yet be burnt and tormented by the testimony of his own conscience, on finding himself overwhelmed with our kindness. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(398)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(398)</span> [<u>Calvin</u> ] has in this exposition followed [<u>Chrysostom</u> ] and [<u>Theodoret</u> ]. The former part no doubt contains the right view; the following verse proves it, “Overcome evil with good.” The idea of “heaping coals of fire” is said to have been derived from the practice of heaping coals on the fire to melt hard metals; but as “the coals of fire” must mean “burning coals,” as indeed the word in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="pr+25:22">Proverbs 25:22</span>, whence the passage is taken, clearly means, this notion cannot be entertained. It seems to be a sort of proverbial saying, signifying something intolerable, which cannot be borne without producing strong effects: such is represented to be kindness to any enemy, to feed him when hungry and to give him drink when thirsty, has commonly such a power over him that he cannot resist its influence, no more than he can withstand the scorching heat of burning coals. Of course the natural tendency of such a conduct is all that is intended, and not that it invariably produces such an effect; for in Scripture things are often stated in this way; but human nature is such a strange thing, that it often resists what is right, just, and reasonable, and reverses, as it were, the very nature of things. </p>
<p>It is not true what [<u>Whitby</u> ] and others have held, that “coals of fire” always mean judgments or punishments. The word indeed in certain connections, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:13">Psalms 18:13</span>, has this meaning, but in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="pr+25:22">Proverbs 25:22</span>, it cannot be taken in this sense, as the preceding verse most clearly proves. There is no canon of interpretation more erroneous than to make words or phrases to bear the same meaning in every place. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
