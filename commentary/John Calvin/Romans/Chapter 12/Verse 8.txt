<p><b>8.</b><i>Or he who gives, let him do so in simplicity, etc.</i> From the former clauses we have clearly seen, that he teaches us here the legitimate use of God’s gifts. By the <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">μεταδιδούντοις</span></blu></grk>, <i>the givers,</i> of whom he speaks here, he did not understand those who gave of their own property, but the deacons, who presided in dispensing the public charities of the Church; and by the <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐλούντοις</span></blu></grk>, <i>those who showed mercy,</i> he meant the widows, and other ministers, who were appointed to take care of the sick, according to the custom of the ancient Church: for there were two different offices, — to provide necessaries for the poor, and to attend to their condition. But to the first he recommends <i>simplicity,</i> so that without fraud or respect of persons they were faithfully to administer what was entrusted to them. He required the services of the other party to be rendered with <i>cheerfulness,</i> lest by their peevishness (which often happens) they marred the favor conferred by them. For as nothing gives more solace to the sick or to any one otherwise distressed, than to see men cheerful and prompt in assisting them; so to observe sadness in the countenance of those by whom assistance is given, makes them to feel themselves despised. </p>
<p>Though he rightly calls those <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">προϊστάμενους</span></blu></grk> <i>presidents,</i> to whom was committed the government of the Church, (and they were the elders, who presided over and ruled others and exercised discipline;) yet what he says of these may be extended universally to all kinds of governors: for no small solicitude is required from those who provide for the safety of all, and no small diligence is needful for them who ought to watch day and night for the wellbeing of the whole community. Yet the state of things at that time proves that Paul does not speak of all kinds of rulers, for there were then no pious magistrates; but of the elders who were the correctors of morals. </p>
