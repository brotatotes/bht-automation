<p><b>2.</b><i>And they who resist, etc.</i> As no one can resist God but to his own ruin, he threatens, that they shall not be unpunished who in this respect oppose the providence of God. Let us then beware, lest we incur this denunciation. And <i>by judgment,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(402)</sup></span> I understand not only the punishment which is inflicted by the magistrate, as though he had only said, that they would be justly punished who resisted authority; but also the vengeance of God, however it may at length be executed: for he teaches us in general what end awaits those who contend with God. </p>
