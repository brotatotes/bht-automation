<p><b>6.</b><i>For this reason also, etc.</i> He takes occasion to introduce the subject of tributes, the reason for which he deduces from the office of magistrates; for if it be their duty to defend and safely preserve the peace of the good, and to resist the mischievous attempts of the wicked, this they cannot do unless they are aided by sufficient force. Tributes then are justly paid to support such necessary expenses. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(406)</sup></span> But respecting the proportion of taxes or tributes, this is not the place to discuss the subject; nor does it belong to us either to prescribe to princes how much they ought to expend in every affair, or to call them to an account. It yet behooves them to remember, that whatever they receive from the people, is as it were public property, and not to be spent in the gratification of private indulgence. For we see the use for which Paul appoints these tributes which are to be paid — even that kings may be furnished with means to defend their subjects. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(406)</span> The words “to this very thing<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">,” εἰς αὐτὸ τούτο,</span></blu></grk> seem to be an instance of Hebraism, as <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">זאת</span></blu></heb>, “this,” in that language is both singular and plural, and means “this,” or “those,” according to the context. “To these very things,” before mentioned as to the works and duties of magistrates, appears to be the meaning here: and so the words are rendered in the Syriac and Ethiopic versions. A singular instance is found at the beginning of <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:9">Romans 13:9</span>, “For this<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">,” τὸ γὰρ,</span></blu></grk> and then several commandments are mentioned; “for this” is the law, says [<u>Stuart</u> ]; but the word for “law” is of a different gender. What we would say in English is, “for these,” etc. It is a Hebrew idiom transferred into Greek. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
