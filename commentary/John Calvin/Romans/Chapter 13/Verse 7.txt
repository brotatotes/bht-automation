<p><b>7.</b><i>Render then to all what is due, etc.</i> The Apostle seems here summarily to include the particulars in which the duties of subjects towards magistrates consist, — that they are to hold them in esteem and honor, that they are to obey their edicts, laws, and judgments, — that they are to pay tributes and customs. By the word <i>fear,</i> he means obedience; by <i>customs</i> and <i>tributes,</i> not only imposts and taxes, but also other revenues. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(407)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Now this passage confirms what I have already said, — that we ought to obey kings and governors, whoever they may be, not <i>because</i> we are constrained, but because it is a service <i>acceptable</i> to God; for he will have them not only to be feared, but also honored by a voluntary respect. </p>
