<p><b>1.</b><i>Him indeed, etc.</i> He passes on now to lay down a precept especially necessary for the instruction of the Church, — that they who have made the most progress in Christian doctrine should accommodate themselves to the more ignorant, and employ their own strength to sustain their weakness; for among the people of God there are some weaker than others, and who, except they are treated with great tenderness and kindness, will be discouraged, and become at length alienated from religion. And it is very probable that this happened especially at that time; for the Churches were formed of both Jews and Gentiles; some of whom, having been long accustomed to the rites of the Mosaic law, having been brought up in them from childhood, were not easily drawn away from them; and there were others who, having never learnt such things, refused a yoke to which they had not been accustomed. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(413)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Now, as man’s disposition is to slide from a difference in opinion to quarrels and contentions, the Apostle shows how they who thus vary in their opinions may live together without any discord; and he prescribes this as the best mode, — that they who are strong should spend their labor in assisting the weak, and that they who have made the greatest advances should bear with the more ignorant. For God, by making us stronger than others, does not bestow strength that we may oppress the weak; nor is it the part of Christian wisdom to be above measure insolent, and to despise others. The import then of what he addresses to the more intelligent and the already confirmed, is this, — that the ampler the grace which they had received from the Lord, the more bound they were to help their neighbors. </p>
<p><i>Not for the debatings of questions.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(414)</sup></span> This is a defective sentence, as the word which is necessary to complete the sense is wanting. It appears, however, evident, that he meant nothing else than that the weak should not be wearied with fruitless disputes. But we must remember the subject he now handles: for as many of the Jews still clave to the shadows of the law, he indeed admits, that this was a fault in them; he yet requires that they should be for a time excused; for to press the matter urgently on them might have shaken their faith. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(415)</sup></span> </p>
<p>He then calls those contentious questions which disturb a mind not yet sufficiently established, or which involve it in doubts. It may at the same time be proper to extend this farther, even to any thorny and difficult questions, by which weak consciences, without any edification, may be disquieted and disturbed. We ought then to consider what questions any one is able to bear, and to accommodate our teaching to the capacity of individuals. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(413)</span> Some, as [<u>Haldane</u> ], have found fault with this classification, as there is nothing in the chapter which countenances it. But as the Apostle’s object throughout the epistle was to reconcile the Jews and Gentiles, there is reason sufficient to regard them as the two parties here intended: and, as [<u>Chalmers</u> ] justly observes, it is more probable that the Gentiles were the despisers, inasmuch as the Jews, who, like Paul, had got over their prejudices, were no doubt disposed to sympathize with their brethren, who were still held fast by them. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(414)</span> <blu><i>Non ad disceptationes quaestionum</i></blu> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, μὴ εἰς διακρίσεις διαλογισμῶν;</span></blu></grk> “<blu>non ad altercationes disceptationum</blu> — not for the altercations of disputings” or debatings, [<u>Beza</u> ]; “not to debates about matter in doubt,” [<u>Doddridge</u> ]; “not in order to the strifes of disputations,” [<u>Macknight</u> ]. Both words are in the plural number; therefore to give the first the sense of “judging,” as [<u>Hodge</u> ] does, cannot be right; for in that case it would have been in the singular number. The words may be rendered, “no for the solutions of doubts.” One of the meanings of the first word, according to [<u>Hesychius</u> ], is<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">διάλυσις</span></blu></grk> — untying, loosening, dissolving; and for the latter, see <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:38">Luke 24:38</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:8">1 Timothy 2:8</span>. according to the frequent import of the preposition<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἰς,</span></blu></grk> the sentence may be thus paraphrased, “Him who is weak in the faith receive, <i>but</i> not that ye may solve his doubts,” or, “debate in reasonings,” or, “contend in disputations.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(415)</span> [<u>Scott</u> ] <i>’s</i> remarks on this verse are striking and appropriate, — “Notwithstanding,” he says, “the authority vested by Christ in his Apostles, and their infallibility in delivering his doctrine to mankind, differences of opinion prevailed even among real Christians; nor did St. Paul, by an express decision and command, attempt to put a final termination to them. A proposition indeed may be certain and important truth; yet a man cannot receive it without due preparation of mind and heart; — so that a compelled assent to any doctrine, or conformity to any outward observances, without conviction, would in general be hypocrisy, and entirely unavailing. So essential are the rights and existence of private judgment, in all possible cases, to the exercise of true religion! and so useless an encumbrance would an infallible judge be, for deciding controversies, and producing unanimity among Christians!” </p>
