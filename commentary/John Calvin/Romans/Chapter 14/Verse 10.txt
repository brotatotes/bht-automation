<p><b>10.</b><i>But thou, why dost thou, etc.</i> As he had made the life and death of us all subject to Christ, he now proceeds to mention the authority to judge, which the Father has conferred on him, together with the dominion over heaven and earth. He hence concludes, that it is an unreasonable boldness in any one to assume the power to judge his brother, since by taking such a liberty he robs Christ the Lord of the power which he alone has received from the Father. </p>
<p>But first, by the term <i>brother,</i> he checks this lust for judging; for since the Lord has established among us the right of a fraternal alliance, an equality ought to be preserved; every one then who assumes the character of a judge acts unreasonably. Secondly, he calls us before the only true judge, from whom no one can take away his power, and whose tribunal none can escape. As then it would be absurd among men for a criminal, who ought to occupy a humble place in the court, to ascend the tribunal of the judge; so it is absurd for a Christian to take to himself the liberty of judging the conscience of his brother. A similar argument is mentioned by James, when he says, that “he who judges his brother, judges the law,” and that “he who judges the law, is not an observer of the law but a president;” and, on the other hand, he says, that “there is but one lawgiver, who can save and destroy.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:12">James 4:12</span>.) He has ascribed <i>tribunal</i> to Christ, which means his power to judge, as the voice of the archangel, by which we shall be summoned, is called, in another place, a trumpet; for it will pierce, as it were with its sound, into the minds and ears of all. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(423)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(423)</span> The words “We shall all stand,” etc., may be rendered, “We must all stand,” etc. It is indeed the future tense, but this is according to what is often the case in Hebrew, for in that language the future has frequently this meaning. <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:12">Romans 13:12</span> may be rendered in the same manner, “So then every one of us must give account of himself to God.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
