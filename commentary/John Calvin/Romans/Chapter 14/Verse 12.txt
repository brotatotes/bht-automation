<p><b>12.</b><i>Every one of us, etc.</i> This conclusion invites us to humility and lowliness of mind: and hence he immediately draws this inference, — that <i>we are not to judge one another;</i> for it is not lawful for us to usurp the office of judging, who must ourselves submit to be judged and to give an account. </p>
<p>From the various significations of the word to judge, he has aptly drawn two different meanings. In the first place he forbids us to judge, that is, to condemn; in the second place he bids us to judge, that is, to exercise judgment, so as not to give offense. He indeed indirectly reproves those malignant censors, who employ all their acuteness in finding out something faulty in the life of their brethren: he therefore bids them to exercise wariness themselves; for by their neglect they often precipitate, or drive their brethren against some stumblingblock or another. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(425)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(425)</span> The two words<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, πρόσκομμα</span></blu></grk> and <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">σκάνδαλον,</span></blu></grk> mean nearly the same thing, but with this difference, that the first seems to be an hindrance or an obstacle which occasions stumbling or falling, and the other is an obstacle which stops or impedes progress in the way. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:23">Matthew 16:23</span>. The two parties, the strong and the weak, are here evidently addressed; the former was not, by eating, to put a stumblingblock in the way of the weak brother; nor was the weak, by condemning, to be a hindrance or impediment in the way of the strong so as to prevent him to advance in his course. Thus we see that forbearance is enjoined on both parties, though the Apostle afterwards dwells more on what the strong was to do. </p>
<p>The clause might be thus rendered, — </p>
<p>“But rather judge it right to do this, — <br>not to lay before a brother a stumbling-stone, or an impediment.” — <i>Ed.</i> </br></p>
