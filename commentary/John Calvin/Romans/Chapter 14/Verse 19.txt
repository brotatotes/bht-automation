<p><b>19.</b><i>Let us then follow, etc.</i> He recalls us, as much as possible, from a mere regard to meats, to consider those greater things which ought to have the first place in all our actions, and so to have the precedence. We must indeed eat, that we may live; we ought to live, that we may serve the Lord; and he serves the Lord, who by benevolence and kindness edifies his neighbor; for in order to promote these two things, concord and edification, all the duties of love ought to be exercised. Lest this should be thought of little moment, he repeats the sentence he had before announced, — that corruptible meat is not of such consequence that for its sake the Lord’s building should be destroyed. For wherever there is even a spark of godliness, there the work of God is to be seen; which they demolish, who by their unfeeling conduct disturb the conscience of the weak. </p>
<p>But it must be noticed, that edification is joined to peace; because some, not unfrequently, too freely indulge one another, so that they do much harm by their compliances. Hence in endeavoring to serve one another, discretion ought to be exercised, and utility regarded, so that we may willingly grant to our brother whatever may be useful to further his salvation. So Paul reminds us in another place: “All things,” he says, “arelawful to me; but all things are not expedient;” and immediately he adds the reason, “Because all things do not edify.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:23">1 Corinthians 10:23</span>.) </p>
<p>Nor is it also in vain that he repeats again, <i>For meat destroy not,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(432)</sup></span> <i>etc.</i>, intimating, that he required no abstinence, by which there would be, according to what he had said before, any loss to piety: though we eat not anything we please, but abstain from the use of meats for the sake of our brethren; yet the kingdom of God continues entire and complete. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(432)</span> This is a similar, but not the same sentence as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:15">Romans 14:15</span>. The verb is different<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, κατάλυε;</span></blu></grk> which means to undo, to loosen, to pull down; and as “work” follows, which, as [<u>Calvin</u> ] and others think, is to be understood of God’s building, the work of edifying or building up his people, the verb may in this sense be rendered here, “Pull not down the work of God.” But here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:15">Romans 14:15</span>, it is the <i>tendency</i> of the deed that is to be considered, and the effect as far as man’s doing was concerned. The Apostle says nothing of what God would do. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
