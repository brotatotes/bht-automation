<p><b>2.</b><i>Let him who believes, etc.</i> What [<u>Erasmus</u> ] has followed among the various readings I know not; but he has mutilated this sentence, which, in Paul’s words, is complete; and instead of the relative article he has improperly introduced <blu><i>alius</i></blu> — one, “One indeed believes,” etc. That I take the infinitive for an imperative, ought not to appear unnatural nor strained, for it is a mode of speaking very usual with Paul. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(416)</sup></span> He then calls those believers who were endued with a conscience fully satisfied; to these he allowed the use of all things without any difference. In the mean time the weak did eat herbs, and abstained from those things, the use of which he thought was not lawful. If the common version be more approved, the meaning then will be, — that it is not right that he who freely eats all things, as he believes them to be lawful, should require those, who are yet tender and weak in faith, to walk by the same rule. But to render the word <i>sick,</i> as some have done, is absurd. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(416)</span> This is true, but the passage here seems not to require such a construction. Both sentences are declarative, announcing a fact respecting two parties: the one believed he might eat everything; the other did eat only herbs. The relative<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὃς,</span></blu></grk> when repeated, often means “one,” as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:5">Romans 13:5</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:21">1 Corinthians 11:21</span>: and the article<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὁ</span></blu></grk> stands here for that repetition; an example of which <i>Raphelius</i> adduces from the Greek classics. </p>
<p>Some think that this abstinence from meat was not peculiar to the Jews; but that some Gentiles also had scruples on the subject. It is true that heathens, who held the transmigration of souls, did not eat flesh: but it is not likely that abstinence, arising from such an absurd notion, would have been thus treated by the Apostle. It indeed appears evident, that the abstinence here referred to did arise from what was regarded to be the will of God: and though abstinence from all animal food was not enjoined on the Jews, yet it appears from history that Jews, living among heathens, wholly abstained, owing to the fear they had of being in any way contaminated. This was the case with Daniel and his companions, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="da+1:8">Daniel 1:8</span>. Professor [<u>Hodge</u> ] says, in a note on this passage, “Josephus states in his life (chapter 23) that certain Jewish priests, while at Rome, lived entirely upon fruit, from the dread of eating anything unclean.” We may also suppose that some of the <i>Essenes</i>, who abstained from meat and from wine, were among the early converts. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
