<p><b>10</b><i>Exult, ye Gentiles, with his people</i> This verse is commonly considered as if it was taken from the song of Moses; but with this I cannot agree; for Moses’ design there was to terrify the adversaries of Israel by setting forth his greatness, rather than to invite them to a common joy. I hence think that this is quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+47:5">Psalms 47:5</span>, where it is written, “Exult and rejoice let the Gentiles, because thou judgest the nations in equity, and the Gentiles on the earth thou guidest.” And Paul adds, <i>with his people,</i> and he did this by way of explanation; for the Prophet in that psalm no doubt connects the Gentiles with Israel, and invites both alike to rejoice; and there is no joy without the knowledge of God. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(447)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(447)</span> This passage is evidently taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="de+32:43">Deuteronomy 32:43</span>, given literally as it is found in the Septuagint, and literally too from the Hebrew, if the reading of two copies, referred to by <i>Kennicalt</i>, be adopted, in which <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">את</span></blu></heb>, “with,” is placed before <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">עשו</span></blu></heb>, “his people.” It is no objection that “adversaries” are mentioned in the context. There have ever been adversaries to God’s people; and God even now denounces his judgments on his adversaries, though the Gentiles as a people, as a separate class from the Jews, have been long ago admitted to the privilege of rejoicing with his people. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
