<p><b>12.</b><i>And again, Isaiah, etc.,</i> This prophecy is the most illustrious of them all: for in that passage, the Prophet, when things were almost past hope, comforted the small remnant of the faithful, even by this, — that there would arise a shoot from the dry and the dying trunk of David’s family, and that a branch would flourish from his despised root, which would restore to God’s people their pristine glory. It is clear from the account there given, that this shoot was Christ, the Redeemer of the world. And then, he added, that he would be raised for a sign to the Gentiles, that might be to them for salvation. The words do indeed differ a little from the Hebrew text; for we read here, <i>arise,</i> while in Hebrew it is <i>stand for a sign,</i> which is the same; for he was to appear conspicuous like a sign. What is here <i>hope,</i> is in Hebrew <i>seek;</i> but according to the most common usage of Scripture, to seek God is nothing else but to hope in him. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(448)</sup></span> </p>
<p>But twice in this prophecy is the calling of the Gentiles confirmed, — by the expression, that Christ was to be raised up as a sign, and he reigns among the faithful alone, — and by the declaration, that they shall hope in Christ, which cannot take place without the preaching of the word and illumination of the Spirit. With these things corresponds the song of Simeon. It may be further added, that hope in Christ is an evidence of his divinity. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(448)</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:10">Isaiah 11:10</span>. The whole of this quotation is given as it is found in the Septuagint. The difference, as noticed by [<u>Calvin</u> ], between the words as given in Hebrew, is considerable. The language of the Prophet is metaphorical, the Septuagint interpreted it, and this interpretation the Apostle approved and adopted. The Messiah is represented by the Prophet as a general or a leader of an army, raising his banner for the nations, (<heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">עמיש</span></blu></heb>, not “people,” as in our version:) and the Gentiles repair or resort to this banner for protection; and so [<u>Lowth</u> ] renders the verb <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">ידרשו</span></blu></heb>, only he does not preserve the metaphor, by rendering <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">אליו</span></blu></heb>, “unto him,” instead of “to it,” as in our version. It hence appears evident, that the passage is substantially the same; and indeed the verb<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἄρχειν,</span></blu></grk> retains in some measure the idea of the original, for it strictly means to be a leader, to rule as a chief. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
