<p><b>15.</b><i>The more boldly, however, have I written to you, etc.</i> The excuse follows, and in adducing this, that he might more fully show his modesty, he says, by way of concession, that he acted boldly in interposing in a matter which they themselves were able to do; but he adds that he was led to be thus bold on account of his office, because he was the minister of the gospel to the Gentiles, and could not therefore pass by them who were also Gentiles. He however thus humbles himself, that he might exalt the excellency of his office; for by mentioning the favor of God, by which he was elevated to that high honor, he shows that he could not suffer what he did according to his apostolic office to be despised. Besides, he denies that he had assumed the part of a teacher, but that of an admonisher, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(452)</sup></span> </p>

Some, like [<u>Origen</u> ], connect the expression with the verb, “I have written to you in part,” that is, not fully, which seems to have no meaning consistently with the evident tenor of the passage. Others, as [<u>Chrysostom</u> ], [<u>Erasmus</u> ], and [<u>Pareus</u> ], connect the words with the adjective, “I have in part (or somewhat) more boldly (or more freely, or more confidently) written to you.” [<u>Macknight</u> ] connects them with the following clause, “partly as calling things to your remembrance.” [<u>Doddridge</u> ] and [<u>Stuart</u> ] render them “in <i>this</i> part of <i>the Epistle</i>. ” The most suitable view is to consider them as qualifying the adjective. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
