<p><b>16.</b><i>Consecrating the gospel, etc.</i> This rendering I prefer to that which [<u>Erasmus</u> ] in the first place adopts, that is, “Administering;” for nothing is more certain than that Paul here alludes to the holy mysteries which were performed by the priest. He then makes himself a chief priest or a priest in the ministration of the gospel, to offer up as a sacrifice the people whom he gained for God, and in this manner he labored in the holy mysteries of the gospel. And doubtless this is the priesthood of the Christian pastor, that is, to sacrifice men, as it were, to God, by bringing them to obey the gospel, and not, as the Papists have hitherto haughtily vaunted, by offering up Christ to reconcile men to God. He does not, however, give here the name of priests to the pastors of the Church simply as a perpetual title, but intending to commend the honor and power of the ministry, Paul availed himself of the opportunity of using this metaphor. Let then the preachers of the gospel have this end in view while discharging their office, even to offer up to God souls purified by faith. </p>
<p>What [<u>Erasmus</u> ] afterwards puts down as being more correct, “sacrificing the gospel,” is not only improper but obscures also the meaning; for the gospel is, on the contrary, like a sword, by which the minister sacrifices men as victims to God. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(453)</sup></span> </p>
<p>He adds that such sacrifices are <i>acceptable</i> to God; which is not only a commendation of the ministry, but also a singular consolation to those who surrender themselves to be thus consecrated. Now as the ancient victims were dedicated to God, having been externally sanctified and washed, so these victims are consecrated to the Lord by the Spirit of holiness, through whose power, inwardly working in them, they are separated from this world. For though the purity of the soul proceeds from faith in the word, yet as the voice of man is in itself inefficacious and lifeless, the work of cleansing really and properly belongs to the Spirit. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(453)</span> “<blu>Consecrans evangelium</blu>,” so [<u>Augustine</u> ]<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">; ἱερουργοῦντα τὸ εὐαγγέλιον,</span></blu></grk> “<blu>operans evangelio</blu> — being employed in the gospel,” [<u>Beza</u> ] and [<u>Pareus</u> ]; “<blu>docens sacrum evangelium</blu> — teaching the holy gospel,” [<u>Vatablus</u> ]. The verb means to “perform sacred rites,” or to officiate in holy things. It has no connection, as some think, with a sacrificing priest; indeed<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἱερεὺς</span></blu></grk> itself, that is a priest, is a holy person, who did sacrifice no doubt among other things, but the word does not import a sacrificer any more than <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">כהן</span></blu></heb> in Hebrew. The word here does not mean to consecrate, or to sanctify, or to sacrifice, but to discharge a holy function. Perhaps the most literal rendering would be “performing a holy office as to the gospel,” but dispensing, administering, or preaching the gospel would be the best version. The Apostle had previously called himself<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">λειτουργὸν,</span></blu></grk> a public functionary, a public minister of Jesus Christ; he now designates his work as such, being a sacred administrator of the gospel, and then he states the object, that the offering of the Gentiles, that is, that the Gentiles being offered, might be an acceptable sacrifice to God, sanctified by the Spirit.
