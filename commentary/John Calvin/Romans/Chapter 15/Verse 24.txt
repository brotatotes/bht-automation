<p><b>24.</b><i>For I hope, etc.</i> He refers to the reason why he had for a long time wished to come to them, and now intended to do so, â€” even that he might see them, enjoy an interview and an intercourse with them, and make himself known to them in his official character; for by the coming of the Apostles the gospel also came. </p>
<p>By saying, to <i>be brought on my way thither by you,</i> he intimates how much he <i>expected</i> from their kindness; and this, as we have already observed, is the best way for conciliating favor; for the more confidence any one hears is reposed in him, the stronger are the obligations under which he feels himself; inasmuch as we deem it base and discourteous to disappoint the good opinion formed of us. And by adding, <i>When I shall first be in part filled, etc.</i>, he bears witness to the benevolence of his mind towards them; and to convince them of this was very necessary for the interest of the gospel. </p>
