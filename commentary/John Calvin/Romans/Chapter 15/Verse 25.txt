<p><b>25.</b><i>But I am going now, etc.</i> Lest they should expect his immediate coming, and think themselves deceived, if he had not come according to their expectation, he declares to them what business he had then in hand, which prevented him from going soon to them, and that was, — that he was going to Jerusalem to bear the alms which had been gathered in Macedonia and Achaia. Availing himself at the same time of this opportunity, he proceeds to commend that contribution; by which, as by a kind of intimation, he stirs them up to follow this example: for though he does not openly ask them, yet, by saying that Macedonia and Achaia had done what they ought to have done, he intimates, that it was also the duty of the Romans, as they were under the same obligation; and that he had this view, he openly confesses to the Corinthians, — </p>
<p>“I boast,” he says, “of your promptitude to all the Churches, that they may be stirred up by your example.”<br/>(<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:2">2 Corinthians 9:2</span>.) </p>
<p>It was indeed a rare instance of kindness, that the Grecians, having heard that their brethren at Jerusalem were laboring under want, considered not the distance at which they were separated from them; but esteeming those sufficiently nigh, to whom they were united by the bond of faith, they relieved their necessities from their own abundance. The word <i>communication,</i> which is here employed, ought to be noticed; for it well expresses the feeling, by which it behooves us to succor the wants of our brethren, even because there is to be a common and mutual regard on account of the unity of the body. I have not rendered the pronoun <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τινὰ</span></blu></grk>, because it is often redundant in Greek, and seems to lessen the emphasis of this passage. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(461)</sup></span> What we have rendered <i>to minister,</i> is in Greek a participle, <i>ministering;</i> but the former seems more fitted to convey the meaning of Paul: for he excuses himself, that by a lawful occupation he was prevented from going immediately to Rome. </p>
