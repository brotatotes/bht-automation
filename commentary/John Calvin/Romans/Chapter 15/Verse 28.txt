<p><b>28.</b><i>And sealed to them this fruit, etc.</i> I disapprove not of what some think, that there is here an allusion to a practice among the ancients, who closed up with their seals what they intended to lay up in safety. Thus Paul commends his own faithfulness and integrity; as though he had said, that he was an honest keeper of the money deposited in his hands, no otherwise than if he carried it sealed up. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(462)</sup></span> — The word <i>fruit</i> seems to designate the produce, which he had before said returned to the Jews from the propagation of the gospel, in a way similar to the land, which by bringing forth fruit supports its cultivator. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(462)</span> More satisfactory is the explanation of [<u>Stuart</u> ] : he says, that the word “sealed” means that the instrument to which a seal is applied is <i>authenticated</i>, <i>made valid, i.e.</i>, “sure to answer the purpose intended. So here the Apostle would not stop short in the performance of his duty, as the almoner of the Churches, until he had seen the actual distribution of their charity.” It seems then that “sealed” here means “secured,” or safely conveyed. “Delivered to them safely,” is the paraphrase of [<u>Hammond</u> ]. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
