<p><b>31.</b><i>That my ministration, etc.</i> Slanderers had so prevailed by their accusations, that he even feared that the present would hardly be acceptable, as coming from his hands, which otherwise, under such a distress, would have been very seasonable. And hence appears his wonderful meekness, for he ceased not to labor for those to whom he doubted whether he would be acceptable. This disposition of mind we ought to imitate, so that we may not cease to do good to those of whose gratitude we are by no means certain. We must also notice that he honors with the name of <i>saints</i> even those by whom he feared he would be suspected, and deemed unwelcome. He also knew that, saints may sometimes be led away by false slanders into unfavorable opinions, and though he knew that they wronged him, he yet ceased not to speak honorably of them. </p>

The words <i>by the will of God</i> remind us how necessary it is to be diligent in prayer, for God alone directs all our ways by his providence. </p>
<p><i>And the God of peace,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(468)</sup></span> <i>etc.</i> From the universal word <i>all,</i> I conclude that he did not simply pray that God would be present with and favor the Romans in a general sense, but that he would rule and guide every one of them. But the word <i>peace</i> refers, I think, to their circumstances at the time, that God, the author of peace, would keep them all united together. </p>
