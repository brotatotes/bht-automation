<p><b>4.</b><i>For whatsoever things, etc.</i> This is an application of the example, lest any one should think, that to exhort us to imitate Christ was foreign to his purpose; “Nay,” he says, “there is nothing in Scripture which is not useful for your instruction, and for the direction of your life.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(440)</sup></span> </p>
<p>This is an interesting passage, by which we understand that there is nothing vain and unprofitable contained in the oracles of God; and we are at the same time taught that it is by the reading of the Scripture that we make progress in piety and holiness of life. Whatever then is delivered in Scripture we ought to strive to learn; for it were a reproach offered to the Holy Spirit to think, that he has taught anything which it does not concern us to know; let us also know, that whatever is taught us conduces to the advancement of religion. And though he speaks of the Old Testament, the same thing is also true of the writings of the Apostles; for since the Spirit of Christ is everywhere like itself, there is no doubt but that he has adapted his teaching by the Apostles, as formerly by the Prophets, to the edification of his people. Moreover, we find here a most striking condemnation of those fanatics who vaunt that the Old Testament is abolished, and that it belongs not in any degree to Christians; for with what front can they turn away Christians from those things which, as Paul testifies, have been appointed by God for their salvation? </p>
<p>But when he adds, <i>that through the patience and the consolation of the Scriptures we might have hope,</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(441)</sup></span> he does not include the whole of that benefit which is to be derived from God’s word; but he briefly points out the main end; for the Scriptures are especially serviceable for this purpose — to raise up those who are prepared by patience, and strengthened by consolations, to the hope of eternal life, and to keep them in the contemplation of it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(442)</sup></span> The word <i>consolation</i> some render exhortation; and of this I do not disapprove, only that consolation is more suitable to patience, for this arises from it; because then only we are prepared to bear adversities with patience, when God blends them with consolation. The patience of the faithful is not indeed that hardihood which philosophers recommend, but that meekness, by which we willingly submit to God, while a taste of his goodness and paternal love renders all things sweet to us: this nourishes and sustains hope in us, so that it fails not. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(440)</span> “The object of this verse is not so much to show the propriety of applying the passage quoted from the Psalms to Christ, as to show that the facts recorded in the Scriptures are designed for our instruction.” — [<u>Hodge</u> ] </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(441)</span> Or, That we might possess, enjoy, or retain hope. He does not describe this hope, it being sufficiently evident — the hope of the gospel. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(442)</span> Some take “patience” apart from “consolation,” — “through patience, and the consolation of the Scriptures;” but what is evidently meant is the patience and consolation which the Scriptures teach and administer, or are the means of supplying; for it is the special object of the passage to show the benefits derived from the Scriptures. Then it is no doubt “consolation,” and not exhortation, though the word has also that meaning; for in the next verse it clearly means consolation. It is thus rendered, and in connection with “patience,” by [<u>Beza</u> ], [<u>Pareus</u> ], [<u>Doddridge</u> ], [<u>Macknight</u> ], etc. </p>
<p>In our version it is “comfort” in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:4">Romans 15:4</span>, and “consolation” in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:5">Romans 15:5</span>; but it would have been better to have retained the same word. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
