<p><b>7.</b><i>Receive ye then, etc.</i> He returns to exhortation; and to strengthen this he still retains the example of Christ. For he, having received, not one or two of us, but all together, has thus connected us, so that we ought to cherish one another, if we would indeed continue in his bosom. Only thus then shall we confirm our calling, that is, if we separate not ourselves from those whom the Lord has bound together. </p>
<p>The words,<i>to the glory of God,</i> may be applied to us only, or to Christ, or to him and us together: of the last I mostly approve, and according to this import, — “As Christ has made known the glory of the Father in receiving us into favor, when we stood in need of mercy; so it behooves us, in order to make known also the glory of the same God, to establish and confirm this union which we have in Christ.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(444)</sup></span> </p>

So [<u>Erasmus</u> ], [<u>Chalmers</u> ], and [<u>Stuart</u> ]. Others regard this “glory” as that which God bestows, even eternal happiness, according to this meaning, — “Receive ye one another into communion and fellowship, as Christ has received you into the glory of God,” that is, into that glorious state which God has provided and promised. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span>. For “you,” our version has “us;” but [<u>Griesbach</u> ] considers “you” as the true reading. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
