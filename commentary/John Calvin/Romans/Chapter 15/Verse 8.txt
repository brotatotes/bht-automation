<p><b>8.</b><i>Now I say, that Jesus Christ, etc.</i> He now shows that Christ has embraced us all, so that he leaves no difference between the Jews and the Gentiles, except that in the first place he was promised to the Jewish nation, and was in a manner peculiarly destined for them, before he was revealed to the Gentiles. But he shows, that with respect to that which was the seed of all contentions, there was no difference between them; for he had gathered them both from a miserable dispersion, and brought them, when gathered, into the Father’s kingdom, that they might be one flock, in one sheepfold, under one shepherd. It is hence right, he declares, that they should continue united together, and not despise one another; for Christ despised neither of them. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(445)</sup></span> </p>
<p>He then speaks first of the Jews, and says, that Christ was sent to them, in order to accomplish the truth of God by performing the promises given to the Fathers: and it was no common honor, that Christ, the Lord of heaven and earth, put on flesh, that he might procure salvation for them; for the more he humbled himself for their sake, the greater was the honor he conferred on them. But this point he evidently assumes as a thing indubitable. The more strange it is, that there is such effrontery in some fanatical heads, that they hesitate not to regard the promises of the Old Testament as temporal, and to confine them to the present world. And lest the Gentiles should claim any <i>excellency</i> above the Jews, Paul <i>expressly</i> declares, that the salvation which Christ has brought belonged by covenant to the Jews; for by his coming he fulfilled what the Father had formerly promised to Abraham, and thus he became the minister of that people. It hence follows that the old covenant was in reality spiritual, though it was annexed to earthly types; for the fulfillment, of which Paul now speaks, must necessarily relate to eternal salvation. And further, lest any one should cavil, and say, that so great a salvation was promised to posterity, when the covenant was deposited in the hand of Abraham, he expressly declares that the promises were made to the Fathers. Either then the benefits of Christ must be confined to temporal things, or the covenant made with Abraham must be extended beyond the things of this world. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(445)</span> The beginning of this verse, “Now I say,” <blu><i>Dico autem</i></blu> <i>,</i> <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Λέγω δὲ,</span></blu></grk> is read by [<u>Beza</u> ] and [<u>Grotius</u> ]<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, Λέγω γὰρ,</span></blu></grk> “For I say,” and [<u>Griesbach</u> ] regards it of nearly equal authority. If we retain<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δὲ,</span></blu></grk> it may be rendered “moreover,” or “further;” and to render the clause more distinct, the word “this,” as proposed by [<u>Beza</u> ] and [<u>Pagninus</u> ], may be added, — “I further say <i>this</i>, ” etc. The two verses may be thus rendered, — </p>
<p><b>8.</b>I further say <i>this</i>, that Christ became a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises <i>made</i> to </p>
<p><b>9.</b>the fathers, and that the Gentiles might glorify God for <i>his</i> mercy, as it is written, “I will therefore confess thee among the nations, and to thy name will I sing.” </p>
<p>The reasons for this rendering are given in the next note. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
