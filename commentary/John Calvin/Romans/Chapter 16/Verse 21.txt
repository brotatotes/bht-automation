<p><b>21.</b><i>Timothy, etc.</i> The salutations which he records, served in part to foster union between those who were far asunder, and in part to make the Romans know that their brethren subscribed to the Epistle; not that Paul had need of the testimony of others, but because the consent of the godly is not of small importance. </p>
<p>The Epistle closes, as we see, with praise and thanksgiving to God. It indeed records the remarkable kindness of God in favoring the Gentiles with the light of the gospel, by which his infinite and unspeakable goodness has been made evident. The conclusion has, at the same time, this to recommend it, — that it serves to raise up and strengthen the confidence of the godly, so that with hearts lifted up to God they may fully expect all those things which are here ascribed to him, and may also confirm their hope as to what is to come by considering his former benefits. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(483)</sup></span> But as he has made a long period, by collecting many things into one passage, the different clauses, implicated by being transposed, must be considered apart. </p>
<p>He ascribes first all the glory to God alone; and then, in order to show that it is rightly due to him, he by the way mentions some of his attributes; whence it appears that he alone is worthy of all praise. He says that he <i>only is wise;</i> which praise, being claimed for him alone, is taken away from all creatures. Paul, at the same time, after having spoken of the secret counsel of God, seems to have designedly annexed this eulogy, in order that he might draw all men to reverence and adore the wisdom of God: for we know how inclined men are to raise a clamor, when they can find out no reason for the works of God. </p>
<p>By adding, that God was <i>able</i> to confirm the Romans, he made them more certain of their final perseverance. And that they might acquiesce more fully in his power, he adds, that a testimony is borne to it in the gospel. Here you see, that the gospel not only promises to us present grace, but also brings to us an assurance of that grace which is to endure for ever; for God declares in it that he is our Father, not only at present,but that he will be so to the end: nay, his adoption extends beyond death, for it will conduct us to an eternal inheritance. </p>
<p>The other things are mentioned to commend the power and dignity of the gospel. He calls the gospel <i>the preaching of Jesus Christ;</i> inasmuch as the whole sum and substance of it is no doubt included in the knowledge of Christ. Its doctrine is <i>the revelation of the mystery;</i> and this its character ought not only to make us more attentive to hear it, but also to impress on our minds the highest veneration for it: and he intimates how sublime a secret it is, by adding that it was hid for many ages, from the beginning of the world. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(484)</sup></span> </p>
<p>It does not indeed contain a turgid and proud wisdom, such as the children of this world seek; and by whom it is held on this account in contempt: but it unfolds the ineffable treasures of celestial wisdom, much higher than all human learning; and since the very angels regard them with wonder, surely none of us can sufficiently admire them. But this wisdom ought not to be less esteemed, because it is conveyed in an humble, plain, and simple style; for thus it has pleased the Lord to bring down the arrogance of the flesh. </p>
<p>And as it might have created some doubt how this mystery, concealed for so many ages, could have so suddenly emerged, he teaches us, that this has not happened through the hasty doings of men, or through chance, but through the eternal ordination of God. Here, also, he closes up the door against all those curious questions which the waywardness of the human mind is wont to raise; for whatever happens suddenly and unexpectedly, they think, happens at random; and hence they absurdly conclude, that the works of God are unreasonable; or at least they entangle themselves in many perplexing doubts. Paul therefore reminds us, that what appeared then suddenly had been decreed by God before the foundation of the world. </p>
<p>But that no one might raise a dispute on the subject, and charge the gospel with being a new thing, and thus defame it, he refers to the prophetic Scriptures, in which we now see, that what is fulfilled had been foretold; for all the Prophets have rendered to the gospel so clear a testimony, that it can in no other way be so fully confirmed. And God thus duly prepared the minds of his people, lest the novelty of what they were not accustomed to should too much astonish them. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(485)</sup></span> </p>
<p>If any one objects and says, that there is an inconsistency in the words of Paul, because he says that the mystery, of which God had testified by his Prophets, was hid throughout all the ages; — the solution of this knot is plainly given by Peter, — that the Prophets, when they sedulously inquired of the salvation made known to us, ministered, not to themselves, but to us. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:12">1 Peter 1:12</span>.) God then was at that time silent, though he spoke; for he held in suspense the revelation of those things concerning which he designed that his servants should prophesy. </p>
<p>Though it is not agreed among the learned in what sense he calls the gospel a hidden mystery in this place, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:9">Ephesians 3:9</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+1:26">Colossians 1:26</span>; yet their opinion has most in its favor, who apply it to the calling of the Gentiles, to which Paul himself expressly refers in his Epistle to the Colossians. Now, though I allow this to be one reason, I yet cannot be brought to believe that it is the only reason. It seems to me more probable that Paul had also a regard to some other differences between the Old and the New Testament. For though the Prophets formerly taught all those things which have been explained by Christ and his Apostles, yet they taught them with so much obscurity, that in comparison with the clear brightness of gospel light, it is no wonder that those things are said to have been hidden which are now made manifest. Nor was it indeed to no purpose that Malachi declared that the Sun of righteousness would arise, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:2">Malachi 4:2</span>;) or that Isaiah had beforehand so highly eulogized the embassy of the Messiah. And lastly, it is not without reason that the gospel is called the kingdom of God: but we may conclude from the event itself, that then only were opened the treasures of celestial wisdom, when God appeared to his ancient people through his only-begotten Son, as it were face to face, all shadows having been done away. He again refers to the end, mentioned at the beginning of the first chapter, for which the gospel is to be preached, — that God may lead all nations to <i>the obedience of faith</i> </p>
<p>PRAISE FOR EVER TO </p>
<p>THE ONLY WISE GOD: </p>
<p>AMEN. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(483)</span> This conclusion bears an evident reference to the point the Apostle had especially in view — the reconciling of the Jews and Gentiles. He connects the gospel with the ancient Scriptures, and mentions the gospel as being in unison with them. Then the Jews had no reason to complain. As in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:17">Romans 16:17</span> to 20 inclusive, he reproved the Gentiles who caused divisions; so in these verses his special object is to put an end to the objections of the Jews. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(484)</span> The words are<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χρόνοις αἰωνίοις</span></blu></grk> <i>,</i> rendered improperly by [<u>Hammond</u> ] and others, from the eternal ages, or eternity. We find them preceded by<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πρὸ</span></blu></grk> <i>before</i>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>, and in <b>Titus 1:2</b>: “before the eternal ages,” could not be right rendering; nor is <i>“before</i> the world began,” as in our version, correct; for a reference in Titus is made to God’s promise. “In the times of the ages” is the rendering of <i>Deza</i> and of [<u>Macknight</u> ] <i>;</i> and, in “ancient times,” is that of [<u>Doddridge</u> ] and [<u>Stuart</u> ] The same subject is handled in two other places, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5">Ephesians 3:5</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+1:26">Colossians 1:26</span>: and the words used by him are “in other ages<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">,” ἑτεραις γενεαῖς,</span></blu></grk> and, “from ages and generations<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">,” ἀπὸ τῶν αἰώνων καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν γενεῶν</span></blu></grk> [<u>Theodoret</u> ] explained the terms by<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἄνωθεν</span></blu></grk> —-in past times; and [<u>Theophylact</u> ] by<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πάλαι—</span></blu></grk> formerly; and [<u>Schleusner</u> ] by a similar word, <i>olim.</i> —<i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(485)</span> This clause is differently construed: some connect <i>“prophetic</i> Scriptures” with “manifested,” or made manifest. So Doddridqe and [<u>Stuart</u> ] <i>;</i> but [<u>Beza</u> ] <i>,</i> [<u>Pareus</u> ] <i>,</i> and [<u>Macknight</u> ] agree with [<u>Calvin</u> ] <i>,</i> and connect the words with “made known” or proclaimed. The conjunetive<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τε</span></blu></grk> after διὰ favors this construction; and<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">διὰ</span></blu></grk> means here “by the means,” or by the aid and sanction, “of the prophetic Scriptures.” Then the meaning is—”that the mystery, hid for ages, is now manifest, that is, by the gospel, and by means of the prophetic Scriptures, and consistently with the decree (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐπιταγὴν</span></blu></grk>) or ordination of the eternal God, is made known to all nations for the obedience of faith.” According to this view is the exposition of [<u>Calvin</u> ] <i>,</i> which is no doubt correct. </p>
<p>But it is more consistent with the tenor of the latter part of this epistle, and with the other passages, such as <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:4">Ephesians 3:4</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+1:26">Colossians 1:26</span>, where he mentions the same mystery, to consider the reference here to be exclusively to the union of Jews and Gentiles, and not generally to the gospel, as [<u>Calvin</u> ] and others have thought. </p>
<p>There is a grammatical difficulty in the last verse: the relative<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ᾦ</span></blu></grk> is found before <i>“glory.”</i> [<u>Beza</u> ] and others considered it redundant. The verse is literally as follows,— </p>
<p><b>27.</b>To the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom <i>be</i> the glory for ever. Amen. </p>
<p>It is omitted in a few copies; several copies have<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">αὐτῷ,</span></blu></grk> which would read better: but its genuineness is rejected by [<u>Griesbach</u> ] and others. The ascription of praise is evidently given to God, as one who has contrived and arranged his dispensation of grace and mercy: and his wisdom here refers to the same thing, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:33">Romans 11:33</span>. However mysterious may his dispensation appear to us with regard to the Jews and Gentiles, in leaving the latter for so long a time in ignorance, in favoring the former only in the first instance with a revelation of himself, and then in showing favor to the Gentiles, and in rejecting the Jews for a time, and afterwards restoring them — however mysterious all these things may appear, the Apostle assures us that they are the arrangements of the only wise God. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
