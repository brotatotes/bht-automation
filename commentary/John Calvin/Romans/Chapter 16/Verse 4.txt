<p><b>4.</b><i>To whom not only I, etc.</i> As Prisca and Aquila had not spared their life for preserving the life of Paul, he testifies that he himself was individually thankful to them: he however adds, that thanks were given them by all the Churches of Christ; and he added this that he might, by such an example, influence the Romans. And deservedly dear and precious to all the Gentiles was the life of such a man, as it was an incomparable treasure: it was therefore no wonder that all the Churches of the Gentiles thought themselves to be under obligations to his preservers. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(472)</sup></span> </p>

They had no churches or temples to meet in; private houses were their churches. Superstitious ideas as to places of worship no doubt led men to seek such following, if he meant only the family, — “Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">σὺν</span></blu></grk> — together with) the Church that is in their house,” <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:19">1 Corinthians 16:19</span>. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
