<p><b>1.</b><i>Therefore inexcusable art thou, O man.</i> ]This reproof is directed against hypocrites, who dazzle the eyes of men by displays of outward sanctity, and even think themselves to be accepted before God, as though they had given him full satisfaction. Hence Paul, after having stated the grosser vices, that he might prove that none are just before God, now attacks saintlings (<blu><i>sanctulos</i></blu> ) of this kind, who could not have been included in the first catalogue. Now the inference is too simple and plain for any one to wonder how the Apostle derived his argument; for he makes them <i>inexcusable,</i> because they themselves knew the judgment of God, and yet transgressed the law; as though he said, “Though thou consented not to the vices of others, and seemest to be avowedly even an enemy and a reprover of vices; yet as thou art not free from them, if thou really examinest thyself, thou canst not bring forward any defense.” </p>
<p><i>For in what thou judgest another, etc.</i> Besides the striking resemblance there is between the two Greek verbs, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κρίνειν</span></blu></grk> and <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κατακρίνειν</span></blu></grk> (to judge and to condemn,) the enhancing of their sin ought to be noticed; for his mode of speaking is the same, as though he said, “Thou art doubly deserving of condemnation; for thou art guilty of the same vices which thou blamest and reprovest in others.” It is, indeed, a well-known saying, — that they who scrutinize the life of others lay claim themselves to innocence, temperance, and all virtues; and that those are not worthy of any indulgence who allow in themselves the same things which they undertake to correct in others. </p>
<p><i>For thou, judging, doest the same things</i>: so it is literally; but the meaning is, “Though thou judgest, thou yet doest the same things.” And he says that they <i>did</i> them, because they were not in a right state of mind; for sin properly belongs to the mind. They then condemned themselves on this account, — because, in reproving a thief, or an adulterer, or a slanderer, they did not merely condemn the persons, but those very vices which adhered to themselves. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(62)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(62)</span> It is confessed by most that the illative<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, διὸ,</span></blu></grk> at the beginning of the verse can hardly be accounted for. The inference from the preceding is not very evident. It is, in my view, an instance of Hebraism; and the reference is not to what has preceded, but to what is to come. It is not properly an illative, but it anticipates a reason afterwards given, conveyed by <i>for,</i> or, <i>because.</i> Its meaning will be seen in the following version: — </p>
<p>On this account, inexcusable art thou, O man, whosoever thou be who condemnest another, because, in what thou condemnest another thou condemnest thyself; for thou who condemnest doest the same things. </p>
<p>The verb<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, κρίνω,</span></blu></grk> has here the idea of condemning, or of passing judgments; to <i>judge</i> is not sufficiently distinct. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
