<p><b>27.</b><i>By the letter and circumcision, etc.</i> A construction <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(85)</sup></span> which means a literal circumcision. He does not mean that they violated the law, because they had the literal circumcision; but because they continued, though they had the outward rite, to neglect the spiritual worship of God, even piety, justice, judgment, and truth, which are the chief matters of the law. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(86)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(85)</span> <i>Hypallage,</i> substitution, a figure of speech, by which a noun or an adjective is put in a form different from its obvious import. — <i>Ed</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(86)</span> The rendering of this clause is rather obscure, “who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law.” The preposition<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, διὰ,</span></blu></grk> has no doubt the meaning of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐν</span></blu></grk> or <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">σύν</span></blu></grk>, as in some other passages, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:11">Romans 4:11</span><grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, δἰ ἀκροβυστίας</span></blu></grk> — in uncircumcision, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:25">Romans 8:25</span><grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, δἰ ῦπομονὢς</span></blu></grk> — in or with patience. Then the version should be, “who, <i>being</i> with, or having, the letter and circumcision, dost transgress the law.” The “letter” means the written law. That this is the meaning is evident from the context. Both [<u>Grotius</u> ] and [<u>Macknight</u> ] give the same construction. It is better to take “letter,” <i>i.e</i>. , the law, and “circumcision” separate, than to amalgamate them by a rhetorical figure, as is done by [<u>Calvin</u> ] and others. [<u>Hodge</u> ] justly says, that this is “more suited to the context, as nothing is said here of spiritual circumcision.” </p>
