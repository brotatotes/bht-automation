<p><b>7.</b><i>To them indeed, who by perseverance, etc.</i>; literally, <i>patience;</i> by which word something more is expressed. For it is perseverance, when one is not wearied in constantly doing good; but patience also is required in the saints, by which they may continue firm, though oppressed with various trials. For Satan suffers them not by a free course to come to the Lord; but he strives by numberless hinderances to impede them, and to turn them aside from the right way. And when he says, that the faithful, by continuing in good works, <i>seek glory and honour,</i> he does not mean that they aspire after any thing else but the favor of God, or that they strive to attain any thing higher, or more excellent: but they can not seek him, without striving, at the same time, for the blessedness of his kingdom, the description of which is contained in the paraphrase given in these words. The meaning then is, — that the Lord will give eternal life to those who, by attention to good works, strive to attain immortality. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(66)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(66)</span> It has appeared to some difficult to reconcile this language with the free salvation which the gospel offers, and to obviate the conclusion which many are disposed to draw from this passage — that salvation is by works as well as by faith. </p>
<p>To this objection [<u>Pareus</u> ] answers, that the Apostle speaks here of salvation by the works of the law, not indeed as a thing possible, which he subsequently denies, but as a declaration of what it is, that he might thereby show the necessity of a gratuitous salvation which is by faith only. And this is the view which Mr. [<u>Haldane</u> ] takes. </p>
<p>But there is no need of having recourse to this hypothesis: for whenever <i>judgment</i> is spoken of even in the New Testament, it is ever represented in the same way, as being regulated in righteousness, according to the works of every individual. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:31">Acts 17:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+3:24">Colossians 3:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="re+20:12">Revelation 20:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="re+22:12">Revelation 22:12</span>. </p>
<p>It will be a<i>judgment</i>, conducted according to the perfect rule of justice, with no respect of persons, with no regard to individuals as such, whether high or low, much or little favored as to outward privileges, but according to what their conduct has been, under the circumstances of their case. The rule, if heathens, will be the law of nature; if Jews, the law which had been given them. Judgment, as to its character, will be still the same to those under the gospel; it will be according to what the gospel requires. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
