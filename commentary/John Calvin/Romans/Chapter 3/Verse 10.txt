<p><b>10.</b><i>As it is written, etc.</i> He has hitherto used proofs or arguments to convince men of their iniquity; he now begins to reason from authority; and it is to Christians the strongest kind of proof, when authority is derived from the only true God. And hence let ecclesiastical teachers learn what their office is; for since Paul asserts here no truth but what he confirms by the sure testimony of Scripture, much less ought such a thing to be attempted by those, who have no other commission but to preach the gospel, which they have received through Paul and others. </p>
<p><i>There is none righteous, etc.</i> The Apostle, who gives the meaning rather than the entire words, seems, in the first place, before he comes to particulars, to state generally the substance of what the Prophet declares to be in man, and that is — <i>that none is righteous;</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(98)</sup></span> he afterwards particularly enumerates the effects or fruits of this unrighteousness. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(98)</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:1">Psalms 14:1</span>. The Hebrew is, “There is none that doeth good;” and the <i>Septuagint,</i> “There is none doing kindness, (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">χρηστότητα</span></blu></grk>), there is not even one, (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὀυκ ἔστιν ἕως ἑνός.</span></blu></grk>)” So that the Apostle quotes the meaning, not the words. </p>
<p>The <i>eleventh</i> verse (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:11">Romans 3:11</span>) is from the same Psalm; the Hebrew, with which the <i>Septuagint</i> agree, except that there is the disjunctive<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἢ</span></blu></grk> between the participles, is the following, — “Whether there is any one who understands, who seeks after God.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
