13.It is further added, Their throat is an open grave; (100) that is, a gulf to swallow up men. It is more than if he had said, that they were devourers (ἀνθρωποφάγους — men-eaters;) for it is an intimation of extreme barbarity, when the throat is said to be so great a gulf, that it is sufficient to swallow down and devour men whole and entire. Theirtongues are deceitful, and, the poison of asps is under their lips, import the same thing, (100) This is from Psalms 5:9, that is, the first part, and is literally the Septuagint, which correctly represents the Hebrew. The last clause is from Psalms 140:3, and is according to the Septuagint, and the Hebrew, too, except that “asps,” or adders, is in the singular number. [Stuart ] gives the import of this figurative language different from [Calvin ] : “As from the sepulchre,” he says, “issues forth an offensive and pestilential vapor; so from the mouths of slanderous persons issue noisome and pestilential words. Their words are like poison, they utter the poisonous breath of slander.” — Ed.
