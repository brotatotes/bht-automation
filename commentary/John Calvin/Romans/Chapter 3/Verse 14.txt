<p><b>14.</b>Then he says, that <i>their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(101)</sup></span> — a vice of an opposite character to the former; but the meaning is, that they are in every way full of wickedness; for if they speak fair, they deceive and blend poison with their flatteries; but if they draw forth what they have in their hearts, bitterness and cursing stream out. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(101)</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+10:7">Psalms 10:7</span>. Paul corrects the order of the words as found in the <i>Septuagint,</i> and gives the Hebrew more exactly, but retains the word “bitterness,” by which the <i>Septuagint</i> have rendered <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">מרמות</span></blu></heb>, which means <i>deceit,</i> or rather, mischievous deceit. Some think that it ought to be <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">מררות</span></blu></heb>, “bitterness;” but there is no copy in its favor. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
