<p><b>4.</b><i>But let God be true, etc.</i> Whatever may be the opinion of others, I regard this as an argument taken from the necessary consequence of what is opposed to it, by which Paul invalidates the preceding objection. For since these two things stand together, yea, necessarily accord, that God is true and that man is false, it follows that the truth of God is not nullified by the falsehood of men; for except he did now set those two things in opposition, the one to the other, he would afterwards have in vain labored to refute what was absurd, and show how God is just, though he manifests his justice by our unjustice. Hence the meaning is by no means ambiguous, — that the faithfulness of God is so far from being nullified by the perfidy and apostasy of men that it thereby becomes more evident. “<i>God</i>, ” he says, “<i>is true,</i> not only because he is prepared to stand faithfully to his promises, but because he also really fulfills whatever he declares; for he so speaks, that his command becomes a reality. On the other hand, <i>man is false,</i> not only because he often violates his pledged faith, but because he naturally seeks falsehood and shuns the truth.” </p>
<p>The first clause contains the primary axiom of all Christian philosophy; the latter is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+116:11">Psalms 116:11</span>, where David confesses that there is nothing certain from man or in man. </p>
<p>Now this is a remarkable passage, and contains a consolation that is much needed; for such is the perversity of men in rejecting and despising God’s word, that its truth would be often doubted were not this to come to our minds, that God’s verity depends not on man’s verity. But how does this agree with what has been said previously — that in order to make the divine promise effectual, faith, which receives it, is on the part of men necessary? for faith stands opposed to falsehood. This seems, indeed, to be a difficult question; but it may with no great difficulty be answered, and in this way — the Lord, notwithstanding the lies of men, and though these are hinderances to his truth, does yet find a way for it through a pathless track, that he may come forth a conqueror, and that is, by correcting in his elect the inbred unbelief of our nature, and by subjecting to his service those who seem to be unconquerable. It must be added, that the discourse here is concerning the corruption of nature, and not the grace of God, which is the remedy for that corruption. </p>
<p><i>That thou mightest be justified, etc.</i> The sense is, So far is it that the truth of God is destroyed by our falsehood and unfaithfulness, that it thereby shines forth and appears more evident, according to the testimony of David, who says, that as he was sinner, God was a just and righteous Judge in whatever he determined respecting him, and that he would overcome all the calumnies of the ungodly who murmured against his righteousness. By the <i>words</i> of God, David means the judgments which he pronounces upon us; for the common application of these to promises is too strained: and so the particle <i>that,</i> is not so much final, nor refers to a far-fetched consequence, but implies an inference according to this purport, “Against thee have I sinned; justly then dost thou punish me.” And that Paul has quoted this passage according to the proper and real meaning of David, is clear from the objection that is immediately added, “How shall the righteousness of God remain perfect if our iniquity illustrates it?” For in vain, as I have already observed, and unseasonable has Paul arrested the attention of his readers with this difficulty, except David meant, that God, in his wonderful providence, elicited from the sins of men a praise to his own righteousness. The second clause in Hebrew is this, “And that thou mightest be pure in thy judgment;” which expression imports nothing else but that God in all his judgments is worthy of praise, how much soever the ungodly may clamor and strive by their complaints disgracefully to efface his glory. But Paul has followed the Greek version, which answered his purpose here even better. We indeed know that the Apostles in quoting Scripture often used a freer language than the original; for they counted it enough to quote what was suitable to their subject: hence they made no great account of words. </p>
<p>The application then of this passage is the following: Since all the sins of mortals must serve to illustrate the glory of the Lord, and since he is especially glorified by his truth, it follows, that even the falsehood of men serves to confirm rather than to subvert his truth. Though the word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κρίνεσθαι</span></blu></grk>, may be taken actively as well as passively, yet the Greek translators, I have no doubt, rendered it passively, contrary to the meaning of the Prophet. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(91)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(91)</span> Whenever there is a material agreement between the Greek and the Hebrew, we ought not to make it otherwise. If the verb<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κρίνεσθαι,</span></blu></grk> as admitted by most critics, may be taken actively and be thus made to agree with the Hebrew, what reason can there be to take it in another sense? The only real difference is in one word, between<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">νικήσης,</span></blu></grk> “overcomest,” and <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">תזכה</span></blu></heb>, “art clear:” but the meaning is the same, though the words are different. To overcome in judgment, and to be clear in judgment, amounts to the same thing. The parallelism of the Hebrew requires<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κρίνεσθαι</span></blu></grk> to be a verb in the middle voice, and to have an active meaning. The two lines in Hebrew, as it is often the case in Hebrew poetry, contain the same sentiment in different words, the last line expressing it more definitely; so that to be “justified,” and to be “cleared,” convey the same idea; and also “in thy word,” or saying — <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">בדברך</span></blu></heb> and “in thy judgment” <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">בשפטך</span></blu></heb>. In <i>many</i> copies both these last words are in the plural number, so that the first would be strictly what is here expressed, “in thy words,” that is, the words which thou hast declared; and “in thy judgments,” that is, those which thou hast announced, would be fully rendered by “when thou Judgest.” </p>
<p>Commentators, both ancient and modern, have differed on the meaning of the verb in question. [<u>Pareus</u> ] <i>,</i> [<u>Beza</u> ] <i>,</i> [<u>Macknight</u> ] <i>,</i> and [<u>Stuart</u> ] <i>,</i> take it in an active sense; while [<u>Erasmus</u> ] <i>,</i> [<u>Grotius</u> ] <i>,</i> [<u>Venema</u> ] <i>,</i> and others, contend for the passive meaning. [<u>Drusius</u> ] <i>,</i> [<u>Hammond</u> ] <i>,</i> and [<u>Doddridge</u> ] render it, “when thou contendest in judgment,” or, “when thou art called to judgment:” and such a meaning no doubt the verb has according to <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:40">Matthew 5:40</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:1">1 Corinthians 6:1</span>. But in this case regard must be had, especially to the meaning which corresponds the nearest with the original Hebrew. Some have maintained that “in thy judgment” <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">בשפטך</span></blu></heb> may be rendered “in judging thee;” but this would not only be unusual and make the sentence hardly intelligible, but also destroy the evident parallelism of the two lines. The whole verse may be thus literally rendered from the Hebrew, — </p>
<p>Against thee, against thee only have I sinned;<br>And the evil before thine eyes have I done;<br/>So that thou art justified in thy words,<br/><i>And</i> clear in thy judgments. </br></p>
<p>The conjunction <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">למען</span></blu></heb>, admits of being rendered <i>so that;</i> see <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+30:12">Psalms 30:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+41:20">Isaiah 41:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="am+2:7">Amos 2:7</span>; and<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὅπως</span></blu></grk> in many instances may be thus rendered; see <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:35">Luke 2:35</span>. It is what [<u>Schleusner</u> ] designates<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐκβατικῶς,</span></blu></grk> signifying the issue or the event. </p>
<p>[<u>Pareus</u> ] connects the passage differently. He considers the former part of the verse parenthetic, or as specifying what is generally stated in the previous verse, the third; and with that verse he connects this passage: so that the rendering of the two verses would be the following, — </p>
<p><b>3.</b>For my transgression I acknowledge, And my sin is before me continually, — </p>
<p><b>4.</b>(Against thee, against thee only have I sinned, and the evil before thine eyes have I done,) That thou mightest be justified in thy saying, <i>And</i> clear in thy judgment. </p>
<p>This is certainty more probable than what [<u>Vatablus</u> ] and [<u>Houbigant</u> ] propose, who connect the passage with the second verse, “Wash me thoroughly,” etc. But the sense given by [<u>Calvin</u> ] is the most satisfactory — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
