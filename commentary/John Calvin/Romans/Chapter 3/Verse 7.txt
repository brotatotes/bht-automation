<p><b>7.</b><i>If indeed</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(92)</sup></span> <i>the truth of God, etc.</i> This objection, I have no doubt, is adduced in the person of the ungodly; for it is a sort of an explanation of the former verse, and would have been connected with it, had not the Apostle, moved with indignation, broken off the sentence in the middle. The meaning of the objection is — “If by our unfaithfulness the truth of God becomes more conspicuous, and in a manner confirmed, and hence more glory redounds to him, it is by no means just, that he, who serves to display God’s glory, should be punished as a sinner.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(93)</sup></span> </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(93)</span> It is remarkable how the Apostle changes his words from the third verse to the end of this, while the same things are essentially meant.
