<p><b>20.</b><i>Nor did he through unbelief make an inquiry</i>, <i>etc.</i> Though I do not follow the old version, nor [<u>Erasmus</u> ], yet my rendering is not given without reason. The Apostle seems to have had this in view, — That Abraham did not try to find out, by weighing the matter in the balance of unbelief, whether the Lord was able to perform what he had promised. What is properly to inquire or to search into anything, is to examine it through diffidence or mistrust, and to be unwilling to admit what appears not credible, without thoroughly sifting it. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(146)</sup></span> He indeed asked, how it could come to pass, but that was the asking of one astonished; as the case was with the virgin Mary, when she inquired of the angel how could that be which he had announced; and there are other similar instances. The saints then, when a message is brought them respecting the works of God, the greatness of which exceeds their comprehension, do indeed burst forth into expressions of wonder; but from this wonder they soon pass on to lay hold on the power of God: on the contrary, the wicked, when they examine a message, scoff at and reject it as a fable. Such, as you will find, was the case with the Jews, when they asked Christ how he could give his flesh to be eaten. For this reason it was, that Abraham was not reproved when he laughed and asked, how could a child be born to a man an hundred years old, and to a woman of ninety; for in his astonishment he fully admitted the power of God’s word. On the other hand, a similar laughter and inquiry on the part of Sarah were not without reproof, because she regarded not the promise as valid. </p>
<p>If these things be applied to our present subject, it will be evident, that the justification of Abraham had no other beginning than that of the Gentiles. Hence the Jews reproach their own father, if they exclaim against the call of the Gentiles as a thing unreasonable. Let us also remember, that the condition of us all is the same with that of Abraham. All things around us are in opposition to the promises of God: He promises immortality; we are surrounded with mortality and corruption: He declares that he counts us just; we are covered with sins: He testifies that he is propitious and kind to us; outward judgments threaten his wrath. What then is to be done? We must with closed eyes pass by ourselves and all things connected with us, that nothing may hinder or prevent us from believing that God is true. </p>
<p><i>But he was strengthened</i>, <i>etc.</i> This is of the same import with a former clause, when it is said, that he was not weak in faith. It is the same as though he had said, that he overcame unbelief by the constancy and firmness of faith. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(147)</sup></span> No one indeed comes forth a conqueror from this contest, but he who borrows weapons and strength from the word of God. From what he adds, <i>giving glory to God</i>, it must be observed, that no greater honor can be given to God, than by faith to seal his truth; as, on the other hand, no greater dishonor can be done to him, than to refuse his offered favor, or to discredit his word. It is hence the chief thing in honoring God, obediently to embrace his promises: and true religion begins with faith. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(146)</span> The verb is<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">διεκρίθη,</span></blu></grk> which Calvin renders “<blu>disquisivit</blu>.” The most common meaning of the verb is to hesitate, to doubt: it has the sense of exploring and examining, in the active voice, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:31">1 Corinthians 11:31</span>, but not in the passive — See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:21">Matthew 21:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:23">Mark 11:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:20">Acts 10:20</span>. The version of [<u>Pareus</u> ] is, “<blu>non disceptavit</blu> — he disputed not,” and also of [<u>Macknight</u> ] But the fathers, and many moderns, such as [<u>Beza</u> ], [<u>Hammond</u> ], [<u>Stuart</u> ], and others, have rendered the sentence, “He doubted not:” [<u>Phavorinus</u> ] says, as quoted by [<u>Poole</u> ], that<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">διακρίνεσθαι,</span></blu></grk> is to doubt, to hesitate, to dispute, to distrust, (<blu><i>diffidere</i></blu> .) — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(147)</span> “Doubt,” says [<u>Pareus</u> ], has two arguments — <i>will</i> God do this? and <i>can</i> God do this? Faith has also two arguments — God <i>will</i> do it, because He has promised; and he <i>can</i> do it, because He is omnipotent.” </p>
