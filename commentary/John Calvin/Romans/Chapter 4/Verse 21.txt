<p><b>21.</b><i>That what he had promised</i>, <i>etc.</i> As all men acknowledge God’s power, Paul seems to say nothing very extraordinary of the faith of Abraham; but experience proves, that nothing is more uncommon, or more difficult, than to ascribe to God’s power the honor which it deserves. There is in deed no obstacle, however small and insignificant, by which the flesh imagines the hand of God is restrained from working. Hence it is, that in the slightest trials, the promises of God slide away from us. When there is no contest, it is true, no one, as I have said, denies that God can do all things; but as soon as anything comes in the way to impede the course of God’s promise, we cast down God’s power from its eminence. Hence, that it may obtain from us its right and its honor, when a contest comes, we ought to determine thus, — That it is no less sufficient to overcome the obstacles of the world, than the strong rays of the sun are to dissipate the mists. We are indeed wont ever to excuse ourselves, that we derogate nothing from God’s power, whenever we hesitate respecting his promises, and we commonly say, “The thought, that God promises more in his word than he can perform, (which would be a falsehood and blasphemy against him,) is by no means the cause of our hesitation; but that it is the defect which we feel in ourselves.” But we do not sufficiently exalt the power of God, unless we think it to be greater than our weakness. Faith then ought not to regard our weakness, misery, and defects, but to fix wholly its attention on the power of God alone; for if it depends on our righteousness or worthiness, it can never ascend to the consideration of God’s power. And it is a proof of the unbelief, of which he had before spoken, when we mete the Lord’s power with our own measure. For faith does not think that God can do all things, while it leaves him sitting still, but when, on the contrary, it regards his power in continual exercise, and applies it, especially, to the accomplishment of his word: for the hand of God is ever ready to execute whatever he has declared by his mouth. </p>
<p>It seems strange to me, that [<u>Erasmus</u> ] approved of the relative in the masculine gender; for though the sense is not changed, we may yet come nearer to the Greek words of Paul. The verb, I know, is passive; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(148)</sup></span> but the abruptness may be lessened by a little change. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(148)</span> The verb is<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, ἐπήγγελται,</span></blu></grk> used here, and perhaps in one other place, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:26">Hebrews 12:26</span>, in an active sense. It is usually found, in the sense of promising, in the middle voice, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:11">Mark 14:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:5">Acts 7:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:13">Hebrews 6:13</span>, etc. It is an anomaly that is to be met with sometimes in Greek authors. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
