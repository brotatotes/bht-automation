<p><b>22.</b><i>And it was therefore imputed</i>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(149)</sup></span> <i>etc.</i> It becomes now more clear, how and in what manner faith brought righteousness to Abraham; and that was, because he, leaning on God’s word, rejected not the promised favor. And this connection of faith with the word ought to be well understood and carefully remembered; for faith can bring us nothing more than what it receives from the word. Hence he does not become immediately just, who is imbued only with a general and confused idea that God is true, except he reposes on the promise of his favor. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(149)</span> As in a former instance in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3">Romans 4:3</span>, there is no nominative case to this verb: it is supplied by the sentence. This is the case not unfrequently in languages, such as Greek and Hebrew, in which the person is included in the verb itself. There is no nominative in the Welsh version, and there seems to be no need of it, <heb><blu>(lang. we)</blu> <blu><i>Amhyny y cyvrivwyd iddo yn gyviawnder</i></blu></heb> </p>
<p>“It is most true, as Paul says to the Romans, that by faith Abraham was justified, and not by <i>obedience</i>: but it is just as true what he says to the Hebrews, that it was by faith that Abraham obeyed.” — [<u>Chalmers</u> ]. </p>
