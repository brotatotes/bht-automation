<p><b>18.</b><i>Therefore</i>, <i>etc.</i> This is a defective sentence; it will be complete if the words <i>condemnation</i> and <i>justification</i> be read in the nominative case; as doubtless you must do in order to complete the sense. We have here the general conclusion from the preceding comparison; for, omitting the mention of the intervening explanation, he now completes the comparison, “As by the offense of one we were made (<blu><i>constitute</i></blu> ) sinners; so the righteousness of Christ is efficacious to justify us. He does not say the righteousness — <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δικαιοσύνην</span></blu></grk>, but the justification — <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δικαίωμα</span></blu></grk>, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(173)</sup></span> of Christ, in order to remind us that he was not as an individual just for himself, but that the righteousness with which he was endued reached farther, in order that, by conferring this gift, he might enrich the faithful. He makes this favor common to all, because it is propounded to all, and not because it is in reality extended to all; for though Christ suffered for the sins of the whole world, and is offered through God’s benignity indiscriminately to all, yet all do not receive him. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(174)</sup></span> </p>
<p>These two words, which he had before used, <i>judgment</i> and <i>grace</i>, may be also introduced here in this form, “As it was through God’s judgment that the sin of one issued in the condemnation of many, so grace will be efficacious to the justification of many.” <i>Justification of life</i> is to be taken, in my judgment, for remission, which restores life to us, as though he called it life-giving. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(175)</sup></span> For whence comes the hope of salvation, except that God is propitious to us; and we must be just, in order to be accepted. Then life proceeds from justification. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(176)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(173)</span> The meaning of this word is evident here; for it stands in contrast with<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">παράπτωμα</span></blu></grk> — offense or transgression, in the former clause, and is identical in sense with<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὑπακόη</span></blu></grk> — obedience, in the next verse. It means what is <i>appointed</i> and adjudged as right; and hence it is rendered “ordinance,” <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:6">Luke 1:6</span>; “judgment,” <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:32">Romans 1:32</span>; and, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16">Romans 5:16</span>, “justification,” when it stands opposed to<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κατάκριμα</span></blu></grk> — condemnation, and means absolution, acquittal, as the determination of the judge. It signifies here, that what Christ did was according to God’s appointment; it was something directly contrary to offense or transgression; and what it was is explained in the next verse by the word “obedience.” [<u>Wolfius</u> ] says, that<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δικαίωμα</span></blu></grk> is the satisfaction of Christ, or his active and passive obedience, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:19">Romans 5:19</span>, — that<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δικαιοσύνη</span></blu></grk> is the merit of Christ, obtained by has death and applied to us by faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:22">Romans 3:22</span>, — and that<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δικαίωσις</span></blu></grk> is the act of justification which follows from the satisfaction of Christ, apprehended by faith. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(174)</span> “<blu>Nam etsi passus est Christus pro peccatis totius mundi. atque omnibus indifferenter Dei benignitate offertur; non tamen omnes apprehendum</blu>.” It appears from this sentence that [<u>Calvin</u> ] held general redemption. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(175)</span> It is an Hebraistic form of speaking, <blu><i>genitivus effectûs</i></blu> Its meaning is that it is a justification unto life, whose end is life, or, which issues in life, that is, eternal life, according to its import in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>, when reigning in life<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">— ἐν ζωὟ,</span></blu></grk> is spoken of; and the word “eternal,” is added to it in the last verse. This life commences with justification, and therefore this view includes what [<u>Calvin</u> ] says, though it extends farther. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(176)</span> In our version are introduced “judgment” and “free-gift,” from verse 16; and it is what has been done by most interpreters. The words are found here in no MSS.; but there is another reading countenanced by four MSS., as given by [<u>Griesbach</u> ], and two of them ancient; the word for offense is put in the nominative case<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, τὸ παράπτωμα,</span></blu></grk> and the word for righteousness the same<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, τὸ δικαίωμα.</span></blu></grk> Then the reading would be — </p>
<p><b>18.</b>So then, as through one the transgression <i>was</i>, as to all men, unto condemnation; so also through one the righteousness <i>is</i>, as to all men, unto justification of life. </p>
<p>This agrees better with the following verse, though the meaning is substantially the same with what is given in our version. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
