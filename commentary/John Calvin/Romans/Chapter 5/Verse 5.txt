<p><b>5.</b><i>Hope maketh not ashamed, etc.</i>; <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(156)</sup></span> that is, it regards salvation as most certain. It hence appears, that the Lord tries us by adversities for this end, — that our salvation may thereby be gradually advanced. Those evils then cannot render us miserable, which do in a manner promote our happiness. And thus is proved what he had said, that the godly have reasons for glorying in the midst of their afflictions. </p>
<p><i>For the love of God</i>, <i>etc.</i> I do not refer this only to the last sentence, but to the whole of the preceding passage. I therefore would say, — that by tribulations we are stimulated to patience, and that patience finds an experiment of divine help, by which we are more encouraged to entertain hope; for however we may be pressed and seem to be nearly consumed, we do not yet cease to feel God’s favor towards us, which affords the richest consolation, and much more abundant than when all things happen prosperously. For as that happiness, which is so in appearance, is misery itself, when God is adverse to and displeased with us; so when he is propitious, even calamities themselves will surely be turned to a prosperous and a joyful issue. Seeing all things must serve the will of the Creator, who, according to his paternal favor towards us, (as Paul declares in the eighth chapter,) overrules all the trials of the cross for our salvation, this knowledge of divine love towards us is instilled into our hearts to the Spirit of God; for the good things which God has prepared for his servants are hid from the ears and the eyes and the minds of men, and the Spirit alone is he who can reveal them. And the word<i>diffused</i>, is very emphatical; for it means that the revelation of divine love towards us is so abounding that it fills our hearts; and being thus spread through every part of them, it not only mitigates sorrow in adversities, but also, like a sweet seasoning, it renders tribulations to be loved by us. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(157)</sup></span> </p>
<p>He says further, that the Spirit is <i>given</i>, that is, bestowed through the gratuitous goodness of God, and not conferred for our merits; according to what [<u>Augustine</u> ] has well observed, who, though he is mistaken in his view of the love of God, gives this explanation, — that we courageously bear adversities, and are thus confirmed in our hope, because we, having been regenerated by the Spirit, do love God. It is indeed a pious sentiment, but not what Paul means: for love is not to be taken here in an active but a passive sense. And certain it is, that no other thing is taught by Paul than that the true fountain of all love is, when the faithful are convinced that they are loved by God, and that they are not slightly touched with this conviction, but have their souls thoroughly imbued with it. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(156)</span> [<u>Chalmers</u> ] observes, that there are two hopes mentioned in this passage, — the hope of faith in the second verse, and the hope of experience in this. “The hope of the fourth verse,” he says, “is distinct from and posterior to the hope of the second; and it also appears to be derived from another source. The first hope is hope in believing, a hope which hangs direct on the testimony of God...The second hope is grounded on distinct considerations — not upon what the believer sees to be in the testimony of God, but upon what he finds to be in himself. — It is the fruit not of faith, but of experience; and is gathered not from the word that is without, but from the feeling of what passes within.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(157)</span> “The love of God” in this passage may mean either the love of which God is the object — love to God, or the love which he possesses — God’s love to us: the <blu><i>usus loquendi</i></blu> would admit either of these meanings; and hence commentators have differed on the point. The expression<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, τὴν ἀγάπην τοῦ Θεοῦ,</span></blu></grk> in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:42">Luke 12:42</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:42">John 5:42</span>, and in other places, means “love to God<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">;” ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ,</span></blu></grk> in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:9">1 John 4:9</span>, signifies clearly the love of God to us. The meaning then can alone be ascertained by the context and by the wording of the sentence. It stands connected with Christian graces, patience and hope; and this favors the first view, that it is love to God produced within by the Spirit. Then the verb<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, ἐκκέχυται</span></blu></grk> — is poured out or poured forth, seems more suitable to the idea of love being communicated as a gift, or as a holy feeling within. It is further what prevents hope from being disappointed; it is some good or enjoyment that now strengthens and satisfies hope; and to love God who first loved us is to realize in a measure what hope expects; and when it is said that it is diffused by the Spirit, we are reminded of what Paul says in (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</span>, that “love” is one of the fruits of the Spirit. But it may, on the other hand, be alleged, that the verse stands connected with what follows, as the next verse begins with “for,” and that the subsequent context most clearly refers to the love of God to us; and this evidently decides the question. </p>
<p>The first view, our love to God, has been adopted by [<u>Augustine</u> ], [<u>Mede</u> ], [<u>Doddridge</u> ], [<u>Scott</u> ], and [<u>Stuart</u> ] <i>;</i> and the other, God’s love to us, by [<u>Chrysostom</u> ], [<u>Beza</u> ], [<u>Pareus</u> ], [<u>Grotius</u> ], [<u>Hodge</u> ], and [<u>Chalmers</u> ], and also by [<u>Schleusner</u> ] who gives this paraphrase, “<blu>Amor Dei abunde nobis declaratus est</blu> — the love of God is abundantly declared to us.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
