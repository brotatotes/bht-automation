<p><b>7.</b><i>For a just man</i>, <i>etc.</i> The meaning of the passage has constrained me to render the particle <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">γὰρ</span></blu></grk> as an affirmative or declarative rather than as a causative. The import of the sentence is this, “Most rare, indeed, is such an example to be found among men, that one dies for a just man, though this may sometimes happen: but let this be granted, yet for an ungodly man none will be found willing to die: this is what Christ has done.” <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(160)</sup></span> Thus it is an illustration, derived from a comparison; for such an example of kindness, as Christ has exhibited towards us, does not exist among men. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(160)</span> [<u>Calvin</u> ] has omitted what is said of the “good” man; for whom, it is said, one would perhaps even dare to die. The “just<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">,” δίκαιος,</span></blu></grk> is he who acts according to what justice requires, and according to what the Rabbins say, “What is mine is mine, and what is thine is thine,” <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">שלי</span></blu> <blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">שלי</span></blu> <blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">ושלך</span></blu> <blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">שלך</span></blu></heb> : but the “good<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">,” ἀγαθὸς,</span></blu></grk> is the kind, the benevolent, the beneficient, called <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">טוב</span></blu></heb> in Hebrew; who is described by [<u>Cicero</u> ] as one who does good to those to whom he can, (<blu>vir bonus est is, qui prodest quibus potest</blu>.) </p>
<p>There is here an evident contrast between these words and those employed in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6">Romans 5:6</span>, to designate the character of those for whom Christ died. The just<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, δίκαιος,</span></blu></grk> is the opposite of the “ungodly<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">,” ἀσέβης;</span></blu></grk> who, by not worshipping and honoring God, is guilty of injustice of the highest kind, and in this sense of being unjust it is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:5">Romans 4:5</span>, where God is said to “justify the ungodly,” that is, him who is unjust by withholding from God the homage which rightly belongs to him. [<u>Phavorinus</u> ] gives<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀθέμιτος,</span></blu></grk> unlawful, unjust, as one of its meanings. — What forms a contrast with “good” is sinner<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, ἁμαρτωλός,</span></blu></grk> which often means wicked, mischievous, one given to vice and the doing of evil. [<u>Suidas</u> ] describes<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἁμαρτωλοί</span></blu></grk> as those who determine to live in transgression<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, οἱ παρανομίᾳ συζὢν προαιρούμενοι;</span></blu></grk> and [<u>Schleusner</u> ] gives “<blu>scelestus</blu> — wicked,” “<blu>flagitiosus</blu> — full of mischief,” as being sometimes its meaning. </p>
<p>But the description goes farther, for in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:10">Romans 5:10</span> the word “enemies<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐχθροὶ,</span></blu></grk> ” is introduced in order to complete the character of those for whom Christ died. They were not only “ungodly,” and therefore unjust towards God, and “wicked,” given to all evils; but also “enemies,” entertaining hatred to God, and carrying on war, as it were, against him. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
