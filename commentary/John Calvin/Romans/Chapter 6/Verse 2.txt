<p><b>2.</b><i>By no means.</i> To some the Apostle seems to have only intended indignantly to reprove a madness so outrageous; but it appears from other places that he commonly used an answer of this kind, even while carrying on a long argument; as indeed he does here, for he proceeds carefully to disprove the propounded slander. He, however, first rejects it by an indignant negative, in order to impress it on the minds of his readers, that nothing can be more inconsistent than that the grace of Christ, the repairer of our righteousness, should nourish our vices. </p>
<p><i>Who have died to sin, etc.</i> An argument derived from what is of an opposite character. “He who sins certainly lives to sin; we have died to sin through the grace of Christ; then it is false, that what abolishes sin gives vigor to it.” The state of the case is really this, — that the faithful are never reconciled to God without the gift of regeneration; nay, we are for this end justified, — that we may afterwards serve God in holiness of life. Christ indeed does not cleanse us by his blood, nor render God propitious to us by his expiation, in any other way than by making us partakers of his Spirit, who renews us to a holy life. It would then be a most strange inversion of the work of God were sin to gather strength on account of the grace which is offered to us in Christ; for medicine is not a feeder of the disease, which it destroys. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(183)</sup></span> We must further bear in mind, what I have already referred to — that Paul does not state here what God finds us to be, when he calls us to an union with his Son, but what it behoves us to be, after he has had mercy on us, and has freely adopted us; for by an adverb, denoting a future time, he shows what kind of change ought to follow righteousness. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(183)</span> This phrase, “died to sin,” is evidently misapprehended by [<u>Haldane</u> ] Having been offended, and justly so, by an unguarded and erroneous expression of [<u>Stuart</u> ], derived from [<u>Chrysostom</u> ], and by the false rendering of [<u>Macknight</u> ], he went to another extreme, and maintained, that to die, or to be dead to sin, means to be freed from its guilt, while the whole context proves, that it means deliverance from its power as a master, from the servitude or bondage of sin. To live in it, does not mean to live under its guilt, but in its service and under its ruling power; and this is what the Apostle represents as a contrast to being dead to sin. Not to “serve sin,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>, is its true explanation. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:11">Romans 6:11</span>. </p>
<p>The very argument requires this meaning. The question in the first verse, — Shall we continue in sin?” does not surely mean — shall we continue in or under the guilt of sin? but in its service, and in the practice of it. It was the chapter of practical licentiousness that the Apostle rebuts; and he employs an argument suitable to the purpose, “If we are dead to sin, freed from it as our master, how absurd it is to suppose that we can live any longer in its service?” Then he shows in what follows how this had been effected. This is clearly the import of the passage, and so taken by almost all commentators. </p>
<p>But it must be added, that [<u>Venema</u> ] and [<u>Chalmers</u> ] materially agree with [<u>Haldane</u> ] The former says that to “die to sin” is to give to sin what it demands and that is, death; and that when this is given, it can require nothing more. In this sense, he adds, Christ died to sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:10">Romans 6:10</span>); and in the same sense believers die to sin, being, as they are, united to Christ, his death being viewed as their death. However true this theology may be, (and [<u>Chalmers</u> ] shows this in his own inimitable manner,) it does not seem to be taught here: though there may be something in one or two expressions to favor it; yet the whole tenor of the passage, and many of the phrases, seem clearly to constrain us to adopt the other view. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
