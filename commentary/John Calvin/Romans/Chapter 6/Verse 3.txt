<p><b>3.</b><i>Know ye not</i>, <i>etc.</i> What he intimated in the last verse — that Christ destroys sin in his people, he proves here by mentioning the effect of baptism, by which we are initiated into his faith; for it is beyond any question, that we put on Christ in baptism, and that we are baptized for this end — that we may be one with him. But Paul takes up another principle — that we are then really united to the body of Christ, when his death brings forth in us its fruit; yea, he teaches us, that this fellowship as to death is what is to be mainly regarded in baptism; for not washing alone is set forth in it, but also the putting to death and the dying of the old man. It is hence evident, that when we become partakers of the grace of Christ, immediately the efficacy of his death appears. But the benefit of this fellowship as to the death of Christ is described in what follows. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(184)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(184)</span> “Baptized into (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἰς</span></blu></grk>) Christ,” “baptized into (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἰς</span></blu></grk>) Moses,” <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:2">1 Corinthians 10:2</span>, “baptized into (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἰς</span></blu></grk>) one body,” <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</span>, are all the same forms of expression, and must mean, that by the rite of baptism a professed union is made, and, in the two first instances, a submission to the authority exercised is avowed. By “baptized into his death,” we are to understand, “baptized,” in order to die with him, or to die as he died; not that the death is the same; for it is a like death, as it is expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:5">Romans 6:5</span>, as the resurrection is a like resurrection. His death was natural, ours is spiritual; the same difference holds as to the resurrection. It is the<i>likeness</i> that is throughout to be regarded; and this is the key to the whole passage. It is true, that through the efficacy of Christ’s death alone the death of his people takes place, and through the operation of his Spirit; but to teach this is not the design of the Apostle here; his object seems to be merely to show that a change takes place in every true Christian, symbolized by baptism, and that this change bears a likeness to the death and resurrection of our Savior. He speaks of baptism here not merely as a symbol, but as including what it symbolizes; as he does in a similar passage, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+2:11">Colossians 2:11</span>, where he refers to this change, first under the symbol of circumcision, and then of baptism; which clearly proves that the same thing is signified by both. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
