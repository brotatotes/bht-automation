<p><b>7.</b><i>For he who has died</i>, <i>etc.</i> This is an argument derived from what belongs to death or from its effect. For if death destroys all the actions of life, we who have died to sin ought to cease from those actions which it exercised during its life. Take <i>justified</i> for freed or reclaimed from bondage; for as he is freed from the bond of a charge, who is absolved by the sentence of a judge; so death, by freeing us from this life, sets us free from all its functions. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(189)</sup></span> </p>
<p>But though among men there is found no such example, there is yet no reason why you should think, that what is said here is a vain speculation, or despond in your minds, because you find not yourselves to be of the number of those who have wholly crucified the flesh; for this work of God is not completed in the day in which it is begun in us; but it gradually goes on, and by daily advances is brought by degrees to its end. So then take this as the sum of the whole, — “If thou art a Christian, there must appear in thee an evidence of a fellowship as to the death of Christ; the fruit of which is, that thy flesh is crucified together with all its lusts; but this fellowship is not to be considered as not existing, because thou findest that the relics of the flesh still live in thee; but its increase ought to be diligently labored for, until thou arrivest at the goal.” It is indeed well with us, if our flesh is continually mortified; nor is it a small attainment, when the reigning power, being taken away from it, is wielded by the Holy Spirit. There is another fellowship as to the death of Christ, of which the Apostle often speaks, as he does in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:0">2 Corinthians 4:0</span>, that is, the bearing of the cross, which is followed by a joint-participation also of eternal life. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(189)</span> This verse has occasioned various explanations. The most obvious meaning of the first clause is, that to “die” here means to die with or in a similar manner with Christ, for in the next verse, where the idea is resumed, “with” or like “Christ,” is expressly stated. The verb<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, δεδικαίωται,</span></blu></grk> “is,” or has been “justified,” has been considered by the early and most of the later commentators in the sense of being <i>freed</i> or delivered. This is the view, among others, of [<u>Chrysostom</u> ], [<u>Basil</u> ], [<u>Œcumenius</u> ], [<u>Beza</u> ], [<u>Pareus</u> ], [<u>Hammond</u> ], [<u>Grotius</u> ], [<u>Doddridge</u> ] and [<u>Macknight</u> ] But it must be added, that it is a meaning of which there is no other clear instance in the New Testament, though the verb occurs often. [<u>Scott</u> ], aware of this, gives it its common meaning, “justified;” and though he does not take the view of [<u>Venema</u> ], [<u>Chalmers</u> ], and [<u>Haldane</u> ], as to the general import of the former part of this chapter, he yet considers that to be “justified from sin” here, is to be justified from its guilt and penalty. Nor is it irrelevant to the subject in hand to refer to justification: for it is a very important truth to declare, that to die to sin is an evidence of being justified from its guilt. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
