<p>Though he had, in a brief manner, sufficiently explained the question respecting the abrogation of the law; yet as it was a difficult one, and might have given rise to many other questions, he now shows more at large how the law, with regard to us, is become abrogated; and then he sets forth what good is thereby done to us: for while it holds us separated from Christ and bound to itself, it can do nothing but condemn us. And lest any one should on this account blame the law itself, he takes up and confutes the objections of the flesh, and handles, in a striking manner, the great question respecting the use of the law. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(201)</sup></span> </p>
<p><b>1.</b><i>Know ye not, etc.</i> Let the general proposition be that the law was given to men for no other end but to regulate the present life, and that it belongs not to those who are dead: to this he afterwards subjoins this truth — that we are dead to it through the body of Christ. Some understand, that the dominion of the law continues so long to bind us as it remains in force. But as this view is rather obscure, and does not harmonize so well with the proposition which immediately follows, I prefer to follow those who regard what is said as referring to the life of man, and not to the law. The question has indeed a peculiar force, as it affirms the certainty of what is spoken; for it shows that it was not a thing new or unknown to any of them, but acknowledged equally by them all. </p>
<p><i>(For to those who know the law I speak.)</i> This parenthesis is to be taken in the same sense with the question, as though he had said — that he knew that they were not so unskilful in the law as to entertain any doubt on the subject. And though both sentences might be understood of all laws, it is yet better to take them as referring to the law of God, which is the subject that is discussed. There are some who think that he ascribes knowledge of the law to the Romans, because the largest part of the world was under their power and government; but this is puerile: for he addressed in part the Jews or other strangers, and in part common and obscure individuals; nay, he mainly regarded the Jews, with whom he had to do respecting the abrogation of the law: and lest they should think that he was dealing captiously with them, he declares that he took up a common principle, known to them all, of which they could by no means be ignorant, who had from their childhood been brought up in the teaching of the law. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(201)</span> The connection of the beginning of this chapter with <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:14">Romans 6:14</span> deserves to be noticed. He says there, that sin shall not rule over us, <i>because</i> we are not under law, but under grace. Then he asks, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:15">Romans 6:15</span>, </p>
<p>“Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace?” </p>
<p>This last subject, according to his usual mode, he takes up <i>first</i>, and discusses it till the end of the chapter: and then in this chapter he reassumes the first subject — freedom from the law. This is a striking instance of the Apostle’s manner of writing, quite different from what is usual with us in the present day. He mentions two things; he proceeds with the last, and then goes back to the first. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
