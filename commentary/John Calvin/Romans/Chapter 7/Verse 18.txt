<p><b>18.</b><i>For I know</i>, <i>etc.</i> He says that no good by nature dwelt in him. Then <i>in me</i>, means the same as though he had said, “So far as it regards myself.” In the first part he indeed arraigns himself as being wholly depraved, for he confesses that no good dwelt in him; and then he subjoins a modification, lest he should slight the grace of God which also dwelt in him, but was no part of his flesh. And here again he confirms the fact, that he did not speak of men in general, but of the faithful, who are divided into two parts — the relics of the flesh, and grace. For why was the modification made, except some part was exempt from depravity, and therefore not flesh? Under the term <i>flesh</i>, he ever includes all that human nature is, everything in man, except the sanctification of the Spirit. In the same manner, by the term <i>spirit</i>, which is commonly opposed to the flesh, he means that part of the soul which the Spirit of God has so re-formed, and purified from corruption, that God’s image shines forth in it. Then both terms, flesh as well as spirit, belong to the soul; but the latter to that part which is renewed, and the former to that which still retains its natural character. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(227)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>To will is present</i>, <i>etc.</i> He does not mean that he had nothing but an ineffectual desire, but his meaning is, that the work really done did not correspond to his will; for the flesh hindered him from doing perfectly what he did. So also understand what follows, <i>The evil I desire not, that I do:</i> for the flesh not only impedes the faithful, so that they can not run swiftly, but it sets also before them many obstacles at which they stumble. Hence they do not, because they accomplish not, what they would, with the alacrity that is meet. This, <i>to will</i>, then, which he mentions, is the readiness of faith, when the Holy Spirit so prepares the godly that they are ready and strive to render obedience to God; but as their ability is not equal to what they wish, Paul says, that he found not what he desired, even the accomplishment of the good he aimed at. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(227)</span> The Apostle here is his own interpreter; he explains who the <i>I</i> is that does what the other <i>I</i> disapproved, and who the <i>I</i> is that hates what the other <i>I</i> does. He tells us here that it is not the same <i>I</i>, though announced at first as though it were the same. The one <i>I</i>, he informs us here, was his flesh, his innate sin or Corruption, and the other <i>I</i>, he tells us in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:22">Romans 7:22</span>, was “the inner man,” his new nature. The “inner man,” as [<u>Calvin</u> ] will tell us presently, is not the soul as distinguished from the body, but the renewed man as distinguished from the flesh. It is the same as the “new man” as distinguished from “the old man.” See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22">Ephesians 4:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:17">2 Corinthians 5:17</span>. But “the inward man,” and “the outward man,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:16">2 Corinthians 4:16</span>, are the soul and the body; and “the inner man,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:16">Ephesians 3:16</span>, the same expression as in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:22">Romans 7:22</span>, means the soul, as it is evident from the context. The same is meant by “the hidden man of the heart,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:4">1 Peter 3:4</span>. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
