<p><b>28.</b><i>And we know</i>, <i>etc.</i> He now draws this conclusion from what had been said, that so far are the troubles of this life from hindering our salvation, that, on the contrary, they are helps to it. It is no objection that he sets down an illative particle, for it is no new thing with him to make somewhat an indiscriminate use of adverbs, and yet this conclusion includes what anticipates an objection. For the judgment of the flesh in this case exclaims, that it by no means appears that God hears our prayers, since our afflictions continue the same. Hence the Apostle anticipates this and says, that though God does not immediately succour his people, he yet does not forsake them, for by a wonderful contrivance he turns those things which seem to be evils in such a way as to promote their salvation. If any one prefers to read this verse by itself, as though Paul proceeded to a new argument in order to show that adversities which assist our salvation, ought not to be borne as hard and grievous things, I do not object. At the same time, the design of Paul is not doubtful: “Though the elect and the reprobate are indiscriminately exposed to similar evils, there is yet a great, difference; for God trains up the faithful by afflictions, and thereby promotes their salvation.” </p>
<p>But we must remember that Paul speaks here only of adversities, as though he had said, “All things which happen to the saints are so overruled by God, that what the world regards as evil, the issue shows to be good.” For though what [<u>Augustine</u> ] says is true, that even the sins of the saints are, through the guiding providence of God, so far from doing harm to them, that, on the contrary, they serve to advance their salvation; yet this belongs not to this passage, the subject of which is the cross. </p>
<p>It must also be observed, that he includes the whole of true religion in the love of God, as on it depends the whole practice of righteousness. </p>
<p><i>Even to them who according to his purpose, etc.</i> This clause seems to have been added as a modification, lest any one should think that the faithful, because they love God, obtain by their own merit the advantage of deriving such fruit from their adversities. We indeed know that when salvation is the subject, men are disposed to begin with themselves, and to imagine certain preparations by which they would anticipate the favor of God. Hence Paul teaches us, that those whom he had spoken of as loving God, had been previously chosen by him. For it is certain that the order is thus pointed out, that we may know that it proceeds from the gratuitous adoption of God, as from the first cause, that all things happen to the saints for their salvation. Nay, Paul shows that the faithful do not love God before they are called by him, as in another place he reminds us that the Galatians were known of God before they knew him. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:9">Galatians 4:9</span>.) It is indeed true what Paul intimates, that afflictions avail not to advance the salvation of any but of those who love God; but that saying of John is equally true, that then only he is begun to be loved by us, when he anticipates us by his gratuitous love. </p>
<p>But the calling of which Paul speaks here, has a wide meaning, for it is not to be confined to the manifestation of election, of which mention is presently made, but is to be set simply in opposition to the course pursued by men; as though Paul had said, — “The faithful attain not religion by their own efforts, but are, on the contrary led by the hand of God, inasmuch as he has chosen them to be a peculiar people to himself.” The word <i>purpose</i> distinctly excludes whatever is imagined to be adduced mutually by men; as though Paul had denied, that the causes of our election are to be sought anywhere else, except in the secret good pleasure of God; which subject is more fully handled in the first chapter to the Ephesians, and in the first of the Second Epistle to Timothy; where also the contrast between this purpose and human righteousness is more distinctly set forth. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(268)</sup></span> Paul, however, no doubt made here this express declaration, — that our salvation is based on the election of God, in order that he might make a transition to that which he immediately subjoined, namely, that by the same celestial decree, the afflictions, which conform us to Christ, have been appointed; and he did this for the purpose of connecting, as by a kind of necessary chain, our salvation with the bearing of the cross. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(268)</span> [<u>Hammond</u> ] has a long note on the expression<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, κατὰ πρόθεσιν</span></blu></grk> and quotes [<u>Cyril</u> ] of Jerusalem, [<u>Clemens</u> ] of Alexandria, and [<u>Theophylact</u> ], as rendering the words, “according to <i>their</i> purpose,” that is, those who love God, — a construction of itself strange, and wholly alien to the whole tenor of the passage, and to the use of the word in most other instances. Paul has never used the word, except in one instance, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:10">2 Timothy 3:10</span>,) but with reference to God’s purpose or decree, — see <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:11">Romans 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:11">Ephesians 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>. It seems that [<u>Chrysostom</u> ], [<u>Origen</u> ], [<u>Theodoret</u> ], and other Fathers, have given the same singularly strange explanation. But in opposition to these, [<u>Poole</u> ] mentions [<u>Ambrose</u> ], [<u>Augustine</u> ], and even [<u>Jerome</u> ], as regarding “the purpose” here as that of God: in which opinion almost all modern Divines agree. </p>
<p>[<u>Grotius</u> ] very justly observes, that<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κλητοὶ,</span></blu></grk> the called, according to the language of Paul, mean those who obey the call, (<blu><i>qui vocanti obediunt</i></blu> ) and refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:6">Romans 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:24">1 Corinthians 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="re+17:14">Revelation 17:14</span>. And [<u>Stuart</u> ] says that the word has this meaning throughout the New Testament, except in two instances, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:16">Matthew 20:16</span>. and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:14">Matthew 22:14</span>, where it means, invited. He therefore considers it as equivalent to<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἔκλεκτοι,</span></blu></grk> chosen, elected, or true Christians. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
