<p><b>3.</b><i>For what was impossible for the law</i>, <i>etc.</i> Now follows the polishing or the adorning of his proof, that the Lord has by his gratuitous mercy justified us in Christ; the very thing which it was impossible for the law to do. But as this is a very remarkable sentence, let us examine every part of it. </p>
<p>That he treats here of free justification or of the pardon by which God reconciles us to himself, we may infer from the last clause, when he adds, <i>who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit</i> For if Paul intended to teach us, that we are prepared by the spirit of regeneration to overcome sin, why was this addition made? But it was very proper for him, after having promised gratuitous remission to the faithful, to confine this doctrine to those who join penitence to faith, and turn not the mercy of God so as to promote the licentiousness of the flesh. And then the state of the case must be noticed; for the Apostle teaches us here how the grace of Christ absolves us from guilt. </p>
<p>Now as to the expression, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὸ ἀδύνατον</span></blu></grk>, the impossibility of the law, it is no doubt to be taken for defect or impotency; as though it had been said, that a remedy had been found by God, by which that which was an impossibility to the law is removed. The particle, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐν ᾧ</span></blu></grk>, [<u>Erasmus</u> ] has rendered “<blu>ea parte qua</blu> — in that part in which;” but as I think it to be causal, I prefer rendering it, “<blu>eo quod</blu> — because:” and though perhaps such a phrase does not occur among good authors in the Greek language, yet as the Apostles everywhere adopt Hebrew modes of expression, this interpretation ought not to be deemed improper. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(239)</sup></span> No doubt intelligent readers will allow, that the cause of defect is what is here expressed, as we shall shortly prove again. Now though [<u>Erasmus</u> ] supplies the principal verb, yet the text seems to me to flow better without it. The copulative <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καὶ</span></blu></grk>, <i>and</i>, has led [<u>Erasmus</u> ] astray, so as to insert the verb <blu><i>prœstitit</i></blu> — hath performed; but I think that it is used for the sake of emphasis; except it may be, that some will approve of the conjecture of a Grecian scholiast, who connects the clause thus with the preceding words, “God sent his own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and on account of sin,” etc. I have however followed what I have thought to be the real meaning of Paul. I come now to the subject itself. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(240)</sup></span> </p>
<p>Paul clearly declares that our sins were expiated by the death of Christ, because it was impossible for the law to confer righteousness upon us. It hence follows, that more is required by the law than what we can perform; for if we were capable of fulfilling the law there would have been no need to seek a remedy elsewhere. It is therefore absurd to measure human strength by the precepts of the law; as though God in requiring what is justly due, had regarded what and how much we are able to do. </p>
<p><i>Because it was weak etc.</i> That no one might think that the law was irreverently charged with weakness, or confine it to ceremonies, Paul has distinctly expressed that this defect was not owing to any fault in the law, but to the corruption of our flesh; for it must be allowed that if any one really satisfies the divine law, he will be deemed just before God. He does not then deny that the law is sufficient to justify us as to doctrine, inasmuch as it contains a perfect rule of righteousness: but as our flesh does not attain that righteousness, the whole power of the law fails and vanishes away. Thus condemned is the error or rather the delirious notion of those who imagine that the power of justifying is only taken away from ceremonies; for Paul, by laying the blame expressly on us, clearly shows that he found no fault with the doctrine of the law. </p>
<p>But further, understand the weakness of the law according to the sense in which the Apostle usually takes the word <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ασθενεια</span></blu></grk>, weakness, not only as meaning a small imbecility but impotency; for he means that the law has no power whatever to justify. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(241)</sup></span> You then see that we are wholly excluded from the righteousness of works, and must therefore flee to Christ for righteousness, for in us there can be none, and to know this is especially necessary; for we shall never be clothed with the righteousness of Christ except we first know assuredly that we have no righteousness of our own. The word <i>flesh</i> is to be taken still in the same sense, as meaning ourselves. The corruption then of our nature renders the law of God in this respect useless to us; for while it shows the way of life, it does not bring us back who are running headlong into death. </p>
<p><i>God having sent his own Son, etc.</i> He now points out the way in which our heavenly Father has restored righteousness to us by his Son, even by condemning sin in the very flesh of Christ; who by cancelling as it were the handwriting, abolished sin, which held us bound before God; for the condemnation of sin made us free and brought us righteousness, for sin being blotted out we are absolved, so that God counts us as just. But he declares first that Christ was <i>sent</i>, in order to remind us that righteousness by no means dwells in us, for it is to be sought from him, and that men in vain confide in their own merits, who become not just but at the pleasure of another, or who borrow righteousness from that expiation which Christ accomplished in his own flesh. But he says, that he came in<i>the likeness of the flesh of sin;</i> for though the flesh of Christ was polluted by no stains, yet it seemed apparently to be sinful, inasmuch as it sustained the punishment due to our sins, and doubtless death exercised all its power over it as though it was subject to itself. And as it behoved our High-priest to learn by his own experience how to aid the weak, Christ underwent our infirmities, that he might be more inclined to sympathy, and in this respect also there appeared some resemblance of a sinful nature. </p>
<p><i>Even for sin</i>, <i>etc.</i> I have already said that this is explained by some as the cause or the end for which God sent his own Son, that is, to give satisfaction for sin. [<u>Chrysostom</u> ] and many after him understood it in a still harsher sense, even that sin was condemned for sin, and for this reason, because it assailed Christ unjustly and beyond what was right. I indeed allow that though he was just and innocent, he yet underwent punishment for sinners, and that the price of redemption was thus paid; but I cannot be brought to think that the word <i>sin</i> is put here in any other sense than that of an expiatory sacrifice, which is called <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">אשם</span></blu></heb>, <i>ashem</i>, in Hebrew, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(242)</sup></span> and so the Greeks call a sacrifice to which a curse is annexed <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κάθαρμα</span></blu></grk>, <i>catharma.</i> The same thing is declared by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>, when he says, that </p>
<p>“Christ, who knew no sin, was made sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in him.” </p>
<p>But the preposition <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">περὶ</span></blu></grk> <i>peri</i>, is to be taken here in a causative sense, as though he had said, “On account of that sacrifice, or through the burden of sin being laid on Christ, sin was cast down from its power, so that it does not hold us now subject to itself.” For using a metaphor, he says that it was <i>condemned</i>, like those who fail in their cause; for God no longer deals with those as guilty who have obtained absolution through the sacrifice of Christ. If we say that the kingdom of sin, in which it held us, was demolished, the meaning would be the same. And thus what was ours Christ took as his own, that he might transfer his own to us; for he took our curse, and has freely granted us his blessing. </p>
<p>Paul adds here, <i>In the flesh</i>, and for this end, — that by seeing sin conquered and abolished in our very nature, our confidence might be more certain: for it thus follows, that our nature is really become a partaker of his victory; and this is what he presently declares. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(239)</span> [<u>Calvin</u> ] is not singular in this rendering. [<u>Pareus</u> ] and [<u>Grotius</u> ] give “<blu>quia</blu> <blu><i>vel</i></blu> <blu>quandoquidem</blu> — because or since;” and the latter says, that<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐν ᾧ</span></blu></grk> is an Hebraism for <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐφ ᾧ;</span></blu></grk> see <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span> [<u>Beza</u> ] refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:19">Mark 2:19</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:34">Luke 5:34</span>, as instances where it means <i>when</i> or<i>while</i>, and says that it is used in Greek to designate not only a certain time, but also a certain state or condition. [<u>Piscator</u> ] <i>’s</i> rendering is “<blu>co quod</blu> — because.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(240)</span> The beginning of this verse, though the general import of it is evident, does yet present some difficulties as to its construction. The clause, as given by [<u>Calvin</u> ], is, “<blu>Quod enim impossibile erat legi</blu><grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">,” — τὸ γὰρ ἀδύνατον τον νόμου</span></blu></grk> [<u>Pareus</u> ] supposes <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δἰα</span></blu></grk> understood, “For on account of the impotency of the law,” etc. [<u>Stuart</u> ] agrees with [<u>Erasmus</u> ] and [<u>Luther</u> ] and supplies the verb “did,” or accomplish, — “For what the law could not accomplish,... God... accomplished,” etc. But the simpler construction is, “For this,” (that is, freedom from the power of sin and death, mentioned in the former verse,) “<i>being</i> impossible for the law,” etc. It is instance of the nominative case absolute, which sometimes occurs in Hebrew. The possessive case, as [<u>Grotius</u> ] says, has often the meaning of a dative after adjectives, as “<blu>malum hominis</blu> “ is “<blu><i>malum homini</i></blu> — evil to man.” The<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὸ</span></blu></grk> has sometimes the meaning of <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τουτο;</span></blu></grk> it is separated by <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">γὰρ</span></blu></grk> from the adjective. Some say that it is for<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ὅτι γὰρ,</span></blu></grk> “Because it was impossible for the law,” etc. But changes of this kind are never satisfactory. The rendering of the whole verse may be made thus, — </p>
<p><b>3.</b>For this <i>being</i> impossible for the law, because it was weak through the flesh, God having sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful a flesh and on account of sin, has condemned sin in the flesh. </p>
<p>God sent his Son in that flesh which was polluted by sin, though his Son’s flesh,<i>i.e.</i> human nature, was sinless; and he sent him on account of that sin which reigned in human nature or flesh; and for this end — to condemn, <i>i.e</i>. , to doom to ruin, to adjudge to destruction, the sin which ruled in the flesh, <i>i.e</i>. in human nature as fallen and corrupted. This seems to be the meaning. Then in the following verse the design of this condemnation of sin is stated — that the righteousness of the law, or what the law requires, might be done by us. Without freedom from the power of sin, no service can be done to God. It is the destruction of the power of sin, and not the removal of guilt, that is contemplated here throughout; the text of the whole passage is walking after the flesh and walking after the Spirit. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(241)</span> The adjective<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὸ ἀσθενὲς</span></blu></grk> is applied to the commandment in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:18">Hebrews 7:18</span>. “Impotent, inefficacious,” are the terms used by [<u>Grotius</u> ] <i>;</i> “destitute of strength,” by [<u>Beza</u> ] <i>;</i> and “weak,” by [<u>Erasmus</u> ] — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(242)</span> The reference had better been made to <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">חטאת</span></blu></heb>, a sin-offering, so called because <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">חטא</span></blu></heb>, sin, was imputed to what was offered, and it was accepted as an atonement. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+1:4">Leviticus 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+4:3">Leviticus 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+16:21">Leviticus 16:21</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:10">Exodus 30:10</span>. The <i>Septuagint</i> adopted the same manner, and rendered sin-offering in many instances by<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἁμαρτία,</span></blu></grk> sin; and Paul has done the same in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:28">Hebrews 9:28</span>. That “sin” should have two different meanings in the same verse or in the same clause, is what is perfectly consonant to the Apostle’s manner of writing; he seems to delight in this kind of contrast in meaning while using the same words, depending on the context as to the explanation. He uses the word <i>hope</i> both in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21">Romans 8:21</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:18">Romans 4:18</span>, in this way. And this is not peculiar to Paul; it is what we observe in all parts of Scripture, both in the New and in the Old Testament. A striking instance of this, as to the word “life<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">,” ψυχή</span></blu></grk> is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:25">Matthew 16:25</span>, in the last verse it is rendered improperly “soul.” </p>
<p>Fully admitting all this, I still think that “sin” here is to be taken in its common meaning, only personified. [<u>Beza</u> ] connects<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">περὶ ἁμαρτίας</span></blu></grk> with the preceding clause, “God having sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and that for or on account of sin, (<blu>idque pro peccato</blu>,)” etc., that is, as he explains, for expiating or taking away sin. “A sin-offering” may indeed be its meaning, for the same expression is often used in this sense in the <i>Septuagint</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="le+5:7">Leviticus 5:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:6">Psalms 40:6</span> </p>
<p>The sense of taking away strength, or depriving of power or authority, or of destroying, or of abolishing, does not belong, says [<u>Schleusner</u> ], to the verb<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">κατακρίνειν,</span></blu></grk> to condemn; he renders it here “punished — <blu>punivit</blu>,” that is, God adjudged to sin the punishment due to it. The meaning is made to be the same as when it is said, that God “laid on him the iniquities of us all.” </p>
<p>By taking a view of the whole passage, from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:24">Romans 7:24</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:5">Romans 8:5</span>, for the whole of this is connected, and by noticing the phraseology, we shall probably conclude that the <i>power</i> of sin and not its <i>guilt</i> is the subject treated of. “Law” here is used for a ruling power, for that which exercises authority and ensures obedience. “The law of sin,” is the ruling power of sin; “the law of the spirit of life,” is the power of the Spirit the author of life; “the law of death” is the power which death exercises. Then “walking after the flesh” is to live in subjection to the flesh; as “walking after the Spirit” is to live in subjection to him. All these things have a reference to the <i>power</i> and not to the<i>guilt</i> of sin. The same subject is continued from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:5">Romans 8:5</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
