<p><b>6.</b><i>The minding of the flesh</i>, <i>etc.</i> [<u>Erasmus</u> ] has rendered it “affection,” (<blu><i>affectum</i></blu> <i>;</i>) the old translator, “prudence,” (<blu><i>prudentiam</i></blu> .) But as it is certain that the <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">το φρονημα</span></blu></grk> of Paul is the same with what Moses calls the imagination (<blu><i>figmentum</i></blu> — devising) of the heart, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+6:5">Genesis 6:5</span>;) and that under this word are included all the faculties of the soul — reason, understanding, and affections, it seems to me that minding (<blu><i>cogitatio</i></blu> — thinking, imagining, caring) is a more suitable word <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(246)</sup></span> And though Paul uses the particle <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">γὰρ</span></blu></grk> — for, yet I doubt not but that is only a simple confirmative, for there is here a kind of concession; for after having briefly defined what it is to be in the flesh, he now subjoins the end that awaits all who are slaves to the flesh. Thus by stating the contrary effect, he proves, that they cannot be partakers of the favor of Christ, who abide in the flesh, for through the whole course of their life they proceed and hasten unto death. </p>
<p>This passage deserves special notice; for we hence learn, that we, while following the course of nature, rush headlong into death; for we, of ourselves, contrive nothing but what ends in ruin. But he immediately adds another clause, to teach us, that if anything in us tends to life, it is what the Spirit produces; for no spark of life proceeds from our flesh. </p>
<p>The minding of the Spirit he calls <i>life</i>, for it is life-giving, or leads to life; and by <i>peace</i> he designates, after the manner of the Hebrews, every kind of happiness; for whatever the Spirit of God works in us tends to our felicity. There is, however, no reason why any one should on this account attribute salvation to works; for though God begins our salvation, and at length completes it by renewing us after his own image; yet the only cause is his good pleasure, whereby he makes us partakers of Christ. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(246)</span> It is difficult to find a word to express the idea here intended. It is evident that<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὸ φρόνημα τὢς σαρκὸς</span></blu></grk> is the abstract of “minding the things of the flesh,” in the preceding verse. The mindedness, rather than the minding of the flesh, would be most correct. But the phrase is no doubt Hebraistic, the adjective is put as a noun in the genitive case, so that its right version is, “The carnal mind;” and “mind” is to be taken in the wide sense of the verb, as including the whole soul, understanding, will, and affections. The phrase is thus given in the next verse in our version; and it is the most correct rendering. The mind of the flesh is its thoughts, desires, likings, and delight. This carnal mind is death,<i>i.e</i>. , spiritual death now, leading to that which is eternal; or death, as being under condemnation, and producing wretchedness and misery; it is also enmity towards God, including in its very spirit hatred and antipathy to God. On the other hand, “the spiritual mind” is “life,” <i>i.e</i>. , a divine life, a living principle of holiness, accompanied with “peace,” which is true happiness; or life by justification, and “peace” with God as the fruit of it. </p>
<p>The word<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">φρόνημα</span></blu></grk> is only found in one other place, in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:27">Romans 8:27</span>, — “the mind,” wish, or desire “of the Spirit.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
