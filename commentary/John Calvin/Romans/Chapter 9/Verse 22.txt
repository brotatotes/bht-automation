<p><b>22.</b><i>And what, etc.</i> A second answer, by which he briefly shows, that though the counsel of God is in fact incomprehensible, yet his unblamable justice shines forth no less in the perdition of the reprobate than in the salvation of the elect. He does not indeed give a reason for divine election, so as to assign a cause why this man is chosen and that man rejected; for it was not meet that the things contained in the secret counsel of God should be subjected to the judgment of men; and, besides, this mystery is inexplicable. He therefore keeps us from curiously examining those things which exceed human comprehension. He yet shows, that as far as God’s predestination manifests itself, it appears perfectly just. </p>
<p>The particles, <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἰ δὲ</span></blu></grk>, used by Paul, I take to mean, <i>And what if?</i> so that the whole sentence is a question; and thus the sense will be more evident: and there is here an ellipsis, when we are to consider this as being understood, — “Who then can charge him with unrighteousness, or arraign him?<i>”</i> for here appears nothing but the most perfect course of justice. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(307)</sup></span> </p>
<p>But if we wish fully to understand Paul, almost every word must be examined. He then argues thus, — There are vessels prepared for destruction, that is, given up and appointed to destruction: they are also vessels of wrath, that is, made and formed for this end, that they may be examples of God’s vengeance and displeasure. If the Lord bears patiently for a time with these, not destroying them at the first moment, but deferring the judgment prepared for them, and this in order to set forth the decisions of his severity, that others may be terrified by so dreadful examples, and also to make known his power, to exhibit which he makes them in various ways to serve; and, further, that the amplitude of his mercy towards the elect may hence be more fully known and more brightly shine forth; — what is there worthy of being reprehended in this dispensation? But that he is silent as to the reason, why they are vessels appointed to destruction, is no matter of wonder. He indeed takes it as granted, according to what has been already said, that the reason is hid in the secret and inexplorable counsel of God; whose justice it behoves us rather to adore than to scrutinize. </p>
<p>And he has mentioned <i>vessels,</i> as commonly signifying instruments; for whatever is done by all creatures, is, as it were, the ministration of divine power. For the best reason then are we, the faithful, called the vessels of mercy, whom the Lord uses as instruments for the manifestation of his mercy; and the reprobate are the vessels of wrath, because they serve to show forth the judgments of God. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(307)</span> Critics have in various ways attempted to supply the ellipsis, but what is here proposed is most approved. [<u>Beza</u> ] considered the corresponding clause to be at <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:30">Romans 9:30</span>, and viewed the intervening verses as parenthetic, “And if God,” etc., — “What then shall we say?” [<u>Grotius</u> ] subjoined, “Does God do any wrong?” [<u>Elsner</u> ] <i>,”</i> Has he not the power?” and [<u>Wolfius</u> ],” What canst, thou say against God?” [<u>Stuart</u> ] proposes to repeat the question in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:20">Romans 9:20</span>, “Who art thou?” etc. Some connect this verse with the question in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:20">Romans 9:20</span>, and include the latter part of it and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:21">Romans 9:21</span> in a parenthesis. Whatever way may be adopted, the sense is materially the same. It has also been suggested that<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἰ δὲ</span></blu></grk> is for <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἴπερ,</span></blu></grk> <i>since, seeing,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:6">2 Thessalonians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:3">1 Peter 2:3</span>. In this case no apodosis is necessary. But we may take<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἰ</span></blu></grk> as meaning <i>since,</i> and <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">δὲ</span></blu></grk> as an iliatire, and render the three verses thus, — </p>
<p><b>22.</b>“Since then God willed (or, it was God’s will) to show His wrath and to make known his power, he endured with much forbearance the vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction; </p>
<p><b>23.</b>So <i>he willed</i> to make known the riches of his glory towards the vessels of mercy, whom he has fore-prepared for glory, </p>
<p><b>24.</b>Even us, whom he has called not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles.” </p>
<p>The verb<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐστι,</span></blu></grk> or ἦν, is often understood after participles, especially in Hebrew; and<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">καὶ</span></blu></grk> has the meaning of ‘so’ in some instances, <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:10">Matthew 6:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:51">Acts 7:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:9">Galatians 1:9</span>; and in some cases, as [<u>Schleusner</u> ] says, without being preceded by any particle of comparison, such as <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:26">Matthew 12:26</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:27">1 John 2:27</span>; but<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">εἰ;</span></blu></grk> here stands somewhat in that character. </p>
<p>The beginning of <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:23">Romans 9:23</span> presents an anomaly, if, with [<u>Stuart</u> ] and others, we consider “willing:” or wills to be understood, as it is followed in the preceding verse by an infinitive, and here by a subjunctive mood. But [<u>Beza</u> ] <i>,</i> [<u>Grotius</u> ] <i>,</i> and [<u>Hammond</u> ] <i>,</i> seem to regard the verb “endured,” to be here, as it were, repeated, which gives the same meaning to the passage as that which is given to it by [<u>Calvin</u> ] — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
