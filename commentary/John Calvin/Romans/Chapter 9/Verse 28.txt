<p><b>28.</b><i>For I will finish and shorten the matter, etc.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(312)</sup></span> Omitting various interpretations, I will state what appears to me to be the real meaning: The Lord will so cut short, and cut off his people, that the residue may seem as it were a consumption, that is, may have the appearance and the vestige of a very great ruin. However, the few who shall remain from the consumption shall be a proof of the work of God’s righteousness, or, what I prefer, shall serve to testify the righteousness of God throughout the world. As <i>word</i> often in Scripture means a thing, the consummated word is put for consumption. Many interpreters have here been grossly mistaken, who have attempted to philosophize with too much refinement; for they have imagined, that the doctrine of the gospel is thus called, because it is, when the ceremonies are cut off, a brief compendium of the law; though the word means on the contrary a consumption. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(313)</sup></span> And not only here is an error committed by the translator, but also in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+10:22">Isaiah 10:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:22">Isaiah 28:22</span>; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="eze+11:13">Ezekiel 11:13</span>; where it is said, “Ah! ah! Lord God! wilt thou make a completion of the remnant of Israel<i>?”</i> But the Prophets meant to say, “Wilt thou destroy the very remnant with utter destruction?<i>”</i> And this has happened through the ambiguity of the Hebrew word. For as the word, <heb><blu><span lang="he-IL" style="">כלה</span></blu></heb> <i>, cale,</i> means to finish and to perfect, as well as to consume, this difference has not been sufficiently observed according to the passages in which it occurs. </p>
<p>But Isaiah has not in this instance adopted one word only, but has put down two words, <i>consumption,</i> and <i>termination,</i> or cutting off; so that the affectation of Hebraism in the Greek translator was singularly unseasonable; for to what purpose was it to involve a sentence, in itself clear, in an obscure and figurative language? It may be further added, that Isaiah speaks here hyperbolically; for by consumption he means diminution, such as is wont to be after a remarkable slaughter. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(312)</span> <blu>Sermonem enim consummans et abbrevians</blu>,” etc<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">.; Λόγον γὰρ,</span></blu></grk> etc. It is literally the <i>Septuagint</i> except in two instances: Paul puts in<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">γὰρ,</span></blu></grk> and substitutes <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐπὶ τὢς γὢς</span></blu></grk> for ἐν <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">τὣ οἰκουμένὟ ὅλὟ.</span></blu></grk> It is a difficult passage in Hebrew: but the following rendering will make it materially consistent with the words of the Apostle, who evidently did not intend to give the words literally. </p>
<p>A destruction, soon executed, <br/><i>Shall</i> overflow in righteousness; <br/>For completed and soon executed shall it be; <br/>The Lord, Jehovah of hosts, shall do <span style="font-style:italic;">it, <br/></span>In the midst of the whole land. </p>
<p>The word rendered above “soon executed,” means literally, abbreviated or cut short, signifying the quick execution of a thing or work. <i>“Shall</i> overflow in righteousness,” imports, “<i>shall</i> justly or deservedly overflow.” — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(313)</span> There are many venerable names in favour of this opinion, such as [<u>Ambrose</u> ] <i>,</i> [<u>Chrysostom</u> ] <i>,</i> [<u>Augustine</u> ] <i>,</i> etc. Not knowing the Hebrew language, they attached a classical meaning to the expression<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, λόγον συντετμημένον,</span></blu></grk> wholly at variance with what the Hebrew means, as [<u>Calvin</u> ] justly observes. The word<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, συντετμημένον,</span></blu></grk> in this passage, as [<u>Schleusner</u> ] says, bears a meaning different from what it has in the classics; it imports what is cut short, that is, quickly executed. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
