<p><b>9.</b><i>For the word of promise is this, etc.</i> He adds another divine testimony; and we see, by the application made of it, with what care and skill he explains Scripture. When he says, the Lord said that he would come, and that a son would be born to Abraham of Sarah, he intimated that his blessing was not yet <i>conferred,</i> but that it was as yet suspended. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(291)</sup></span> But Ishmael was already born when this was said: then God’s blessing had no regard to Ishmael. We may also observe, by the way, the great caution with which he proceeds here, lest he should exasperate the Jews. The cause being passed over, he first simply states the fact; he will hereafter open the fountain. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(291)</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:10">Genesis 18:10</span>. The quotation is not from the Septuagint, but is much nearer a literal version of the Hebrew: the only material difference is in the words, “at this time,” instead of “according to the time of life.” The words in different forms occur<i>four</i> times, — <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:21">Genesis 17:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:10">Genesis 18:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:2">Genesis 21:2</span>; we meet with the same words in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ki+4:16">2 Kings 4:16</span>. It appears that the Apostle here took this expression, “at this time,” from <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:21">Genesis 17:21</span>, while he mainly followed the text in <span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:10">Genesis 18:10</span>. The meaning of the phrase, “according to the time of life,” as given in Genesis and in Kings, evidently is the time of child-bearing, what passes between conception and the birth. This was repeatedly mentioned in order to show that the usual course of nature would be followed, though the conception would be miraculous; the child to be born was to be nourished the usual time in the womb, — “according to the time of producing life,” or of child-bearing. </p>
<p>The exposition of [<u>Gesenius</u> ] <i>,</i> adopted by [<u>Tholuck</u> ] and [<u>Stuart</u> ] <i>,</i> “when the time shall be <i>renewed,”</i> does not comport with the passage, as it introduces a tautology. [<u>Hammond</u> ] says, that the Hebrews interpret the expression in Kings as meaning the time between the conception and the birth. — <i>Ed.</i> </p>
