<p><b>12</b><i>One of themselves, a prophet of their own</i> I have no doubt that he who is here spoken of is Epimenides, who was a native of Crete; for, when the Apostle says that this author was “one of themselves,” and was “a prophet of their own,” he undoubtedly means that he belonged to the nation of the Cretans. Why he calls him a Prophet--is doubtful. Some think that the reason is, that the book from which Paul borrowed this passage bears the title<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Περὶ Χρησμῶν</span></blu></grk> “concerning oracles.” Others are of opinion that Paul speaks ironically, by saying that they have such a Prophet — a Prophet worthy of a nation which refuses to listen to the servants of God. But as poets are sometimes called by the Greeks (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">προφὢται</span></blu></grk>) “prophets,” and as the Latin authors call them <blu><i>Vates</i></blu> , I consider it to denote simply a teacher. The reason why they were so called appears to have been, that they were always reckoned to be (<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">γένος θεῖον καὶ ἐνθουσιαστικόν</span></blu></grk>)<i>“</i> a divine race and moved by divine inspiration.” Thus also Adimantus, in the Second Book of Plato’s treatise<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">Περὶ Πολιτείας</span></blu></grk> after having called the poets <grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">υἵους Θεῶν</span></blu></grk> “sons of the gods,” adds, that they also became their prophets. For this reason I think that Paul accommodates his style to the ordinary practice. Nor is it of any importance to inquire on what occasion Epimenides calls his countrymen liars, namely, because they boast of having the sepulcher of Jupiter; but seeing that the poet takes it from an ancient and well-known report, the Apostle quotes it as a proverbial saying. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(228)</sup></span> </p>
<p>From this passage we may infer that those persons are superstitious, who do not venture to borrow anything from heathen authors. All truth is from God; and consequently, if wicked men have said anything that is true and just, we ought not to reject it; for it has come from God. Besides, all things are of God; and, therefore, why should it not be lawful to dedicate to his glory everything that can properly be employed for such a purpose? But on this subject the reader may consult Basil’s discourse <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(229)</sup></span><grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">πρὸς τοὺς νέους, ὅπως ἂν ἐξ ἑλλ κ.τ.λ</span></blu></grk> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(228)</span> The Greek hexameter verse which Paul quotes has been rendered into Latin hexameter by Calvin himself, and into a French couplet by his translator; and it may be worth while to set down the quotation in the three languages: </p>
<p>Greek<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">. — Κρὢτες ἀεὶ ψεῦσται, κακὰ θηρία, γαστέρες ἀργαί</span></blu></grk> </p>
<p>Latin. — <blu>Mendax, venter iners, semper male bestia Cres est</blu>. </p>
<p>French. — “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">I’ousjours menteuse, et tousiours male-beste</span></blu>, </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(229)</span> “<blu><span lang="fr-FR" style="">Qu’il lise l’oraison que Basile en a faite, remonstrant aux jeunes gens comment ils se doyvent aider des livres des autheurs profanes</span></blu>.” — “Let him read Basil’s discourse on this subject, instructing young persons how they ought to avail themselves of the assistance to be derived from heathen authors.” </p>
