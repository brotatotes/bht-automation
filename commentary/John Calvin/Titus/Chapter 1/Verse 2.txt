<p><b>2.</b><i>In the hope</i> (or, <i>on account of the hope</i>) <i>of eternal life</i> This undoubtedly denotes the cause; for that is the force of the Greek preposition<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἐπί</span></blu></grk> <i>;</i> and therefore it may be translated, “On account of the hope,” or “On the hope.” True religion and the practice of godliness — begin with meditation on the heavenly life; and in like manner, when Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>) praises the faith and love of the Colossians, he makes the cause and foundation of them to be “the hope laid up in heaven.” The Sadducees and all who confine our hope to this world, whatever they may pretend, can do nothing else than produce contempt of God, while they reduce men to the condition of cattle. Accordingly, it ought always to be the aim of a good teacher, to turn away the eyes of men from the world, that they may look up to heaven. I readily acknowledge that we ought to value the glory of God more highly than our salvation; but we are not now discussing the question which of these two ought to be first in order. All that I say is — that men never seek God in a right manner till they have confidence to approach to him; and, therefore, that we never apply our mind to godliness till we have been instructed about the hope of the heavenly life. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(210)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>Which God promised before the times of ages.</i> As Augustine translated the words<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, Πρὸ χρόνων αἰωνίων</span></blu></grk> to mean — not “the times of ages” but “eternal times,” he gives himself great uneasiness about “the eternity of times,” till at length he explains “eternal times” as denoting those which go beyond all antiquity. As to the meaning, he and Jerome and other commentators agree, that God determined, before the creation of the world, to give that salvation which he hath now manifested by the gospel. Thus Paul would have used the word <i>promise</i> incorrectly instead of <i>decree;</i> for before men existed there was no one to whom he could promise. </p>
<p>For this reason, while I do not reject this exposition, yet when I take a close survey of the whole matter, I am constrained to adopt a different interpretation — that eternal life was promised to men many ages ago, and not only to those who lived at that time, but also for our own age. It was not for the benefit of Abraham alone, but with a view to all who should live after him, that God said, </p>
<p>“In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:18">Genesis 22:18</span>.) </p>
<p>Nor is this inconsistent with what he says, in another sense, (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>) that salvation was given to men “before the times of ages.” The meaning of the word is still the same in both passages; for, since the Greek word<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">αἰών,</span></blu></grk> denotes an uninterrupted succession of time from the beginning to the end of the world, Paul declares, in that passage, that salvation was given or decreed for the elect of God before times began to flow. But because in this passage he treats of the promise, he does not include all ages, so as to lead us back beyond the creation of the world, but shews that many ages <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(211)</sup></span> have elapsed since salvation was promised. </p>
<p>If any person prefer to view “the times of ages” as a concise expression for the ages themselves, he is at liberty to do so. But because salvation was given by the eternal election of God before it was promised, the act of giving salvation is put in that passage (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>) before all ages, and therefore we must supply the word <i>all.</i> But here it means nothing more than that the promise is more ancient than a long course of ages, because it began immediately after the creation of the world. In the same sense he shews that the gospel, which was to have been proclaimed when Christ rose from the dead, had been promised in the Scriptures by the prophets; for there is a wide difference between the promise which was formerly given to the fathers and the present exhibition of grace. </p>
<p><i>Who cannot lie.</i> This expression<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">ἀψευδής</span></blu></grk> is added for glorifying God, and still more for confirming our faith. And, indeed, whenever the subject treated of is our salvation, we ought to recollect that it is founded on the word of Him who can neither deceive nor lie. Moreover, the only proof of the whole of religion is — the unchangeable truth of God. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(212)</sup></span> </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(210)</span> “Thus he shews that it will never be possible for men to dedicate themselves entirely to the service of God, if they do not think more about God than about all things else. In short, there is no living root, no faith no religion, till we have been led to heaven, that is, till we know that God has not created us to keep us here in an earthly life with brute beasts, but that he has adopted us to be his heritage, and reckons us to be his children. If, therefore, we do not look up to heaven, it is impossible that we shall have true devotion to surrender ourselves to God, or that there shall be any faith or Christianity in us. And that is the reason why — among all who, in the present day, are accounted Christians, and give themselves out to be such — there are very few who have this true mark, which Paul has here given to all the children of God. It is because all are occupied with the present life, and are so firmly bound to it, that they cannot rise higher. Now perceiving this vice to be so common, so much the more ought we to guard against it, and break the force of that which we cannot altogether destroy, till we come into close fellowship with God, which will only be, when the hope of eternal life shall be actually and sincerely formed in our hearts.”—<i>Fr. Ser.</i> </p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(212)</span> “What a strange sort of men are these, that will endure to be so exposed, so scorned, so trampled upon, as they that bear the Christian name commonly are? What is the reason of it? What account will a reasonable man give, why he will so expose himself? I will tell you the reason. ‘Therefore we labor and suffer reproach, because we hope in God, in the living God, and we are pretty well persuaded we shall not finally be losers. We shall not have an ill bargain of it at last.’ As the same Apostle, when he writes himself ‘an Apostle and servant of Jesus Christ’ seems to allow that he was to doom himself to all the sufferings and calamities that the enemies of the Christian cause could load him with and lay upon him, for his assuming to himself such names of ‘an Apostle and servant of Jesus Christ.’ But why should Paul, — that wise and prudent man, that learned man, that man of so considerable reputation among his own countrymen — why should he come to be written among the Apostles and servants of Jesus Christ? Why, saith he, it is in hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, hath promised. (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:1">Titus 1:1</span>.) I avow myself an Apostle and servant of Jesus Christ upon this inducement, and for this reason; and so I mean to continue unto the end. It is the hope of eternal life which God, that cannot lie, hath promised to me. He whose nature doth not allow him to deceive to whom it is impossible to lie, I firmly and securely hope in him; and, therefore, I will readily dispose myself to encounter all the difficulties and hardships which the service of Jesus Christ can lay me open to.” — <i>Howe.</i> </p>
