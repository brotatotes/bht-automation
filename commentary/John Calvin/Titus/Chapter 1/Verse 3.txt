<p><b>3.</b><i>But hath manifested</i> There was indeed some manifestation of this kind, when God in ancient times spake by his prophets; but because Christ publicly, displayed by his coming those thing which they had obscurely predicted, and the Gentiles were afterwards admitted into the fellowship of the covenant, in this sense Paul says that what had formerly been exhibited in part “hath now been manifested.” </p>
<p><i>In his own times</i> This has the same meaning as “the fullness of times.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span>.) He reminds us that the time when it pleased the Lord to do this — must have been the most seasonable time for doing it; and he mentions this for the purpose of meeting the rashness of men, who have always the hardihood to inquire why it was not sooner, or why it is to-day rather than to-morrow. In order therefore that our curiosity may not exceed proper bounds, he shews that the “times” are placed in the hand, and at the disposal, of God, in such a manner that we ought to think that he does everything in the proper order and at the most seasonable time. </p>
<p><i>His word.</i> Or<i>, by his word;</i> for it is not uncommon with Greek writers to supply the preposition <i>by</i>. Or, he calls Christ the Word; if it be not thought preferable to supply something for the sake of completing the sentence. Were it not that the second exposition is a little forced, in other respects I should give it the preference. Thus John says, </p>
<p>“What we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what our hands have handled of the Word of life; and the life was manifested.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>.) </p>
<p>I therefore prefer what is a simple meaning, that God hath manifested the word concerning the life by the preaching of the gospel. </p>
<p><i>The preaching,</i> of which he speaks, is the gospel proclaimed, as the chief thing which we hear in it is — that Christ is given to us, and that in him there is life. </p>
<p><i>Which hath been committed to me.</i> Because all are not indiscriminately fit for so important an office, and no man ought to thrust himself into it, he asserts his calling, according to his custom. Here we ought to learn — what we have often remarked on other occasions — that the honor is not due to any man, till he has proved that God has ordained him, for even the ministers of Satan proudly boast that God has called them, but there is no truth in their words. Now Paul states nothing but what is known and proved, when he mentions his calling. </p>
<p>Besides, from this passage we learn for what purpose they were made apostles. It was for the sake of publishing the gospel, as he says elsewhere, </p>
<p>“Woe to me if I preach not the gospel, for a dispensation is committed unto me.” (<span class="scriptRef" com="cal" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:16">1 Corinthians 9:16</span>.) </p>
<p>Accordingly, they who enact dumb show, in the midst of idleness and luxury, are excessively impudent in boasting that they are the successors of the apostles. </p>
<p><i>Of God our Savior</i> He applies the same epithet to the Father and to Christ, so that each of them is our Savior, but for a different reason; for the Father is called our Savior, because he redeemed us by the death of his Son, that he might make us heirs of eternal life; and the Son, because he shed his blood as the pledge and the price of our salvation. Thus the Son hath brought salvation to us from the Father, and the Father hath bestowed it through the Son. </p>
