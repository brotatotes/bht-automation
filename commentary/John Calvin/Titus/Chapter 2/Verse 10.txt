<p><b>10</b><i>Not thievish but shewing all good faith</i> He censures two vices that are common among servants, petulant replies, and a propensity to steal. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(246)</sup></span> The comedies are full of instances of excessively ready talk, by which servants cheat their masters. Nor was it without reason that an exchange of names took place in ancient times, by which “servant “and “thief “became convertible terms. Thus prudence requires that we make our instructions apply to the morals of each individual. </p>
<p>By<i>faith</i> he means fidelity to their masters; and therefore, to <i>shew all faith</i> is to act faithfully, without using fraud or doing injury, in transacting the affairs of their masters. </p>
<p><i>That they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things</i> This ought to be a very sharp spur of exhortation to us, when we learn that our becoming conduct adorns the doctrine of God, which, at the same time, is a mirror of his glory. And, indeed, we see that this usually happens; as, on the other hand, our wicked life brings disgrace upon it; for men commonly judge of us from our works. But this circumstance ought also to be observed, that God deigns to receive an “ornament” from shaves, whose condition was so low and mean that they were wont to be scarcely accounted men; for he does not mean “servants,” such as we have in the present day, but slaves, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(247)</sup></span> who were bought with money, and held as property, like oxen or horses. And if the life of those men is an ornament to the Christian name, much more let those who are in honor take care that they do not stain it by their baseness. </p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;">(246)</span> “Here we see how strictly Paul observed those of whom he was speaking. For the slaves who were in that age were addicted to pillage; and besides, they were contradictory, as if they had not dreaded the strokes with which they were chastised. We find that they sometimes grew hardened, because their masters did not use them gently, but treated them as brute beasts, struck them, teased them, put them to the torture, and frequently beat them, when they were absolutely naked, so that the blood flowed on all sides. Being thus hardened to evil, we must not be astonished if they had such corruption as to take revenge on their masters when they had any opportunity. But now Paul does not fail to exhort them to please their masters, that is, in everything that was good and right — an exception which he makes in other passages” —<i>Fr. Ser.</i> </p>
