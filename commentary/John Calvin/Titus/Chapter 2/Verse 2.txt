<p><b>2.</b><i>That aged men be sober</i> He begins with particular duties, that the discourse may be better adapted to the instruction of the people. And he does so, not only that he may accommodate himself to their capacity, but that he may press every one more closely; for a general doctrine produces a less powerful impression; but when by holding out a few cases, he has instructed every person about his duty, there is no one who may not easily conclude, that the Lord has sufficiently instructed him as to the work in which he ought to be employed. We must not therefore, look for a regular method here; for Paul’s design was only to state briefly what were the subjects concerning which godly teachers ought to speak, and not to undertake to treat largely of those subjects. </p>
<p>“Aged men” are mentioned by him in the first place. He wishes them to be “sober,” because excessive drinking is a vice too common among the old. <i>Gravity,</i> which he next mentions, is procured by well-regulated morals. Nothing is more shameful than for an old man to indulge in youthful wantonness, and, by his countenance, to strengthen the impudence of the young. In the life of old men, therefore, let there be displayed<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">σεμνότης</span></blu></grk> “a becoming gravity,” which shall constrain the young to modesty. This will be followed chiefly by <i>temperance,</i> which he immediately adds. </p>
<p><i>Sound in faith</i> I do not know whether the word “sound” or “healthy” contains an indirect allusion to the various diseases of old men, with which he contrasts this health of the soul; at least, I think so, though I do not affirm it. With good reason does he include in these three parts — <i>faith, love, patience</i> — the sum of Christian perfection. <i>By faith</i> we worship God; for neither calling upon him, nor any exercises of godliness, can be separated from it. <i>Love</i> extends to all the commandments of the second table. Next follows <i>patience</i> as the seasoning of “faith” and “love;” for without “patience” faith would not long endure, and many occurrences are taking place every day — instances of unhandsome conduct or evil temper, which irritate us so much that we should not only be languid, but almost dead, to the duties of love towards our neighbor, if the same “patience” did not support us. </p>
