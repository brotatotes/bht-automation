<p><b>4.</b><i>That they may teach young women temperance</i> That they may be more attentive to duty, he shows that it is not enough if their own life be decent, if they do not also train <i>young women,</i> by their instructions, to a decent and chaste life. He therefore adds, that by their example they should train to temperance and gravity those younger women whom the warmth of youth might otherwise lead into imprudence. </p>
<p><i>To love their husbands and their children</i> I do not agree with those who think that this is a recapitulation of the advices which elderly women should give to those who are younger for a careful perusal of the context will enable any one easily to perceive that Paul goes on in explaining the duties of women, which apply equally to those who are older. Besides, the construction would be inappropriate<grk><blu><span lang="el-GR" style="">, σωφρονίζωσι, σώφρονας εἶναι</span></blu></grk> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(240)</sup></span> Yet while he instructs elderly females what they ought to be, he at the same time holds out to the younger the example which they ought to follow. Thus he indiscriminately teaches both. In short, he wishes women to be restrained, by conjugal love and affection for their children, from giving themselves up to licentious attachments, he wishes them to rule their own house in a sober and orderly manner, forbids them to wander about in public places, bids them be chaste, and at the same time modest, so as to be subject to the dominion of their husbands; for those who excel in other virtues sometimes take occasion from them to act haughtily, so as to be disobedient to their husbands. </p>

Those instructions (as appears from what follows) were to turn on the domestic duties suitable to young married women, and each in the order of importance.
