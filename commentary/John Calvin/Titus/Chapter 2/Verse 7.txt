<p><b>7.</b><i>In all things shewing thyself</i> For doctrine will otherwise carry little authority, if its power and majesty do not shine in the life of the bishop, <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(242)</sup></span> as in a mirror. He wishes, therefore, that the teacher may be a pattern, which his scholars may copy. <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(243)</sup></span> </p>
<p><i>A pattern of good works in doctrine, uprightness, gravity</i> In the original Greek the style is here involved and obscure, and this creates ambiguity. First, he makes use of the words <i>in doctrine,</i> and then adds, in the accusative case, <i>integrity, gravity, etc.</i> <span style="color:#800000;font-weight:bold;"><sup>(244)</sup></span> Without mentioning the interpretations given by others, I shall state that which appears to me to be the most probable. First, I connect these words, <i>of good works in doctrine;</i> for, after having enjoined Titus that, in teaching he shall inculcate the practice of good works, he wishes that good works, which correspond to this doctrine, may be visible in his life; and consequently the preposition <i>in</i> means that they shall be suitable, or shall correspond, to the doctrine. What follows is in no degree obscure; for; in order that he may exhibit a representation of his doctrine in morals, he bids him be “upright and grave.” </p>

And would to God that this were duly observed; for the truth of God would be received with greater reverence than it is. But however that may be, we shall not be held excused, since God wishes to make use <i>of us</i> so as to regulate others, and to direct our life in such a manner that, when they shall follow as with one accord, we may strive to honor God, and give no occasion to despise the sacred word, since God has made us instruments, and wishes that his doctrine should be received from us, <i>as if</i> he spoke in his own person.” — <i>Fr. Ser.</i> </p>
