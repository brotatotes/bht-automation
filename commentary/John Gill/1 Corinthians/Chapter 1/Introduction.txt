<p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO FIRST CORINTHIANS 1</strong></p>
<p>This chapter contains the general inscription of the epistle, the usual salutation, and a special thanksgiving for blessings received; after which the apostle intimates the occasion of his writing, the divisions about their ministers, which gives him an opportunity of discoursing concerning the nature, end, use, and efficacy of the preaching of the Gospel. The inscription is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span>, in which an account is given of the persons concerned in this epistle; and first of Paul, the only inspired writer of it, who is described by his name, by which he went among the Gentiles; by his office, an apostle of Jesus Christ; and by the manner in which he came into it, being called to it not through any merit of his own, but through the sovereign will and pleasure of God: and next mention is made of Sosthenes, a brother minister of the Gospel, who was with the apostle, and joined in the salutation of the church, to whom the epistle is written; who are described, by their general character, a church of God; by the place of their abode, and seat of their church state, Corinth; and by their special characters, sanctified in Christ by election, and saints through the effectual calling; and with them are joined all other saints in Achaia, that belonged to them and the apostle, that called upon the name of the Lord; and then follows the salutation in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:3">1 Corinthians 1:3</span>, usual in all the epistles; after that a thanksgiving to God for the grace they had by Christ in general, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:4">1 Corinthians 1:4</span>, and particularly for their gifts of utterance and knowledge, which were plentifully bestowed upon them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:5">1 Corinthians 1:5</span>, and were a confirmation to them of the Gospel of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:6">1 Corinthians 1:6</span>, and by which it appeared, that they were not behind other churches in these things; and are commended for their waiting for the coming of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</span>, by whom the apostle assures them, they would be so confirmed in the mean while, as to be presented blameless by him in that day, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:8">1 Corinthians 1:8</span>, of which they might be assured from the faithfulness of God, who had called them to communion with Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:9">1 Corinthians 1:9</span>, upon which he exhorts them to unity of affection and judgment, for this end, that there might be no schisms among them; and this he does in a way of entreaty, and that by the name of Christ, and from the consideration of their being brethren, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:10">1 Corinthians 1:10</span>, suggesting hereby, that there were divisions among them: and signifies, that he had good reason to believe it, having had an account of them from a family of repute among them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:11">1 Corinthians 1:11</span>, and then expressly mentions what their differences were about, namely, their ministers, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span>, and uses arguments to dissuade them from their dividing principles and practices; showing, that one was their Lord and master, Christ, who was crucified for them, and in whose name they were baptized, and not his ministers, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:13">1 Corinthians 1:13</span>, and since some among them made an ill use of their having been baptized by the apostle, he is thankful that he had baptized no more of them, and mentions by name those that he had baptized, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span>, and gives a reason for it, taken from the principal end of his mission by Christ, which was to preach the Gospel, and not only or chiefly to baptize, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:17">1 Corinthians 1:17</span>. The manner in which he was sent to preach, and did preach it, is observed by him, not in the words of human wisdom; and that for this reason, lest either the Gospel should be of no use, or the effect of it should be ascribed to a wrong cause; and then be obviates an objection that might be made to this way of preaching, that hereby the Gospel would be brought into contempt; to which he answers, by granting that it would be, and was reckoned foolishness by them that were blinded and were lost; and by observing on the other hand, that it was effectual to saving purposes to others, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18">1 Corinthians 1:18</span>, and though the former sort might be the wise and prudent of this world, this need seem no strange thing, since the infatuation of such persons is no other than what was foretold would be, as appears from a testimony out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:14">Isaiah 29:14</span>, cited in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:19">1 Corinthians 1:19</span>, upon which some questions are put, and inquiries made, after men of wisdom and learning, whose wisdom God made foolish, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:20">1 Corinthians 1:20</span>, the reason of which was, because they did not make a right use of their natural wisdom in the knowledge of God, wherefore it was his pleasure to save men by means esteemed foolishness by them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:21">1 Corinthians 1:21</span>, and these wise men, who accounted the preaching of the Gospel foolishness, are distinguished into two sorts, Jews and Gentiles; the one requiring miracles to confirm it, the other seeking wisdom in it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:22">1 Corinthians 1:22</span>, but finding neither, though there were really both, the preaching of a crucified Christ was a stumbling to the one, and folly to the other, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:23">1 Corinthians 1:23</span>, though those that were called by grace from among them, whether Jews or Gentiles, had different sentiments of it, and of Christ preached in it, in whose esteem he was the power and wisdom of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:24">1 Corinthians 1:24</span>, the reason of which was, because there are superior wisdom and power in Christ and his Gospel, which the apostle, an ironical concession, calls the foolishness and weakness of God, to the wisdom and power of men, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:25">1 Corinthians 1:25</span>, and instances in the effectual calling and conversion of the Corinthians, who for the most part were not the wise, the mighty, and noble, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:26">1 Corinthians 1:26</span>, but the foolish, weak, and base; and the end of God, in the call of such, was to draw a veil over and bring to confusion the wisdom and power of men, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:27">1 Corinthians 1:27</span>, and also that no creature whatever should dare to glory before him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:29">1 Corinthians 1:29</span>, but the true object of glorying in is pointed at, the Lord Jesus Christ; and the reason of it, all blessings of grace being in him, and from him, is suggested, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:30">1 Corinthians 1:30</span>, so that whoever glories, should glory in him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:31">1 Corinthians 1:31</span>. </p>
