<p><strong>So that ye come behind in no gift</strong>,.... Ordinary or extraordinary; a detail of the gifts which were bestowed on them is made in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8">1 Corinthians 12:8</span>; by which it appears that they were not inferior in gifts to any of the churches:</p>
<p><strong>waiting for the coming</strong>; or "the revelation"</p>
<p><strong>of our Lord Jesus Christ</strong>; who will appear a second time, come in great glory, will raise the dead, and judge both quick and dead; when gifts will cease and be of no more use, and when they must all be accounted for; and therefore, till that time comes, should be diligently made use of, and improved to the interest and service of Christ; who will surely come again, and call his servants and churches to an account for the talents he has intrusted them with; and whose coming is to be believed, loved, looked, and hoped for by all, that love him in sincerity and truth.</p>
