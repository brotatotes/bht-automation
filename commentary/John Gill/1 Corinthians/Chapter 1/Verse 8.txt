<p><strong>Who shall also confirm you unto the end</strong>,.... The author of this blessing of confirmation is not the Lord Jesus Christ, though he is mentioned in the latter part of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</span>; and seems to be the antecedent to the relative "who" in this, but is not, for this confirmation is made in him; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:21">2 Corinthians 1:21</span>; and besides, it is in order that the saints might be blameless in the day of Christ, and so must design some other person distinct from him, which is God the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:4">1 Corinthians 1:4</span>, to whom the apostle gives thanks, and continues to do so unto this verse; in which he assures the saints of confirmation in grace by God, the author and giver of all grace: and which may be understood of their confirmation in the love and favour of God, from which there can be no separation; and of their establishment in the person of Christ, and in the doctrines of grace; and of the permanency of the grace of the Spirit in them, and of their perseverance in faith and holiness unto the end: that is, of their days; even until the day of Christ, when the good work begun in them shall be performed and finished; that is, "for ever", as the Ethiopic version reads it; for the love of God to his people always continues; their interest in Christ can never be lost; grace in them is an immortal seed; nor shall they be ever finally and totally moved away from the hope of the Gospel:</p>
<p><strong>that ye may be blameless</strong>; not in themselves, for no man is without his faults; none of God's children are without their failings and infirmities; they have whereof to blame themselves, and may be blamed by God too in a providential way; but they are so in Christ their head, being justified by his righteousness, and washed in his blood; and so in the sight of God, as considered in Christ; and will appear such</p>
<p><strong>in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ</strong>, when he shall descend from heaven, and take his saints to him, and present them to himself a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.</p>
