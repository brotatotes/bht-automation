<p><strong>But I say</strong>,.... This is my sense and meaning,</p>
<p><strong>that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice unto devils, and not to God</strong>; reference is had to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+32:17">Deuteronomy 32:17</span> for what the Gentiles sacrificed, though they did not sacrifice intentionally to the idols of gold, silver, wood, and stone, but to God in them, as they pretended; yet inasmuch as in such worship and sacrifices they were directed, instigated, influenced, and assisted by devils, who took up their residence in these idols, and gave forth their oracles from them, they sacrificed to them; and which some have done, as in India and China, professedly and openly, and all other idolaters, eventually, virtually, and covertly:</p>
<p><strong>and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils</strong>; as all wicked men have, in the commission of any lust, sin, or immorality; and as all idolaters have in their superstitious practices, and idolatrous worship; and if grace prevent not, will have to all eternity in everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels; wherefore the apostle would have the Corinthians flee from idolatry, and all appearance of it, and abstain from eating things offered to idols, of which they could not eat without having fellowship with devils; this he says, to deter them from such practices, which must be very horrible and shocking, and bespeaks in him great care of them, and affection for them.</p>
