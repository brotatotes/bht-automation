<p><strong>If any of them that believe not</strong>,.... In Christ, and make no profession of faith in him; but are infidels to his person, office, grace, righteousness, Gospel, and ordinances, as there were many such at Corinth: "bid you" to a feast; invite you to dine or sup with them in their own houses:</p>
<p><strong>and ye be disposed to go</strong>; the apostle does not lay any commands upon them to go, or not go, but leaves them to their own will, inclination, and discretion; for as circumstances might be, it might be either proper or improper to listen to an invitation from such a quarter; but if they were inclined, and did think fit to go, which they might without sin; for as it is lawful to trade, so to eat and drink with unbelievers; then his advice is,</p>
<p><strong>whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no questions for conscience sake</strong>; that is, as before, as whether it is offered to idols or not; lest either their own, or another's conscience should be hurt thereby.</p>
