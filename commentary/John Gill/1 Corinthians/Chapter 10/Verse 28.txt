<p><strong>But if any man say unto you</strong>,.... Either a weak believer, to prevent the doing of what he thought to be sinful; or the unbeliever, that invites to try the integrity of his Christian guest, and to draw him into a snare:</p>
<p><strong>this is offered in sacrifice unto idols</strong>; the meat that is in that dish, or that portion of food which stands in such a part of the table, came out of an idol's temple, and was sacrificed to idols; which with the Jews were forbidden o: for</p>
<p>"everything that came out of an idol's temple was forbidden, and was reckoned as the sacrifices of the dead; for it was not thought possible it could be there, and not offered to idols:''</p>
<p>now when any at the feast, either believer or unbeliever, should thus point at any particular dish, and affirm this of it; then the apostle's advice is,</p>
<p><strong>eat not for his sake that showed it</strong>: who, if a weak believer, will be grieved and wounded; and if an infidel, will be hardened in his impiety, and be furnished with an opportunity of reproaching the Christians, as variable, insincere, and unfaithful in their religion:</p>
<p><strong>and for conscience sake</strong>; which is explained in the following verse:</p>
<p><strong>the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof</strong>; which words are neither in the Syriac version, nor in the Vulgate Latin, nor in the Alexandrian copy, and some others, and are thought by some to be added, from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:26">1 Corinthians 10:26</span> though the repetition of them is far from being impertinent; since they contain a very good reason why such a man should abstain from things sacrificed to idols, seeing there is such a plenty and variety of creatures for his use, which he has a right to eat of; and therefore is under no necessity to eat of such sacrifices, nor is it any hardship upon him to forbear the use of them.</p>
<p>o T. Bab. Avoda Zara, fol. 32. 2.</p>
