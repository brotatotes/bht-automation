<p><strong>Now I praise you, brethren</strong>,.... The apostle prefaces what he had to say by way of commendation of them; though some think that this is said in an ironical way, because there are many things both in this chapter, and in the following part of this epistle, delivered in a way of reproof; but whoever considers the change of style in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:17">1 Corinthians 11:17</span> will easily see, that this must be spoken seriously here, and is designed to raise the attention to what he was about to say, and to prepare their minds to receive, and take in good part, what he should say by way of rebuke; who could not well be angry when he praised them for what was praiseworthy in them, and reproved them for that which was blamable. The things he commends them for are as follow,</p>
<p><strong>that ye remember me in all things</strong>; that is, either that they were mindful of him, though at a distance from them, and had such a veneration for him, and paid such respect to him, and to his judgment, as to write to him to have his sense about any point of doctrine, or case of conscience which had any difficulty in them; or that they bore in memory the doctrines of the Gospel which he had delivered among them; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:2">1 Corinthians 15:2</span> The Arabic version reads, "that ye remember my sayings and deeds"; the doctrines he preached among them, and the examples he set them:</p>
<p><strong>and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you</strong>; meaning, among the rest, if not principally, baptism and the Lord's supper, which he received from Christ, and delivered unto them; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23">1 Corinthians 11:23</span> and which they, at least many of them, kept and observed in the faith of Christ, from a principle of love to him, and with a view to his glory, and that as to the form and manner in which they were delivered to them by the apostle, agreeably to the mind of Christ; but was the apostle alive now, would, or could he praise the generality of those that are called Christians on this account? no; neither of these ordinances in common are kept as they were delivered: as to baptism, it is not attended to either as to subject or mode, both are altered, and are different from the original institution; and the Lord's supper is prostituted to the vilest of men; and, what is "monstrum horrendum", is made a test and qualification for employment in civil and military offices under the government.</p>
