<p><strong>After the same manner also he took the cup</strong>,.... That is, off from the table, or out of the hands of the master of the house, and blessed or gave thanks, as he did before when he took the bread; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:27">Matthew 26:27</span>, "when he had supped"; the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, read, "when they had supped"; which give a true sense, though not a literal translation; for both Christ and his disciples had supped, having both eaten the passover supper, and the bread, the principal part in the Lord's supper, when he took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them:</p>
<p><strong>saying, this cup is the New Testament</strong>, or covenant,</p>
<p><strong>in my blood</strong>; alluding to the old covenant, which was ratified and confirmed by the blood of bulls, and which was called "the blood of the covenant", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:8">Exodus 24:8</span> but the new covenant was established with Christ's own blood, of which the wine in the cup was a sign and symbol; for neither the cup, nor the wine in it, can be thought to be the covenant or testament itself, by which is meant the covenant of grace, as administered under the Gospel dispensation; called new, not because newly made, for it was made from everlasting; or lately revealed, for it was made known to our first parents immediately after the fall, and to other saints in succeeding ages, though more clearly exhibited by Christ under the present dispensation; but it is so called in distinction from the old covenant, or former mode of administration of it, under the Mosaic economy; and it is always new, and will be succeeded by no other; and it provides for and promises new things, and which are famous and excellent, and preferable to all others. Now this is said to be "in the blood" of Christ; that is, it is ratified, and all its blessings and promises are confirmed by his blood: hence his blood is called "the blood of the everlasting covenant", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:20">Hebrews 13:20</span>, pardon and righteousness, peace and reconciliation, and entrance into the holiest of all, all come through this blood, and are secured by the same; and to which the faith of the saints is directed in this ordinance, to observe, receive, and enjoy for themselves:</p>
<p><strong>this do ye as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me</strong>; of his soul's being poured out unto death; of his blood being shed for the remission of sins; and of his great love in giving himself an atoning sacrifice to divine justice, and laying such a foundation for solid peace and joy in the hearts of his people.</p>
