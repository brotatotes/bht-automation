<p><strong>For if we would judge ourselves</strong>,.... Examine, try, and prove ourselves as above directed, before we eat and drink; or condemn ourselves, by confessing, acknowledging, and mourning over sin, and by repentance for it; or separate ourselves from the company of profane sinners, come out from among them, and touch not their unclean things; or join with them in their unfruitful works of darkness:</p>
<p><strong>we should not be judged</strong>; by the Lord; he would not inflict these diseases, sicknesses, and death.</p>
