<p><strong>And if any man hunger let him eat at home</strong>,.... Whereby the apostle shows his dislike of their ante-suppers in the place of public worship, at which they behaved in so indecent a manner, neglecting the poor, and too freely indulging themselves; and therefore if anyone was hungry, and could not wait till the Lord's supper was over, let him eat at home before he come to the place of worship, and satisfy his appetite, that he might with more ease and decency attend the table of the Lord:</p>
<p><strong>that ye come not together unto condemnation or judgment</strong>; that is, that you may so behave when ye come together, that you may not bring upon you the judgment of the Lord, either by way of punishment or chastisement; that is to say, bodily diseases or death.</p>
<p><strong>And the rest will I set in order when I come</strong>: meaning, not doctrines of faith, but things respecting ecclesiastical order and polity, which were amiss among them.</p>
