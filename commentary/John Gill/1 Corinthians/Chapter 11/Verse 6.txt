<p><strong>For if the woman be not covered</strong>,.... That is, if her head is not covered with some sort of covering, as is the custom of the place where she lives,</p>
<p><strong>let her also be shorn</strong>; let her hair be cut short; let her wear it as men do theirs; and let her see how she will look, and how she will like that, and how she will be looked upon, and liked by others; everybody will laugh at her, and she will be ashamed of herself:</p>
<p><strong>but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven</strong>: as it is accounted in all civilized nations: the very Heathens a speak of it as a thing abominable, and of which there should not be one single dreadful example: then let her be covered; with a veil, or any sort of covering in common use.</p>
