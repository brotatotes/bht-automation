For if the woman be not covered,.... That is, if her head is not covered with some sort of covering, as is the custom of the place where she lives,let her also be shorn; let her hair be cut short; let her wear it as men do theirs; and let her see how she will look, and how she will like that, and how she will be looked upon, and liked by others; everybody will laugh at her, and she will be ashamed of herself:but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven: as it is accounted in all civilized nations: the very Heathens a speak of it as a thing abominable, and of which there should not be one single dreadful example: then let her be covered; with a veil, or any sort of covering in common use.a Vid. Apul. Metamorph. l. 2. p. 21.
