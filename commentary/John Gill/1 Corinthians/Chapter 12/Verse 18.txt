<p><strong>But now hath God set the members</strong>,.... The members of a natural body, as they are all made and fashioned by God in the form they be, so they are each of them set by him in the place they are:</p>
<p><strong>everyone of them in the body as it hath pleased him</strong>; according to his sovereign will, without consulting any; and each stands in the best situation and position they could be put, and for the greatest service and usefulness to the whole: so God, and not man, hath set every member in the mystical body, the church, in such a place and part of it, as he himself thought fit; some in a higher, others in a lower station, but all for the good of the body; and therefore each member ought to be content with his place, gift, and usefulness, be they what they will; since it is the wise counsel and sovereign pleasure of God, who works all things after the counsel of his own will, that so it should be.</p>
