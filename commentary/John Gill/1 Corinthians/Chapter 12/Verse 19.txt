<p><strong>And if they were all one member</strong>,.... As all eye, or all ear, or all hand, or all foot:</p>
<p><strong>where were the body</strong>? where would be the body? it would not be a body consisting of such proper and suitable members, as now it is: so if the community of the saints were either all ministers, or all hearers, c. there would be no body, consisting of different persons, to receive any benefit or usefulness from either the church of Christ would not be that uniform, useful, and consistent community it is.</p>
