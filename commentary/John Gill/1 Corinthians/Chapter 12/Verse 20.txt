<p><strong>But now are they many members</strong>,.... Of different make and shape, in different parts and places, and of different use and service:</p>
<p><strong>yet but one body</strong>; all are united together, and make up one complete body, and which without each of them would not be perfect: so there are many members in the body of Christ, the church; some are teachers, others are hearers; some give, and others receive; but all make up but one church, of which Christ is the head; nor can anyone of them be spared; was anyone wanting, even the meanest, there would be a deficiency, and the church would not be the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</p>
