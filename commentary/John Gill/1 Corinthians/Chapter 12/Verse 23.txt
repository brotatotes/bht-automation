<p><strong>And those members of the body</strong>,.... As the back parts of it:</p>
<p><strong>which we think to be less honourable</strong>; though greatly useful,</p>
<p><strong>upon these we bestow more abundant honour</strong>; by clothing them, for a man's garments are his honour and glory; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, so the poor members of Christ's church, who are thought to be, though they really are not, the less honourable, have the more abundant honour conferred on them by God and Christ: God has chosen the poor of this world; Christ has sent his Gospel to them; these the Spirit calls and sanctifies, and makes them all glorious within; these Christ has given his churches a particular charge to take care of now, and will own them as his brethren at the great day, before angels and men; as he now greatly honours them with his presence, a large experience of his grace, and the supply of his Spirit:</p>
<p><strong>and our uncomely parts</strong>; which distinguish sexes, and are appointed for generation;</p>
<p><strong>have more abundant comeliness</strong>; by an external covering and ornament, to preserve decency and modesty. I do not know who should be designed by these, unless backsliding believers, who have been suffered to fall into great sins; these are the uncomely parts of the church, who, when made sensible of their evils, are restored again, and received into the church; and a mantle of love is cast over all their failings; and all possible care taken that their faults may not be exposed to the world, that so the name of God, and ways of Christ, may not be blasphemed and evil spoken of.</p>
