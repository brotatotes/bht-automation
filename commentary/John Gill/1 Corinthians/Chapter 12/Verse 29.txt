<p><strong>Are all apostles</strong>?.... No some are prophets, as distinct from apostles; and some are teachers, as distinct from them both, and some are neither:</p>
<p><strong>are all prophets</strong>? no; some are apostles, above them, and some are teachers, inferior to them; and but very few there were who had that peculiar character and gift:</p>
<p><strong>are all teachers</strong>? no; the far greater part of the members of churches are hearers, or persons that are taught in the word; are neither in the office of teaching, nor have they the qualifications for it.</p>
<p><strong>Are all workers of miracles</strong>? no; in those early times, when the gift of doing miracles was bestowed, it was not given to all, only to some; and now there are none that are possessed of it.</p>
