<p><strong>Have all the gifts of healing</strong>?.... No; when these gifts were in being, all had them not. When anointing with oil, in order to heal the sick, was in use, it was only performed by the elders of the church, not by the common members of it, who were to be sent for by the sick on this occasion:</p>
<p><strong>do all speak with tongues</strong>? no; it was not true in fact, as they well knew; though this was greatly coveted after, as a following chapter of this epistle shows;</p>
<p><strong>do all interpret</strong>? that is, unknown tongues, strange languages; or can they? no. This also was a peculiar gift bestowed on some persons only.</p>
