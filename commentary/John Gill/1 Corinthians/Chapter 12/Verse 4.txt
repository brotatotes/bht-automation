<p><strong>Now there are diversities of gifts</strong>,.... Of spiritual ones, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:1">1 Corinthians 12:1</span> which spring from the free grace, and good will and pleasure of God, and are not owing to the merits of men; and therefore such who have the largest share of them should not boast of them as acquired by themselves, or be puffed up on account of them; and those who have the smallest measure should be content and thankful; for though the gifts are different, some have greater, and others lesser, none have all, but all have some, yet not alike:</p>
<p><strong>but the same Spirit</strong>; is the author and giver of all as he pleases; the lesser gifts, and the smallest degree of them, come from the Spirit of God, as well as the greater. Gifts here seem to be the general name for all that follow; and</p>
<p><strong>administrations</strong> and</p>
<p><strong>operations</strong> are the two species of them; and of these a particular account is afterwards given.</p>
