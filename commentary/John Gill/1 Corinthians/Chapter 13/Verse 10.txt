<p><strong>But when that which is perfect is come</strong>,.... When perfect knowledge of God, of Christ, and of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven shall take place; which will not in this life, but in that which is to come. So the Jews say r that at the resurrection, upon the reunion of the soul and body,</p>
<p>"the children of men shall attain to דעה שלימה, "perfect knowledge";''</p>
<p>which is what the apostle refers to here:</p>
<p><strong>and then that which is in part, shall be done away</strong>: the imperfection of knowledge shall be removed; the imperfect manner of communicating knowledge, and of receiving and acquiring it, will cease: thus the apostle explains what he means by the cessation and failing of knowledge, and prophecy; not that knowledge itself will be no more, and a state of ignorance and darkness succeed; but imperfect knowledge will vanish away, or rather will be perfected, or be swallowed up in perfect knowledge; the imperfection of it will disappear; and it will be no more taught and received in part; the whole of truth will be clearly known.</p>
<p>r Midrash Haneelam in Zohar in Gen. fol. 69. 1.</p>
