<p>INTRODUCTION TO 1 CORINTHIANS 14</p>
<p>In this chapter the apostle discourses concerning the use of spiritual gifts, and prefers prophesying, or preaching, to every other gift; and directs to the order and manner of using it, and also points at the persons who should exercise it; and whereas there was much confusion and disorder in this church, in the management of the affairs of it, the chapter is concluded with a general exhortation to do everything in a decent and orderly manner. The apostle begins with an exhortation to follow after charity, which he had commended in the preceding chapter, and had preferred to gifts, and yet he would not have gifts slighted, but represents them as desirable; particularly prophesying or preaching, which he prefers above all, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:1">1 Corinthians 14:1</span> and especially above the gift of tongues, and for which he gives his reasons; he that speaks with tongues, speaks to God and not to men; at least not to their understanding, though he may by his gift deliver the most excellent truths, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:2">1 Corinthians 14:2</span> whereas he that preaches speaks to men, to their edification, exhortation, and comfort, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span> the one edifies himself, and the other the church, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:4">1 Corinthians 14:4</span> wherefore since he had a sincere affection for this church, though he could wish they all had the gift of speaking with tongues, yet he rather desired they might have the gift of preaching, because that was most for edification, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:5">1 Corinthians 14:5</span> and exemplifies this in himself, that should he come to them speaking with divers tongues, this would be of no use to them, unless he came revealing, making known, and preaching the doctrines of the Gospel to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:6">1 Corinthians 14:6</span> and illustrates this by a simile taken from musical instruments, in which unless there is a distinction of sounds, the music will not be understood, and there can be nothing grateful and pleasant: and such is speaking with divers tongues, without an interpretation, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:7">1 Corinthians 14:7</span> and particularly by a simile taken from the trumpet, as used in war; which if it gives a sound that is unknown, it will be no direction to prepare for the battle, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:8">1 Corinthians 14:8</span> which similes are accommodated to the case in hand; showing that words easy to be understood by the hearer should be made use of by the speaker, or speaking is in vain, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:9">1 Corinthians 14:9</span> each word in every language indeed has its signification, some idea or another annexed to it; but if this is not understood by the hearer as well as the speaker, they become barbarians to one another, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:10">1 Corinthians 14:10</span> wherefore such as were eagerly desirous of spiritual gifts, should covet those that were most for edification; and if speaking with tongues were what they were most set upon, they should pray for the gift of interpretation also, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:12">1 Corinthians 14:12</span> because, for instance, if prayer is made in an unknown tongue, the extraordinary gift indeed may be exercised, but not to the understanding, and so not to the profit of others, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:14">1 Corinthians 14:14</span> hence the apostle determines for himself, that though he should make use of his spiritual gifts, both in praying and singing, it should be in such a manner as to be understood by others, as well as himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:15">1 Corinthians 14:15</span> and it was right for everyone to do so likewise, otherwise persons not knowing what is prayed for, or thanks given for, would be so far from being able to join in the exercise, that they could not so much as say Amen at the conclusion of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:16">1 Corinthians 14:16</span> and though thanks might be returned for a mercy received in ever so agreeable a manner, yet it could be no ways edifying to a man that did not understand the language in which it was expressed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:17">1 Corinthians 14:17</span> not that the apostle said all this, because he had not such a gift himself, for he had it to a greater degree than any in this church had arrived to, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:18">1 Corinthians 14:18</span> yet after all it was more eligible to him to speak live words in a public manner, so as to be understood, than ten thousand in a language the people were ignorant of, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:19">1 Corinthians 14:19</span> wherefore he exhorts the Corinthians not to act the childish part, to covet speaking with tongues, but rather the more manly one, to prophesy, or preach, to the understanding of others, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:20">1 Corinthians 14:20</span> moreover, the apostle deters them from seeking to speak with divers tongues, by citing a passage out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:11">Isaiah 28:11</span> by which it appears, that speaking with divers tongues and strange languages was sometimes threatened as a punishment, and not given as a blessing, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:21">1 Corinthians 14:21</span> besides, speaking with tongues was a sign of unbelief, and used for the conviction of unbelievers; whereas prophesying, or preaching, was a sign of faith, and was for the profit of believers, and therefore the most desirable, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:22">1 Corinthians 14:22</span> to which he adds another reason, dissuading from the use of speaking with divers tongues in public, where they are not understood, taken from the opinion that ignorant and unbelieving persons coming into their assemblies would entertain of them, as though they were madmen, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:23">1 Corinthians 14:23</span> whereas should they preach in a language understood, on the contrary it might be of use for the conviction of such persons, who having the secrets of their hearts laid open to them, will fall down and worship God, whose word they hear; and when they depart, report that the divine presence is with such a people, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:24">1 Corinthians 14:24</span> hence the apostle proceeds to direct to the proper and orderly manner of using gifts; that whereas there were different ones among them, one had one gift, and another had another, they might all be used, provided they were used in such a manner as to tend to edification, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:26">1 Corinthians 14:26</span> so for instance, if speaking in an unknown tongue was used, it should be only by two or three at most, one after another; and there should be an interpreter to make known the meaning of what was said to the people, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:27">1 Corinthians 14:27</span> but if there were none that had the gift of interpreting, then it was most advisable for the speaker to be silent in public, and only in private speak to God and himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:28">1 Corinthians 14:28</span> and then as for those that had the gift of prophesying, or preaching, these should exercise their gift two or three at a time, one after another, and the rest should sit and judge what they delivered, whether agreeable to the word of God or not, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:29">1 Corinthians 14:29</span> and should anything be more clearly revealed to one that sat and heard, the speaker should be silent, and give way to him, that he might have the opportunity of declaring it to the edification of the church, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:30">1 Corinthians 14:30</span> for all that had the gift of preaching might use it one after another, by turns, for general instruction and comfort, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:31">1 Corinthians 14:31</span> seeing spiritual gifts are subject to and at the dispose of those that are possessed of them: or the doctrines preached by the one are subject to the examination and judgment of the other, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:32">1 Corinthians 14:32</span> for God, the donor of all gifts, is the author of order and peace, and not of confusion in all the churches, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:33">1 Corinthians 14:33</span> and whereas the apostle had suggested, that all might prophecy, or preach, that is, that had gifts qualifying for it, he would be understood only of men, and not women, who were not permitted to speak in the church in a way of preaching; no, not even to ask questions there about what they heard, but if they wanted to be informed of any thing they did not rightly understand, they were to ask their husbands at home; this the apostle argues, partly from the law, which commands them to be in obedience to men, and partly from the indecency of such a practice, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:34">1 Corinthians 14:34</span> and seeing as it should seem such a practice did obtain in the church at Corinth, the apostle warmly reproves them for it, it being what was not to be observed in other churches, by intimating to them, that the Gospel neither came out from them, nor did it come to them only, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:36">1 Corinthians 14:36</span> and whoever had a gift of preaching, or a spiritual understanding of things, must allow, that what the apostle said were not the commandments of men, but of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:37">1 Corinthians 14:37</span> but as for ignorant persons, who were affectedly and wilfully such, they must so remain, there was no help for it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:38">1 Corinthians 14:38</span> upon which the apostle repeats his exhortation he set out with, to desire in the first place the gift of prophesying, or preaching, though he would not have speaking with tongues forbidden, provided the above rules were attended to, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:39">1 Corinthians 14:39</span> and concludes with a general exhortation to do all the above things, and everything relating to the doctrine and discipline of the church, in a becoming and orderly manner, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:40">1 Corinthians 14:40</span>. </p>
