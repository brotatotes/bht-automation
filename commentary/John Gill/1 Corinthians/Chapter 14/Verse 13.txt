<p><strong>Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue</strong>,.... The Hebrew, or any other, the gift of speaking with which is bestowed upon him:</p>
<p><strong>pray that he may interpret</strong>; that he may have also the gift of interpretation of tongues; for as has been before hinted, these two gifts were distinct; and a man might have the one, and not the other; a man might speak in an unknown tongue, so as to understand himself, what he said, and be edified, and yet not be capable of translating it at once into the common language of the people; and if he could not do this, he would not excel in his gift to the edification of the church; whereas if he could interpret he would, and therefore, above all things, he should pray to the Father of lights, the giver of every good and perfect gift, that he might be furnished with this also.</p>
