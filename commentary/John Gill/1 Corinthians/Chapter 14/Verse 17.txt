<p><strong>For thou verily givest thanks well</strong>,.... In very proper words, and pertinent expressions, with great affection and devotion, suitable to the service;</p>
<p><strong>but the other is not edified</strong>; the rest of the people, who do not understand the language in which thanks are given; "thy friend", as the Syriac version reads it; or thy next neighbour, he that stands by thee, receives no manner of profit by it, because he does not understand what is said.</p>
