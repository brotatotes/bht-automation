<p><strong>Wherefore tongues are for a sign</strong>,.... Of wrath and punishment inflicted on a rebellious and unbelieving people, and not of grace and kindness, as prophesying, or speaking to them by the prophets, was; and so this is an inference from what is said in the preceding verse, and shows, that there was no reason why believers should be so very desirous of them. But if these words refer to all that is said before on this subject, the word "sign" may be taken for a miracle; and so a new argument is formed against an over fondness for divers tongues, and the use of them in public worship, showing the preferableness of prophecy to them; for speaking with divers tongues was used in a miraculous way,</p>
<p><strong>not to them that believe</strong>; who have no need of miracles to raise their attention to what is said, and that it may gain credit with them, or to confirm their faith in it:</p>
<p><strong>but to them that believe not</strong>; to prepare them to listen to what might be suggested to them, when they see the persons speaking were endued with miraculous powers, and to engage their assent to it, and belief of it; and so with such persons, and for such purposes, was the gift of speaking with divers tongues used by the apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</span> but inasmuch as the Corinthian church consisted of believers, there was no need of such a sign or miracle among them; wherefore, if they desired such gifts, and to make use of them, they should choose to do it, not in the church, but among unbelievers:</p>
<p><strong>but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not</strong>; that is, not for them only; for prophesying or explaining the prophetic writings, or preaching the word, may be, and often is, the means of converting unbelievers; yet this is not the only use, nor does it serve for, or administer comfort to unbelievers as such; but is profitable to, and serves</p>
<p><strong>for them which believe</strong>: it is for their edification, exhortation, and comfort, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:4">1 Corinthians 14:4</span> it is the means of building them up on their most holy faith; of quickening and stirring them up to the exercise of grace, and performance of duty; of comforting them under various distresses, inward and outward; and of establishing, strengthening, and settling them, and therefore much more eligible to be used in a church of Christ, than speaking with tongues.</p>
