<p><strong>He that speaketh its an unknown tongue</strong>,.... Be it the Hebrew language, or any other; some copies, and the Ethiopic version, read, "with tongues":</p>
<p><strong>edifieth himself</strong>; his heart may be warmed, his affections raised, his devotion kept up, and he be in a very spiritual and comfortable frame, knowing and understanding what he himself says:</p>
<p><strong>but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church</strong>: which is the great end of the Gospel ministry, which is for the edifying the body of the church: wherefore that which tends to the edification of more, even the whole church, must be preferable to that, which at most can only edify one, and that the speaker himself.</p>
