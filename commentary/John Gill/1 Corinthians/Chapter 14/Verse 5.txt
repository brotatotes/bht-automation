<p><strong>I would that ye all spake with tongues</strong>,.... This the apostle says, to prevent being misunderstood; for his view was not to bring the gift of tongues into contempt, or to represent it as at all times, and on all occasions, useless and insignificant; nor would he be thought to envy them this gift, or beat them off of desiring it; for, for his own part, he could wish they all had it, was it the will of God; though he must needs say, that prophesying was most desirable by him, as being most profitable;</p>
<p><strong>but rather that ye prophesied</strong>; he wished them all prophets, as Moses did all the Lord's people; he was not against their speaking with tongues, but this was the most eligible, for which he gives this reason:</p>
<p><strong>for greater is he that prophesieth, than he that speaketh with tongues</strong>; that is, he is more useful and profitable to men, and so consequently more honourable, in higher esteem, and more valued, and in greater dignity, being in a more serviceable post and office, and which is more beneficial and advantageous to mankind:</p>
<p><strong>except he interpret</strong>; what he said; and then he might stand upon an equal foot, and be equally useful with him that prophesieth; but this everyone could not do that spake with tongues; for speaking with tongues, and the interpretation of tongues, were two distinct gifts; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:10">1 Corinthians 12:10</span> and though a man that had the gift of tongues might understand what he himself said to his own edification, yet not be able to interpret it to the understanding and edification of others; and if he could not do this, his speaking was to no purpose: hence the apostle advises such an one to pray that he might interpret, have the gift of interpretation also, in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:13">1 Corinthians 14:13</span>.</p>
<p><strong>That the church may receive edifying</strong>: which otherwise cannot be thought it should, or be expected, and then an opportunity and ordinance would be wholly lost.</p>
