<p><strong>whether pipe or harp</strong>; wind music, or hand music; either that which is blown with the breath, or pressed or stricken with the hand:</p>
<p><strong>except they give a distinction in the sounds</strong>; or "tunes", so as one may be discerned from another; as that this is such a musical note, and that is another:</p>
<p><strong>how shall it be known what is piped or harped</strong>? what tune is played; such an use of instruments would be a mere jargon, and not music, and so yield no pleasure to the ear, or mind; and just the like must speaking in an unknown tongue be, to one that understands it not.</p>
