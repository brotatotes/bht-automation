<p>INTRODUCTION TO 1 CORINTHIANS 15</p>
<p>The apostle, in this chapter, recommends the Gospel, and gives a summary of it, proves the resurrection of Christ, and by various arguments establishes the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, and answers objections made unto it. He also sets forth the glory there will be upon the bodies of risen saints, and the change that will be made on living ones; and concludes with an exhortation to perseverance in faith and holiness. As his chief view is the doctrine of the resurrection, he introduces this by recommending the Gospel in general, or by observing that this is a principal doctrine which should be remembered and retained, because it was the Gospel which he had preached, and they had received, and had hitherto persevered in, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:1">1 Corinthians 15:1</span> and besides was essential to salvation, and the means of it, by which they would be saved, if they retained it, except their faith in it was in vain, as it would be should they drop it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:2">1 Corinthians 15:2</span>. And moreover, the apostle had received it by divine revelation, and had faithfully delivered it to them, and therefore it became them to hold it fast; the sum of which were the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, agreeably to the Scriptures of the Old Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</span> and then he reckons up the eyewitnesses of the latter, as first Peter, then the twelve disciples, then five hundred brethren at one time; next James, and all the apostles; and last of all himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:5">1 Corinthians 15:5</span> of whom he speaks in a very diminishing style, describing himself as an abortive, affirming himself to be the least of the apostles, and unworthy to be in that office, or bear that name, giving this as a reason for it, because he had been a persecutor of the church of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:9">1 Corinthians 15:9</span> wherefore he ascribes the dignity he was raised to entirely to the free grace of God; and yet he magnifies his office, and observes, that the gifts of grace bestowed upon him were not in vain, and that he was a more abundant labourer than the rest of the apostles, and had more success; but then he freely declares that all he had, and all he did, were by the grace of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:10">1 Corinthians 15:10</span>. But however, not to insist upon the difference between him and other apostles; he observes, that the subject matter of their ministry was the same, namely, a suffering and risen Saviour, and who was also the object of the faith of the believing Corinthians, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:11">1 Corinthians 15:11</span> wherefore the apostle proceeds to blame some among them for denying the doctrine of the resurrection from the dead, seeing it was a principal part of the ministry of the Gospel, that Christ was risen from the dead, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:12">1 Corinthians 15:12</span> whereas that would not be true, if there is no resurrection of the dead, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:13">1 Corinthians 15:13</span> but that Christ is risen, is not only evident from the testimonies of eyewitnesses before produced, but from the absurdities that follow upon a denial of it, as that the preaching of the Gospel was a vain thing, and faith in it also, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:14">1 Corinthians 15:14</span> yea, the apostles would be no other than false witnesses of God, testifying that he raised up Christ, when he is not risen, if the dead rise not, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:15">1 Corinthians 15:15</span> which argument is repeated, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:16">1 Corinthians 15:16</span> and other absurdities following such an hypothesis are added; as besides what was before mentioned, that faith becomes hereby a vain thing, such as have believed in him must be in an unregenerate state, and both under the power and guilt of sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:17">1 Corinthians 15:17</span> nay, not only so, but such who are dead in Christ, or for his sake are lost and perished, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:18">1 Corinthians 15:18</span> and even those of the saints who are alive must be the most unhappy and miserable of all mortals, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:19">1 Corinthians 15:19</span>. But inasmuch as it is a certain point that Christ is risen, it is as clear a case that the saints will rise, which is argued from Christ being the firstfruits of those that are fallen asleep in him, which secures their resurrection to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:20">1 Corinthians 15:20</span> and from his being their covenant head, as Adam was to his posterity; so that as all his offspring died in him, all the saints will be quickened by Christ, death coming by the one, and the resurrection by the other, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:21">1 Corinthians 15:21</span>. And whereas it might be objected, if this is the case, why did not the saints, who were dead before the resurrection of Christ, rise from the dead when he did, or quickly after? To which it is answered, there is an order observed agreeable to the firstfruits and lump: Christ, the firstfruits, is first, and then they that believe in him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:23">1 Corinthians 15:23</span> and this will not be until the second coming of Christ, and the end of all things, when all the elect of God shall be gathered in; and then they will be raised and presented to the Father complete in soul and body, and all rule and authority among men will cease, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:24">1 Corinthians 15:24</span>. But in the mean while Christ must reign until all enemies are subject to him, and the last of all that will be destroyed by him is death; which is another argument proving the resurrection of the dead; for if death is destroyed, the dead must rise, and never die more, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:25">1 Corinthians 15:25</span> That all things will be put under the feet of Christ, every enemy, and so death, is proved from a testimony out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:6">Psalms 8:6</span>. But to prevent a cavil, and secure the honour of God the Father, he is excepted from being subject to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:27">1 Corinthians 15:27</span> so far is he from being so, that the Son shall be subject to him, and appear to be so as Mediator, by giving up the account of things to him; the end of which is, that God, Father, Son, and Spirit, may be all in all, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:28">1 Corinthians 15:28</span>. The resurrection of the dead is further argued from the sufferings of the saints and martyrs of Jesus, for the sake of him and his Gospel, and particularly this doctrine of it, which are first figuratively expressed under the notion of a baptism, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:29">1 Corinthians 15:29</span> and then more literally and clearly signified by being in jeopardy, and exposed to danger of life continually, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:30">1 Corinthians 15:30</span> and which is exemplified in the case of the apostle himself, who was liable to death daily, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:31">1 Corinthians 15:31</span> of which he gives a particular instance in his fighting with beasts at Ephesus. Moreover, another absurdity would follow upon this, should this doctrine not be true; and that is, that a loose and licentious life, such an one as the Epicureans live, would be encouraged hereby, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:32">1 Corinthians 15:32</span> from which the apostle dissuades; partly from the pernicious effect of it, which he shows by a passage cited out of one of the Heathens, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:33">1 Corinthians 15:33</span> and partly from its being contrary to a righteous conversation, and from the stupidity, sinfulness, and ignorance, which such a course of life, upon such principles, declares, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:34">1 Corinthians 15:34</span>. And then the apostle proceeds to answer questions, and remove objections relating to the resurrection of the dead; which questions and objections are put, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:35">1 Corinthians 15:35</span> which suppose the thing to be impossible and absurd, and to which answers are returned, first by observing, that grain which is sown in the earth first dies before it is quickened, and that it does not rise up bare grain as it was sown, but in a different form and shape, with additional circumstances greatly to its advantage; and has a body given by the power, and according to the pleasure of God, and suitable to the nature of the seed; by which is suggested, that in like manner the body first dies, and then is raised;, and though the same body, yet it is raised in a different form with different qualities, by the power, and according to the will of God; and therefore seeing there are every year such innumerable instances in nature, of dead and putrefied grain being revived, it need not be thought incredible, impracticable, and absurd, that God should raise the dead, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:36">1 Corinthians 15:36</span> and that the body, though the same shall rise different from what it was when laid in the grave, is illustrated by the difference of flesh in men, beasts, fishes, and birds; which, though all of it flesh, differs from each other; and so will the flesh of the body, in the resurrection, differ from the flesh it is now clothed with, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:39">1 Corinthians 15:39</span>. And the same is further illustrated by the difference there is in the heavenly and earthly bodies, in the sun, and moon, and stars, and in one star from another; all which have respect to the same, showing not any difference there will be in risen bodies among themselves, but in risen bodies from what they now are, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:40">1 Corinthians 15:40</span> as appears by the accommodation of these similes to the resurrection of the dead; and which differences are clearly expressed, the present bodies being corrupt, dishonourable, weak, and natural, the risen ones being incorruptible, glorious, powerful, and spiritual, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:42">1 Corinthians 15:42</span>. And that the risen bodies will be spiritual, the apostle proves, by comparing Adam and Christ together; the one had a natural body, the other had a spiritual body after his resurrection, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span> the order of which is given, the natural body of Adam was before the spiritual body of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:46">1 Corinthians 15:46</span>. Their original is also taken notice of, the one being of the earth, the other front heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:47">1 Corinthians 15:47</span> and so accordingly the offspring of the one, and of the other, are different; the offspring of the first Adam are earthly like him, and have a natural body, as he had; the offspring of the second Adam are heavenly, as he was, and will have a body like to his; for as they bear the image of the first man, from whom they naturally descend, by having a natural body like to his, so they must bear the image of the second man, the Lord from heaven, by having a spiritual body fashioned like to his glorious body, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:48">1 Corinthians 15:48</span>. And there is an absolute necessity for this, seeing bodies, in their present state, and case, as natural, mortal, and sinful, cannot be admitted into the possession of the kingdom and glory of the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:50">1 Corinthians 15:50</span> but inasmuch as all will not die, and so be raised again, but some will be alive at the coming of Christ and the resurrection of the dead, a difficulty arises how the living saints will come by spiritual bodies, in order to inherit the kingdom of God, without which they cannot inherit it: this difficulty the apostle removes, by making known a secret never divulged before, that at the same time the dead will be raised, which will be at the sounding of a trumpet; in a moment, at once the living saints will be changed, and become immortal and incorruptible, as the raised ones, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:51">1 Corinthians 15:51</span> for so it must be that these corruptible and mortal bodies be clothed with incorruption and immortality, either by the resurrection of them, or a change upon them, when either way they will become spiritual, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:53">1 Corinthians 15:53</span>. And hereby some prophecies in Isaiah and Hoses will have their accomplishment, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:54">1 Corinthians 15:54</span> on the mention of which, some things in them are explained, as that sin is the sting of death, and the law is the strength of sin, which regard the prophecy in Hosea, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:56">1 Corinthians 15:56</span> and the victory obtained over death, which is mentioned in the prophecy of Isaiah, is ascribed to God, who gives it through Christ, to whom thanks are returned for it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:57">1 Corinthians 15:57</span>. And the chapter is concluded with an exhortation steadfastly to abide by the cause of Christ, and in his service; to which the saints are encouraged from this consideration, that they will find their account in it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:58">1 Corinthians 15:58</span>. </p>
