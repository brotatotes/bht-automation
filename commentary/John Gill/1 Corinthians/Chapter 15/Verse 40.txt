<p><strong>There are also celestial bodies</strong>,.... Or bodies in the heavens, as the sun, moon, and stars:</p>
<p><strong>and bodies terrestrial</strong>; or bodies on earth, animate and inanimate, men, beasts, trees, minerals, c.</p>
<p><strong>But the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another</strong>: though both sorts are bodies, yet their qualities differ, and there is a greater glory in the one than in the other. This is another similitude, serving to help our ideas of this doctrine of the resurrection of the body that though it is the same in substance, yet different in qualities; and does not design any difference between the bodies of good men and bad men, elect and reprobate; as if the one were intended by the celestial bodies, and the other by the terrestrial; and much less degrees of glory in the saints themselves, who, imagine them in as low a form as can be, can never be compared to terrestrial ones; but it shows the difference there will be between the raised bodies and the present ones; which will be as great as that which now is between celestial and terrestrial bodies.</p>
