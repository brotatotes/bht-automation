<p><strong>It is sown a natural body</strong>,.... Or an animal one, being generated as animals are, and supported with food as they be, and die at last as they do: see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ec+3:19">Ecclesiastes 3:19</span>.</p>
<p><strong>It is raised a spiritual body</strong>; not as to substance, but as to its quality; it will not be changed into a spirit; our Lord's risen body, to which ours will be conformed, was not a spirit, but, as before, consisted of flesh and bones: but the body will then be subject to the spirit and soul of man; it will be employed in spiritual service, for which it will be abundantly fitted and assisted by the Spirit of God; and it will be delighted with spiritual objects; it will be like the angels, those excellent spirits; it will live as spirits do, without natural helps and means, as meat, drink, clothes, sleep, and, as they, will never die:</p>
<p><strong>there is a natural</strong>; or "animal body", such as the first man's was, and those are that descend from him by ordinary generation; and</p>
<p><strong>there is a spiritual body</strong>; such as the body of Christ now is, and as will be the bodies of the risen saints; the phrase is Jewish, הרוחני</p>

<p>בשרם רוחנים, "spiritual flesh" z, are to be met with in their writings.</p>
