<p><strong>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption</strong>,.... As at the coming of Christ, both the bodies of living saints, and of dead ones being raised, will: and this</p>
<p><strong>mortal shall have put on immortality</strong>; which will be the case, in the resurrection morn:</p>
<p><strong>then shall be brought to pass that saying that is written</strong>; then that passage will have its full accomplishment, which stands in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+25:8">Isaiah 25:8</span> where it is read,</p>
<p><strong>he will swallow up death in victory</strong>, or "for ever". That is, the Messiah shall by his death, and resurrection from the dead, obtain such an entire victory over death, not only for himself, but for all his people, that in the resurrection morn, when they will be all raised from the dead, death will be so swallowed up, that it will be no more: the Jews acknowledge that this prophecy belongs to the times of the Messiah; so they say p, that</p>
<p>"the Messiah shall descend from Pharez, and in his day the holy blessed God will cause death to be swallowed up, as it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+25:8">Isaiah 25:8</span> "he shall swallow up death in victory":''</p>
<p>and again q,</p>
<p>"when the King Messiah comes, the holy blessed God will raise up those that sleep in the dust, as it is written, he shall swallow up death in victory:''</p>
<p>they also say r, that this passage refers to future time, and to the world to come. The prophet expresses it actively, it being a prediction of what was to be done by the Messiah; the apostle cites it passively, as being accomplished by him after the resurrection, and considered as a part of the song sung by the risen saints; to which is added,</p>
