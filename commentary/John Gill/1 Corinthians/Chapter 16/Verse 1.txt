<p><strong>Now concerning the collection for the saints</strong>,.... Not at Corinth, but at Jerusalem, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:3">1 Corinthians 16:3</span> for the poor saints there, who were reduced to poverty, either through the spoiling of their goods by their persecuting countrymen; or through the selling of their possessions, and putting their substance into one common stock, which was now exhausted, partly by their living upon it, and partly by the expending of it for the enlargement of the interest of Christ, and the spread of his Gospel among the Gentiles; so that it was but fit and reasonable that they should assist them in their necessitous circumstances: wherefore the apostle, after he had gone through the various subjects he thought fit to write upon, relating both to doctrine and practice, proceeds to give some orders, directions, and instructions, concerning this matter.</p>
<p><strong>As I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye</strong>. The churches of Galatia were those he wrote an epistle to, which bears their name, and in which he takes notice of the request of the apostles at Jerusalem to him, that he would remember the poor as he travelled through the Gentile countries, and which, no doubt, he mentions, as a hint unto them to collect for them. <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:10">Galatians 2:10</span> though the order he here speaks of was doubtless given them when he passed through the region of Galatia, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:6">Acts 16:6</span>. This he observes by way of example to the church at Corinth, and to show them, that what he ordered them was no other than what he enjoined other churches, and which they were ready to come into, as these in Galatia, and also in Macedonia; and designs this as a spur unto them, that if the Galatians, who were a more rude and uncultivated people, being now called by grace, were ready to such a good work, they who were a more polite people, and used to civility, humanity, and tenderness, would not be backward to it.</p>
