<p><strong>That ye submit yourselves to such</strong>,.... To persons of such a character, and in such an office; if in ministering to poor saints, by assisting them, and by putting into their hands; and putting it in their power to discharge their work fully, in which they were so heartily concerned; and if in the work of the ministry of the word, by attending their ministrations, receiving the truths delivered by them with faith and love, so far as they appeared to be agreeably to the word of God; hearkening to their admonitions, counsels and advice, regarding their censures and reproofs by the authority of the church, and in their name, and by subjection to the laws of Christ's house, as put in execution by them, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:17">Hebrews 13:17</span>,</p>
<p><strong>and to everyone that helpeth with us</strong>; in any form, whether by relieving the poor, or by preaching the Gospel:</p>
<p><strong>and laboureth</strong>; in the Lord's vineyard, in the word and doctrine, for the good of souls, and the glory of Christ: for such are worthy of double honour, and ought to be valued and esteemed for their works' sake, and submitted to in everything that is according to the rules of the Gospel.</p>
