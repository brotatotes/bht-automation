<p><strong>I am glad of the coming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus</strong>,.... Who very probably were those of the household of Chloe, mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:11">1 Corinthians 1:11</span>, who came either of their own accord, or were sent as messengers from the church at Corinth to the apostle; who was glad to see them, one of them being baptized by him, and perhaps all of them converted under his ministry: however, they were believers in Christ, if not ministers of the Gospel, which seems very probable.</p>
<p><strong>For that which was lacking on your part they have supplied</strong>; which is not to be understood of their supplying him with money, in which the Corinthians had been deficient; for as he had never taken anything of them, he was determined he never would; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:7">2 Corinthians 11:7</span>; but either of their presence which supplied the want of theirs, the apostle had been for some time greatly desirous of; or whereas they had been greatly wanting in sending him an account of the state of the church, and how things stood with them, these brethren greatly supplied that defect, by giving him a very particular account of their church affairs.</p>
