<p><strong>The churches of Asia salute you</strong>,.... The Syriac version renders it, "all" the churches. This shows, that this epistle was not written from Philippi, as the subscription to it attests, for then he would rather have said; the churches of Macedonia salute you, but at Ephesus, where he now was; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:8">1 Corinthians 16:8</span>; and this is the more confirmed, by the following salutation of Aquila and Priscilla, who it is plain from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:18">Acts 18:18</span>, were with the apostle at Ephesus:</p>
<p><strong>Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord</strong>; Aquila was a Jew of Pontus, and Priscilla was his wife, who came from Italy, all Jews being obliged to depart from Rome, by the order of Claudius Caesar. These came to Corinth, where they met with the apostle; and being of the same occupation, stayed and wrought with him; and when he went from thence to Ephesus, accompanied him thither; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:3">Acts 18:3</span>; wherefore having personal knowledge of the members of this church, through their stay with the apostle there, for the space of a year and a half, send their Christian salutations to them, with great affection and respect:</p>
<p><strong>with the church that is in their house</strong>: their family consisting of believers, and being kept in such good decorum, and employed daily in singing, praying, expounding, and conferring together about divine things, looked like a little church; and it may be that at certain times the principal members of the church at Ephesus met in their house for religious worship, and to consider and debate about the affairs of the church; and very likely as they were of the same occupation with the apostle, he himself dwelt here; and which might be the more an occasion of the church assembling here at times; and the Vulgate Latin version adds, "with whom also I lodge".</p>
