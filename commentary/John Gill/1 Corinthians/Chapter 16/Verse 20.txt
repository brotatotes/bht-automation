Either the brethren, the members of the church at Ephesus; or the apostle's brethren in the ministry, that were along with him, as Sosthenes and others; or the brethren that were come to him from Corinth, namely Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus:</p>
<p><strong>greet ye one another with an holy kiss</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
