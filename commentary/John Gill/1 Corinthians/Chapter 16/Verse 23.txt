<p><strong>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</strong> This is the apostle's salutation in all his epistles, and is a token of the truth and genuineness of them; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; and is a wish for a supply of all grace from Christ, and an increase of it in the saints; that they may have the communications of it to them, to quicken, invigorate, and draw forth into exercise the grace they have received, and to enable and assist them in the discharge of every duty.</p>
