The following subscription is added, not by the apostle, but by some other hand since. "The first" epistle "to the Corinthians was written from Philippi, by Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, and Timotheus"; but, as has been already observed, this epistle was not written from Philippi, but from Ephesus, where the apostle now was, as appears from 1 Corinthians 16:8; nor was it sent by Timotheus, for he was sent out before the writing of this epistle, see 1 Corinthians 4:17, and the apostle puts an if upon his coming to them, in 1 Corinthians 16:10, which he would scarcely have done, if he had sent this letter by him; though very probably it was sent by the other three, who came from Corinth, at their return thither.
