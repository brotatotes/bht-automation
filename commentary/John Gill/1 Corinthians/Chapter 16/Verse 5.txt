<p><strong>Now I will come unto you</strong>,.... Which he again assures them of, as being his real intention and design; though some had given out that he would not come to them any more, and hoped they should never see him any more; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:18">1 Corinthians 4:18</span>.</p>
<p><strong>When I shall pass through Macedonia</strong>; hereby fixing the time when he intended to visit them after he had gone through that country, and had received their collections for the saints at Jerusalem, which the churches there so generously made, and pressed him to the ministering of, of which he speaks in his next epistle.</p>
<p><strong>For I do pass through Macedonia</strong>; not that he was then passing through Macedonia, or was in it, and so at Philippi, from whence this epistle is said to be written, as the subscription at the end of it expresses, for he was now at Ephesus; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:8">1 Corinthians 16:8</span> and from thence was this epistle written; he was not in Macedonia till some time after, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span> but the sense is, that he should take his tour through Macedonia; and so the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "for I shall pass through Macedonia"; and so coming into Greece, he intended to come to Corinth, and stay some time with them.</p>
