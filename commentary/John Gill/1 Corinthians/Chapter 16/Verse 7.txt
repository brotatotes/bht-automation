For I will not see you now by the way,.... Just to look upon them, and be gone, be like a wayfaring man that tarries but for a night:but I trust to tarry a while with you; the whole winter season:if the Lord permit; submitting all to the will of God, at whose sovereign disposal he always was, and at whose beck and command he desired to be, and to do nothing, or be any where, but what was agreeable to the will of God.
