<p><strong>For what man knoweth the things of a man</strong>,.... The thoughts of a man's heart, the conceptions of his mind, the schemes he is drawing there, his designs, purposes, and intentions; these can never be known by another man, no, nor by angels or devils; not by any creature; by none</p>
<p><strong>save the spirit of a man which is in him</strong>? which is only conscious to, and can only make known the things that are in him:</p>
<p><strong>even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God</strong>; and which, as it proves how secret, hidden, unknown, the mysteries of grace are, until revealed by the Spirit; so it gives full evidence to the deity of the Holy Ghost, and clearly shows he must be God, who is in him, knows the thoughts of his heart, the counsels of his mind, his purposes and decrees, and what is contained in them.</p>
