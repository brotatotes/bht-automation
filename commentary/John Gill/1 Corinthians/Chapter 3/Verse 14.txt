That is, if any minister's doctrine will bear the test of daylight, to be looked into, and abide the fire of the word; as gold, silver, and precious stones will, or such doctrines as are comparable to them, which will shine the brighter for being tried by this fire:</p>
<p><strong>which he hath built thereupon</strong>; upon the foundation Christ, in entire consistence with, and proportion to it, and highly becoming it:</p>
<p><strong>he shall receive a reward</strong>; either from the churches of Christ here, who shall honour and respect him for his faithful labours in the ministry; or from Christ hereafter, who will say, well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</p>
