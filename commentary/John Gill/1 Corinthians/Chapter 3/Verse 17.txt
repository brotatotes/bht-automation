<p><strong>If any man defile the temple of God</strong>,.... By the wisdom of the world, through philosophy, and vain deceit; by bringing in false doctrines, errors, and heresies, and hereby corrupt their minds from the simplicity that is in Christ; and make rents, factions, and divisions among them:</p>
<p><strong>him shall God destroy</strong>; body and soul in hell; for as their wicked principles and heretical notions are pernicious to others, they are damnable to themselves, and will bring upon them that judgment which lingereth not, and that damnation which slumbereth not. The false prophet, as well as the beast, and the devil, shall be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone. God is not only an avenger of all immoralities committed against his righteous law, but of all false doctrine and false worship, and of everything that is contrary to the Gospel, and to the order and ordinances of it. The reason of this is,</p>
<p><strong>for the temple of God is holy</strong>; alluding to the holiness of Solomon's temple,</p>
<p>"into which a man might not go with his staff, nor with his shoes on, nor with his purse, nor with dust upon his feet, nor might he make it a thoroughfare, and much less spit in it o.''</p>
<p>And yet, how was it polluted in our Lord's time by the Jews, who made it a den of thieves, instead of an house of prayer?</p>
<p><strong>which temple ye are</strong>. This is added for further confirmation, and to assert their holiness in doctrine, worship, and conversation, and to deter the false teachers from making use of any means to corrupt them in either.</p>
<p>o Misn. Beracot, c. 9. sect. 5.</p>
