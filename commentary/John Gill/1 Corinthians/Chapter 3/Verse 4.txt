<p><strong>For while one saith, I am of Paul</strong>,.... This shows what their envying and strife, and divisions were about, and from whence they sprung; and which serve, to strengthen the proof, and support the charge of carnality brought against them; for when one sort made a party for Paul, and set up him as their minister above all others; and said</p>
<p><strong>another, I am of Apollos</strong>, preferring him for his eloquence above Paul, or any other preacher, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span> there was a third sort for Cephas, whom they cried up as superior to the other two, or any other man; and a fourth were for Christ, and despised all ministers whatever:</p>
<p><strong>are ye not carnal</strong>? all this was a demonstration of it: they could never clear themselves from it, they must be convicted in their own consciences of it; to which the apostle appeals: the Alexandrian copy and the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions read, "are ye not men?"</p>
