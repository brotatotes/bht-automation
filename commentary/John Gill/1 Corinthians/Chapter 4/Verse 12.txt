<p><strong>And labour, working with our own hands</strong>,.... As the apostle did at Corinth, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:3">Acts 18:3</span> and elsewhere; partly to minister to his own necessities, and those of others; and partly that he might not be burdensome to the churches; and also to set an example of diligence and industry to others; though he had a right and power to claim a maintenance of those to whom he ministered.</p>
<p><strong>Being reviled, we bless</strong>; as Christ commanded, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:44">Matthew 5:44</span> and the apostle himself directed and exhorted to, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:14">Romans 12:14</span></p>
<p><strong>being persecuted, we suffer it</strong>; that is, patiently; neither resisting our persecutors, nor murmuring and repining at our unhappy circumstances; but taking all in good part, as what is the will of God, and will make for his glory.</p>
