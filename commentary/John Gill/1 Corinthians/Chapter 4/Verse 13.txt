<p><strong>Being defamed, we entreat</strong>,.... Being blasphemed, as the word signifies, being evil spoken of, our good name taken away, and characters hurt; we entreat or pray to God for them, that he would convince them of their evil, give them repentance unto life, and remission of their sins, according to Christ's direction, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:44">Matthew 5:44</span> and in imitation of his example, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:34">Luke 23:34</span> or we entreat them; so the Syriac version reads it, בעינן מנהון, "we beseech them": not to blaspheme and speak evil of us, since it will be to their own hurt; we give them smooth words, and soft language, not rendering railing for railing, or reviling for reviling:</p>
<p><strong>we are made as the filth of the world, and the offscouring of all things unto this day</strong>; referring, as some think, to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="la+3:45">Lamentations 3:45</span> or to the lustrations and expiations among the Heathens, who when any calamity was upon them, particularly a plague among them, used to take one of the refuse of the people, and sacrifice him by way of expiation; or any living creature, as a sheep which with imprecations they cast into a river, or into the sea, fancying it carried away all the contagion along with it; hence, by way of reproach, such that were under disgrace, and were ejected, and exiled, were called καθαρματα, "purgations"; the refuse of the people, by which the rest were purged u or the reference is to any dirt, or filth in common, swept out of houses, and trodden under foot; and so expresses the mean and abject condition of the apostles, and with what disdain and contempt they were treated in the world: all which shows that they were far from reigning as kings; and whilst this was their case, who were at the head of the interest of Christ, it must be a vain conceit of the Corinthians, that they reigned as kings without them.</p>
