<p><strong>For I verily, as absent in body</strong>,.... As he really was, being now at Philippi, if any dependence is to be had upon the subscription of this epistle; or rather at Ephesus; however, wherever he was, it is certain he was not at Corinth:</p>
<p><strong>but present in spirit</strong>; in his affection to them, care of them, and concern for their good, and the glory of God:</p>
<p><strong>have judged already</strong>; he had considered of the matter, thought very deliberately about it, and was now come to a point, to a determination concerning it, what to do in it:</p>
<p><strong>as though I were present</strong>; upon the spot, in person, to do what he had resolved upon:</p>
<p><strong>to him that hath so done this deed</strong>; this infamous one, and in so scandalous a manner, and which was continued in: what that was which the apostle, upon mature deliberation and judgment, determined to do with this wicked man, is expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span> which is to be connected with this, the whole fourth verse being to be read in a parenthesis, and that was to deliver him to Satan.</p>
