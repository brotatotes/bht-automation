<p>INTRODUCTION TO 1 CORINTHIANS 6</p>
<p>The principal view of this chapter is to dissuade Christians from going to law with one another before Heathens, and also from fornication: the apostle begins with the first of these, and argues against it, from its being a daring, dangerous, and scandalous practice; and from the different characters of the persons, before whom controversies about civil things among Christians should and should not be brought; the one being saints, and so conscientious persons, and would do the right thing; the other unjust, and so justice could not be expected to be done by them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:1">1 Corinthians 6:1</span>, and that the former, and not the latter, should be appointed judges in such cases, is argued from the greater to the lesser; that seeing these will judge the world, much more then should they be employed in matters of less consequence, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:2">1 Corinthians 6:2</span> and by the same sort of argument it is further urged, that even angels themselves shall be judged by the saints; then much more might affairs appertaining to this life, be brought before them, and be decided by them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:3">1 Corinthians 6:3</span> yea, even the things that were litigated by them, and which they had power of judging in, were such as might be determined by the men of the least capacity among them, and therefore had no need to bring them before Heathen magistrates, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:4">1 Corinthians 6:4</span> besides, it could not be spoken of, but to their shame, that after all their boast of their gifts, learning, and eloquence, there was not one man of wisdom and ability among them, to judge in matters of civil property, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:5">1 Corinthians 6:5</span> and this evil of commencing law suits in Heathen courts of judicature, is aggravated by its being done, not between Christians and heathens, but between one Christian brother and another, and that before men that were infidels, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:6">1 Corinthians 6:6</span> and which to do, showed a great deficiency of love, wisdom, and care; and much better it was to take and suffer wrong, than to be guilty of such criminal conduct, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:7">1 Corinthians 6:7</span> yea, those, that drew their brethren before such judgment seats, did them wrong, both by bringing them thither, and by getting their cause in an unjust manner, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:8">1 Corinthians 6:8</span> wherefore, to deter from such unrighteous procedures, the apostles declares, that all injurious persons, and wicked men in any way, and of any sort, should not inherit the kingdom of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:9">1 Corinthians 6:9</span> and whereas some of those the apostle writes to had been such, but now through the grace of God were otherwise, this should be considered as an argument, why they should not contend with one another before persons destitute of the grace they were partakers of, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:11">1 Corinthians 6:11</span> and now the apostle having mentioned fornication as a sin which excluded from the kingdom of God, and this being reckoned by the Gentiles an indifferent thing; he first observes of indifferent things in general, that are really so, that though they are lawful to be used, it is not expedient to use them at all times, and under all circumstances; and especially care should be taken, that by the use of them, we do not become slaves unto them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:12">1 Corinthians 6:12</span> and then particularly instances in meats, which without distinction might be lawfully eaten, they being made for the belly, and the belly for them; which was answering the original design of them, though hereafter both will be destroyed; yet fornication must not be put upon a level with them, and reckoned indifferent as they are; since the body was not made to be abused and defiled, or for fornication: but to be redeemed and sanctified by the Lord, and to serve him, and who was appointed for the redemption and sanctification of that, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:13">1 Corinthians 6:13</span> moreover, the sin of fornication is dissuaded from, by the consideration of the resurrection of the body as a glorious one, by the power of God, of which Christ's resurrection is a pledge; and therefore should not be defiled with this sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:14">1 Corinthians 6:14</span> as also from the bodies of the saints being the members of Christ; and therefore should not be made the members of an harlot by fornication, these things being utterly absurd and inconsistent, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:15">1 Corinthians 6:15</span>. Which is illustrated by observing, that he that is joined in unlawful copulation with an harlot, becomes one flesh with her, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:16">1 Corinthians 6:16</span> which is confirmed by a passage cited out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24">Genesis 2:24</span> which regards carnal copulation in general; but one that is in union with Christ, and is become a member of him, is one spirit with him; and therefore since there is such a spiritual union between them, fornication, which joins, unites, and makes a man one with an harlot, should be carefully avoided, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:17">1 Corinthians 6:17</span> and in order the more to deter from this sin, the apostle observes, that it is not like some other sins, which are without the body, but this is by it, and with it, and against it; it is dishonourable, and may be hurtful to it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:18">1 Corinthians 6:18</span> to which he adds, that the bodies of the saints are the temples of the Holy Ghost, where he dwells, and therefore should not be polluted with fornication, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:19">1 Corinthians 6:19</span> and closes all with an argument, taken from their bodies not being their own property, to use and abuse at pleasure, but the purchase of Christ's blood; and therefore it was incumbent upon them to glorify him with them, as well as with their spirits, and not defile them with fornication. </p>
