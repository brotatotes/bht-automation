<p><strong>Nor thieves</strong>,.... Who take away another man's property, secret or openly, by fraud or force.</p>
<p><strong>Nor covetous</strong>: insatiable, in the lust of uncleanness; or greedy of worldly gain, bent upon increasing their substance at any rate, by circumvention, fraud, and deceit; and do not use the things of this life as they should, for their own good, and that of others.</p>
<p><strong>Nor drunkards</strong> who are strong to drink strong liquors; who give up themselves thereunto: who sit down on purpose to intoxicate themselves, and are frequent in the commission of this sin.</p>
<p><strong>Nor revilers</strong>; who are free with other men's characters, load them with reproaches, and take away their good names; either openly or secretly, either by tale bearing, whispering, and backbiting, or by raising and spreading scandalous reports in a public manner.</p>
<p><strong>Nor extortioners</strong> ravishers of virgins; or plunderers of men's substance in an open and forcible way; or who extort unlawful gain:</p>
<p><strong>shall inherit the kingdom of God</strong>; not that these sins, any or all of them, are unpardonable; for such who have been guilty of them may, through the blood of Christ, receive the remission of them, and through the grace of the Spirit of God obtain repentance for them, and have both right and meetness for the kingdom of heaven, as the following words show.</p>
