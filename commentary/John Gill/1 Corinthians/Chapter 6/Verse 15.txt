<p><strong>Know ye not that your bodies are the members, of Christ</strong>,.... The whole persons of God's elect were chosen in Christ, and given to him, and made one with him, their bodies as well as their souls; and both are redeemed by him, and, in union with him, are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones:</p>
<p><strong>shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid</strong>. Signifying, that it is a most absurd, indecent, abominable, and detestable thing, that the bodies of the saints, which are the members of Christ, should be joined in carnal copulation with an harlot.</p>
