<p><strong>Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you</strong>,.... Or a "defect": a want of brotherly love, or there would be no occasion to go to law at all; a want of wisdom and conduct, or proper persons would be pitched upon, and chosen out from among themselves to be arbitrators and judge between them; and a want of care among their leaders, who else would have pointed out to them such a method of accommodation, and not have suffered them to go the lengths they did:</p>
<p><strong>because ye go to law one with another</strong>; which would never be, was there not a declension among you, a decay of your first love, and of the power of religion and true godliness:</p>
<p><strong>why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded</strong>? than to go to law, especially before unjust persons and unbelievers, taking the advice of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:40">Matthew 5:40</span> It is more advisable to a believer to suffer wrong than to go to law with any man, and especially with a brother. It is a petition in the Jewish liturgy g,</p>
<p>"let it please thee, O Lord God, and the God of my fathers, to deliver me this day, and every day---from hard judgment, and a severe adversary, ברית ובין שאינו בן ברית</p>
<p>בין שהוא בן, "whether he be a Son of the covenant, or whether he be not a son of the covenant".''</p>
<p>g Seder Tephillot, fol. 3. 2. Ed. Basil. fol. 5. 2. Ed. Amst.</p>
