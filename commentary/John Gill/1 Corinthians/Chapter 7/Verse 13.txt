<p><strong>And the woman which hath an husband that believeth</strong>,.... The apostle puts the case both ways, there being the same reason for one as for another; that if she that was a sister, who was partaker of the grace of God, and a member of the church, had a husband to whom she was married before her conversion; who was an unbeliever, had no faith in Christ, nor any notion of the Gospel, but an infidel to both:</p>
<p><strong>and if he be pleased to dwell with her</strong>; loves her, and is willing to continue with her; neither puts her away from him, nor departs from her on account of her Christianity:</p>
<p><strong>let her not leave him</strong>; but continue, and cohabit with him as man and wife; this is the advice the apostle gives, as agreeably to the light of nature and reason; as becoming the Gospel of Christ, and as what might serve to recommend it, and spread the knowledge of it.</p>
