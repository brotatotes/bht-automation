<p><strong>Art thou bound unto a wife</strong>?.... Or to a woman; either by promise, or by espousal, or by consummate marriage; either of which is a tic, or obligation, a bond, and especially the latter; marriage is such a bond as cannot be dissolved, but by the death of one of the parties; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:2">Romans 7:2</span> unless in case of adultery, or of wilful desertion: and it is a bond which mutually obliges; as the husband is bound by the law of marriage to live chastely and lovingly with his wife, and to take care of her, and provide for her; so the wife is bound by the same law to live in like manner with her husband, and to submit unto him, and obey him:</p>
<p><strong>seek not to be loosed</strong>; do not depart from her, nor seek to be divorced, nor even desire to be loosed by death:</p>
<p><strong>art thou loosed from a wife</strong>? being either never married, or else if having been married the wife is dead, or legally divorced for a just cause:</p>
<p><strong>seek not a wife</strong>, or woman; make no inquiry after one; be content to live without one; enter not into a marriage state, nor take any step towards it; it is best to continue loosed, for the reason above given, that is, provided the person has the gift of continence, otherwise not; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:5">1 Corinthians 7:5</span>.</p>
