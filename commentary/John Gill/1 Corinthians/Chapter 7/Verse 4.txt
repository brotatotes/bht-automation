<p><strong>The wife hath not power of her own body</strong>,.... To refrain the use of it from her husband; or to prostitute it to another man:</p>
<p><strong>but the husband</strong>; he has the sole power over it, and may require when he pleases the use of it:</p>
<p><strong>and likewise also the husband has not power over his own body</strong>: to withhold due benevolence, or the conjugal debt from his wife; or abuse it by self-pollution, fornication, adultery, sodomy, or any acts of uncleanness: but the wife; she only has a power over it, a right to it, and may claim the use of it: this power over each other's bodies is not such, as that they may, by consent, either the husband allow the wife, or the wife the husband, to lie with another.</p>
