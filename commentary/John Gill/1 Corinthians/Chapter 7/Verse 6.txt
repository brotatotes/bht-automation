<p><strong>But I speak this by permission</strong>,.... Referring either to what he had said before, though not to all; not to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:2">1 Corinthians 7:2</span> that for the avoiding of fornication, every man should make use of his own wife, and every woman of her own husband; since this is not by permission, but by command, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24">Genesis 2:24</span> that carnal copulation should be between one man and one woman in a married state; nor to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:3">1 Corinthians 7:3</span> for that married persons ought to render due benevolence to, and not defraud each other, having a power over each other's bodies, is a precept, and not a permission, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:10">Exodus 21:10</span> but to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:5">1 Corinthians 7:5</span> their parting for a time, and coming together again: it is not an absolute command of God that they should separate for a time, on account of fasting and prayer, but if they thought fit to do so by agreement, they might; nor was there any positive precept for their coming together again directly, after such service was over. The apostle said this,</p>
<p><strong>not of commandment</strong>; but, consulting their good, gives this advice, lest Satan should be busy with them, and draw them into sin; but if they had the gift of continence, they might continue apart longer; there was no precise time fixed by God, nor did the apostle pretend to fix any: or it may refer to what follows after, that he would have all men be as he was; though he laid no injunction, but left them to their liberty; unless it can be thought to regard marriage in general, and to be said in opposition to a Jewish notion, which makes marriage מצוה, a "command";</p>
<p>"a man, they say f, is bound to this command at seventeen years of age, and if he passes twenty and does not marry, he transgresses, and makes void an affirmative precept;''</p>
<p>but the apostle puts it as a matter of choice, and not of obligation.</p>
