<p>INTRODUCTION TO 1 CORINTHIANS 8</p>
<p>In this chapter the apostle proceeds to consider the case of eating things offered to idols, which, though an indifferent thing, was abused by many in the Corinthian church, to the scandal and hurt of weak Christians; wherefore the apostle dissuades from the use of it, and refutes the arguments which were used by them in defence of their practice. And the general foundation on which they proceeded being their knowledge of Christian liberty, he begins with that; and makes answer to it, by granting, that he, and they, and all had knowledge in general; and by distinguishing between knowledge and charity, the one puffing up, and the other edifying: wherefore to argue from the one, to the disuse of the other, was wrong, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span> seeing that kind of knowledge, which was not accompanied with love, was no true knowledge, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:2">1 Corinthians 8:2</span> but that was right which had annexed to it love to God, and our neighbour, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:3">1 Corinthians 8:3</span> and then applies this observation to the case of things offered to idols; and explains the knowledge which some had, and boasted of, that an idol was nothing, and that there was but one God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:4">1 Corinthians 8:4</span> which latter he proves and confirms, partly by allowing that there were many nominal gods and lords, both in heaven and earth; but then they were only so by name, not by nature, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:5">1 Corinthians 8:5</span> and partly by observing the common faith of Christians, that there is but one God, and one Lord Jesus, who are both described by their names and properties, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:6">1 Corinthians 8:6</span> But now, though there was such knowledge concerning an idol, as nothing, and things offered to it, as indifferent, in some, this was not the case of all; who, as their knowledge was small, their consciences were weak, and were defiled by eating such things through the example of others, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:7">1 Corinthians 8:7</span> wherefore it became such who had greater knowledge to abstain from eating them; partly from the unprofitableness of such eating to them with respect to divine acceptance, it making them neither better nor worse, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:8">1 Corinthians 8:8</span> and partly from the harmfulness of it to others, it being a stumblingblock to the weak, which ought not to be laid in their way, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:9">1 Corinthians 8:9</span> and emboldening to do so likewise to the injury of their weak consciences, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:10">1 Corinthians 8:10</span> and so was to the loss and ruin of their peace and comfort, which is aggravated by their being brethren, and such for whom Christ died, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:11">1 Corinthians 8:11</span>. Thus by wounding their weak consciences, they that drew them into this practice, by their example, sinned both against their brethren, and Christ himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:12">1 Corinthians 8:12</span>. From all which the apostle concludes, that rather than offend a weak brother, it was right never to eat any flesh at all; and this he strengthens by his own example and resolution, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:13">1 Corinthians 8:13</span>. </p>
