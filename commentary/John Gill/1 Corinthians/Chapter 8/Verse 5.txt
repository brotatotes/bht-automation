<p><strong>For though there be that are called gods</strong>,.... That are so by name, though not by nature; who are called so in Scripture, as angels and magistrates, or by men, who give them such names, and account them so:</p>
<p><strong>whether in heaven</strong>; as the sun, moon, and stars:</p>
<p><strong>or in earth</strong>; as men who formerly lived on earth; or various creatures on earth, who have been accounted deities; or stocks and stones graven by man's device:</p>
<p><strong>as there be gods many</strong>: almost without number, as were among the Egyptians, Grecians, Romans, and others; yea, even among the Jews, who falling into idolatry, their gods were according to the number of their cities, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:28">Jeremiah 2:28</span></p>
<p><strong>and lords many</strong>; referring to the Baalim, or the several idols that went by the name of Baal, or lord, as Baal Peor, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:3">Numbers 25:3</span> Baal Zephon, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:2">Exodus 14:2</span> Baal Zebub, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+1:2">2 Kings 1:2</span> Baal Berith, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+8:33">Judges 8:33</span>.</p>
