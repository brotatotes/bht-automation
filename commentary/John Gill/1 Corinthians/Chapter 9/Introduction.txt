<p>INTRODUCTION TO 1 CORINTHIANS 9</p>
<p>The principal things in this chapter are the proof of the apostle's office and authority; arguments for his own maintenance, and the maintenance of Gospel ministers; reasons why he did not make use of his right and privilege in this respect: and the whole is concluded with an exhortation to diligence and perseverance in the Christian course of life, of which he himself was an example. He begins with his office, as an apostle, and proves it; partly by his independency on men, not having his call and mission from them; and partly by his corporeal sight of Christ, and the authority which he in person received from him; and also by the success of his ministry among the Corinthians, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span>, wherefore, whatever might be objected to him by other persons, they had no reason to object to his apostleship, seeing they, being converted under his ministry, were so many seals of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:2">1 Corinthians 9:2</span>, and since his call to the ministry was firm and valid, he had a right, as other ministers, to a maintenance of himself and family, should he have any, from the churches, without labouring with his own hands, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:3">1 Corinthians 9:3</span>, which he proves from the law of nature and nations, exemplified in the cases of soldiers, planters of vineyards, and keepers of flocks, who by virtue of their calling and service have a right to a livelihood, between whom, and ministers of the Gospel, there is some resemblance, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:7">1 Corinthians 9:7</span>, and also from the law of Moses, particularly the law respecting the ox, which was not to be muzzled when it tread out the corn; and which he observes is to be understood, not only and barely in the letter of oxen, but of ministers of the word, who are as husbandmen that plough and thresh in hope, and therefore should be partakers of their hope, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:8">1 Corinthians 9:8</span>. Moreover, the apostle argues the right of the maintenance of the ministers of the Gospel, from the justice and equity of the thing, that seeing they minister spiritual things, it is but reasonable that they should receive temporal ones, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:11">1 Corinthians 9:11</span>, and which the apostle argues for himself, and Barnabas, as from the instances of other apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:5">1 Corinthians 9:5</span>, so from the examples of those that succeeded him in Corinth, who were maintained by that church; though he did not think fit, when among them, to claim his right, and make use of his power, lest any check should be put to the progress of the Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:12">1 Corinthians 9:12</span>. And he goes on to make this point clear and manifest from the case of, the priests and Levites under the former dispensation, who ministering in holy things, had a provision made for them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:13">1 Corinthians 9:13</span>. And lastly, from the constitution and appointment of Christ himself, who has ordained it as a law of his, that the preachers of the Gospel should live of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:14">1 Corinthians 9:14</span>, though the apostle himself did not make use of this his privilege; nor would he ever make use of it, especially at Corinth, for which he gives his reasons; and his principal one was, that his glorying might not be made void, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:15">1 Corinthians 9:15</span> which did not lie in preaching the Gospel, for that he was obliged to do, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:16">1 Corinthians 9:16</span>, for if he had engaged in it of his own accord, he would have had his reward; but since it was through necessity, he could not claim any, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:17">1 Corinthians 9:17</span>, or if any, it could be no other than to preach the Gospel "gratis", and without charge, which was the thing he gloried in, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:18">1 Corinthians 9:18</span>, and thus, though he lived independent of men, both with respect to his office and his maintenance, yet in order to gain souls to Christ, and be the instrument of their salvation, he became a servant to all, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:19">1 Corinthians 9:19</span>, who are distributed into three sorts, the Jews that were under the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:20">1 Corinthians 9:20</span>, the Gentiles that were without the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:21">1 Corinthians 9:21</span>, and weak Christians, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:22">1 Corinthians 9:22</span>, all which he did, not with any lucrative view to himself, but for the sake of the Gospel, that he might partake of that, and of the glory he was called unto by it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:23">1 Corinthians 9:23</span> which, and not temporal things, he was looking unto, and pressing after; and which he illustrates by a metaphor taken from the Grecian games, well known to the Corinthians, particularly that of running races, in which all ran, but one only had the prize: wherefore he exhorts the Corinthians to run in like manner, that they may obtain the prize which he mentions, and describes as an incorruptible crown, in opposition to a corruptible one, which others strove for, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:24">1 Corinthians 9:24</span>, and to this he animates by his own example and conduct, which he expresses in terms borrowed from racers and wrestlers, expressive of his humility, sobriety, and temperance; which things he exercised, that whilst he was a preacher to others, he might not be worthy of reproof and disapprobation himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:26">1 Corinthians 9:26</span>. </p>
