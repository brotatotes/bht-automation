<p><strong>Or saith he it altogether for our sakes</strong>,.... That is, God says this, or delivers out this law, forbidding the muzzling the ox, while it treads out the corn; not merely for the sake of the ox, but chiefly for the sake of men; and so Jarchi upon the place says, that the ox is mentioned, להוציא את אדם, "to express man"; and so another of the Jewish writers m interprets the law in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+22:6">Deuteronomy 22:6</span>. "Thou shalt not take the dam with the young";</p>
<p>"the intention of the command is, not to have mercy on birds, "but for the sake of men", he (God) says this, whom he would accustom to meekness and compassion:''</p>
<p>and particularly this is here said, for the sake of ministers of the Gospel, who for their spiritual strength, and labours in their work, may be compared to oxen; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:10">Ezekiel 1:10</span>. This law is elsewhere produced by the apostle, and urged in favour of the maintenance of ministers, as here, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17">1 Timothy 5:17</span> and therefore</p>
<p><strong>for our sakes no doubt it is written</strong>; to teach men, that as any workmen are not to be deprived of proper sustenance, so neither they that labour in the word and doctrine:</p>
<p><strong>that he that ploweth should plow in hope</strong>; of enjoying the fruit of his labours:</p>
<p><strong>and that he that thresheth in hope, should be partaker of his hope</strong>; of having a supply out of that he is threshing.</p>
