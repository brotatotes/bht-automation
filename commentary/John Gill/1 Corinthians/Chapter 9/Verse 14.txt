<p><strong>Even so hath the Lord ordained</strong>,.... That is, the Lord Jesus Christ, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:10">Matthew 10:10</span> it is an order and appointment of his that his ministering servants, who labour in preaching his Gospel, should be sufficiently taken care of, as to a comfortable livelihood; he has not indeed fixed it in the same way as the priests and Levites had theirs under the law; but as the one was just and right, that they should be maintained out of the things belonging to the temple and altar, and live on them, so it is his will and pleasure,</p>
<p><strong>that they which preach the Gospel</strong>; that continue to do so, that labour, and not loiter in the word and doctrine, who do the work of the ministry fully and faithfully, and not bear the name only of Gospel preachers: should live of the Gospel; not the Gospel itself, which is spiritual, and not corporeal food; but the sense is, that in consideration and because of their preaching the Gospel, they should be supplied with the proper necessaries of life: the learned Mr. Mede has proved, by various instances, that the word ευαγγελιον, here rendered "Gospel", and which signifies good news and glad tidings, is in other writers used for a reward, given to such that bring good tidings; and has rightly observed, that the Hebrew word</p>
<p>בשרה, which signifies the same, is used in a like sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+4:10">2 Samuel 4:10</span> and accordingly the sense here will be, that it is the ordination of Christ, that such who faithfully bring the news and glad tidings of salvation to sinners, should, as a reward for such good news, be provided for with a comfortable maintenance, on which they should live.</p>
