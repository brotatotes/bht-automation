<p><strong>Say I these things as a man</strong>?.... After the manner of men, reasoning from things common among men, and obvious to everyone's observation:</p>
<p><strong>or saith not the law the same also</strong>? As the subject the apostle is upon was capable of being illustrated and confirmed by instances common unto, and easy of observation among men; so it might be supported by divine authority; it was not only a clear point from the reason of things, but was certain by the law of God.</p>
