<p><strong>He that saith I know him</strong>,.... God or Christ, as the Gnostics did, who pretended to great, even perfect, knowledge of divine things:</p>
<p><strong>and keepeth not his commandments</strong>; which the above persons had no regard to, and as many who profess great light and knowledge in our days show no concern for:</p>
<p><strong>is a liar</strong>; he contradicts what he says, and gives the lie to it; for though in words he professes to know God, in works he denies him, and which betrays his ignorance of him:</p>
<p><strong>and the truth is not in him</strong>; there is no true knowledge of God and Christ in him; nor is the truth of the Gospel in his heart, however it may be in his head; nor is the truth of grace in him, for each of these lead persons to obedience. The Ethiopic version renders it, "the truth of God is not with him"; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
