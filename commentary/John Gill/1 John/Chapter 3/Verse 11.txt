Sent from God by Christ, or what he in his ministry declared, and is the commandment which was so frequently urged by him, John 13:34;that ye have heard from the beginning; of the preaching of the Gospel to them, and of their conversion; see 1 John 2:7;that we should love one another; to which the command of Christ, the reason with which it is enforced, and the early notice of it, should engage.
