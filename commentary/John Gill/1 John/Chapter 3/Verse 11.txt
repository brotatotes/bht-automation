<p><strong>For this is the message</strong>,.... Sent from God by Christ, or what he in his ministry declared, and is the commandment which was so frequently urged by him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:34">John 13:34</span>;</p>
<p><strong>that ye have heard from the beginning</strong>; of the preaching of the Gospel to them, and of their conversion; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:7">1 John 2:7</span>;</p>
<p><strong>that we should love one another</strong>; to which the command of Christ, the reason with which it is enforced, and the early notice of it, should engage.</p>
