<p><strong>And whatsoever we ask we receive of him</strong>,.... According to his promise, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7">Matthew 7:7</span>; that is, whatever is asked according to the will of God, in the name of Christ, and for his sake, and in faith, nothing wavering, but believing in God, in his covenant and promises, for these are provisos in the case; and such as ask in this way may exercise an holy confidence that they shall receive; and indeed they do receive what they ask for; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:14">1 John 5:14</span>;</p>
<p><strong>because we keep his commandments</strong>; not that keeping the commands of God is the meritorious cause of receiving anything from him; for when men have done all they can, or are assisted to do, they are but unprofitable servants in point of merit: whatever is received from God, as it is in consequence of asking, so it is entirely owing to his own grace and favour, and for the sake of Christ; but keeping the commands of God is a necessary adjunct, or, as Calvin on the text calls it, an inseparable accident, or what necessarily belongs unto, and enters into the character of such, who are heard and answered by God, and receive at his hands; for there is a great deal of truth in what the Jews say to the blind man, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:31">John 9:31</span>; and which may serve as a comment on these words:</p>
<p><strong>and do those things that are pleasing in his sight</strong>; as keeping of his commandments is; not that these things ingratiate into the love and favour of God, or are the causes and conditions of it, for the love of God is prior to anything of this kind; nor are they the causes of men's acceptance with God, for the acceptance both of persons and services is only in Christ the beloved; but these things are what God approves of, when done in faith, from a principle of love, and with a view to his glory: and since he hears such persons that are worshippers of him, and do his will, and has promised good things to them; this is therefore a reason strengthening their confidence in him, that what they ask they shall receive.</p>
