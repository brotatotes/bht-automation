<p><strong>If a man say I love God, and hateth his brother</strong>,.... Than which profession nothing can be more contradictory, not black and white, or hot and cold in the same degree:</p>
<p><strong>he is a liar</strong>; it is not truth he speaks, it is a contradiction, and a thing impossible:</p>
<p><strong>for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen</strong>; his person, which might have drawn out his affection to him; and something valuable and worthy in him, which might have commanded respect; or his wants and distresses, which should have moved his pity and compassion:</p>
<p><strong>how can he love God whom he hath not seen</strong>? it cannot be thought he should; the thing is not reasonable to suppose; it is not possible he should; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
