<p><strong>And this commandment have we from him</strong>,.... Either "from God", as the Alexandrian copy and the Vulgate Latin version read; and that to love the brethren is a commandment of God, is clear from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:23">1 John 3:23</span>; or from Christ, for it is also a command of his, even his new commandment, which he has given, and his people have received from him:</p>
<p><strong>that he who loveth God, love his brother also</strong>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:34">John 13:34</span>; which is an argument persuading to attend to the one as well as to the other; for the same command that requires the one, requires the other: and he that transgresses it in one case, is a transgressor of it, as well as in the other.</p>
