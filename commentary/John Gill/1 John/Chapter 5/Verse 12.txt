<p><strong>He that hath the Son</strong>,.... Has a spiritual and experimental knowledge of him, true faith in him; who has him dwelling in his heart, and living in him:</p>
<p><strong>hath life</strong>: not only spiritual life, being quickened by him, and living by faith on him, but eternal life; the knowledge he has of him is eternal life; he has it in faith and hope, and has a right unto it, and the earnest of it, as well as has it in Christ his representative, whom he has, and in whom this life is:</p>
<p><strong>[and] he that hath not the Son of God</strong>; no knowledge of him, nor faith in him, nor enjoyment of him:</p>
<p><strong>hath not life</strong>; he is dead in sin, he is alienated from the life of God, has no title to eternal life, nor meetness for it, nor shall enjoy it, but shall die the second death.</p>
