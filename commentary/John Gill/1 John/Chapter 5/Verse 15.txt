And if we know that he hear us,.... As it may be assured he does hear and answer all such persons that ask according to his will:whatsoever we ask, we know, or are assured,that we have the petitions that we desired of him: for as it is the nature of that holy confidence, which believers have in God, to believe whatever they ask according to his will, in general, shall be grappled, so every request in particular; yea, before the mercy desired, or the favour asked for is conferred, they are as sure of having it in God's own time and way, as if they now had it in hand and fact.
