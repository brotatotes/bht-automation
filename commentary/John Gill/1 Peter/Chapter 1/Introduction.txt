<p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO I PETER 1</strong> In this chapter, after the inscription and salutation, the apostle gives thanks to God for various blessings of grace bestowed, or to be bestowed upon the persons he writes to; and then, with the best of arguments and motives, urges them to the performance of several duties of religion. In the inscription, the person who is the writer of the epistle is described, both by his name, and by his office; and also the persons to whom it is sent, by their outward condition, strangers dispersed through several countries particularly mentioned, and by their spiritual estate, elect men; the source and spring of which election is the foreknowledge of God the Father; the means, the sanctification of the Spirit; and the end, obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Christ; and to these the apostle wishes a multiplication of grace and peace, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span> and then he gives thanks to God for the regeneration of them; the efficient cause of which is God the Father; the moving cause, his abundant mercy; the means, the resurrection of Christ from the dead; the end, a lively hope of a glorious inheritance, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span> and next follows a description of regenerate ones; they are such who are kept by the power of God through faith, unto salvation; who rejoice in hope of that salvation, though now for a little while are sorrowful, by reason of afflictions, which are for the trial of their faith; they are believers in Christ, lovers of him, and rejoice in him, and shall at last receive the end of their faith, the salvation of their souls, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:5">1 Peter 1:5</span> the excellency of which salvation is set forth from the concern the prophets had in it, the scrutiny they made into it, and the revelation of it made to them; from the concern the apostles had in it, and their report of it, and from the desire of angels to look into it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:10">1 Peter 1:10</span> upon which the apostle exhorts to the exercise of various graces and duties, to attention of mind, to sobriety, to a constant hope of eternal glory, and to holiness of life and conversation, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:13">1 Peter 1:13</span> the arguments engaging to which are taken from the nature of God, who had called them by his grace, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:15">1 Peter 1:15</span> from their concern with him, as a Father and a judge; from their state and condition, as sojourners in this world, and from their redemption by the blood of Christ from a vain conversation, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:17">1 Peter 1:17</span> and of Christ, the Redeemer of them, many things are said, as that he was ordained before the foundation of the world to be the Redeemer; was manifested in human nature in these last days, for the sake of such that believe; was raised from the dead, and glorified, that there might be a sufficient foundation for the exercise of faith and hope in God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span> and next the apostle exhorts to brotherly love, in purity, and with fervency; from the consideration of the internal purification of them by the Spirit, through obedience to the truth; and from their regeneration, the cause of which was not corruptible, but incorruptible seed; and the means, the living and abiding word of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22">1 Peter 1:22</span> which is illustrated by a passage out of</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:6">Isaiah 40:6</span> setting forth the frailty and mortality of men, and the transitoriness of all outward enjoyments; to which is opposed the duration of the everlasting Gospel, the means of regeneration, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:24">1 Peter 1:24</span>. </p>
