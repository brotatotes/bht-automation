<p><strong>But the word of the Lord endureth for ever</strong>,.... Though men die, and ministers of the word too, and everything in the world is uncertain, unstable, fleeting, and passing away, and whatever change has been in the ordinances of divine service; yet the word of the Lord, the Gospel of Christ, is settled for ever, and will never pass away:</p>
<p><strong>and this is the word which by the Gospel is preached unto you</strong>; this is the apostle's application of the passage in Isaiah, showing that the word of the Lord there is the same with the Gospel preached by him, and the other apostles, at that present time; and is no other than that good tidings Zion is said to bring; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:9">Isaiah 40:9</span> the selfsame Gospel the Prophet Isaiah preached the apostles did, though with greater clearness, and more success; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:8">Romans 10:8</span>.</p>
