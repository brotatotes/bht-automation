<p><strong>Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham</strong>,.... Going along with him wherever he went, as from Chaldea to Canaan, and into Egypt, and the land of the Philistines, saying the words he put into her mouth, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:5">Genesis 12:5</span> and doing the things he bid her do, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:6">Genesis 18:6</span> "calling him lord"; or "my lord", as the Syriac and Ethiopic versions render it, and as it appears she did from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:12">Genesis 18:12</span>. The Jews use this instance to the same purpose the apostle does, saying p,</p>
<p>"the wife ought to take care of the family, to educate her children, to serve and minister to her husband in all things, "calling him her own lord"; which is what we learn from the example of Sarah, who called Abraham her lord, saying, "my lord is old".''</p>
<p><strong>Whose daughters ye are</strong>; meaning not by natural descent, though they were, these being Jews the apostle writes to, but by grace, and in a spiritual sense; just as those are the children of Abraham, who walk in the steps of his faith, whether they be Jews or Gentiles; so such are the daughters of Sarah, the children of the free woman, who imitate her in faith and obedience; that is, they appear, and are declared to be so:</p>
<p><strong>as long as ye do well</strong>: do acts of beneficence and hospitality to strangers, and proper objects, as Sarah did, and all and every good work, according to the will of God, from love, and in faith, and with a view to his glory; and particularly obey and live in subjection to their husbands, as she did: and are not afraid with any amazement; are not deterred from doing well, nor scared by the terrors and menaces of wicked men, either their own husbands, or others; or who with fortitude and intrepidity of mind continue in the discharge of their duty to God and men, and particularly to their husbands, following them, and obeying their lawful commands, as Sarah did in Egypt, and in Gerar, though she exposed herself to great danger: this is said, because women are timorous, and apt to be frightened at everything, from the performance of their duty.</p>
