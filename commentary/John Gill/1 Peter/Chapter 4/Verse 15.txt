<p><strong>But let none of you suffer as a murderer</strong>,.... The punishment for murder was death by the law of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:6">Genesis 9:6</span></p>
<p><strong>or as a thief</strong>; whose fine or mulct, according to the Jewish law, was a fivefold or fourfold restitution, according to the nature of the thing that was stolen, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:1">Exodus 22:1</span></p>
<p><strong>or as an evildoer</strong>; a breaker of any of the laws of God or men, which are of a moral nature, and for the good of civil society:</p>
<p><strong>or as a busybody</strong> in other men's matters; "or as a bishop in another man's diocese"; that concerns himself in things he has nothing to do with, and neglects his own affairs, and lives in idleness, and upon the spoil of others; or takes upon him to manage, direct, order, and command other men's servants, or persons that do not belong to him, to do his business, or whatsoever he pleases. The Vulgate Latin version renders it, "a desirer of other's goods"; and the Ethiopic version, "a covetous desirer of other's things"; and so is led on by an insatiable thirst for them, to obtain them in an evil way, either by secret fraud, or open violence and oppression. To suffer in any such cases is scandalous and dishonourable, and unbecoming the character of a Christian. This last clause is left out in the Syriac version.</p>
