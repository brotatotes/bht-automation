<p><strong>Yet if any man suffer as a Christian</strong>,.... Because he is one, and professes himself to be one. This name was first given to the disciples at Antioch, either by themselves, or by the Gentiles; however, it being agreeable to them, was retained; it is only mentioned here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>,</p>
<p><strong>let him not be ashamed</strong>; neither of Christ, and his Gospel, for which he suffers, nor of the name he bears, nor of the punishment he endures, however ignominious and shameful it may be among men; but let him, as his Lord and master did, endure the cross, and despise the shame, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span></p>
<p><strong>but let him glorify God on this behalf</strong>: that he bestows this gift upon him to suffer for Christ, as well as to believe in him; and that he does him so much honour to call him to such service, and to strengthen him in it, so as to take it joyfully, and endure it patiently and cheerfully. The Alexandrian copy, and some others, and also the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, instead of "in this behalf", read "in this name"; that is, of a Christian.</p>
