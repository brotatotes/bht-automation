<p>INTRODUCTION TO I PETER 5</p>
<p>In this chapter the apostle first exhorts pastors and members of churches to their respective duties as such; and then to those which were common to them all, as Christians; and closes the epistle with prayers for them, salutations of them, and with his apostolic benediction. He begins with the pastors or elders, and describes himself as a fellow elder, an eyewitness of Christ's sufferings, and a partaker of his glory, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:1">1 Peter 5:1</span>, and these he exhorts to feed the flock of God, where they were; to take the charge and oversight of them, freely, readily, and willingly, and not through force or covetousness; and not to exercise a tyrannical dominion over them, but to be examples to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:2">1 Peter 5:2</span>, and the argument made use of to encourage them to all this is, that at the appearance of Christ, the chief Shepherd, they should receive a never fading crown of glory, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span> and next, the members of the churches are exhorted to submit to the rule and government of their pastors, being according to the word of God; and to be subject to one another; and particularly to put on humility, as a garment very ornamental to them; and the rather, since God opposes himself to men that are proud, but gives more grace to the humble, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:5">1 Peter 5:5</span> and especially he exhorts them to be humble under the hand of God, since that is a mighty one, and this is the way to be exalted in due time; and also to cast their care upon him, seeing he cared for them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:6">1 Peter 5:6</span> and then the apostle proceeds to the common duties of Christians, and to exhort them to sobriety and watchfulness, since Satan their adversary was a cruel and indefatigable one, and ever seeking the ruin of men; and to resist him in the steadfast exercise of faith, and patiently bear all afflictions, seeing the same were accomplished in their brethren in the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:8">1 Peter 5:8</span> and then he puts up some petitions for them, that they might be perfected, stablished, strengthened, and settled, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:10">1 Peter 5:10</span> and ascribes glory and dominion for ever to the God of grace, to whom he prays, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:11">1 Peter 5:11</span> after which he names the person by whom he sends this epistle, giving a summary of it; that it was an exhortation and a testimony to the true doctrine of grace wherein they stood, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:12">1 Peter 5:12</span>, and next follow the salutations of the church at Babylon, and of his son Marcus, to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:13">1 Peter 5:13</span>, and lastly, he desires they would salute one another with a kiss of love, and gives them his benedictory wish, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:14">1 Peter 5:14</span>. </p>
