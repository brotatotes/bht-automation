<p><strong>To him be glory, and dominion, for ever and ever, Amen.</strong> The Syriac version begins this doxology in the preceding verse, reading the words thus, "to the God of grace", and then putting what follows, "who hath called us", c. into a parenthesis, connects them with these, "be glory, and power, and honour", c. "glory" is due to God for all the grace he bestows on men and to give it to him shows a sense of divine goodness, and a grateful heart and to him very fitly is "dominion" ascribed, whose kingdom rules over all, and who dispenses his grace, as well as his providential favours, in a sovereign way; and whom the saints are in a peculiar manner under obligation to obey; to which is added, "Amen", signifying that so the apostle prayed it might be, and believed it would be.</p>
