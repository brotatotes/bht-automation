<p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO 1 THESSALONIANS 1</strong></p>
<p>This chapter contains the inscription of the epistle; the apostle's salutation of the persons it is written to; his thanksgiving for blessings received by them; an account of the manner in which the Gospel came to them, how they behaved when it was preached to them, and of the success of it in their conversion. The inscription which expresses the names of the persons concerned in the epistle, and describes those to whom it is written, and also the salutation, which is the same as in other epistles, are in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span> and then follows a thanksgiving to God made in prayer to him for the special graces of the Spirit bestowed on them, as faith, hope, and love, and the lively exercise of them in which they were; the source and spring of which was the electing love of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:2">1 Thessalonians 1:2</span> and the evidence of their election of God to the apostle, was the manner in which the Gospel came to them; not merely in the external ministry of it, but in the internal efficacy of it, through the power of the Holy Ghost, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:5">1 Thessalonians 1:5</span> and the effects of it upon them; it found an hearty reception among them, in much affliction, and with joy of the Holy Ghost; so that they not only professed it, and became the followers of Christ and his apostles, but were examples unto others, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:6">1 Thessalonians 1:6</span> for the fame of the Gospel being preached unto them, and of their faith, were spread everywhere, so that the apostle had no need to say anything about it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:8">1 Thessalonians 1:8</span> the manner of their entrance among them, and the issue of it, their conversion, were so manifest to all; which is described by what they were turned from, idols; and by what they were turned to, the living God; and by the ends of it, which were to serve God, and wait for Jesus Christ; the arguments engaging to which are, his relation to God as his Son, his being raised from the dead by him; his being in heaven, exalted at his right hand there, from whence he is expected; and his having, by his sufferings and death, delivered his people from wrath to come, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:9">1 Thessalonians 1:9</span>. </p>
