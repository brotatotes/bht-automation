<p>INTRODUCTION TO 1 THESSALONIANS 2</p>
<p>The apostle in this chapter gives a further account of his ministry among the Thessalonians, of the nature, manner, and success of it, and of his regard to them, and conduct and conversation when with them; and commends their readiness in receiving the Gospel, and excuses his present absence from them. He appeals to them themselves for the truth of it, that his entrance to them, or preaching among them, was not in vain and without success, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:1">1 Thessalonians 2:1</span> that it was with all boldness and intrepidity of mind, notwithstanding what he had suffered before for it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span> and with all integrity and faithfulness to the trust reposed in him by the Lord, without deceit and guile, or seeking to please men, but God the searcher of hearts, who had committed this trust unto him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:3">1 Thessalonians 2:3</span> and that neither then, nor at any other time, he had used flattery, or showed covetousness; which he calls God to witness, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:5">1 Thessalonians 2:5</span> nor of them or others sought glory and honour, even that which was due unto him by virtue of his office, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:6">1 Thessalonians 2:6</span> but had showed all gentleness, humanity, and, affection; which he illustrates by the simile of a nurse cherishing her children <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:7">1 Thessalonians 2:7</span> and by the willingness he showed not only to preach the Gospel to them, but to lay down his life for them, had it been necessary; so great was his affection for them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:8">1 Thessalonians 2:8</span> and, as a proof of this, he puts them in mind of his labours, both in preaching the word, and in working with his own hands; because he would not be burdensome and chargeable to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span> and as for his conversation among them, he appeals both to God and them, how holy, just, and unblemished it was, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:10">1 Thessalonians 2:10</span> and reminds them of his tenderness, diligence, and faithfulness, in exhorting, comforting, and charging them, particularly to walk worthy of God; since he had called them to his kingdom and glory, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:11">1 Thessalonians 2:11</span> and then he expresses his thankfulness to God for their reception of the worth of the Gospel; not as an human invention, but as of God, which wrought effectually in them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:13">1 Thessalonians 2:13</span> the evidence of which were partly their imitation of the churches of Christ in Judea, in doctrine and practice; and partly their suffering the same things they did, of the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:14">1 Thessalonians 2:14</span> who are described by their ill usage of, and cruelty to, Christ, their own prophets, and his apostles, by their not pleasing God, and by their opposition to men; an instance of which is given in prohibiting the apostles to preach to the Gentiles, whose end in so doing with respect to the Gentiles, was that they might not be saved; but God's end in suffering them so to do, was with respect to them that they might fill up their iniquity, and so entire wrath and ruin come upon them, as had been foretold, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:15">1 Thessalonians 2:15</span> and then the apostle concludes the chapter, by expressing his affectionate concern in parting with them, which was not in heart but in body; by declaring his earnest desire and endeavour to see them again; and by observing to them the reason he had not and could not come unto them, because Satan hindered him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:17">1 Thessalonians 2:17</span> the cause of his being so desirous to see them, was their being his hope, joy, glory, and crown of rejoicing, both now and hereafter, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:19">1 Thessalonians 2:19</span>. </p>
