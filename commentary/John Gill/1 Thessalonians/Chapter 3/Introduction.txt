<p>INTRODUCTION TO 1 THESSALONIANS 3</p>
<p>In this chapter the apostle expresses his great love to the Thessalonians, by sending Timothy to then, to establish and comfort them; and declares his satisfaction with the things he brought of them, and concludes the chapter with fervent prayers for them: such was his affection for them, that he chose rather to be left alone at Athens, and send Timothy to them, though so very dear and useful to him, as his characters show, to the end that they might be established and comforted, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:2">1 Thessalonians 3:2</span> and not be shaken with the afflictions the apostles met with, seeing these were no other than what God had appointed them to; and besides, they had been apprized of them before hand by the apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:3">1 Thessalonians 3:3</span> but however, lest Satan should get an advantage of them, the apostle could not be easy without sending to know how things stood with them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:5">1 Thessalonians 3:5</span> next he proceeds to give an account of the success of this mission, and the satisfaction it gave him and his fellow ministers to hear of their faith and charity, their remembrance of them, and desire to see them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:6">1 Thessalonians 3:6</span> which comforted them under their afflictions, made them lively and cheerful, filled them with joy and thankfulness, and put them upon praying to God to see their face, and perfect what was lacking in their faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:7">1 Thessalonians 3:7</span> and then follow the petitions themselves, which are made both to God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that their way might be directed to them, that they might increase and abound in love to one another, and to all men, as they did to them, and that God would establish them in holiness in his sight, at the coming of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:11">1 Thessalonians 3:11</span>. </p>
