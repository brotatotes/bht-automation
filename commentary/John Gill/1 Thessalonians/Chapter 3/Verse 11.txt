<p><strong>Now God himself, and our Father</strong>,.... The Oriental versions leave out the copulative "and", and read, "God himself, our Father" the first person in the Trinity, who is God himself, truly and properly so; and who is a God that hears prayer; and who is omnipotent, and able to do more than the saints can ask or think; and omniscient, and knows their persons and cases, and what is proper for them, and how and when to help and supply them; and he is also the God of all grace, the author and giver of it, and who is able to make it abound, and increase it, and so a very proper object of prayer: and who is likewise the Father of Christ, and of all the saints, not only by creation, in which sense he is the Father of all men, but by adopting grace; and which is mentioned to encourage freedom and boldness in prayer, which children may use with a father, and to raise an expectation of succeeding and receiving an answer; for if earthly parents hear their children, and give good things to them, how much more will not our heavenly Father give his Holy Spirit, and all other good gifts, unto his children? And this shows that the apostle prayed to God in the manner Christ directed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:9">Matthew 6:9</span></p>
<p><strong>and our Lord Jesus Christ</strong>: who is equally the object of prayer with God his Father and ours; who is sometimes distinctly prayed unto, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:59">Acts 7:59</span> and often in conjunction with his Father, as in all those places in the epistles, where grace and peace are wished for from them both; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span>, and sometimes he is set before the Father, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:16">2 Thessalonians 2:16</span> to show the entire equality between them, and that he is equally addressed as he, being truly and properly God, who knows all things, and is the Almighty, and whose grace is sufficient for us, and therefore rightly applied unto, as here: the petition put up to them both is, that they would</p>
<p><strong>direct our way unto you</strong>: a journey is not to be taken without the will of God, without seeking to know it, without submission to it, and dependence on it; nor is there any prosperous one, but by it; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:13">James 4:13</span>. Men may devise their own ways, but God directs their goings; especially a good man's steps are ordered by the Lord, and particularly ministers; who, as they are often directed to subjects and matter, in a very providential way, so to places, and are ordered both where and when to go; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:6">Acts 16:6</span>. The apostle was aware, that there were obstacles in his way of coming to Thessalonica, for he had attempted it once and again, but Satan, and his emissaries, hindered; and therefore he desires that God and Christ would remove them out of the way, and make his way straight and plain, as the word signifies, that he might once more see their faces.</p>
