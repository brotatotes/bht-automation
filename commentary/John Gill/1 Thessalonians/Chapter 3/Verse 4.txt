<p><strong>For, verily, when we were with you</strong>,.... In presence, in person, as they then were in heart and affection; when they were first among them, and preached the Gospel to them:</p>
<p><strong>we told you before</strong>; before it came to pass;</p>
<p><strong>that we should suffer tribulation</strong>: which they might say by virtue of Christ's prediction to all his disciples, that they should have tribulation in the world; and upon its being the common case of God's people, and the usual way through which they enter the kingdom; and the Apostle Paul might foretell this, upon the discovery that was made to him how many things he should suffer for the sake of Christ, and which therefore he always, and in every place expected; and he might have a particular revelation of the disturbance and opposition he was to meet with at Thessalonica:</p>
<p><strong>even as it came to pass, and ye know</strong>; referring to the tumult and uproar in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</span>, and which should be considered so far from being a discouragement, that it was a great confirmation of the truth of their mission and ministry; nor could it be so surprising to them as it might have been had they had no previous taste of it.</p>
