<p>INTRODUCTION TO 1 THESSALONIANS 5</p>
<p>In this chapter the apostle discourses concerning the suddenness of Christ's coming, and the necessity of sobriety and watchfulness, and being on our guard with respect unto it, and then proceeds to exhort to several duties of religion, and closes the epistle with prayers for the saints, salutations of them, advice unto them, and with his usual benediction. Having spoken of the coming of Christ in the preceding chapter, the apostle signifies he had no need to write of the time and season of it; since it was a well known thing that it would be sudden, and at an unawares, like the coming of a thief in the night, and the travail of a woman with child, though certain and inevitable; and would bring sure destruction on wicked men, unthought of by them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:1">1 Thessalonians 5:1</span> but such was the state and condition of the saints, being not in the night of nature's darkness and unregeneracy, but enlightened by the spirit of God, that they were not ignorant of these things, nor liable to be surprised unawares hereby, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:4">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span>, however, in consideration of their being in the light, and not in darkness, it became them to behave accordingly, and not indulge themselves in sleep and sloth, but be watchful and sober, and on their guard, having on their spiritual armour, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:6">1 Thessalonians 5:6</span> and the rather, since they were not appointed to the wrath they deserved, but to salvation by Christ; whose end in dying for them was, that they might live together with him, and therefore should exhort and comfort, and edify one another, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:9">1 Thessalonians 5:9</span> and then follow various exhortations, some, which respect their ministers, their knowledge of them, love to them, and esteem for them, on account of their dignity, office, work, and usefulness, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:12">1 Thessalonians 5:12</span> others, which concern themselves and one another, as church members, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:13">1 Thessalonians 5:13</span> others, which regard also them that are without, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:14">1 Thessalonians 5:14</span> and others which relate to joy and thanksgiving, to prayer and praise; to the gifts of the spirit, and the ministry of the word; and to a trial and examination of what is good, and an abiding by it, and an abstinence from all evil, and every appearance of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:16">1 Thessalonians 5:16</span> and the whole is concluded with prayers for them, for their perfect sanctification, and entire preservation to the coming of Christ; which were put up in faith, grounded upon the faithfulness of God who had called them to grace and glory, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span> and with a request to them to pray for him, and other ministers of the Gospel, and to salute all the brethren, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:25">1 Thessalonians 5:25</span> and with a charge to read this letter to them all, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:27">1 Thessalonians 5:27</span> and with his usual benediction, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:28">1 Thessalonians 5:28</span>. </p>
