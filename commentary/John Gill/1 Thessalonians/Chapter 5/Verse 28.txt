<p><strong>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, Amen.</strong> This is the apostle's usual salutation in all his epistles, and the token of the genuineness of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>.</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17- :">2 Thessalonians 3:17- :</span>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17- :">2 Thessalonians 3:17- :</span>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17- :">2 Thessalonians 3:17- :</span>.</p>
<p>The subscription to this epistle is not genuine, which runs thus, "The first Epistle unto the Thessalonians was written from Athens"; whereas it appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:1">1 Thessalonians 3:1</span> compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:1">Acts 18:1</span> that it was written from Corinth, and not from Athens; nor are these last words, "from Athens", in Beza's Claromontane copy; though they stand in the Syriac and Arabic versions of the London Polygot Bible, which add, "and sent by Timothy", and in the Alexandrian copy, and Complutensian edition.</p>
