The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, Amen. This is the apostle's usual salutation in all his epistles, and the token of the genuineness of them, 2 Thessalonians 3:17.2 Thessalonians 3:17- :,2 Thessalonians 3:17- :,2 Thessalonians 3:17- :.The subscription to this epistle is not genuine, which runs thus, "The first Epistle unto the Thessalonians was written from Athens"; whereas it appears from 1 Thessalonians 3:1 compared with Acts 18:1 that it was written from Corinth, and not from Athens; nor are these last words, "from Athens", in Beza's Claromontane copy; though they stand in the Syriac and Arabic versions of the London Polygot Bible, which add, "and sent by Timothy", and in the Alexandrian copy, and Complutensian edition.
