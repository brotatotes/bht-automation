<p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO 1 TIMOTHY 1</strong></p>
<p>In this chapter, after the inscription and salutation, the apostle having entreated Timothy to abide at Ephesus, observes, that his end was, that he might check the false teachers there, whom he describes; and then he gives an account of his apostleship, and also of his conversion, to the encouragement of sinners, and to the glory of the grace of God; and closes with an exhortation to Timothy to constancy and perseverance in his Christian warfare. The inscription and salutation are in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:1">1 Timothy 1:1</span> and much in the common form; and whereas, when he went into Macedonia, he desired Timothy to continue at Ephesus, his end was, to restrain the false teachers from preaching the doctrine they did, which was contrary to the Gospel, fabulous, useless, and unedifying, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span> for though these men set up for teachers of the law, they went off, and strayed from its general end, which was love with faith, through their ignorance of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:5">1 Timothy 1:5</span> not but that the law itself was good, as Gospel ministers full well knew; which is said to prevent an objection against them, as laying it aside as useless; but the abuse of it is what is complained of, it being made for some persons, and not for others who are mentioned, between which, and the sound doctrine of the Gospel, there is an agreement, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:8">1 Timothy 1:8</span> which leads on the apostle to observe his call to the office of a preacher of it by Christ, his qualification for it, and investiture with it, for which he gives thanks, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:12">1 Timothy 1:12</span> And in order to illustrate the grace of God in converting him first, and then making him a minister of the word, he takes notice of his state and condition before conversion, what a vile sinner he had been, and of the abundant grace God bestowed on him in it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:13">1 Timothy 1:13</span> And that this case of his might not seem strange and incredible, he observes, that this is the sum of the Gospel, that Christ came into the world to save the chief of sinners, such an one as he was, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span>. And besides, the end of the Lord in his conversion was, by the pattern of longsuffering he showed in him, that others might be encouraged to believe in Christ also, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:16">1 Timothy 1:16</span> and then for all this grace bestowed on him, he ascribes honour and glory to God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:17">1 Timothy 1:17</span> and renews his charge to Timothy to fight manfully against the false teachers, to which he should be the more induced by the consideration of the prophecies that went before of him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span> and to hold faith and good conscience, which had been dropped by some professors; of which instances are given in Hymenaeus and Philetus, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:19">1 Timothy 1:19</span>. </p>
