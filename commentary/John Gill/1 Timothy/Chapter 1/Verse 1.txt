<p><strong>Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ</strong>,.... His name was well known to Timothy, and very dear to him; and so was his office as an apostle, and which he mentions, not so much for Timothy's sake, but for the sake of others, that what he delivers in this epistle might come with its proper weight and authority, and be regarded: of this his office, as well as name, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. How he came into this office next follows, not of himself, nor by men, but</p>
<p><strong>by the commandment of God</strong>; the appointment and decree of God, by which he was separated to this office, even from eternity, and is the same with the counsel or will of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:1">Ephesians 1:1</span> or it may refer to the order given by the Holy Ghost to the church; to set apart him and Barnabas, to the work of the ministry, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2">Acts 13:2</span> though this commandment is called the commandment of God</p>
<p><strong>our Saviour</strong>; by whom is meant God the Father; and this character of him is mentioned, to show that the embassy the apostle was sent on as such, and in which the discharge of his office greatly lay, was the affair of salvation, to publish and declare that to the sons of men; and also to show the concern which God the Father has in that work: he resolved upon it, and appointed his people to it, and determined upon saving them by his Son, whom he pitched upon to be his salvation; he drew the scheme of it by his infinite wisdom, and sent his Son into the world to execute it; and he sends his ministers to publish the Gospel of it, and his Spirit to reveal and apply it to the hearts of his chosen ones; and keeps them by his power unto it, and will at last put them into the full possession of it; so that this character well suits with him, to whom it is also given, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:4">Titus 3:4</span> as well as with his Son Jesus Christ, to whom it is more commonly ascribed, and from whom he is here distinguished: for it follows,</p>
<p><strong>and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope</strong>; who is both the author, and the ground and foundation of the grace of hope of salvation, and eternal life; not earthly enjoyments, nor any external thing whatever; not birth privileges, carnal descent, religious education, morality and civility, obedience to the law of Moses, moral or ceremonial; nor a profession of Christ, nor a bare subjection to his ordinances, but he himself: and there is good ground to hope for pardon through his blood, which was shed for it; and for justification by his righteousness, which is freely wrought out, and freely imputed; and for salvation by him, since it is in him, and in no other, and is completely effected by him, and that for the worst of sinners, and is wholly of free grace, and which everyone that believes in him shall enjoy; and so for eternal life, which hope is conversant with; and good reason there is for it in Christ, seeing it is in him, and in his gift; what his grace gives a meetness for, and his righteousness a title to; and which he is possessed of in the name of his people, prepares for them, and will introduce them into. The Complutensian edition reads, "of the Father, and, our Saviour Jesus Christ"; and so the Ethiopic version, "of God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ".</p>
