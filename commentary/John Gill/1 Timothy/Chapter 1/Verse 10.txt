<p><strong>For whoremongers</strong>,.... Fornicators and adulterers, who were transgressors of the seventh command, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:14">Exodus 20:14</span> these God will judge, and such shall have their portion in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone:</p>
<p><strong>for them that defile themselves with mankind</strong>; who are guilty of sodomy; such, according to the law, were to die, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+18:22">Leviticus 18:22</span> the wrath of God was revealed from heaven in a very visible and remarkable manner against this abomination, by raining fire and brimstone upon Sodom and Gomorrah, and upon the cities of the plain, who defiled themselves in this way:</p>
<p><strong>for men stealers</strong>; who decoyed servants or free men, and stole them away, and sold them for slaves; see the laws against this practice, and the punishment such were liable to, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:16">Exodus 21:16</span>. This practice was condemned by the Flavian law among the Romans i, and was not allowed of among the Grecians k; the death with which such were punished was strangling, according to the Jews l:</p>
<p><strong>for liars</strong>; who speak what is false, against their own knowledge and conscience, and with a design to deceive; who lie against their neighbours, and act falsely and deceitfully in trade and merchandise, as well as speak that which is not true; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+6:2">Leviticus 6:2</span></p>
<p><strong>for perjured persons</strong>; who take a false oath on any account, and bear false witness against their neighbour. Now upon, and against all, and each of these, the law lies, as an accusing, threatening, and cursing law:</p>
<p><strong>and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine</strong>; the law lies against it, takes notice of it, charges with it, condemns and punishes for it: by "sound doctrine" is meant the doctrine of the Gospel, which is in itself pure and incorrupt, and is the cause of soundness and health to others; it is health to the navel, and marrow to the bones; its doctrines are the wholesome words of Christ, and by them souls are nourished up unto eternal life; when the errors and heresies of men are in themselves rotten and corrupt, and also eat as do a canker. Here it may be observed, that there is an entire harmony and agreement between the Gospel and the law, rightly understood and used; what is contrary to the one, is also to the other; the Gospel no more countenances sin than the law does; and whatever is repugnant to the Gospel is liable to be punished by the law.</p>
