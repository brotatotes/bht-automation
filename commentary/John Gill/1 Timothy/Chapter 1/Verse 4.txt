<p><strong>Neither give heed to fables</strong>,.... Old wives' fables, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:7">1 Timothy 4:7</span> or Jewish fables, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:14">Titus 1:14</span> the traditions of the elders; anything that was not true; or if it was, yet idle, vain, trifling, and unprofitable:</p>
<p><strong>and endless genealogies</strong>; not of deities, as the Theogony of the Gentiles, or the ten Sephirot or numbers in the Cabalistic tree of the Jews, or the Aeones of the Gnostics and Valentinians, which are said to proceed from one another, as some have thought; but both the public and private genealogies of the Jews, which they kept to show of what tribe they were, or to prove themselves priests and Levites, and the like; of which there was no end, and which often produced questions and debates. By reason of their captivities and dispersions, they were much at a loss to distinguish their tribes and families. Some care Ezra took of this matter, when the Jews returned from the Babylonish captivity. It is said a, that יוחסין</p>
<p>עשרה,</p>
<p>"ten genealogies (or ten sorts of persons genealogized) came out of Babylon; priests, Levites, Israelites, profane (or unfit for the priesthood, though they sprung from priests) proselytes, freemen (servants made free), bastards, Nethinim or Gibeonites, such whose father was not known, and those that were took up in the streets.''</p>
<p>These Ezra brought up to Jerusalem thus distinguished, that they might be taken care of by the sanhedrim, and kept distinct; but these would often intermix and cause disputes; and sometimes these mixtures were connived at through partiality or fear b</p>
<p>"Says R. Jochanan, by the temple, it is in our hands, (the gloss adds, to discover the illegitimate families of the land of Israel,) but what shall I do? for lo, the great men of this age are hid (or impure): in which he agreed with R. Isaac, who said, the family that is hid, let it be hid. Abai also saith, we have learned this by tradition, there was a family of the house of Tzeriphah, beyond Jordan, and a son of Zion, (a famous man, a man of authority,) set it at a distance, (proclaimed it illegitimate,) by his authority. And again, there was another, and he made it near (or pronounced it right) by his power. Again, there was another family, and the wise men would not discover it.''</p>
<p>By which we may see what management there was in these things, and what a foundation was laid for questions and debates. Of these public and private genealogies, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:14- :">Titus 1:14- :</span>, to which may be added what R. Benjamin says c of some Jews in his time, who were the Rechabites, and were very numerous, and had a prince over them of the house of David; and, adds he, they have a genealogical book,</p>
<p>ומשגרות שאלות, "and extracts of questions", which I should be tempted to render "clusters of questions", which are with the head of the captivity; and this comes very near to what our apostle here says. And when it is observed, that Herod, that he might hide the meanness of his descent and birth, burnt all the genealogical writings in the public archives d, it must be still more difficult to fix the true account of things; and for the loss of the genealogical book, the public one, the Jews express a very great concern: for they say e, that</p>
<p>"from the time the book of genealogies was hid, the strength of the wise men was weakened, and the light of their eyes grew dim. Says Mar Zutra, between Azel and Azel, (that is, between <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+8:38">1 Chronicles 8:38</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+9:44">1 Chronicles 9:44</span>) there is need of four hundred camel loads of commentaries.''</p>
<p>So intricate an affair, and such an endless business was this. And this affair of genealogies might be now the more the subject of inquiry among judaizing Christians, since there was, and still is, an expectation among the Jews, that in the times of the Messiah these things will be set aright. Says Maimonides f,</p>
<p>"in the days of the King Messiah, when his kingdom shall be settled, and all Israel shall be gathered to him, כולם</p>
<p>יתייחסו, "they shall all of them be genealogized", according to his word, by the Holy Ghost, as it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:3">Malachi 3:3</span> he shall purify the sons of Levi, and say, this is a genealogized priest, and this is a genealogized Levite; and shall drive them away who are not genealogized (or related) to Israel, as it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ezr+2:63">Ezra 2:63</span>. Hence you learn, that by the Holy Ghost they shall be genealogized, those that arrogate and proclaim their genealogy; and he shall not genealogize Israel but by their tribes, for he shall make known that this is of such a tribe, and this is of such a tribe; but he shall not say concerning such an one he is a bastard, and this is a servant; for so shall it be, that the family that is obscure shall be obscure.''</p>
<p>Or else the genealogical account of their traditions may be meant, which they trace from Moses to Joshua, from Joshua to the elders, from the elders to the prophets, from the prophets to the men of the great synagogue, and from one doctor to another g, which to pursue is endless, tedious, and tiresome:</p>
<p><strong>which minister questions</strong>; as the traditions of the elders, and the genealogical account of them did; the Talmud is full of the questions, debates, contentions, and decisions of the doctors about them:</p>
<p><strong>rather than godly edifying, which is in faith</strong>; and which is the principal end of preaching, hearing, and conversation; and that may be called "godly edifying, or the edification of God", as it may be rendered, which he is the author of, and which he approves of, and is by, and according to his word; or that in which souls are built up an habitation for God, and are built up in faith and holiness, and by an increase of every grace: and this is "in faith", not only in the grace of faith, but by the doctrine of faith, on which the saints may build one another, and by which they are edified through the faithful ministration of it by the ministers of the word; when fabulous stories and disputes, about genealogies, are useless and unedifying: not that the apostle condemns all genealogies, such as we have in the writings of the Old Testament, and in the evangelists, nor all inquiries into them, and study of them, which, rightly to settle, is in some cases of great importance and use, but the private and unprofitable ones before mentioned. Some copies read, "the dispensation of God, which is in faith"; meaning the dispensation of the mysteries of grace, which are in the doctrine of faith, which becomes a faithful steward of them, and not fables and genealogies, which issue in questions, quarrels, and contentions.</p>
