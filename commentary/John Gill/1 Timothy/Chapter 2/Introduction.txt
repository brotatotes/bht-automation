<p>INTRODUCTION TO 1 TIMOTHY 2</p>
<p>In this chapter the apostle exhorts to prayer for all sorts of men, gives rules and directions about the dress of women, and their subjection to their husbands; and concludes with some comfort to them. The apostle exhorts to prayer in the first place, directs to the several parts and branches of prayer, and points to the persons to be prayed for, and what should be prayed for on their account, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:1">1 Timothy 2:1</span>. And next follow the reasons or arguments engaging to it, which are taken from the agreeableness of it in the sight of God; from the will of God, that all men should be saved: from there being but one God of all, and one Mediator between God and men; from Christ's giving himself a ransom price for all; and from the apostle being a preacher of the Gospel to the Gentiles, as well as Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:3">1 Timothy 2:3</span> wherefore he concludes and determines, according to his apostolical power and authority, that prayer be made in any place, provided there were faith and purity, and wrath and doubting were laid aside, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:8">1 Timothy 2:8</span>. Also, he exhorts women to appear, especially in public service, in a modest and becoming dress, and to adorn themselves with good works, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:9">1 Timothy 2:9</span>, and that they should be silent learners, and not teachers, and be in subjection to their husbands, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:11">1 Timothy 2:11</span>. The reasons of which subjection are taken from the formation of Adam before Eve, and from Eve's being deceived, and not Adam, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:13">1 Timothy 2:13</span>. However, for the comfort of women, it is observed, that though in sorrow they bring forth children, yet through the birth of a Son, the promised Messiah, they shall be saved, who continue in faith, charity, and holiness, with sobriety, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:15">1 Timothy 2:15</span>. </p>
