<p><strong>But (which becometh women professing god likeness)</strong>,.... By which is meant not any particular grace, was it, the fear of God might be designed, and so the Syriac version renders it; nor the whole of internal religion only; nor the form of godliness, or the whole scheme of Gospel truth, which is according to godliness; nor only outward holiness of life and conversation; but the whole of all this, all religion, internal and external, the whole of godliness, both in a doctrinal and in a practical way. All this, these women the apostle gives directions unto, had made a profession of, and had been baptized upon it, and received members of churches; and as yet held their profession: and such persons, it best became them not so much to adorn themselves with any outward adornings, as</p>
<p><strong>with good works</strong>; such as are mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:10">1 Thessalonians 5:10</span> Good works are like good clothes, to which the apostle alludes; they do not make persons men and women, but they adorn them as such; so good works, they do not make men and women Christians, or believers, but they adorn them as such; they are ornaments to their persons, and to their profession, and to the Gospel they profess. See <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:10">Titus 2:10</span>.</p>
