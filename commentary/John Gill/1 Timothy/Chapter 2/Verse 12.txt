<p><strong>But I suffer not a woman to teach</strong>, c,] They may teach in private, in their own houses and families they are to be teachers of good things, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:3">Titus 2:3</span>. They are to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; nor is the law or doctrine of a mother to be forsaken, any more than the instruction of a father; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+1:8">Proverbs 1:8</span>. Timothy, no doubt, received much advantage, from the private teachings and instructions of his mother Eunice, and grandmother Lois; but then women are not to teach in the church; for that is an act of power and authority, and supposes the persons that teach to be of a superior degree, and in a superior office, and to have superior abilities to those who are taught by them:</p>
<p><strong>nor to usurp authority over the man</strong>; as not in civil and political things, or in things relating to civil government; and in things domestic, or the affairs of the family; so not in things ecclesiastical, or what relate to the church and government of it; for one part of rule is to feed the church with knowledge and understanding; and for a woman to take upon her to do this, is to usurp an authority over the man: this therefore she ought not to do,</p>
<p><strong>but to be in silence</strong>; to sit and hear quietly and silently, and learn, and not teach, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:11">1 Timothy 2:11</span>.</p>
