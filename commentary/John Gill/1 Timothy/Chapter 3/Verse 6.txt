<p><strong>Not a novice</strong>,.... Or one newly planted, the Arabic version adds, "in the faith"; meaning not a young man, for so was Timothy himself; but a young professor and church member; one that is lately come to the knowledge of the truth, and has just embraced and professed it, and become a member of a church, a new plant there: so the Hebrew word נטע, "a plant", is by the Septuagint in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="job+14:9">Job 14:9</span> rendered by this very word. The reason why such a person should not be a bishop, elder, or pastor of a church, is,</p>
<p><strong>lest being lifted up with pride</strong>; through the dignity of the office he is advanced to, and the high opinion of men he stands in, and the great gifts qualifying him for such a place, he is supposed to have: for pride on account of these is apt to creep in, and swell and elate the minds of young professors especially; so that there is danger</p>
<p><strong>that he fall into the condemnation of the devil</strong>; or "of the slanderer", as the word is rendered in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:11">1 Timothy 3:11</span> and the sense then is, lest he should be censured and condemned by such who are given to calumny and detraction, and are glad of any opportunity to reproach and vilify the ministers of the word: but it is better to understand it of Satan; and then the meaning is, either lest such an one fall under the censure and condemnation of the accuser of the brethren; or rather lest he fall into the same condemnation and punishment the devil is fallen into, their crimes being alike. For it seems from hence, that pride was the first sin of the devil, and the cause of his apostasy from God; being elated with his own knowledge, strength, and dignity; and not being able to bear it, that the human nature should be advanced above that of angels.</p>
