<p><strong>For it is sanctified</strong>,.... Or set apart for use, and may be lawfully used at all times:</p>
<p><strong>by the word of God</strong>; which declares that there is nothing in itself common, or unclean, or unfit for use, and that nothing that goes into a man defiles him; so that by virtue of this word of God, every creature may be made use of, that is fit for food: or else this designs the word of God, which gives a blessing to what is eaten; for it is not by bread or meat only, but through the word of God commanding a blessing on what is eaten, that man lives, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:4">Matthew 4:4</span> and therefore this blessing upon our food should be asked for: wherefore it follows,</p>
<p><strong>and prayer</strong>; this being used before eating for a blessing on the food, and after it, in a way of thanksgiving for it, sanctifies every creature of God, or gives men a free use of any, or all of them. So the Israelites, when they had eaten, and were full, were to bless the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+8:10">Deuteronomy 8:10</span>. And thus our Lord Jesus Christ, at meals, used to take the food, and bless it or ask a blessing on it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:19">Matthew 14:19</span>. And so did the Essenes among the Jews h, and the Christians in Tertullian's i time; and the practice is highly necessary and commendable, nor ought it to be disused.</p>
