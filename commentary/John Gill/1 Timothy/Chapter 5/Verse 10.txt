<p><strong>Well reported of for good works</strong>,.... Both by the members of the church, and by them that were without:</p>
<p><strong>particularly if she have brought up children</strong>; that is, "well", as the Arabic version adds; in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; commanding them, as Abraham did, to keep the way of the Lord, and to do justice and judgment; training them up in the paths of religion and virtue, from which they will not so easily depart when grown up.</p>
<p><strong>If she have lodged strangers</strong>; as Abraham and Lot did, who entertained angels unawares: this may be understood of strangers in common, but especially of the brethren, ministers, and others, who came from distant parts, and travelled about to spread the Gospel of Christ. The y Jews say many things בכבוד אכסניא, "in honour of hospitality" or entertaining of strangers, especially of receiving into their houses the disciples of the wise men, and giving them food and drink, and the use of their goods; this was what gave persons a very great character with them, and highly recommended them.</p>
<p><strong>If she have washed the saints' feet</strong>; which was usual in those hot countries, where they wore sandals only, partly for refreshment, and partly for the removal of dust and filth, contracted in walking; instances of this we have in several places of Scripture, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:4">Genesis 18:4</span>. It was such a common piece of civility, that our Lord complains of the neglect of it towards him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:44">Luke 7:44</span>. It was what he did to his own disciples, and in so doing set them an example of what they should do to one another, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:14">John 13:14</span> and being a mean and low office, and which very likely was done by the servants of the house; the sense may be, if she has condescended to do the meanest office for the saints.</p>
<p><strong>If she have relieved the afflicted</strong>; either in body, with her purse; or in mind, by visiting them, and speaking comfortably to them: in general,</p>
<p><strong>if she have diligently followed every good work</strong>; not only have done good works at certain times, but has followed that which is good; has closely pursued it, and that with great eagerness and diligence; has been constant and indefatigable in the performance of it.</p>
<p>y T. Bab. Beracot, fol. 63. 2.</p>
