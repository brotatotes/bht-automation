<p><strong>And withal they learn to be idle</strong>,.... Being at ease, and without labour, living at the expense of the church: "wandering about from house to house"; having nothing else to do: such an one is what the Jews z call אלמנה שובבית, "the gadding widow"; who, as the gloss says,</p>
<p>"goes about and visits her neighbours continually; and these are they that corrupt the world.''</p>
<p>Of this sort of women must the Jews be understood, when they say a, it is one of the properties of them to be יוצאניות "going out", or gadding abroad, as Dinah did; and that it is another to be</p>
<p>דבריות, "talkative", which agrees with what follows:</p>
<p><strong>and not only idle, but tattlers also</strong>; full of talk, who have always some news to tell, or report to make of the affairs of this, or the other person, or family:</p>
<p><strong>and busy bodies</strong>; in the matters of other persons, which do not concern them:</p>
<p><strong>speaking things which they ought not</strong>; which either are not true, and, if they are, are not to be spoken of, and carried from place to place: this is a very great inconvenience, the apostle observes, arising from the admission of such young widows to be relieved and maintained at the church's charge.</p>
