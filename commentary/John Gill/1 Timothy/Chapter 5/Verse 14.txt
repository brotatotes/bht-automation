<p><strong>I will therefore that the younger women marry</strong>,.... Or "the younger" widows rather; and so some copies read; for this is not the apostle's advice to young women in general, though it will suit with them, but with younger widows in particular, of whom he is speaking:</p>
<p><strong>bear children</strong>; and bring them forth, and feed, and nourish them, and bring them up in a religious way:</p>
<p><strong>guide the house</strong>; manage domestic affairs, direct, order, or do what is proper to be done for the good of the family; which is much more commendable than to throw themselves upon the church, and live an idle and wanton life, and after that marry: and so</p>
<p><strong>give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully</strong>; that is, either that Satan, the grand adversary of the saints, might have no opportunity to reproach them, and cast in their teeth their unbecoming walk, or accuse them before the throne; or that any enemy of the Christian religion might have no room nor reason to speak evilly of Christ, his Gospel, truths, and ordinances, on account of the disorderly conversation of any that profess his name; or that the ο αντικειμενος, the great opposer of Christ, the man of sin, and son of perdition, even antichrist, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:4">2 Thessalonians 2:4</span>, might have no handle from hence to speak reproachfully of marriage, and forbid it, under a pretence of sanctity, as <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:3">1 Timothy 4:3</span>.</p>
