<p><strong>If any man or woman that believeth have widows</strong>,.... That is, if any member of a church, whether a brother or a sister, have mothers or grandmothers, or any near relations widows, in mean circumstances, and incapable of taking care of themselves:</p>
<p><strong>let them relieve them</strong>; out of their own substance; which is what the apostle before calls showing piety at home, and requiting their own parents:</p>
<p><strong>and let not the church be charged</strong>; or burdened with the maintenance of them:</p>
<p><strong>that it may relieve them that are widows indeed</strong>; that the church may be in a better capacity, its stock not being expended on others, to supply the wants of those who are really widows; who have neither husbands, nor children, nor any relations, to provide for them; nor anything in the world to support themselves with.</p>
