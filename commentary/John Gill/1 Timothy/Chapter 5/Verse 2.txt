<p><strong>The elder women as mothers</strong>,.... When they offend in any point, they are to be reasoned, and argued, and pleaded with, as children should with their mothers; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:2">Hosea 2:2</span> and are to be considered as mothers in Israel, and to be treated with great tenderness and respect.</p>
<p><strong>The younger as sisters</strong>; using the freedom as a brother may with a sister; and considering them as sisters in Christ, and in a way becoming the relation, tell them their faults freely and privately, but</p>
<p><strong>with all purity</strong>: in such manner as to preserve chastity in looks, in words, and actions.</p>
