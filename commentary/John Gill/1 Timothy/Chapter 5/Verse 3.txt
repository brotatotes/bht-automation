<p><strong>Honour widows that are widows indeed.</strong> Who those are, see in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:5">1 Timothy 1:5</span>. The honour to be given them is not a putting of them into the office of a deaconess, in the church; which office, some think, is referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>, and did obtain in some of the primitive churches; and it might be that some of these widows, the apostle here and hereafter speaks of, might be preferred to the rest, and be set over them, and have the care of such, who were more infirm; but then this could only be the case of some, whereas the honour here spoken of is what is to be given to all that are really widows; and therefore rather regards some external honour and respect to be shown them, by words and actions; and especially it designs an honourable provision for them, and maintenance of them; in which sense the word is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17">1 Timothy 5:17</span>. So, with the Jews, giving gifts to persons, and making presents to them, is called honour. When Manoah asked the angel's name, that he might do him honour, when his saying came to pass, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+13:17">Judges 13:17</span> the sense, according to them, is q,</p>
<p>"that I may inquire in what place I may find thee, when thy prophecy is fulfilled, and give thee דורון, "a gift"; for there is no honour but what signifies a gift, as it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:17">Numbers 22:17</span>, "honouring I will honour thee".''</p>
<p>So giving gifts to the poor, or providing for their maintenance, is doing them honour; and that this is the sense here, appears by what follows in the context.</p>
