<p><strong>Now she that is a widow indeed</strong>,.... A real widow, whom the Jews r call גמורה, "a perfect one", in opposition to one that is divorced, or a brother's widow, that has had the shoe plucked off for her: and such an one as the apostle means, is one that is</p>
<p><strong>desolate</strong>, or "alone": who has neither husband to take care of her, nor children or nephews to show kindness to her, nor any worldly substance to subsist upon:</p>
<p><strong>but trusteth in God</strong>: not in man, nor in an arm of flesh, but in the living God, the giver of all good things, the Judge of widows; who vindicates their cause, avenges the injuries done them, protects and defends them, and relieves their wants, and gives all encouragement to them, to trust in him; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+49:11">Jeremiah 49:11</span>.</p>
<p><strong>and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day</strong>; as the widow Anna did, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:36">Luke 2:36</span>. A Widow indeed is one that has no outward dependence, betakes herself to the Lord, puts her confidence in him, and cries to him continually for a daily supply; and such an one, amidst all her poverty and meanness, is a living believer, one that lives by faith on the Lord; and is profitable, and useful to the church by her prayers and supplications made for them, as well as for herself; whereas she that is in the next verse described is just the reverse.</p>
