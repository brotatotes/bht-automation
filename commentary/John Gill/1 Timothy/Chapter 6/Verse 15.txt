<p><strong>Which in his times he shall show</strong>,.... For though the time of Christ's appearing is unknown, yet the thing itself is certain; God will bring it about, and make it manifest in his own time, in the time that is fixed and appointed by him; and which is only known unto him, and which he keeps in his own power, and has reserved in his own breast:</p>
<p><strong>who is the blessed</strong>; the Syriac version reads, "the blessed God"; who is blessed in himself, in his Son and Spirit, in the perfections of his nature; who is God all-sufficient, has enough in himself for himself, and for all his creatures; who is the fountain and the author of all blessedness, temporal, spiritual, and eternal, which any of them are, or shall be possessed of:</p>
<p><strong>and only Potentate</strong>; or Governor of the whole world, which can be said of none but himself: he is the Governor among the nations, and over all the nations of the earth; his kingdom rules over all other kingdoms; and he has his power and government from himself, whereas all other potentates have their power from him, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>the King of kings, and Lord of lords</strong>; from whom they receive their sceptres, crowns, and kingdoms; by whom they reign, and are continued in their power; for he sets up kings, and removes kings at his pleasure, and to him they must be accountable for all their administrations another day; and at present they are under his influence, and at his control; he has their hearts, and their counsels, as well as kingdoms, in his hands, and under his overruling providence; and causes all to answer his wise and eternal purposes. These titles are used by the Jews, who style him,</p>
<p>אדון כל האדונים מלך על כל המלכים, "Lord of all lords, King over all kings" s. The same name is given to Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:16">Revelation 19:16</span> which shows him to be equal with the Father.</p>
<p>s Zohar in Numb. fol. 100. 2.</p>
