<p><strong>For we brought nothing into this world</strong>,.... Which is a reason both clearly showing that godliness is great gain, since those who have it brought nothing into the world with them but sin, and yet are now in such happy circumstances as before described; and that godly persons should be content with what they have, even of worldly things, seeing they are so much more than they had when they came into the world, into which they came naked; and which should be a quieting consideration under the most stripping providences; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="job+1:21">Job 1:21</span></p>
<p><strong>and it is certain we can carry nothing out</strong>: as men come into the world, so will they go out of it; nor will they need their worldly substance after death, any more than they did before they were born; and what they now have, and use not, will then be lost to them, whatever gain it may be to others: wherefore it becomes them cheerfully to use what they have, and be content therewith; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ec+5:15">Ecclesiastes 5:15</span>. The Jews have a saying like this o, that</p>
<p>"as a man comes (into the world), בחליטין, "simply" or "nakedly", so he goes out in like manner.''</p>
<p>o Bereshit Rabba, sect. 42. fol. 36. 3.</p>
