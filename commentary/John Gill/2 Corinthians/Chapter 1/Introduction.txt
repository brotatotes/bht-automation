<p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO 2 CORINTHIANS 1</strong></p>
<p>This chapter contains the inscription of the epistle, the salutation of the persons to whom it is written, the preface to it, and the first part of it, in which is the apostle's defence of himself from the charge of fickleness and inconstancy. The inscription is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:1">2 Corinthians 1:1</span>, in which an account is given of the person, the writer of this epistle, by his name Paul, and by his office, an apostle of Jesus Christ, which is ascribed to the will of God as the spring and cause of it; and with himself he joins Timothy, whom he calls a brother: also an account is given of the persons to whom the epistle is inscribed, who are both the church at Corinth, and all the saints throughout the region of Achaia, of which Corinth was the chief city: the salutation, and which is common to all the epistles of the Apostle Paul, is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:2">2 Corinthians 1:2</span>, and the preface begins <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:3">2 Corinthians 1:3</span>, with a thanksgiving to God, who is described by the relation he stands in to Christ, as his Father, by the manifold mercies and blessings he is the author and donor of, and by the consolation he administers; an instance of which is given, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:4">2 Corinthians 1:4</span>, in the apostle and his companions, who had been comforted by him; the end of which was, that they might be instruments of comforting others in like troubles with the same consolations; the great goodness of God in which is illustrated by proportioning their consolation by Christ to their sufferings for him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:5">2 Corinthians 1:5</span>, and the end both of their afflictions and their comforts is repeated and explained; and by a dilemma it is shown, that both were for the good of the saints at Corinth, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:6">2 Corinthians 1:6</span>, and a strong assurance is given, that as they shared in sufferings for Christ, they would partake of consolation by him as they had done, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:7">2 Corinthians 1:7</span>. Next the apostle, in proof of what he had said, gives an instance of the trouble he had been in, and of the comfort and deliverance he had received, which he would not have the Corinthians ignorant of: he mentions the place where it was, in Asia, and gives an account of the nature of the affliction, how great it was; it was out of measure, above the strength of man, and induced despair of life, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:8">2 Corinthians 1:8</span>, so that the apostle, and those that were with him in it, expected nothing but death, and were under the sentence of it in their own apprehensions; the end of God in suffering which, was to take them off of all self-confidence, and to engage their trust in God, to which the consideration of his power in raising the dead is a strong argument, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:9">2 Corinthians 1:9</span>. And indeed this deliverance, which God wrought, for the apostle, and his friends, was a deliverance as it were from death, and a very great one; and which had this effect upon them, the designed and desired end, trust and confidence in God for future deliverance, having had an experience of past and present, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:10">2 Corinthians 1:10</span>, which deliverance the apostle acknowledges, was owing to the prayers of the Corinthians, as a means or helping cause of it; and which favour was bestowed thereby for this end, that as it came by the means of many, thanks might be returned by many for it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:11">2 Corinthians 1:11</span>. And the reason why the apostle, and his fellow ministers, had such an interest in the prayers of the Corinthians, was their agreeable conversation in the world, and particularly at Corinth, which their consciences bore witness to, and they could reflect upon with pleasure; it being through the grace of God with great simplicity and sincerity, and not with carnal craft and subtlety: or this is mentioned by the apostle to remove the charge of levity, and to vindicate himself and others from it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span>, which he next enters upon, premising that the constant course of their lives was such as before described, and which there was no reason to doubt would always continue such; for the truth of which he appeals to what they had seen, and owned to be in them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:13">2 Corinthians 1:13</span>, and that it was acknowledged, at least in part, that the apostles were their rejoicing, or of whom they boasted as to their conduct and conversation, even as they were persuaded they would be matter of rejoicing in the day of Christ to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:14">2 Corinthians 1:14</span>. And then the apostle acknowledges his intention and promise of coming to them, which was in confidence of their value for him, and of their being real Christians and persevering ones; and for this end, that he might establish them in the grace which they had received, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:15">2 Corinthians 1:15</span>, and also, after he had passed by them into Macedonia, and was returned from thence to them again, that he might be helped on by them in his journey to Jerusalem, with the collection for the poor saints there, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:16">2 Corinthians 1:16</span>. But then he denies that he used levity, or carnal policy and purposes, or was guilty of any contradiction; all which expresses by certain interrogations, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:17">2 Corinthians 1:17</span>, which confirms by the ministration of the Gospel among them, which was all of apiece, without contradiction for the truth of which he calls God to witness; and so argues from the uniformity of his ministry, to the constancy of his word of promise, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:18">2 Corinthians 1:18</span>. Which argument he amplifies and enlarges on, by observing the subject matter of the Gospel ministry, which is Jesus Christ the Son of God; and which, though preached by different ministers, himself, Silvanus, and Timothy, yet was the same, had no contrariety in it, as preached by the one, and by the other, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:19">2 Corinthians 1:19</span>, and therefore there was no reason to conclude that he was fickle and inconstant in his promise to them, when he was so invariable in his ministry among them: besides, as all the promises of God are sure and certain, being made by the God of truth, and being in Christ, and the performance of them being for the glory of God by the saints; so the promises of every good man, in imitation of God and Christ, are firmly and constantly observed, as much as can be by frail and finite creatures, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:20">2 Corinthians 1:20</span>; and that the apostle, and his fellow ministers, were not so fickle and changeable as they were represented, neither in their principles, nor in their practices, the apostle takes notice of some blessings of grace, which they enjoyed in common with other saints, and with the Corinthians; such as stability in Christ, the unction of divine grace, the seal and earnest of the Spirit in their hearts; all which they had from God, and which kept them close to God, and preserved them in his grace, and from a fickle variable temper of mind, and from changeableness either in doctrine or conduct, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:21">2 Corinthians 1:21</span>. And then the apostle proceeds to give the true reason why he had not as yet come to Corinth, according to his promise, which was on their account, and not his own, that they might not come under that severe discipline and correction, which their faults required; and for the truth of this he calls God to witness, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:23">2 Corinthians 1:23</span>. But lest it should be objected that this was assuming a dominion over them, a lording it over God's heritage, he observes, that he and his fellow ministers did not pretend to have dominion over their faith, only to be helpers of their joy, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:24">2 Corinthians 1:24</span>. </p>
