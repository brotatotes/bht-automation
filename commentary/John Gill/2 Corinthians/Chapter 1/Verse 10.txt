<p><strong>Who delivered us from so great a death</strong>,.... Accordingly, being enabled to trust in God, when all human hope and helps failed, to believe in hope against hope, then the Lord appeared for them, and delivered them from this heavy affliction; which, because by reason of it they were not only in danger of death, and threatened with, but were even under the sentence of it, is therefore called a death, and so great an one, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span>. The apostle expresses the continuance of the mercy,</p>
<p><strong>and doth deliver</strong>; which shows that they were still exposed to deaths and dangers, but were wonderfully preserved by the power of God, which gave great encouragement to them to hope and believe that God would still preserve them for further usefulness. The Alexandrian copy leaves out this clause, and so does the Syriac version.</p>
<p><strong>In whom we trust that he will yet deliver us</strong>; all the three tenses, past, present, and future, are mentioned, which shows that an abiding sense of past and present deliverances serves greatly to animate faith in expectation of future ones.</p>
