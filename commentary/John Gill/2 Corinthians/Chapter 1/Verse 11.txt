<p><strong>You also helping together by prayer for us</strong>,.... Though the apostle ascribes their deliverance solely to God, as the author and efficient cause of it; yet he takes notice of the prayers of the saints for them, as helping causes or means of their obtaining it. It was a very laudable practice in the churches, and worthy of imitation, to pray for the ministers of the Gospel, and especially when under affliction and persecution; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:5">Acts 12:5</span>, and the prayers of those righteous ones were heard by God, and often effectual for the deliverance of them, as they were in the present case: for</p>
<p><strong>by the means of many persons</strong>, who wrestled together in prayer with God,</p>
<p><strong>the gift</strong> of deliverance from so great a death, which the apostle looked upon as a wonderful mercy, χαρισμα, "a free grace gift", was "bestowed upon" them, which was granted for this end,</p>
<p><strong>that thanks may be given by many on our behalf</strong>; which is but reasonable, and ought to be observed; for since many were concerned in asking for, and obtaining the mercy, they ought to join in thanksgiving for it: and the apostle's view in this is to stir them up to a joint acknowledgment of the deliverance with them, which better became them than to side with the false apostles in their charge against him.</p>
