For we write none other things to you,.... The things we write unto you concerning our conduct; and behaviour, are no otherthan what you read; not in our letters to you, but in our lives and conversations, when we were among you, and which you must own and acknowledge to be just and right; we can appeal to you, that what we say, and are obliged to say of ourselves, in our own defence, is what, upon a recollection, you will easily remember to have seen and observed:and I trust; or "hope", through the grace of God, we shall be enabled so to walk, as thatyou shall acknowledge even to the end; that our conversations are as become the Gospel of Christ, and are clear of that hypocrisy and deceit our adversaries would insinuate concerning us.
