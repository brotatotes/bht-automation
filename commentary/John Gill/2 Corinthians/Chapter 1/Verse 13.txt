<p><strong>For we write none other things to you</strong>,.... The things we write unto you concerning our conduct; and behaviour, are no other</p>
<p><strong>than what you read</strong>; not in our letters to you, but in our lives and conversations, when we were among you, and which you must own and acknowledge to be just and right; we can appeal to you, that what we say, and are obliged to say of ourselves, in our own defence, is what, upon a recollection, you will easily remember to have seen and observed:</p>
<p><strong>and I trust</strong>; or "hope", through the grace of God, we shall be enabled so to walk, as that</p>
<p><strong>you shall acknowledge even to the end</strong>; that our conversations are as become the Gospel of Christ, and are clear of that hypocrisy and deceit our adversaries would insinuate concerning us.</p>
