<p><strong>And to pass by you into Macedonia</strong>,.... It was his first intention and determination to have come first to Corinth, and then to Macedonia, to have took this city in his way thither; which was an argument of his love to them, and his great desire to see them; since he might have gone, as he did, a nearer way to Macedonia, than by Corinth:</p>
<p><strong>and to come again out of Macedonia to you</strong>; when he had gone through that, and done his business there unto the Corinthians; and after some stay with them,</p>
<p><strong>of you to be brought on my way towards Judea</strong>; where he intended to go, with the collections he had made for the poor saints at Jerusalem, in the several churches in Asia; but though this was his first resolution, which he had signified either by letter, or messengers, yet he afterwards changed his mind, for some reasons within himself; it may be, having heard some things disagreeable of them, which he thought more convenient to acquaint them with in an epistle first, and to try what effect that would have upon them, before he came in person: that he changed his mind, appears from the former epistle, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:5">1 Corinthians 16:5</span>, where he says, "I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia"; and upon this account it is he excuses and vindicates himself in the following verse.</p>
