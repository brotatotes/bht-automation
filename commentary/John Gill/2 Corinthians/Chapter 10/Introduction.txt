<p>INTRODUCTION TO 2 CORINTHIANS 10</p>
<p>In this chapter the apostle has chiefly to do with the false teachers, and it is taken up in refuting their calumnies of him, and in exposing their boasting of themselves; and as he goes along, he takes notice of the efficacy of the Gospel, and of the success and extent of it, as it was preached by him, and other Gospel ministers, and points at the proper manner and ground of glorying. And whereas the false teachers had represented him as a mean spirited man, as well as his outward aspect was contemptible, and that he had not that authority and courage he boasted of, he describes himself by those characters they had reproached him with: by his name Paul, which signified little, they suggesting that he was little in soul, as well as in body; by his modesty and humility, when he was with the Corinthians, and by his boldness, now absent from them: and he entreats them by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, which he imitated, and they ought also, that they would not join in those sneers, nor reproach him for these things, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:1">2 Corinthians 10:1</span> and that they would so behave, that, when he came among them, he might have no occasion of using that power and authority, which the false teachers called bluster and boldness; and which he had thought and determined in his own mind to exercise on some who traduced him and his fellow ministers as carnal selfish persons, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:2">2 Corinthians 10:2</span> which calumny he removes by owning, that they walked in the flesh, in the body, and were subject to imperfections, as men; but denies that their ministerial warfare or service was managed in a carnal and worldly, or in a weak way and manner, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:3">2 Corinthians 10:3</span> assigning this reason for it, because the weapons they made use of, in the warfare of their ministry, to defend truth, and annoy the enemy, to enlarge Christ's kingdom, and weaken Satan's, were not carnal, weak, and worldly, but spiritual and efficacious, through the power of God that accompanied them; and which appeared by the use they were of to the demolishing the strong holds of the flesh, and bringing down the haughty and lofty imaginations of the fleshly mind, which were opposed to the knowledge of God, and the refuting all the sophisms of fleshly wisdom, and carnal reasonings against the Gospel of Christ. This was the influence it had on some through the power of divine grace, whereby they became obedient to Christ, and subject to his word and ordinances, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:4">2 Corinthians 10:4</span> whilst on others, as on Elymas the sorcerer, who sought to pervert the right ways of God, the apostolical power was exercised in a way of just punishment and awful vengeance, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:6">2 Corinthians 10:6</span>. The apostle moreover suggests to the Corinthians, that they judged of him, and the false teachers, according to the outward appearance of things, which was wrong: however, let these men make ever so great a show in the flesh, or what pretensions soever to Christianity, to being the members and ministers of Christ, the apostle would have them observe, that he, and those with him, were, and were to be looked upon as equally the same, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:7">2 Corinthians 10:7</span> nay, should he exalt himself above them, and affirm he had an authority superior to theirs, which he describes by the efficient cause of it, the Lord, and by its end, edification, and not destruction, he should have no reason to be ashamed, since he was capable of giving proof of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:8">2 Corinthians 10:8</span> however, he would say no more of this for the present, lest he should strengthen the calumny cast upon him, that it was his way to terrify by his letters, with blustering menaces of his power and authority, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:9">2 Corinthians 10:9</span> and which calumny is more fully expressed in the words of the false teachers, who said, that his letters were bold and blustering, and by which he would be thought to be a man of power and authority; though, alas! a man of no speech nor presence, when in person among men, and so not to be regarded, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>. In answer to which the apostle returns, that he would have such a reviler know, that as he was in word by letters when absent, such would he be found to be in deed when present, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:11">2 Corinthians 10:11</span> and then proceeds to expose the vain glorying of the false teachers, and to observe those things which he, and other faithful ministers of the word, might glory of; though they could not give themselves the liberties they did, and chose to glory in the Lord; they could not commend themselves in that bold and insolent manner, to the contempt of others, when there was no necessity for it, as the false teachers did, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:12">2 Corinthians 10:12</span> nor could they boast of things they never did; of conversions they never were instruments of; of the planting of churches they had no concern in; and of spreading the Gospel where they had never been, which was the case of these men: whereas, whenever they gloried, it was when there was an absolute necessity for it, and always with modesty, acknowledging the grace and goodness of God unto them, and ever with truth; and of their own labours, and not of others; and particularly with respect to Corinth, it was with the strictest regard to truth that they affirmed they were the first that preached the Gospel there, converted souls, and planted a Gospel church, and hoped they should be the means of spreading it further still, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:13">2 Corinthians 10:13</span>. However, they did not desire to glory in themselves, but in the Lord, from whom they had all their gifts, success, and usefulness; and so they directed others to do, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:17">2 Corinthians 10:17</span> and because, for this reason, that he that commends himself is not approved of God, but he that is commended by the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:18">2 Corinthians 10:18</span>. </p>
