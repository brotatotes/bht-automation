<p><strong>In weariness and painfulness</strong>,.... Through long journeys and frequent preaching; or "in labour and trouble"; or in troublesome labour, for all labour is not so; as hunting, hawking, c. though laborious, yet delightful but the labours of the apostle were painful and troublesome to the flesh, though he had much inward spiritual delight and pleasure in them:</p>
<p><strong>in watchings often</strong>; being sometimes engaged at midnight, either in preaching, or praying, or staging psalms, and sometimes obliged to work early and late with his own hands to supply his necessities:</p>
<p><strong>in hunger and thirst</strong>; as when at sea, or in wilderness places, or where no notice was taken of him for preaching the Gospel; he doing that freely without asking the assistance of any, which in some places would have been prejudicial to his designs, and the spread of the Gospel:</p>
<p><strong>in fastings often</strong>; voluntary ones, which he engaged in, not as meritorious works, but to keep under his body, and as proper to attend the work of prayer at certain times:</p>
<p><strong>in cold and nakedness</strong>; when travelling in the winter season, and but poorly clothed to keep him from the inclemencies of the weather; and having no certain dwelling place to retire unto and abide in, during any severe season there might be, and wanting the comforts of life to support him under such inconveniences.</p>
