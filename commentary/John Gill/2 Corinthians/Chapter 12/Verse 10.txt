<p><strong>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities</strong>,.... Not in them simply considered, but as they were made use of to his advantage, for the exercise of his grace, and for his more abundant consolation; and especially as they tended to the glory of Christ, and made his grace, power, and strength the more conspicuous: by infirmities are meant all outward troubles, everything that is mean and abject, distressing and afflicting, whether from Satan or the world; it seems to be a general term, which includes and is explained by the following particulars:</p>
<p><strong>in reproaches</strong>; of Satan, the accuser of the brethren, who sometimes reproachfully insinuates that they are hypocrites, and serve God and Christ with mercenary views and selfish ends; and of the men of the world, who traduce them as deceivers, treat them with opprobrious language, and lead them with revilings and contumelies, endeavour to take away their characters, credit, and reputation; the faithful servants of Christ must go through bad report, and suffer shame for the name of Christ; but these reproaches with Moses are esteemed by them greater riches than the treasures of Egypt:</p>
<p><strong>in necessities</strong>; not of the soul, the better part, there being a sufficiency of grace in Christ to relieve all its wants; but of the body, the apostle was sometimes reduced to very necessitous circumstances, wanting the common necessaries of life, being hungry, thirsty, and naked, and yet cheerful:</p>
<p><strong>in persecutions</strong>; from place to place by the enemies of the Gospel, by whom he was severely handled by beating, scourging, and imprisonment; but his stripes were the marks of the Lord Jesus; his chains were his crown, and his prison a palace to him:</p>
<p><strong>in distresses</strong>, or "straits"; both as to body and mind, encompassed with such difficulties that he knew not what way to take, or course to steer: and all</p>
<p><strong>for Christ's sake</strong>; not for any real crime done by him, but for a profession of Christ, preaching his Gospel, and for the glory of his name; and which made all these afflictions so delightful to him, having in the midst of them the love of God to comfort him, the power and strength of Christ to support him, and the grace of the Spirit to assist him, and the presence of all the three Persons with him; this he suggests to be the ground and reason of his delight and pleasure, in such otherwise disagreeable circumstances:</p>
<p><strong>for when I am weak, then am I strong</strong>; when he was attended with all the above mentioned infirmities, when laden with reproaches, surrounded with necessities, followed with persecutions, and brought into the utmost straits and difficulties, and was most sensible of his weakness in himself to bear and go through all these things; then was he upheld by the divine arm, and strengthened by the power of Christ; so that he was not only able to sustain the conflict, but became more than a conqueror, and even to triumph in the midst of these adversities; he could and did readily take the advice in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joe+3:10">Joel 3:10</span>, and express himself in the same language there directed to, and to which he seems to refer, "let the weak say I am strong"; for he that is weak in himself, and sees himself to be so, is strong in Christ, and has a comfortable experience of renewed strength from him, as his day is. The Jews have a saying h somewhat like this,</p>
<p>"the righteous even כשהן חלשים מתחזקים, "when they are weak strengthen themselves"; as it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:2">Genesis 48:2</span>, and the wicked, though in their strength, fall, according to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="es+7:8">Esther 7:8</span>.''</p>
<p>h Baal Hatturim in Gen. xlviii. 2.</p>
