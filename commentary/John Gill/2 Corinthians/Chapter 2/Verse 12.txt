<p><strong>Furthermore, when I came to Troas</strong>,.... The apostle proceeds, in this latter part of the chapter, to take notice of and remove the charge of ostentation and insincerity in preaching the Gospel, and hints at other reasons of his not coming to Corinth; particularly that he took a journey to Troas, expecting to meet with Titus there, who was to give him an account of the affairs of the church at Corinth, which he was desirous of knowing before he went thither; but missing of Titus, is uneasy, and goes for Macedonia; though he was first detained awhile at Troas, having a good opportunity of preaching the Gospel there, with a prospect of success. Troas was a city of the lesser Asia near the Hellespont, formerly called Troy; of Paul's being at this place more than once, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:13">2 Timothy 4:13</span>, and of this place</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:13- :">2 Timothy 4:13- :</span>, and of the church there,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:13- :">2 Timothy 4:13- :</span>. Hither he came,</p>
<p><strong>to preach Christ's Gospel</strong>; that Gospel, of which Christ is both the author and subject; and is no other than the good news and glad tidings of peace, pardon, righteousness, life, and salvation, by a crucified Jesus; this was his work and business; his heart was in it, he took delight in this service, and it was what he pursued in every place wherever he came; and in this place he had much encouragement; for he adds,</p>
<p><strong>and a door was opened unto me of the Lord</strong>; such an one as was opened to him at Ephesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:9">1 Corinthians 16:9</span>; he had a good opportunity of preaching the Gospel to many souls, many were inclined to attend his ministry, from whence he conceived great hopes of doing good; a door of utterance was given to him to preach the Gospel boldly and freely, and a door of entrance for the Gospel to pass into their hearts: all which was not of men, "but of the Lord"; who has the key of David, who opens and no man shuts, shuts and no man opens.</p>
