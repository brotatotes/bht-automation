<p><strong>And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face</strong>,.... This he did, because there was such a glory upon his face when he came down from the mount, that the Israelites could not bear to look upon him; and also to take off that dread of him which was upon them, for they were afraid to come nigh him; and that so they might be able to hearken and attend to the words of the law, he delivered to them: the account of Moses's putting on this veil is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:33">Exodus 34:33</span> where Onkelos renders it by בית אפי, "the house of the face", or a "mask": and Jarchi on the place says it was a "garment", which he put before his face; and both the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem call it</p>
<p>סודרא, "a linen cloth": now this veil upon his face had a mystery in it; it was an emblem of the Gospel being veiled under the law, and of the darkness and obscurity of the law in the business of life and salvation; and also of the future blindness of the Jews, when the glory of the Gospel should break forth in the times of Christ and his apostles; and which was such,</p>
<p><strong>that the children of Israel</strong>, the Jews, as in the times of Moses, so in the times of Christ and his apostles,</p>
<p><strong>could not steadfastly look to</strong>; not upon the face of Moses, whose face was veiled; not that they might not look, but because they could not bear to look upon him; but they could not look</p>
<p><strong>to the end of that which is abolished</strong>; that is, to Christ, who is the end of the law, which is abrogated by him: to him they could not look, nor could they see him to be the fulfilling end of the law for righteousness; which being fulfilled, is done away by him; and this because of the blindness of their hearts, of which blindness the veil on Moses' face was typical: though the Alexandrian copy and the Vulgate Latin version read, "to the face of him which is abolished".</p>
