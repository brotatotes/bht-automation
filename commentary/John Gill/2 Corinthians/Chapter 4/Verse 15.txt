<p><strong>For all things are for your sakes</strong>;.... This is a very large and comprehensive expression, and reaches to all the things of Christ, as well as of his ministers. The incarnation, obedience, death, and resurrection of Christ, are all for the sake of God's elect; and so the ministry of his apostles and servants, their gifts, graces, comforts, and experiences; and so likewise all their reproaches, afflictions, and persecutions; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:6">2 Corinthians 1:6</span>. These were endured for their sakes, and tended to their establishment in the faith; were for the furtherance of the Gospel, and of the faith and joy of saints; and this gave no small pleasure and relief to them under their sufferings, that they were of such use to others. Moreover, all their deliverances, when in any imminent danger; were for the sake of the churches:</p>
<p><strong>that the abundant grace</strong>; held forth in their ministrations, manifestly to be seen in supporting them under their troubles, and delivering them out of them:</p>
<p><strong>might through the thanksgiving of many</strong>; for such appearances of divine goodness, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:11">2 Corinthians 1:11</span></p>
<p><strong>redound to the glory of God</strong>; which is another thing that yielded them a pleasing satisfaction, in all their distresses for the sake of Christ, and his Gospel.</p>
