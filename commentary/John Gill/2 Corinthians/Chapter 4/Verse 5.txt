<p><strong>For we preach not ourselves</strong>,.... These words contain a reason why the apostles behaved themselves in the manner described, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:2">2 Corinthians 4:2</span> and serve to explain in what sense this inspired writer is to be understood, when he calls the Gospel our Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:3">2 Corinthians 4:3</span> and most clearly proves the Gospel to be a glorious one, which he had asserted, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span> since Christ, and not themselves, is the subject of it, "for we preach not ourselves". They did not preach any doctrine of their own devising; they did not set up themselves as lords over the faith and consciences of men; nor was their view in preaching to set forth their learning, parts, and eloquence, or to amass wealth and riches to themselves; nor did they assert the purity of human nature, or the power of man to do anything of himself that is spiritually good; or that justification and salvation are by works of righteousness done by men. To do any, or each, or all of these, as did the false apostles, is to preach a man's self: but so did not these faithful dispensers of the word, but they</p>
<p><strong>preached Christ Jesus the Lord</strong>; that is, the doctrines respecting the person, office, and grace of Christ; as that he is truly and properly God, the eternal and only begotten Son of God, God and man in one person, the only Mediator between God and man, and the Saviour and Redeemer of lost sinners; that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, the true Messiah; and that this Christ is Jesus, a Saviour, the only able and willing one; and that this Jesus Christ is "Lord" of all, especially of the saints; not only as Creator, but as their head, husband, and Redeemer; that peace and reconciliation, pardon and righteousness, life and salvation, are only by him: and they also declared themselves the servants of the churches,</p>
<p><strong>and ourselves your servants</strong>. The apostle does not say they were the servants of Christ, though they were, and esteemed it their greatest honour to be so; for he had no need to observe this, since this is included in their preaching him as "Lord": nor does he say they were the servants of men, or menpleasers, for then they would not be the servants of Christ; but he asserts them to be the servants of the churches: and which must be understood, not with respect to things temporal, with which they had no concern; but with regard to things spiritual, particularly to the ministration of the word, and administration of ordinances: and this they professed to be,</p>
<p><strong>for Jesus' sake</strong>; either for the sake of preaching Christ unto them; or because they were chosen and called by him to this service, and in which they were willing to continue, for the sake of his honour and interest.</p>
