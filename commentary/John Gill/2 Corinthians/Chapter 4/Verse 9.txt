<p><strong>Persecuted, but not forsaken</strong>,.... Pursued from place to place, and followed with menaces, curses, and reproaches; laid hold on, proscribed, imprisoned, and threatened with the severest tortures, and death itself; but our God never leaves us nor forsakes us; though we are followed close by evil men, and left by our friends, we are not forsaken of God:</p>
<p><strong>cast down</strong> we sometimes are, as an earthen vessel; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:7">2 Corinthians 4:7</span>, which may be cast out of a man's hands, in order to be dashed to pieces; or as a man in wrestling, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span> may be thrown to the ground by his antagonist, so we are sometimes foiled by sin, Satan, and the world:</p>
<p><strong>but not destroyed</strong>; we are still safe in the hands of Christ, and are kept by the power of God; and, indeed, to what else can all this be ascribed? it is surprising that earthen vessels should bear and suffer so much, and not fall, or be dashed to pieces.</p>
