<p><strong>For we commend not ourselves again to you</strong>,.... We have no need to do so, being well known to you; nor do we intend it when we thus speak of ourselves, and of our ministrations:</p>
<p><strong>but give you occasion to glory on our behalf</strong>; suggest some things to you which you may make use of in our favour, for the vindicating of our characters and conduct:</p>
<p><strong>that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart</strong>; by whom are meant the false apostles who gloried in an outward show, in their learning, eloquence, and popular applause they had acquired, and not in the sincerity of their hearts, and the testimony of a good conscience, things which the true apostles of Christ were most ambitious of.</p>
