<p><strong>Now for a recompence in the same</strong>,.... That your love to me may answer mine to you; that as you have my heart, I may have yours, and the same room in your heart, as you have in mine. The Vulgate Latin version reads, "having the same recompence"; and the Arabic version renders it, "grant to me the same recompence"; and the Syriac version, "recompense to me my usuries that are with you"; that is, repay me with affection, let love be returned for love.</p>
<p><strong>I speak as unto my children</strong>; which relation subsisting between us requires mutual affection; for as a father should love his children, so children should love their father:</p>
<p><strong>be ye also enlarged</strong>; in your love to me, as I am to you; and then, as if he should say, you will bear with, and take in good part the following exhortation and advice.</p>
