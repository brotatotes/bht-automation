In stripes,.... As the Apostle Paul particularly was, who was thrice beaten with rods, and five times scourged by the Jews with the scourge of forty stripes save one.In imprisonments; under which are included bonds, in which they often were for the Gospel of Christ:in tumults; and uproars of the people, when their lives were frequently in imminent danger: or "in tossings to and fro"; being drove from place to place through the fury of their enemies;in labours; in a laborious ministry of the word, and administration of ordinances; or by labouring with their own hands to supply their necessities:in watchings; being obliged to work night and day at their hand labour, and in preaching, praying, and singing psalms; which exercises they were often employed in at midnight:in fastings; by which are meant not voluntary, but involuntary ones, through want of food to eat.
