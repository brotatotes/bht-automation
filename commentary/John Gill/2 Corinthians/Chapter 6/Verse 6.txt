<p><strong>By pureness</strong>,.... The apostle having observed how he, and other ministers of God, showed themselves to be such by patiently bearing everything that was afflictive and distressing to the outward man, proceeds to show how they approved themselves in other respects; and which more chiefly regard the inward man, the exercise of grace, and a spiritual behaviour: "by pureness"; of doctrine and conversation, chastity of body and mind, sincerity of heart, and integrity of life:</p>
<p><strong>by knowledge</strong>; of the Scriptures of truth, the mysteries of grace; or by a prudent conduct, a walking in wisdom with caution and circumspection:</p>
<p><strong>by longsuffering</strong>: not easily provoked to wrath, but bearing with patience every indignity and affront:</p>
<p><strong>by kindness</strong>; gentleness, sweetness of temper and manners, affability and courteousness:</p>
<p><strong>by the Holy Ghost</strong>; influencing and assisting in the exercise of every grace, and the discharge of every duty, or by the gifts of the Holy Ghost, ordinary and extraordinary:</p>
<p><strong>by love unfeigned</strong>; without dissimulation, being not in word only, but in deed and in truth towards the brethren, and to all men.</p>
