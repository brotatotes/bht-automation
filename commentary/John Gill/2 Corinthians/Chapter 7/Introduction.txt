<p>INTRODUCTION TO 2 CORINTHIANS 7</p>
<p>This chapter begins with an inference deduced, from what is said in the latter part of the foregoing chapter, engaging to holiness of heart and life, in opposition to filthiness of flesh and spirit, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:1">2 Corinthians 7:1</span> and the apostle, in order to prevail upon the Corinthians kindly to receive his exhortations, observes his own conduct, and that of his fellow ministers towards them; as that they had done them no injury by the advice they had given them, nor had they corrupted them by unsound doctrine, or had coveted their worldly substance, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:2">2 Corinthians 7:2</span> not that by so saying he would insinuate as if they had been guilty of injury, corruption, and covetousness; it was far from his thoughts to suggest anything of that kind concerning them, for whom he had so great an affection, as never to separate from them, but living and dying to continue the same regards unto them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:3">2 Corinthians 7:3</span> and which he expresses, and had shown everywhere, by the freedom of speech he had used concerning them, and his boasting of them, and the joy and comfort he had in the midst of his troubles, by the good news he had received of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:4">2 Corinthians 7:4</span>, which he had in the following manner; for though when in Macedonia he had no rest, partly through outward troubles, and partly through inward fears, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:5">2 Corinthians 7:5</span> yet meeting with Titus, who had been with them, and had brought an account of their state, it was a means God made use of for the comfort of him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:6">2 Corinthians 7:6</span> and it was not merely the sight of Titus that yielded him this consolation, but the comfortable reception he had met with at Corinth; and also the good effect the apostle's letter written to them had upon them, as related by Titus; what a desire they had to see him, what grief that they should sin, and by it distress him, and what a fervent affection they had for him <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:7">2 Corinthians 7:7</span> for which reason he did not repent of the letter he sent them, though it did produce sorrow in them, since that was of the right kind, and was but for a time, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:8">2 Corinthians 7:8</span> yea, he was so far from it, that he was glad, not merely on account of their sorrow, but because their sorrow was a godly one, and issued in repentance; and so they were no losers, but gainers by the epistle, it producing such good effects, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:9">2 Corinthians 7:9</span> which leads him to distinguish between a true right godly sorrow, and a worldly one, and that by their consequences; repentance and salvation following upon the one, and death upon the other, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:10">2 Corinthians 7:10</span> the fruits and evidences of which godly and true repentance he makes mention of in seven particulars, by which it appeared that their sorrow and repentance were sincere and genuine, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:11">2 Corinthians 7:11</span> when the apostle proceeds to observe to them the end he had in view in writing to them, upon the account of the incestuous person, in which he had used great plainness and faithfulness; and this was not merely on account of him that offended, nor only on account of the person injured by him, but chiefly to testify his care of, and concern for their welfare, as a church of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:12">2 Corinthians 7:12</span> and inasmuch as though they had been grieved, yet were now comforted, it added to the consolation of the apostle and his companions, and the more delighted they were, when they understood what a reception Titus had among them, what reverence he was had in, what respect was shown him, and care was taken of him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:13">2 Corinthians 7:13</span> and the rather, seeing the apostle had boasted of the liberality, generosity, and affectionate regard of the Corinthians to the ministers of the Gospel, Titus found it to be all true what he had said; so that he had no reason to be ashamed, as he must have been, had they behaved otherwise, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:14">2 Corinthians 7:14</span> and still it gave him further pleasure, that by their behaviour to Titus, they had gained his heart, and increased his affection towards them; which he could not but express, whenever he called to mind, or made mention of the great respect, veneration, and obedience, they yielded to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:15">2 Corinthians 7:15</span> and indeed it was not only in this instance, but in all others, the apostle had confidence concerning them, which heightened his joy and pleasure in them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:16">2 Corinthians 7:16</span>. </p>
