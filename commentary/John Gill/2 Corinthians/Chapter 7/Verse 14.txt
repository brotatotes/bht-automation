<p><strong>For if I have boasted anything to him of you</strong>,.... As of their faith in Christ, of their liberality to the saints, their affection for him, and obedience to him as children to a father:</p>
<p><strong>I am not ashamed</strong>; since these all appeared to be true; as he must have been had they been otherwise:</p>
<p><strong>but as we spake all things to you in truth</strong>; that is, our preaching among you was true; all the doctrines we delivered to you were truth; our word was not yea and nay, but uniform, and all of a piece:</p>
<p><strong>even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth</strong>; some understand this of the boasting which the apostle made concerning Titus, in his epistle to them, highly commending him, and which they found to be in all things exactly true; but the words rather design his boasting of the Corinthians unto Titus, which was found to be true by him.</p>
