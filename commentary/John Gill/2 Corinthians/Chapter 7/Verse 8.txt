<p><strong>For though I made you sorry with a letter</strong>,.... His former epistle, relating to the incestuous person:</p>
<p><strong>I do not repent, though I did repent</strong>; not of writing the letter, which was wrote by divine inspiration; but of the sorrow occasioned by it, though now he did not repent of that:</p>
<p><strong>for I perceive that the same epistle made you sorry, though it were but for a season</strong>; inasmuch as the sorrow was true, hearty, and genuine, though it was but for a time, the apostle was entirely satisfied, and the more pleased, because of its brevity, since it was sincere.</p>
