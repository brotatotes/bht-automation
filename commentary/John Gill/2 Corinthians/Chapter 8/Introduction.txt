<p>INTRODUCTION TO 2 CORINTHIANS 8</p>
<p>In this chapter the apostle stirs up the Corinthians, to make a collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem, by a variety of arguments, and gives a commendation of Titus and some other brethren, who were appointed messengers to them on that account. He first sets before them the example of the Macedonian churches, who had made a liberal collection for the above persons; which the apostle calls the grace of God, and says it was bestowed on them; and it was not the generosity of one church only, but of many, and so worthy of imitation, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:1">2 Corinthians 8:1</span> which generosity of theirs he illustrates by the circumstances and condition they were in, they were not only in great affliction, but in deep poverty; and yet contributed with abundance of joy, and in great liberality, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:2">2 Corinthians 8:2</span> yea, this they did not only to the utmost of their power, and according to the best of their abilities; but their will was beyond their power, they had hearts to do more than they were able; and what they did, they did of themselves without being asked and urged to it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:3">2 Corinthians 8:3</span> nay, they even entreated the apostle and his fellow ministers to take the money they had collected, and either send or carry it to the poor saints at Jerusalem, and minister it to them themselves, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:4">2 Corinthians 8:4</span> and which was beyond the expectation of the apostle, who knew their case; and yet it was but acting like themselves, who at first gave themselves to the Lord and to the apostles by the will of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:5">2 Corinthians 8:5</span> and this forwardness and readiness of the Macedonian churches, or the churches themselves put the apostle upon desiring Titus to go to Corinth, and finish the collection he had begun; and which carries in it more arguments than one to excite them to this service; as that this was not only at the request of the apostle, but of the Macedonian churches, that Titus should be desired to go on this business; and besides the thing had been begun, and it would be scandalous not to finish it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6">2 Corinthians 8:6</span> and next the apostle argues from their abounding in the exercise of other graces, which he enumerates, that they would also in this, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:7">2 Corinthians 8:7</span> for to excel in one grace, and not in another, was not to their praise and honour; however, he did not urge them to this in an imperious way, and to show and exercise his authority; but was moved unto it through the generous example of others, and that there might be a proof of their sincere love and affection to the Lord, and to his people, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:8">2 Corinthians 8:8</span> but as what he wisely judged would have the greatest weight with them; he proposes to them the example of Christ, and instances in his great love to them; who though was rich became poor for them, that they might be enriched through his poverty, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:9">2 Corinthians 8:9</span> and therefore should freely contribute to his poor saints. Moreover, inasmuch as the apostle did not take upon him to command, only give advice, he should be regarded; and that the rather because what he advised to was expedient for them, would be for their good, and be profitable to them; as well as prevent reproach and scandal, which would follow should they not finish what they had begun so long ago, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:10">2 Corinthians 8:10</span> wherefore he exhorts them cheerfully to perform what they had shown a readiness to; and points out unto them the rule and measure of it, that it should be out of their own, what they were possessed of, and according to their ability; which be it more or less would be acceptable to God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:11">2 Corinthians 8:11</span> for his meaning was not that some should be eased and others burdened; but that all should communicate according to what they had, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:13">2 Corinthians 8:13</span> to which he stimulates them from the hope of the recompence of reward, whenever it should be otherwise with them than it was, and things should change both with them who communicated, and with them to whom they communicated; or this was the end proposed by the apostle, that in the issue there might be an equality between them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:14">2 Corinthians 8:14</span> which he confirms and illustrates by the distribution of the manna to the Israelites, who had an equal measure, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:15">2 Corinthians 8:15</span> as appears from what is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:18">Exodus 16:18</span> next the apostle enters upon a commendation of the messengers, that were appointed and ordered to be sent to them upon this errand, and begins with Titus; and gives thanks to God, that had put it into his heart to be so solicitous about this matter, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:16">2 Corinthians 8:16</span> and praises him for his forwardness in undertaking it of his own accord, and in performing it without being urged to it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:17">2 Corinthians 8:17</span> and next he commends another person, whose name is not mentioned, who was sent along with him; a person of note and fame in all the churches, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:18">2 Corinthians 8:18</span> and who had the honour to be chosen by the churches for this service, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:19">2 Corinthians 8:19</span> and the reason why more persons than one were sent, was to prevent any suspicion of converting the collections to wrong purposes; and to preserve and secure a good character, a character of honesty before God and men, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:20">2 Corinthians 8:20</span>. To these two a third was added, whose name also is not mentioned, and who had been proved to be a diligent man, and appeared more so in this matter upon the apostle's confidence in the Corinthians, that they would readily attend to the service these were sent to promote, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:22">2 Corinthians 8:22</span> and thus having separately given the characters of these men, they are all of them commended again; Titus, as the apostle's partner and fellow helper; and the other brethren as the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23">2 Corinthians 8:23</span> and the chapter is concluded with an exhortation to the members of the church at Corinth, to give these messengers a proof of their love to the poor saints before all the churches, and make it appear that he had not boasted of them in vain, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:24">2 Corinthians 8:24</span>. </p>
