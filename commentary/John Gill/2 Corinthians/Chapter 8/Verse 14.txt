<p><strong>But by an equality</strong>,.... All that he meant was, that there might be an equality both in givers and receivers, proportioned to their several circumstances and stations of life:</p>
<p><strong>that now at this time</strong>; which was a very necessitous time at Jerusalem, there being a famine there, and their common stock exhausted:</p>
<p><strong>your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want</strong>; which respects either the different abilities of givers at different times; and that whereas now the church at Corinth was rich, and wealthy, and had great abundance of the things of this world, they in this general collection were able to make up the deficiencies of other churches; and so should it ever be their case, as it might be, that they should be reduced, and these other churches increased, and enjoy a large abundance, they might hereafter in their turn supply what would be wanting in them: or else the persons given to; and the sense is, that should they ever change circumstances, as it was not impossible that they that were now rich should become poor, and they that were poor become rich; then as their abundance had been a supply to the wants of others, the abundance of others in their turn would be a supply to their wants; so that the argument is taken from the hope of retribution, in case of such vicissitudes; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:38">Luke 6:38</span> his view was,</p>
<p><strong>that there may be equality</strong>; either that in time to come an equal return may be made, should it be necessary; or that at present some sort of equality might be observed between the rich and poor; that the rich should so distribute as not to leave themselves without a proper support, according to their station of life; and yet so freely communicate, that the poor may not be without food and raiment, suitable to their lower sphere of life.</p>
