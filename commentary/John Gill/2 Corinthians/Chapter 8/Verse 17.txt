<p><strong>For indeed, he accepted the exhortation</strong>,.... The Macedonians besought the apostle with much entreaty to give unto him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:4">2 Corinthians 8:4</span> or which being moved by their example, they gave unto him, namely, that he would go and finish what he had already begun; and accordingly he did not refuse, but readily accepted the exhortation: yea, not only so,</p>
<p><strong>but being more forward</strong>; than was known or could have been expected; which shows that this was put into his heart by God, before it was moved unto him; so that if he had never been asked, or exhorted hereunto, he would have gone of himself:</p>
<p><strong>of his own accord he went unto you</strong>; so great is his care of you; so great his love unto you so willing was he to come again and pay another visit: and especially on this account, where he had before been treated with so much respect and kindness. Titus having been at Corinth already, and being well known there, the apostle forbears saying anything more in his commendation.</p>
