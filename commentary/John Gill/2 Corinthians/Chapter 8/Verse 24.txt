<p><strong>Wherefore show ye to them, and before the churches</strong>,.... This is the conclusion of the apostle, upon summing up the characters of these messengers; and his exhortation is, that since they were persons of so much note and worth, as they ought to be received with great marks of respect and affection, so they would take care evidently to make it appear to them who were sent by the churches, and before the churches, or before them who represented the churches; or so as that it might be known by the churches from whence they came, when they returned with their report; or be evident to the churches in Judea, when their liberality should be brought to them:</p>
<p><strong>the proof of your love</strong>; to Christ and his poor members, how hearty and sincere it was:</p>
<p><strong>and of our boasting on your behalf</strong>; how willing and forward they were to this good work, and how liberal they would be.</p>
