<p>INTRODUCTION TO 2 CORINTHIANS 9</p>
<p>The apostle proceeds in this chapter upon the same subject, the making a collection for the poor saints; gives the reason why he sent the brethren to them on this account; directs to the manner in which this service should be performed, and subjoins some fresh arguments to encourage them to it. As for the ministration itself, he suggests, it might seem needless to say any more about it, since he had said so much already in the preceding chapter, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:1">2 Corinthians 9:1</span> and especially seeing they were so forward to it, and were even prepared for it a year ago; of which the apostle had boasted to the Macedonian churches, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:2">2 Corinthians 9:2</span> and whereas it might be objected, that since there was such an inclination in them to this good work, why did he send these brethren to them? the reason of this he gives, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:3">2 Corinthians 9:3</span> that they might get their collection ready against the time he came, lest should any of the Macedonians come along with him, and this collection not be made, his glorying of them would be in vain, and both he and they would be ashamed; wherefore he sent them before hand to prevent everything of this kind, and that their collection might appear to be not done in a covetous niggardly way, but bountifully and cheerfully, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:5">2 Corinthians 9:5</span> which manner he directs unto, and encourages from the advantages of it, under the metaphorical phrases of sowing and reaping, intimating, that as a man sows, so he reaps; or in proportion to his giving, is he blessed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:6">2 Corinthians 9:6</span> wherefore he advises to give heartily, freely, and cheerfully, and that from this consideration, because cheerful giving is acceptable to God, being like himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:7">2 Corinthians 9:7</span> who, as he loves, so he rewards the cheerful giver; and as he is able to give him abundance, so he does, whereby he is more qualified and fitted for such liberal service, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:8">2 Corinthians 9:8</span>. And this is confirmed by a passage of Scripture cited out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+112:9">Psalms 112:9</span> showing, that he that gives bountifully to the poor is ever regarded by the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:9">2 Corinthians 9:9</span> and which is further proved from the general course of Providence, which so multiplies and increases the seed sown in the earth, that it usually ministers seed to the sower, and bread to the eater; to which the apostle had alluded in the use of these metaphorical expressions; or he puts up a prayer that there might, or delivers out a promise that there would be a like increase in giving liberally, as in sowing plentifully, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:10">2 Corinthians 9:10</span>. And then he makes use of a new argument, stirring up to bountifulness, taken from the glory which is brought to God through thanksgiving to him, from the poor and needy, supplied by the liberality of those whose hearts he had opened, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:11">2 Corinthians 9:11</span>. On which argument he enlarges, showing, that not only by this bounty the wants of the poor are supplied, and thanksgivings offered up to God on that account; but also the poor saints are led to glorify God for sending his Gospel to these their benefactors, and giving them his grace to submit unto it, which had had such an influence upon them as to cause them to communicate to their necessities in such a generous manner, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:12">2 Corinthians 9:12</span>. To which he adds another argument, taken from the prayers of the poor saints, for those who liberally contributed to them, that they might prosper in body and soul, in things temporal and spiritual, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:14">2 Corinthians 9:14</span>. And the chapter is concluded with a thanksgiving to God for the grace bestowed upon all the churches, and particularly for the gift of Christ to the sons of men; which contains in it another argument for beneficence and liberality, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:15">2 Corinthians 9:15</span>. </p>
