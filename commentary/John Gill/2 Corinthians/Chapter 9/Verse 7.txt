<p><strong>Every man according as he purposeth in his heart</strong>,.... Which is not to be understood of the quantity, or any set sum he has fixed upon in his mind to give; but of the quality or nature of giving; or of the manner in which he is to give:</p>
<p><strong>so let him give</strong>; of his own will and free choice, from his very heart; not as directed and forced by others, but according to his own counsel and determination:</p>
<p><strong>not grudgingly</strong>; or not of grief; with pain and uneasiness of mind, grieving at parting with what is given, reflecting on the persons that move him to it, or on the objects moved for. The Jews g reckon this the lowest degree of all in giving alms; "when a man gives to anyone" בעצב, "with grief", to which the apostle seems to refer: who adds,</p>
<p><strong>or of necessity</strong>; of force, by coaction, being obliged to it by the influence, example, or commands of superiors; or through the powerful motives, or prevailing entreaties of others; for without these, men, according to their abilities, should give of themselves freely and liberally:</p>
<p><strong>for God loveth a cheerful giver</strong>; or one that gives בסבר פנים יפות, "with a cheerful countenance", as the Jews h say; or as elsewhere i, "with a cheerful heart": their rule is this,</p>
<p>"he that doth the commandment, i.e. alms, let him do it</p>
<p>בלב שמח, "with a cheerful heart".''</p>
<p>Who looks pleasantly on the person or persons that move him to it, or on the object to whom he gives; who parts with his money willingly, and takes delight in doing good to others; such givers God loves: not that their cheerful beneficence is the cause of his special peculiar love to them in his own heart, which arises from nothing in man, or done by him; but the meaning is, that God does well to such persons; shows his love to them; he lets them know how kindly he takes such acts of theirs, by prospering and succeeding them in their worldly affairs. In the Septuagint in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+22:8">Proverbs 22:8</span> are these words, "God blesses a cheerful man, and a giver", which the apostle refers to.</p>
