<p><strong>As it is written</strong>,.... In <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+112:9">Psalms 112:9</span> where it is said of the good and righteous man,</p>
<p><strong>he hath dispersed</strong> ממוניה, "his riches", his substance, as the Chaldee paraphrase adds by way of explanation; not in a profuse extravagant manner, but with wisdom and prudence, and yet largely and liberally, according to his ability. Just as the sower scatters his seed here, and there, and in every place, with an open and wide hand, to the good man distributes to all in necessity, and makes them all partakers of his bounty; he gives not only to one, but to many, and not to all without distinction he meets with, whether necessitous or not:</p>
<p><strong>he hath given to the poor</strong>. This explains the former phrase, and points out the persons, the objects of the good man's bounty and compassion:</p>
<p><strong>his righteousness remaineth for ever</strong>. This is not to be understood of his justifying righteousness, as if that consisted of, and was established upon his works of bounty and charity to the poor; nor of his fame among men on account of his liberality; nor of any reward in another world; but of his beneficence itself, it being common with the Jews to call alms צדקה, "righteousness":</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+112:9- :">Psalms 112:9- :</span> and the sense is, that what such a man bestows in charity on the poor shall not be lost, but shall be like the seed cast into the earth, shall spring up again, and bring forth fruit with increase, according to what follows.</p>
