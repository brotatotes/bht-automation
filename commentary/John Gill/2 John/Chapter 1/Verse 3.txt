<p><strong>Grace be with you, mercy [and] peace</strong>,.... This form of salutation, or wish and prayer for the blessings mentioned,</p>
<p><strong>from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ</strong>, is the same used by other apostles; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:2">1 Timothy 1:2</span> and</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:2- :">1 Timothy 1:2- :</span>. Only it is added here with respect to Christ, that he is</p>
<p><strong>the Son of the Father in truth and love</strong>; which is mentioned by the apostle to confirm the deity of Christ, which is plainly implied in wishing for the above things equally from him, as from the Father; and to oppose and confront some heretics of those times, who denied the true and proper sonship of Christ; and therefore he calls him, "the Son of the Father", the only begotten of the Father; and that "in truth", or truly and properly, and not in a figurative and metaphorical sense, as magistrates are called the sons of God, and children of the most High, by reason of their office; but so is not Christ, he is God's own Son, in a true, proper, and natural sense: and he is so "in love"; he is his well beloved Son, his dear Son, the Son of his love; as he cannot otherwise be; since he is not only the image of him, but of the same nature, and has the same perfections with him.</p>
