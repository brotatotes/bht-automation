<p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO II PETER 1</strong></p>
<p>In this chapter, after the inscription and salutation, the apostle takes notice of gifts of grace bestowed; and exhorts to the exercise of holiness and good works; and gives the reasons why he was so pressing to them; and endeavours to establish the saints in the Gospel that had been preached among them. In the inscription, the writer of the epistle describes himself by his names, the one given him by his parents, the other by his Lord and master, and by his character and office; and the persons to whom he writes are described as having faith, and that of the same kind with the apostles, and which they obtained through the righteousness of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1">2 Peter 1:1</span>. The salutation is the same with that in the former epistle, only here is added a wish for an increase of divine knowledge, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:2">2 Peter 1:2</span> and which might be expected, since, by the power of living grace, everything necessary to a spiritual and godly life bad been given them in the effectual calling, through the knowledge of Christ; even exceeding great and precious promises, whereby they partook of the divine nature, and escaped the vices which prevailed in the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:3">2 Peter 1:3</span> upon which he exhorts not to rest where they were, but to go on in the exercise of grace, and performance of duties, many of which he enumerates, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5">2 Peter 1:5</span> to enforce which he adds several arguments, as that through an abounding in these things they would appear not to have a superficial and speculative knowledge of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:8">2 Peter 1:8</span> or otherwise it would be evident that they were blind and ignorant, and in an unrenewed state, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:9">2 Peter 1:9</span> whereas by these things they would make their calling and election sure and manifest to men, and would never fall totally and finally, and in the issue have an abundant entrance into the everlasting kingdom of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:10">2 Peter 1:10</span> and then he gives the reasons of his conduct, why he so much urged a regard to these things, and put them in mind of them; namely, the usefulness of them for their establishment, the duty of his office, which required it, the short time he had to live, and the profitableness of such exhortations to them, after his decease, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:12">2 Peter 1:12</span> and in order to establish them in the truths of the Gospel, and particularly in that which concerns the coming of Christ in power and glory, on which he enlarges in the latter part of this epistle; he observes, that this was not a cunningly devised fable, but was what he and others were eyewitnesses of, even of that which was an emblem and pledge of it; namely, the transfiguration of Christ on the mount, when they saw the glory he received from God his Father, and heard the voice from heaven which declared him to be his well beloved Son, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16">2 Peter 1:16</span>, and besides, they had a surer proof of the certainty of his coming; namely, the prophecies concerning it, which should be regarded and given heed to, being as a lamp to direct in the present state of darkness and imperfection, until the illustrious day of Christ's coming appears, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:19">2 Peter 1:19</span> and the rather this should be attended to, since no scriptural prophecy is an invention and device of men; nor was it formerly given out at the pleasure of men, but by saints, who were influenced and moved unto it by the Holy Ghost, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:20">2 Peter 1:20</span>. </p>
