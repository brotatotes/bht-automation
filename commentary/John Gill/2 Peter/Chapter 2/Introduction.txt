<p>INTRODUCTION TO II PETER 2</p>
<p>This chapter contains a description of false teachers, that were then in Christian churches, as there had been false prophets among the Jews; and they are described by the doctrines, which they privily introduced; in general, damnable heresies; in particular, denying the Lord that bought them; and by their success, having many followers of them in their pernicious ways; and by the sad effects following hereupon; with respect to the way of truth, that was blasphemed; with respect to their hearers, they, through the covetousness of these false teachers, were made merchandise of; and with respect to themselves, swift and sure destruction would be brought upon them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>, which is illustrated and confirmed by the instances of punishment in the angels, the men of the old world, and the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:4">2 Peter 2:4</span> and whereas, in these instances, notice is taken of the deliverance of some righteous persons, as Noah and Lot, when wicked men were destroyed; the apostle draws this conclusion from the whole, that the Lord knows both how to deliver the saints out of afflictions, and to reserve wicked men until the day of judgment, then to be punished, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:9">2 Peter 2:9</span>, especially such shall be then punished, who are described by their impure course of lift, their contempt of civil government, and their presumption and selfwill, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:10">2 Peter 1:10</span> which sins of theirs are aggravated by the different conduct of angels, superior to them; and by their being like brute beasts, as ignorant as they, and even below them; whose punishment will be to perish in their corruption, as the just reward of their unrighteousness, since they are open in sin, take pleasure in it, and sport themselves with it, and are spots and blemishes in Christian societies, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:11">2 Peter 2:11</span> and these, who are no other than the false teachers before spoken of, are further described by their adulterous eyes, which cannot cease from sin; by their beguiling unstable souls; by the covetous practices their hearts were exercised with; by their just desert, cursed children; by the course they steer, forsaking the right way, going astray from it, and following the way of Balaam in his covetousness, and other wicked practices, for which he was reproved by his ass; and by various metaphors, which express the emptiness of these persons, and which also point at their destruction, and describe their boasts and brags, and the influence they have, through their lasciviousness and uncleanness, on some persons, who have been outwardly reformed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:14">2 Peter 2:14</span> and this they obtain over them in a very stupid and senseless way, by promising them liberty, when through being overcome by them, and drawn into sin, they were brought into bondage, and become servants of corruption; and so their case is worse than it was before their reformation, and profession of religion; and better it would have been not to have had the knowledge they had, than after it to turn from the paths of truth and holiness, which is illustrated by a true Scripture proverb, which expresses the filthy nature of sin, the character of these men, and their irrecoverable state and condition, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:19">2 Peter 2:19</span>. </p>
