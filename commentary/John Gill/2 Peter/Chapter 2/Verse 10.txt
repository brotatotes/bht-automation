<p><strong>But chiefly them that walk after the flesh</strong>,.... Not merely after the dictates of corrupt nature, as all men, and even God's elect do, in a state of unregeneracy; but "after strange flesh", as <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:7">Judges 1:7</span> expresses it, after the flesh of men:</p>
<p><strong>in the lust of uncleanness</strong>; not of fornication and adultery, but of sodomy, and sodomitical practices; sins exceeding great, not only contrary to the law and light of nature, but dishonourable to human nature; and are what prevail where idolatry, infidelity, errors, and heresies do; and which, as they are sins of the deepest dye, deserve the greater damnation, and are chiefly and more especially punished by God with great severity:</p>
<p><strong>and despise government</strong>: of parents, to whom these proud boasters and blasphemers are generally disobedient; and of masters, pretending it to be contrary to their Christian liberty; and of magistrates on the same account, and as being a restraint upon their lusts; which is to despise the ordinance of God, his representatives, and to introduce anarchy and confusion, and to open a door to all manner of sin; and also the government of Christ, as head of the church, and King of Zion, whom they will not have to reign over them, and therefore reject his laws, and submit not to his ordinances; and likewise the government of the world itself by God; and so the Ethiopic version renders it, "despise their Creator"; denying his omniscience and his providence, giving out that he neither sees, observes, and takes notice of what is done in the world; nor does he himself do either good or evil, or concern himself about what is done by men.</p>
<p><strong>Presumptuous [are they]</strong>; bold and daring, not fearing to speak against men of the most exalted character on earth, and against God himself in heaven; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+73:8">Psalms 73:8</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Selfwilled</strong>; pleased with themselves, and their own conceits, their dogmas and opinions, with their high sense and profound judgment; and being obstinate in their sentiments, and resolutely bent to retain and defend them.</p>
<p><strong>They are not afraid to speak evil of dignities</strong>; or "glories"; of the apostles, who were set in the first place in the church, and were the glory of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>; or of angels, styled thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers; or rather of civil magistrates, set in high places, and to whom glory and honour are due; which to do is contrary to the law of God, and of dangerous consequence, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:28">Exodus 22:28</span>.</p>
