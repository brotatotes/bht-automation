<p><strong>And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness</strong>,.... Due punishment, both in body and soul, for all their injustice to God and men; which will be a just recompense of reward they shall receive at the righteous judgment of God, who will render to every man according to his works: the justice of which appears by what follows,</p>
<p><strong>[as] they that count it pleasure to riot in the daytime</strong>; who place all their satisfaction and happiness in sensual delight, in rioting and drunkenness, in chambering and wantonness, day after day; putting away the evil day far from them, supposing that tomorrow will be as this day, and that there will be no future judgment nor state; and therefore do not take the night for their revels, as other sinners do, but being without all shame, declare their sin as Sodom, and hide it not:</p>
<p><strong>spots [they are], and blemishes</strong>; which defile themselves, their minds and consciences, their souls and bodies, with sin, and defile others by their evil communications, and bring dishonour and disgrace upon the ways, doctrines, and interest of Christ:</p>
<p><strong>sporting themselves with their own deceivings</strong>; with their sins and lusts, by which they deceive themselves and others, it being a sport to them to commit sin; and in which they take great pleasure and pastime, and not only delight in their own sins, but in those of others, and in them that do them. Some versions, as the Vulgate Latin and Arabic, instead of απαταις, "deceivings", read αγαπαις, love feasts, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:12">Judges 1:12</span>, and so the Alexandrian copy; in which they behaved in a very scandalous manner, indulging themselves in luxury and intemperance: to which agrees what follows,</p>
<p><strong>while they feast with you</strong>; at the above feasts, or at the Lord's table, or at their own houses, which shows that they were of them, and among them, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>; and carries in it a tacit reproof for the continuance of them, when they were become so bad in their principles, and so scandalous in their lives.</p>
