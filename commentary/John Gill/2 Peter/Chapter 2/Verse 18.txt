<p><strong>For when they speak great swelling [words] of vanity</strong>,.... Marvellous things against the God of gods, great things and blasphemies against God, his name, his tabernacle, and his saints; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:36">Daniel 11:36</span>; or against men, dominions, and dignities, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:10">2 Peter 2:10</span>; or it may design their self-applauses and vain glorying in themselves, and their empty boast of knowledge and learning; and also express the windiness of their doctrines, and the bombast style, and high flown strains of rhetoric in which they were delivered; as likewise the flattering titles they bestowed on men for the sake of their own worldly interest and advantage; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:16">Judges 1:16</span> and hereby</p>
<p><strong>they allure, through the lusts of the flesh, [through much] wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error</strong>: that is, from those who lived in the error of Heathenism or Judaism, from whom, and which, they were clean escaped; or truly, really, and entirely delivered, being fully convinced of the falsity thereof, and of the truth of the Christian religion; though some copies, as the Alexandrian, and two of Beza's, and two of Stephens's, read, not</p>
<p>οντως, "truly", but ολιγως, "a little"; and the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "a very little"; to which agrees the Complutensian edition; and the Syriac version renders it "in a few words", or "almost"; and according to the Ethiopic version, "a few persons" are designed; but be they more or less, and truly, or but a little, and for a little while, or almost, escaped from their former errors, in which they were brought up, and lived; yet by the carnal lusts and liberties, lasciviousness and wantonness, which these false teachers indulged, they were allured, ensnared, and drawn by them into their wicked principles and practices.</p>
