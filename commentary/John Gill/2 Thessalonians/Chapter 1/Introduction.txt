<p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO 2 THESSALONIANS 1</strong></p>
<p>This chapter, besides the inscription and salutation, contains a thanksgiving for the flourishing condition in which the graces of the Spirit were in these saints, and consolation for them under their suffering circumstances. The inscription and salutation are in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:1">2 Thessalonians 1:1</span> and are as usual: the thanksgiving is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:3">2 Thessalonians 1:3</span> for the growth of their faith, the abounding of their love, and their constant patience under persecutions and afflictions, insomuch that the apostle also gloried of them for these things among other churches, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:4">2 Thessalonians 1:4</span> and as an encouragement to them to continue patient under sufferings, he observes that this was a token of the righteous judgment of God, and that they were reckoned worthy of his kingdom for which they suffered, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:5">2 Thessalonians 1:5</span> and of which righteous judgment they might be assured, from the nature of God himself, whose justice required a retribution of vengeance to their persecutors, and rest to them with the apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:6">2 Thessalonians 1:6</span> the time of which rest and ease is pointed at, as that it will be at the coming of Christ; which is described by the place from whence he comes, heaven; by his retinue, his mighty angels; by the manner in which he shall come, in flaming fire; and by the vengeance he will execute: the objects of which are also described, by their ignorance of God, and by their disobedience to the Gospel of Christ; and by the nature of the punishment inflicted on them, which will lie in an expulsion from the presence, power, and glory of God, and in an everlasting destruction of soul and body, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:7">2 Thessalonians 1:7</span> but as for them, the persecuted saints, and which is mentioned for their comfort, Christ shall at this day be glorified and admired in them, and by them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:10">2 Thessalonians 1:10</span> wherefore the apostle prays for this perseverance of them, that the good work of faith might be performed in them, and they enjoy the glory they were called unto; and that Christ might be glorified in them, and they in him; not according to their works, but according to the grace of God through him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:11">2 Thessalonians 1:11</span>. </p>
