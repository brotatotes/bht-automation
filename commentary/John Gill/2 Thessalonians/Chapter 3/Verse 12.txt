<p><strong>Now them that are such</strong>,.... For this was not the case and character of them all. Did such practices generally obtain, no community, civil or religious, could subsist. And the apostle wisely distinguishes them from others, that the innocent might not be involved in the charge.</p>
<p><strong>We command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ</strong>; using both authority and entreaty; taking every way to reclaim them, commanding in the name of Christ and beseeching for the sake of Christ</p>
<p><strong>that with quietness they work</strong>: with their own hands, at their proper callings, and so support themselves, provide for their families, and have something to give to them that are in need; by which means they will live peaceable and quiet lives, in godliness and honesty, and not disturb the peace of neighbourhoods, churches, and families:</p>
<p><strong>and eat their own bread</strong>; got by their own labour, and bought with their money, and not the bread of others, or that of idleness.</p>
