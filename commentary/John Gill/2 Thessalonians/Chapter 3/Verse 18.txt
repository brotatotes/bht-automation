<p><strong>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</strong> This was the sign or token; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> The subscription to this epistle is, "The Second Epistle to the Thessalonians was written from Athens"; though it seems rather to be written from Corinth. In the Syriac version it is said,</p>
<p>"the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, which is written from Laodicea of Pisidia, and sent by the hands of Tychicus.''</p>
