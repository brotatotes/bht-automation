<p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO II TIMOTHY 1</strong></p>
<p>In this chapter, after the inscription and salutation, the apostle expresses his great affection for Timothy, and highly commends him; exhorts him to various things relating to his office, as a preacher of the Gospel; and concludes with taking notice of the kindness shown him by Onesiphorus. The inscription and salutation are in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:1">2 Timothy 1:1</span> and then follows the preface to the epistle, in which the apostle testifies his great love to Timothy, and commends him; by declaring his thankfulness to God, that he had reason always to remember him in his prayers; by his desire to see him again, who had shed so many tears for him, that his joy might be filled; and by taking notice of his unfeigned faith, the same with that which had dwelt in his ancestors, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:3">2 Timothy 1:3</span>. And then he proceeds to exhort him to the exercise and improvement of his ministerial gift; to show a fortitude of mind, and a manly spirit in the cause of Christ; and to suffer cheerfully for the sake of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span> and in order to animate and encourage him to the same, he gives a summary of the Gospel, as containing in it the great doctrines of salvation, and eternal life, according to the free grace of God through Jesus Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span> and observes, that he himself was appointed a preacher of it to the Gentiles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:11">2 Timothy 1:11</span> and instances in himself, as suffering for it, without being ashamed; and as having a strong confidence in Christ, as able to keep him, and what he had committed to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span> and then returns to his exhortation to Timothy to hold fast the Gospel of Christ; to which he urges him from the consideration of the nature and value of it, being a form of sound words, and that famous good thing, and of the means and manner in which he came to the knowledge of it; and chiefly from its being committed to him by the Holy Ghost, that dwelt in him; and also because of the general defection of the Asian professors from it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:13">2 Timothy 1:13</span> but he excepts one person, Onesiphorus by name, whom he commends for his kindness to him both at Ephesus and at Rome; and therefore entreats of the Lord mercy, both for him and his house, at the great day, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:16">2 Timothy 1:16</span>. </p>
