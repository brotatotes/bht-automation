<p><strong>Whereunto I am appointed a preacher</strong>,.... Both from eternity, in the counsel and purpose of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span> and in time, by the church at Antioch, and the prophets in it, according to the express order of the Holy Ghost, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2">Acts 13:2</span>. And if ever there was a preacher of the Gospel, Paul was one; he preached purely, powerfully, publicly, constantly, boldly, and with all faithfulness and integrity:</p>
<p><strong>and an apostle</strong>; that is, of the Gentiles, as follows, and as he elsewhere styles himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:13">Romans 11:13</span> for it does not run so smooth and easy to connect this with the word Gospel. In <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:1">2 Timothy 1:1</span>, he is called the apostle of Jesus Christ, because he was sent by him; and here the apostle of the Gentiles, because, he was sent to them; and this by the same appointment, by which he became a preacher:</p>
<p><strong>and a teacher of the Gentiles</strong>; though all the apostles, by their commission, were sent to teach all nations, or the Gentiles in the several parts of the world, as well as Jews; yet the apostle was eminently a teacher of them; his work chiefly lay among them; the Gospel of the uncircumcision, or the ministration of the Gospel to the uncircumcised Gentiles, was committed to him; and he was a teacher of them in faith and verity, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:7">1 Timothy 2:7</span>. The Alexandrian copy only reads, "and a teacher".</p>
