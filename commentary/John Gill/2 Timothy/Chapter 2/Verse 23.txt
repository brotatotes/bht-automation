<p><strong>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid</strong>,.... Such as have no solid wisdom in them, and are foreign from the Gospel, the wisdom of God in a mystery, and are not useful and unedifying; such ought to be avoided, publicly and privately; they should not be started in the public ministry, nor attended to in private conversation; as being unworthy of the notice of a minister of the Gospel wise and learned, and useless to the church, and to his hearers.</p>
<p><strong>Knowing that they do gender strife</strong>; about words, and contentions, which break the peace of churches, and hinder the profit of souls, and the progress of the Gospel.</p>
