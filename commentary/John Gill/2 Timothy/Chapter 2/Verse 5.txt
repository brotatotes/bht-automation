<p><strong>And if a man also strive for masteries</strong>,.... In the Olympic games, by running, wrestling, leaping, c.</p>
<p><strong>yet is he not crowned</strong> with a corruptible, fading crown, a crown made of herbs and leaves of trees, as parsley, laurel, c.</p>
<p><strong>except he strive lawfully</strong> according to the laws and rules fixed for those exercises; so no man that calls himself a Christian, minister, or any other, can expect the crown of life, the prize of the high calling of God, except he runs the race set before him, in the right way; looking to Christ, the mark, pressing through all difficulties, towards the prize, and holds on and out unto the end.</p>
