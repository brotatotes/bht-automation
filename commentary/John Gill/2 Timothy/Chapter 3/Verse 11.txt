<p><strong>Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch</strong>,.... In Pisidia; where the Jews that contradicted and blasphemed his doctrine, and envied his success, stirred up the chief of the city, both men and women, against him, and Barnabas; who persecuted them and expelled them out, of their coasts, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:45">Acts 13:45</span> and also at Iconium; where both Jews and Gentiles made an assault upon them, to use them ill, and stone them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:5">Acts 14:5</span> and likewise at Lystra; where the apostle was stoned, and drawn out of the city, and left for dead, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:19">Acts 14:19</span>. And these instances are the rather mentioned because they were done in those parts, where Timothy had lived, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span> and so knew the truth of these things, not only from the apostle's mouth, but from the testimonies of others; and perhaps he might have been a witness to some of them himself;</p>
<p><strong>what persecutions I endured</strong>: not only in the above places, but elsewhere; see a detail of them in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span>,</p>
<p><strong>but out of them all the Lord delivered me</strong>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:10">2 Corinthians 1:10</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:17">2 Timothy 4:17</span>, this he says to the glory of the grace and power of God, to whom he ascribes all his deliverances; and for the encouragement of Timothy, and other saints, under sufferings, who may hope and believe that the Lord will deliver them in his own time and way, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+34:19">Psalms 34:19</span>.</p>
