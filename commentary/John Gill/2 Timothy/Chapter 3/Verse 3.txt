<p><strong>Without natural affection</strong>,.... To parents, or children, or wife; parents thrusting their children into religious houses, cloisters, c. against their wills children leaving their parents without their knowledge or consent; married bishops and priests being obliged to quit their wives, and declare their children spurious; with many other such unnatural actions.</p>
<p><strong>Trucebreakers</strong>; or covenant breakers; stirring up princes to break through their treaties and covenants with one another; dissolving the allegiance of subjects to their sovereigns, and moving them to rebellion against them; loosing the marriage bond between husband and wife; making void all oaths, contracts, and agreements, among men, which stand in the way of their designs; teaching that no faith is to be kept with heretics.</p>
<p><strong>False accusers</strong>; or devils, being like Satan, the accuser of the brethren, charging all that depart from their communion with schism and heresy.</p>
<p><strong>Incontinent</strong>; though they pretend to the gift of continency, yet give themselves up to all lasciviousness, and work all uncleanness with greediness; or "intemperate" in eating and drinking, indulging themselves in rioting and drunkenness: "she hath lived deliciously", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:7">Revelation 18:7</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Fierce</strong>; like beasts of prey; such was Rome Pagan, in the times of the ten persecutions; and such has been Rome Papal, exercising the greatest cruelties and barbarities on the saints, being drunk with their blood.</p>
<p><strong>Despisers of those that are good</strong>; or without love to good; both to good works, to which they are reprobate, notwithstanding all their pretensions to them, and bluster about them; and to good men, whom they hate.</p>
