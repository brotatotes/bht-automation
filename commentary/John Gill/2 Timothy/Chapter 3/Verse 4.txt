<p><strong>Traitors</strong>,.... To their princes and sovereigns, whose deaths they have contrived and compassed, and whom they have assassinated and murdered; and have been betrayers of the secrets of persons, which they have come at by auricular confession to them; and of their best and nearest friends, to preserve and secure themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Heady</strong>; rash, daring, bold, and impudent, fit to say and do any thing, though ever so vile and wicked.</p>
<p><strong>High, minded</strong>; puffed and swelled up with a vain conceit of themselves, and speaking great swelling words of vanity;</p>
<p><strong>lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God</strong>; lovers of sinful pleasures, or the pleasures of sin, which are but for a season, and not God; serving divers lusts and pleasures, and not God; making a god of their belly; sensual idolaters, delighting themselves in their carnal lusts, and not in the service of God.</p>
