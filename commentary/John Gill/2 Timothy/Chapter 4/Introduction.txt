<p>INTRODUCTION TO II TIMOTHY 4</p>
<p>In this chapter the apostle charges Timothy to perform his office as an evangelist with great diligence, constancy, and faithfulness, with reasons for it; gives some hints of several particular persons mentioned, which made him very desirous that Timothy would come quickly to him; relates how things were with him when he made his first defence at Rome; and concludes the epistle with salutations, and his usual blessing. The charge is made in the most solemn manner in the sight of God; and of Christ, as Judge of quick and dead; and directs to the several parts of the ministerial work, and the manner in which they should be performed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:1">2 Timothy 4:1</span>. The reason of which charge is, because the time was hastening on that sound doctrine would not be endured, and men would depart from the truth to fables and false teachers, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:3">2 Timothy 4:3</span>. Wherefore the apostle repeats his charge and exhortation to Timothy, though in other words, to be vigilant, patient, courageous, and faithful in the discharge of his office, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:5">2 Timothy 4:5</span> adding a fresh reason moving to it, taken from the apostle's death being at hand; which is expressed by a sacrifice, and by a departure out of the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:6">2 Timothy 4:6</span> which leads him to give an account of his past conduct in fighting the good fight, finishing his course, and keeping the faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:7">2 Timothy 4:7</span> and of his firm belief of eternal glory and happiness, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span> and next he desires Timothy to use all diligence to come quickly to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:9">2 Timothy 4:9</span> his reasons for which were, because he had scarce anybody with him: one had forsook him through love of the world; another was gone to Thessalonica; a third to Galatia, and a fourth to Dalmatia; only Luke the evangelist was with him; and as for Tychicus, he had sent him to Ephesus: he therefore desires he would bring Mark with him, and his cloak, books, and parchments he had left at Troas, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:10">2 Timothy 4:10</span> and then takes notice of persons that had used him ill, particularly Alexander the coppersmith; he wishes justice might be done him; and advises Timothy to beware of him, because of his opposition to the doctrines of the Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:14">2 Timothy 4:14</span> and also of others that neglected him, who forsook him when he defended himself: however, he prays that this might not be charged upon them; and observes the goodness of God in standing by him and delivering him; and expresses his faith and confidence that he should be delivered and preserved safe to eternal glory, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:16">2 Timothy 4:16</span> and next follow the apostle's salutations of some persons at Ephesus, and an account of two others, one at Corinth, and another at Miletum; and a repetition of his request to Timothy, to come quickly to him, and before winter; and then some salutations of persons at Rome, sent by Timothy; and the whole is concluded with the apostle's usual benediction, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:19">2 Timothy 4:19</span>. </p>
