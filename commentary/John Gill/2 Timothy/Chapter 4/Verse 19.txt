<p><strong>Salute Prisca and Aquila</strong>,.... The same with Priscilla and Aquila: and so the Complutensian edition, and some copies, read here; who were of the same occupation with the apostle, and with whom he wrought at Corinth, and whom he left at Ephesus; and who seem by this salutation to have continued there, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And the household of Onesiphorus</strong>: who also lived at Ephesus, and whose kindness to the apostle, when he was at Rome, is before mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:16">2 Timothy 1:16</span>.</p>
