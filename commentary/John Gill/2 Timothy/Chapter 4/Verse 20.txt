<p><strong>Erastus abode at Corinth</strong>,.... He was chamberlain of that city, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span> who being sent along with Timothy into Macedonia, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span> very probably went from thence into Achaia, to Corinth, his native place, where he stayed.</p>
<p><strong>But Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick</strong>. Trophimus was an Asian, of the city of Ephesus, the same that is spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>. Some say he suffered martyrdom the same day the Apostle Paul did; but others say, that after that time he was bishop of Arles in France. This man went with the apostle into Asia, and from thence to Jerusalem, and came along with him in his voyage to Rome, but falling sick by the way, was left at Miletum. Some, instead of Miletum, would read Melita, that being the island Paul, and the ship's company, escaped to, when they were shipwrecked, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:1">Acts 28:1</span> here it is supposed Trophimus was left sick. Others have observed, that there was a city called Miletus in the island of Crete, under which Paul sailed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:7">Acts 27:7</span>, see footnote j, and is the place intended; but there is no need to suppose either of these; no doubt Miletum, near to Ephesus, is meant; and as the apostle sailed by the coast of Asia, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:7">Acts 27:7</span>, on which shore Miletum was, there is no difficulty in supposing him put ashore there. The Alexandrian copy reads "Melotus".</p>
