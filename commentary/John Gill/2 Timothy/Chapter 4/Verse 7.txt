<p><strong>I have fought a good fight</strong>,.... The fight of faith; the same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:10">1 Timothy 6:10</span></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:10- :">1 Timothy 6:10- :</span>:</p>
<p><strong>I have finished my course</strong>, or race; the race of life set before him, his course of years; his days were extinct, the grave was ready for him, and he for that; his last sands were dropping, and he was just going the way of all flesh; or else he means the course of his ministry, which he desired to finish with joy, and was now finishing;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:25">Acts 13:25</span> he was now got to the end of his line, to Rome, where he was to be a martyr for Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:11">Acts 23:11</span> so that he now concluded his work was done, and his warfare accomplished:</p>
<p><strong>I have kept the faith</strong>; by which he means, not so much the grace of faith, that was kept by Christ, the object, author, and finisher of it, and through his effectual grace and powerful intercession; but rather the profession of faith, which he had held fast without wavering; and chiefly the doctrine of faith, which was committed to his trust, which he had kept pure and incorrupt against all opposition; unless his faithfulness and integrity in the ministerial work should be thought rather to be intended; and which sense is favoured by the Syriac and Ethiopic versions, which render it, "I have kept my faith"; or have been faithful to my trust, as a good steward of the mysteries of God; not concealing and keeping back any thing that was profitable, but declaring the whole counsel of God; and now what remained for him was the crown of righteousness; and this he says for the comfort and encouragement and imitation of Timothy and others. The phrase seems to be Jewish; it is said y by the Jews, that he that does not keep the feast of unleavened bread, is as he who does not נטיר מהימנותא, "keep the faith of the holy blessed God".</p>
