<p>Ver. 1. <strong>The elder unto the well beloved Gaius</strong>,.... The elder is the writer of the epistle, the Apostle John, who so styles himself on account of his age, and office, as in the preceding epistle. The person to whom he writes is "the well beloved Gaius"; not that Gaius, who was the Apostle Paul's host, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span>, for though their characters agree, being both hospitable men, yet neither the place nor time in which they lived. The Apostle Paul's Gaius lived at Corinth, this is in some place near to Ephesus, for the apostle in his old age purposed to come and see him shortly; the other was contemporary with Paul, this with John; there were thirty or forty years difference between them: besides, the Corinthian Gaius was baptized by Paul, and was doubtless one of his spiritual children, or converts, whereas this Gaius was one of the Apostle John's spiritual children, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:4">3 John 1:4</span>; nor does he seem to be the same with Gaius of Macedonia, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span>, or with Gaius of Derbe, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>, who seem to be two different persons by their country, though both companions in travel of the Apostle Paul; for which reason, as well as the time of their living, neither of them can be this Gaius, who was a settled housekeeper, and resided at some certain place. His name is a Roman name, and the same with Caius, though he seems to have been a Jew, as he might, it being usual with the Jews in other countries to take Gentile names. His character is, that he was "well beloved"; that is, of God, as it appears he was from the grace bestowed on him, from the prosperous estate of his soul, and from the truth that was in him, and his walking in it; and of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the same reasons; and also of all the brethren and saints that knew him; he being a person not only truly gracious, and of faithfulness and integrity, but of great liberality and beneficence, which must gain him much love and esteem among them; and he was well beloved by the Apostle John; and so the Syriac version renders it, "to my beloved Gaius": though his love to him is expressed in the following clause,</p>
<p><strong>whom I love in the truth</strong>; as being in it, or for the sake of it, or truly and sincerely; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4- :">Acts 20:4- :</span>.</p>
