<p><strong>Demetrius hath good report of all [men]</strong>, This man was of a quite different cast from Diotrephes, and therefore the apostle makes mention of him to Gaius, to be followed by him, and not the other; he was either the same with Demas, which is a contraction of this name, or the person that John sent from Ephesus with this letter: we read of an Ephesian of this name, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:24">Acts 19:24</span>; though not the same person; or else one that also was a member of the same church with Gaius and Diotrephes; and he being kind and beneficent, obtained a good report of the generality of men, not only of the brethren, but of those that were without; for a liberal man is universally respected. The Syriac version adds, "and of the church itself"; as distinct from all men, or the generality of the men of the world:</p>
<p><strong>and of the truth itself</strong>; that is, whoever speaks truth must give him a good character, for this cannot be understood with any propriety of the Gospel, nor of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p><strong>yea, and we also bear record</strong>; or a testimony to the character of Demetrius; that is, I, John, the apostle, and the saints at Ephesus:</p>
<p><strong>and ye know that our record is true</strong>; faithful, and to be depended upon. The Alexandrian copy, and several others, read, "thou knowest", as does also the Vulgate Latin version, which seems most agreeable, since this epistle is directed to a single person; compare this with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:35">John 19:35</span>; and it will give a further proof of this epistle being the Apostle John's.</p>
