<p><strong>And they appointed two</strong>,.... The motion made by Peter was attended to by the whole company; they approved of it, and accordingly proposed two persons by name; one of which was to be chosen, not by the apostles, but by the whole assembly. The Arabic version reads, "he appointed two", as if Peter singly did this: contrary to all copies, and other versions, and to the context; which shows, that the whole body of the people were concerned in this affair, who prayed and gave forth their lots and suffrages: the persons nominated were,</p>
<p><strong>Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias</strong>. The former of these has three names; in one ancient copy of Beza's he is called Joses; and by some thought to be the same with Joses, surnamed Barnabas, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:36">Acts 4:36</span> partly because in one copy, and in the Syriac version there, that Joses is called Joseph; and partly, because of the nearness in sound between Barsabas and Barnabas: hence the Ethiopic version here reads, "Joseph, who was called Barnabas", and so Beza's most ancient copy; but though Joses is here meant for Jose, or Joses is, with the Jews, an abbreviation of Joseph; yet not Joses the Levite, who was of the country of Cyprus, but Joses of Galilee, the son of Alphaeus and Mary; and who had two brothers, James and Jude, already apostles; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:55">Matthew 13:55</span>. Moreover, though the two names, Barnabas and Barsabas, differ little in sound, yet much in sense: the former is interpreted "the son of consolation", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:36">Acts 4:36</span> but the latter signifies much the same with Bathsheba; as that may be interpreted "the daughter", this "the son of an oath"; or as others, "a son of wisdom"; and by others, "the son of fulness"; I should choose to take it to be the same name with</p>
<p>בר סבא, and interpret it, "the son of an old man"; as Alphaeus might be, when Joses, or Joseph was born, and he be the younger brother of James and Jude; as for his surname Justus, this was a name not only in use among the Grecians and Romans, especially the latter, but among the Jews: hence we often read of Rabbi יוסטא, "Justa", and sometimes, יוסטי, "Justi", and at other times, יוסטאי "Justai" x whether he had this surname from his being a very just man, as Aristides was called Aristides the just; and so Simeon the high priest, the last of Ezra's great synagogue, was called Simeon the just y; and so James the brother of this Joseph, or Joses, was called by the Jews z; and it may be, that he himself might have his name from the patriarch Joseph, who used to be called by them, Joseph, הצדיק, "the just" a: for Matthias, his name is Jewish, and he was no doubt a Jew; hence we read רבי מתיא, "Rabbi Matthia ben Charash" b; his name signifying the same as Nathanael does, namely, the gift of God, made Dr. Lightfoot conjecture they might be the same; but this agrees not with another conjecture that learned man, who elsewhere thinks, that Bartholomew and Nathanael were the same; and if so, he must have been an apostle already; Clemens of Alexandria was of opinion, that this Matthias was Zacchaeus c.</p>
