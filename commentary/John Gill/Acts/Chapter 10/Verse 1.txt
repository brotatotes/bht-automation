<p><strong>There was a certain man in Caesarea</strong>,.... This was the Caesarea formerly called Strato's tower, not Caesarea Philippi; for the former, and not the latter, lay near Joppa:</p>
<p><strong>called Cornelius</strong>; which was a Roman name, and he himself was a Roman or an Italian:</p>
<p><strong>a centurion of the band called the Italian band</strong>; which consisted of soldiers collected out of Italy, from whence the band took its name, in which Cornelius was a centurion, having a hundred men under him, as the name of his office signifies.</p>
