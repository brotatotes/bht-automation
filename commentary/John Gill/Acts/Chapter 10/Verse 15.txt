<p><strong>And the voice spake unto him again the second time</strong>,.... The following words,</p>
<p><strong>what God hath cleansed</strong>; that is, hath pronounced clean and lawful to be used, as he now had all sorts of food, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:11">Matthew 15:11</span>.</p>
<p><strong>[that] call not thou common</strong>; or pronounce it to be unholy or unclean, and unlawful to be used: and the same holds good of men, as well as things; for as hereby the Lord instructed Peter, that there was nothing of itself common, or unclean, and unfit for use; so that no man, not any Gentile, Barbarian, Scythian, or be he who he would, was common or unclean, and his company to be avoided as such. Distinctions both of men and meats were now to be laid aside; and the Jews themselves own, that what is now unclean, will be clean in the time to come, or the times of the Messiah; they say f,</p>
<p>"every beast which is unclean in this world, <strong>the holy blessed God</strong> מטהר אותה, <strong>cleanses it</strong>, in the time to come, (the times of the Messiah,) as they were at first clean to the sons of Noah <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:3">Genesis 9:3</span>, wherefore, as the herb was clean to all, and as the beasts were clean to the sons of Noah; so also in the time to come he will loose what he has bound, or forbidden.''</p>
<p>And particularly they observe, that a swine is call הזיר from הזר, "to return", because the Lord will return it unto Israel. g</p>
