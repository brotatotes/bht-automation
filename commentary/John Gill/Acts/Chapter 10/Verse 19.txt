<p>Ver. 19 <strong>While Peter thought on the vision</strong>,.... Which greatly amused him, affected his mind, and employed his thoughts what should be the meaning and design of it:</p>
<p><strong>the Spirit said unto him</strong>; the holy Spirit of God, either by an articulate voice, or by making an impulse on his mind;</p>
<p><strong>behold, three men seek thee</strong>; the Arabic version leaves out the word "three": the Spirit of God is omniscient, and knows all things; if the deep things of God, then much more man, and the things of man.</p>
