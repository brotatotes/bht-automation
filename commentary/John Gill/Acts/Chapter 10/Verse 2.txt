<p><strong>A devout man</strong>,.... A truly religious person, who had forsaken the Roman idolatry and superstition, in which he was brought up:</p>
<p><strong>and one that feared God</strong>: the one only living and true God, the God of Israel; he had the fear of God wrought in his heart, which is a part of the covenant of grace, a blessing of it, and the beginning of wisdom; he was truly a gracious man, a converted person, and who from an internal principle worshipped God externally:</p>
<p><strong>with all his house</strong>; he brought up his family in a religious way, as every good man should; and which was very remarkable in a Gentile, a soldier, and an officer:</p>
<p><strong>which gave much alms to the people</strong>; to the Jews that dwelt at Caesarea, and therefore was of good report among them, and much beloved by them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:22">Acts 10:22</span> he had regard to both tables of the law, both to the worship of God, and the love of the neighbour: and prayed to God always; every day, at the usual times of prayer; prayed privately in his closet, and with his family, as well as attended public service of this kind.</p>
