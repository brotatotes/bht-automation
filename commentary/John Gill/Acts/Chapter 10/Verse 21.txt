<p><strong>Then Peter went down to the men</strong>,.... The Ethiopic version adds, "from the third floor"; to the place where the men were: the following clause,</p>
<p><strong>which were sent unto him from Cornelius</strong>, is not in Beza's most ancient copy, nor in the Alexandrian copy, nor in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions:</p>
<p><strong>and said, behold, I am he whom ye seek</strong>; without being called by any of the family he came down, and without being informed in that way who the men were inquiring for; it being suggested to him by the Spirit of God, he declared himself to be the person they were seeking after: and put this question to them,</p>
<p><strong>what is the cause wherefore ye are come</strong>? for that was not intimated to him by the Spirit; it was only told him there were three men seeking him, and he was bid to go with them, without any scruple or hesitation; but what they came for, or he was to go with them about, was not suggested.</p>
