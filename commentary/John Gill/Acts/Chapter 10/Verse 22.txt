<p><strong>And they said, Cornelius, the centurion</strong>,.... A certain person, by name Cornelius, a Roman or Italian, as his name shows, and by office a "centurion", that was over an hundred soldiers: a just man; before God, and in his sight, through the imputation of Christ's righteousness to him; and who was a new man, created in righteousness and true holiness; and lived soberly, righteously, and godly, and did justice between man and man; and so was just in the sight of men, which was very rare in a Gentile, and in a soldier:</p>
<p><strong>and one that feareth God</strong>; the true God, the God of Israel, and worshipped him, both internally and externally; for both sorts of worship are included in the fear of God:</p>
<p><strong>and of good report among all the nation of the Jews</strong>; that knew any thing of him, especially at Caesarea, where many Jews, and even many of their most celebrated doctors lived: and this is the rather observed, to induce Peter, a Jew, to go along with them to him, since his character was so very good, and he was in so much credit and esteem with the people; for he must be something extraordinary to have their good word, who had such an abhorrence of uncircumcised Gentiles in general: this man, they add,</p>
<p><strong>was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house</strong>; they intimate hereby, that he did not send for him of himself, he was not led to it by any fancy of his own, or any curiosity in him; nor should he have presumed to have used such freedom with Peter, but that he had some instructions from God himself, who had sent an holy angel to him, and had ordered him to send men to Joppa, and fetch Peter from thence to his house, for the end next mentioned:</p>
<p><strong>and to hear words of thee</strong>: the doctrines of the Gospel, and the ordinances of it: that being taught by the one, he and his might submit to the other.</p>
