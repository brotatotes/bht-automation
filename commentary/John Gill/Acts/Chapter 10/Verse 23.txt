<p><strong>Then called he them in</strong>,.... Into Simon's house; not "into his own house", as the Ethiopic version adds; as yet they stood without, before the gate of the house; he took them in, no doubt, with the leave of Simon, his host, and set provisions before them, and lodged them that night:</p>
<p><strong>and in the morning Peter went away with them</strong>; the next morning he set out with them towards Caesarea:</p>
<p><strong>and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him</strong>; there were six of them, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:12">Acts 11:12</span> these went with him, not only to bear him company, and out of respect to him; but to be witnesses of what might be seen, heard, said, or done, and for Peter, should there be any occasion for it, as there afterwards was.</p>
