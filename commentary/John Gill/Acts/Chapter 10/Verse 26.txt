<p><strong>But Peter took him up</strong>,.... As he lay at his feet, and lifted him up and set him on his legs:</p>
<p><strong>saying, stand up</strong>; and continue in this posture:</p>
<p><strong>I myself also am a man</strong>; a mortal man, a man of like passions with others, no better than others by nature: and it was by grace, and not any merit of his own, that he was a believer in Christ, and an apostle of his; and therefore he chose not to have any distinguishing homage and respect paid to him, and especially in any excessive and extravagant way; which though not designed, might carry in it a suggestion, as if he was more than a man.</p>
