He saw in a vision evidently,.... He was not in a dream, or in a trance, but he was thoroughly awake, and his eyes open, and was himself; it was not in the night, but in clear day:about the ninth hour of the day; or three o'clock in the afternoon, which was the hour of prayer, Acts 3:1 in which exercise he was now engaged, Acts 10:30 at this time he sawan angel of God coming to him; into the room where he was at prayer:and saying unto him, Cornelius; he called him by his name, to let him know that he knew him, as angels are very knowing spirits; and to express his affection and friendship to him, and that he was a messenger, not of bad, but of good news to him; as well as to engage his attention to him; for he might be so intent at his devotion, that had he not called him by name, he would not have minded him.
