<p><strong>He saw in a vision evidently</strong>,.... He was not in a dream, or in a trance, but he was thoroughly awake, and his eyes open, and was himself; it was not in the night, but in clear day:</p>
<p><strong>about the ninth hour of the day</strong>; or three o'clock in the afternoon, which was the hour of prayer, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:1">Acts 3:1</span> in which exercise he was now engaged, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:30">Acts 10:30</span> at this time he saw</p>
<p><strong>an angel of God coming to him</strong>; into the room where he was at prayer:</p>
<p><strong>and saying unto him, Cornelius</strong>; he called him by his name, to let him know that he knew him, as angels are very knowing spirits; and to express his affection and friendship to him, and that he was a messenger, not of bad, but of good news to him; as well as to engage his attention to him; for he might be so intent at his devotion, that had he not called him by name, he would not have minded him.</p>
