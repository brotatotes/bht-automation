<p><strong>Him God raised up the third day</strong>,.... According to the Scriptures, particularly <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:2">Hosea 6:2</span>. The resurrection, of Christ, though it is sometimes ascribed to himself, as God, whereby he was declared to be the Son of God, yet generally to God the Father, as here:</p>
<p><strong>and showed him openly</strong>; in a glorious body, and yet numerically the same he before lived and suffered in, so as to be heard, seen, and handled; by which full proof was given of the truth of his resurrection, in which he appeared to be the conqueror over death and the grave.</p>
