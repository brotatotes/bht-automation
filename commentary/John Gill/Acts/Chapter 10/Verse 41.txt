<p><strong>Not to all the people</strong>,.... Of the Jews, who crucified him; nor to the whole body of the Christians, though at one time to a large number, even five hundred brethren at once:</p>
<p><strong>but unto witnesses chosen before of God</strong>; by Christ himself, who is God:</p>
<p><strong>even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead</strong>; namely, to the apostles, with whom he familiarly conversed by times, for the space of forty days after his resurrection; and Beza's most ancient copy; and the Ethiopic version here add, "forty days"; and particularly he did sometimes eat and drink with them;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:42">Luke 24:42</span> and though drinking is not mentioned, it is included in eating, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:36">Luke 7:36</span> wherefore there is no need to connect the last clause, "after he rose from the dead", with the latter part of the preceding verse, as some do, on that account.</p>
