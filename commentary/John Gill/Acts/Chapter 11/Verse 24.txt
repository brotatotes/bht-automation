<p><strong>For he was a good man</strong>,.... He had the grace of God wrought in his soul, and did good works; he was very kind, and generous, and charitable; he sold what land he had, and gave the money to the apostles, for the use of the community, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:37">Acts 4:37</span></p>
<p><strong>and full of the Holy Ghost, and of faith</strong>; he was full of the several graces of the Spirit, and particularly of faith; and he was full of the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, and of the faith of miracles; he was full of the doctrine of faith, and of spiritual gifts for the preaching of it: the same character is given of Stephen, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:5">Acts 6:5</span></p>
<p><strong>and much people was added unto the Lord</strong>; by the means of Barnabas, through his ministry, and the exercise of those gifts he was full of; so the Arabic version, "and he drew a large multitude to the Lord".</p>
