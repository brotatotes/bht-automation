<p><strong>And when he had considered the thing</strong>,.... The whole of the salvation wrought for him; or rather, where he should go, to what house he should betake himself; ere he was aware,</p>
<p><strong>he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark</strong>. This good woman seems to be a widow, no mention being made of her husband, and was sister to Barnabas, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>. She is described by a son she had, whose name was John Mark, because of the frequent mention made of him hereafter; her house being large, and her heart as large as her house, the saints met here, and were welcome, and where they were at this time, though so late:</p>
<p><strong>where many were gathered together, praying</strong>; the Ethiopic version adds, "for him"; and there were some in other places, for one place could not hold them all; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:17">Acts 12:17</span> they held out to the end in prayer; this was their last effort in this way, and in this they were no doubt exceeding vehement and importunate, and they succeeded; so true is that observation in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:16">James 5:16</span>.</p>
