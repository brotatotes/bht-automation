<p><strong>And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate</strong>, c. The lesser door in the great gate, or the door of the porch through which they entered into the house. So the Jews distinguish between</p>
<p>פתח, "the door", and שער, "the gate" see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+18:16">Judges 18:16</span> where the Septuagint use the same words as here. Kimchi h says,</p>
<p>"xtp, "the door" is what is of the gate, without the folding doors; for all is called שער, "the gate", whether within or without, with the folding doors, and the outward threshold, as that is joined to the side posts and lintel.''</p>
<p>The door was kept shut, for fear of the Jews, lest they should be disturbed: here Peter stood and knocked:</p>
<p><strong>a damsel came to hearken</strong>; hearing a knocking, she came out to the door, and listened, to try if she could know who it was, a friend or a foe, before she opened; or she came "to answer", as the Syriac version renders it, to know who was there, and what he or she wanted, and to give an answer. And the damsel was</p>
<p><strong>named Rhoda</strong>, which signifies a rose in the Greek language: so the Jewish women often had their names, in the Hebrew tongue, from flowers and trees, as Susanna from a lily, or rose: and which, perhaps, was the Hebrew name of this damsel; and Esther was called Hadassah, from the myrtle tree.</p>
