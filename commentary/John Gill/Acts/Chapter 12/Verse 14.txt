<p><strong>And when she knew Peter's voice</strong>,.... often heard him preach and converse in the family:</p>
<p><strong>she opened not the gate for gladness</strong>, filled with joy to hear his voice, and that he was delivered from prison, and in haste to carry the welcome news to the company within, stayed not to open the gate, and let Peter in:</p>
<p><strong>but ran in and told how Peter stood before the gate</strong>: she went into the house in a great hurry, and related to them within, that Peter was at the door without.</p>
