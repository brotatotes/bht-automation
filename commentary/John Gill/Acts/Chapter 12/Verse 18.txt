<p><strong>Now as soon as it was day</strong>,.... When it was morning; as soon as there was any light in the prison, by which the guards could discern one another and their prisoners:</p>
<p><strong>there was no small stir among the soldiers</strong>: the two between whom Peter slept, and the rest of the quaternions that were employed in the wards to keep watch; who were now all in an uproar, and in the utmost concern and fright:</p>
<p><strong>what was become of Peter</strong>; whether he was in any other part of the prison, by what means he could escape, and whither he was gone.</p>
