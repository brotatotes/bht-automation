<p><strong>Peter therefore was kept in prison</strong>,.... Till the feast of the passover was at an end:</p>
<p><strong>but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him</strong>; this was not done by them as a body together, but either by them in several bands at different places, or by some of the principal of the church at some one certain place, and where they might frequently change companies, and keep on a continual incessant prayer for days together; and whereas it is very likely it might be at the beginning of the passover, when Peter was taken up, and it was now at the close of it, when he was delivered, the church might be engaged by companies alternately, a whole week together, in prayer, on this occasion.</p>
