<p><strong>And the angel said unto him, gird thyself</strong>,.... He slept in his inner garment loose about him; wherefore the angel bids him gird it up with his girdle, and prepare to walk out after him:</p>
<p><strong>and bind on thy sandals</strong>; which were a sort of shoes that covered only the soles of the feet, and were fastened to the leg, with strings:</p>
<p><strong>and so he did</strong>; he did not ask any question, or the reason of these orders; he did not dispute the matter, but at once obeyed:</p>
<p><strong>and he saith unto him, cast thy garment about thee</strong>; meaning his upper garment, or cloak, which lay by him:</p>
<p><strong>and follow me</strong>; suggesting hereby, that he should take care of him, and show him his way, and bring him safe out of the prison.</p>
