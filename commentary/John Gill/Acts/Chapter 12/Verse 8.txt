And the angel said unto him, gird thyself,.... He slept in his inner garment loose about him; wherefore the angel bids him gird it up with his girdle, and prepare to walk out after him:and bind on thy sandals; which were a sort of shoes that covered only the soles of the feet, and were fastened to the leg, with strings:and so he did; he did not ask any question, or the reason of these orders; he did not dispute the matter, but at once obeyed:and he saith unto him, cast thy garment about thee; meaning his upper garment, or cloak, which lay by him:and follow me; suggesting hereby, that he should take care of him, and show him his way, and bring him safe out of the prison.
