<p><strong>And he went out and followed him</strong>,.... He came out from between the two soldiers, and out of that apartment in the prison, in which he was, and followed the angel where he led him:</p>
<p><strong>and wist not that it was true that was done by the angel</strong>; not that he thought the angel was a mere apparition, and all this that was done was a delusion; but he did not know whether this was matter of fact, or whether it was, not represented to him in a visionary way, as what could be, or would be done:</p>
<p><strong>but thought he saw a vision</strong>; imagined he was in a dream or a trance, and only saw these things in a vision, and that they were not really done, the whole was so amazing and astonishing.</p>
