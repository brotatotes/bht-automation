<p><strong>And now behold the hand of the Lord is upon thee</strong>,.... That is, the power of God was just ready to be exerted on him in a way of punishment, by striking him with blindness:</p>
<p><strong>and thou shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season</strong>: so blind as not to see the sun, when it shined ever so brightly: this punishment seems to be but for a time; and some say that Elymas repented, and had his sight restored to him; and after that he returned to his sorcery, and again greatly opposed Barnabas in the island of Cyprus:</p>
<p><strong>and immediately there fell on him a mist and darkness</strong>; as soon as ever the apostle had said the above words, a dark mist fell upon his eyes, which began the blindness, and issued in a total one:</p>
<p><strong>and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand</strong>; he groped about the room, if he could find, and lay hold on some person to lead him: for he was quickly stone blind, so that he could not guide himself, as the men of Sodom were, when smitten with blindness by the angel; wherefore, though they groped about for the door of the house till they were weary, they could not find it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:11">Genesis 19:11</span> of which the Jews say, as here, that it was מכה מאת השם, "a stroke from God" u. Blind men need one to hold them by the hand, and lead them, as Samson, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+16:26">Judges 16:26</span> and Saul, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:8">Acts 9:8</span>. The striking this man with blindness is an instance of the power the apostles were endued with, for the punishing of offenders: so Ananias and Sapphira were struck dead for telling a lie: and the incestuous person was delivered to Satan to undergo a corporeal punishment for his incest; as Hymenaeus and Alexander were for their blasphemy, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:5">Acts 5:5</span>.</p>
<p>u Tzeror Hammor, fol. 20. 3.</p>
