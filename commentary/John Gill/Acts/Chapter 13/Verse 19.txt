<p><strong>And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan</strong>,.... The Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, Jebusites, and Girgashites; and the name of seven nations is what they are usually called by in Jewish writings; and though they were not utterly destroyed, or everyone of them put to death, or driven out, for some remained to be thorns in the sides of the Israelites; yet they were so wasted and conquered, that they could never recover any more: he divided their land to them; every tribe had its portion of it assigned, by lot; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jos+14:1">Joshua 14:1</span>.</p>
