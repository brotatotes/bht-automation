<p><strong>For they that dwelt at Jerusalem, and their rulers</strong>,.... The inhabitants of that city, and the great sanhedrim which sat there: because they knew him not; that is, either Jesus the Saviour, whom God had raised of the seed of David, and to whom John bore witness; and which must be understood, not of all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and members of the sanhedrim; for though some were ignorant, yet there were others that knew that Jesus was the Messiah, and notwithstanding rejected him; but the apostle chooses to take no notice of these, because he would not irritate and provoke, but rather of others, that were really ignorant of Christ: or else this may be understood of the Gospel, the word of salvation, that the Jews knew not "that"; and so the Syriac version renders it; and to which agrees the Ethiopic version, which reads thus, "they knew not this word of the prophets", joining the word of salvation, and what follows, together:</p>
<p><strong>nor yet the voices of the prophets</strong>: "or the writings of the prophets", as the Syriac version, and some copies read; their prophecies concerning the Messiah, particularly in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:1">Psalms 22:1</span> which are read every sabbath day;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:1- :">Psalms 22:1- :</span></p>
<p><strong>they have fulfilled them</strong>; the word, of the prophets:</p>
<p><strong>in condemning him</strong>; Jesus Christ, for these prophets testified, in the places referred to, of the sufferings and death of Christ, to which he was condemned by them.</p>
