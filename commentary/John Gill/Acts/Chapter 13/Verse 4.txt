<p><strong>So they being sent forth of the Holy Ghost</strong>,.... This is said, lest it should be thought they were sent by men; it was the Holy Ghost that moved the prophets at Antioch to separate them from them, and to send them away; and who inclined their minds to go, and directed them what course to steer: and accordingly they</p>
<p><strong>departed to Seleucia</strong>; which was a city of Syria, called by Pliny, Seleucia Pieria d; it had its name from Seleucus Nicanor, king of Egypt, who was the builder of it: it was not far from Antioch, it is said to be twenty four miles from it; it is the first city of Syria from Cilicia, and was situated at the mouth of the river Orontes; wherefore Saul and Barnabas made no stay here; and it seems that their coming hither was only in order to take shipping for the island of Cyprus; for Seleucia was upon the sea coast, as appears from:</p>
<p>"King Ptolemee therefore, having gotten the dominion of the cities by the sea unto Seleucia upon the sea coast, imagined wicked counsels against Alexander.'' (1 Maccabees 11:8)</p>
<p>and was the proper place to set sail from to Cyprus. So we read of Apollonius Tyaneus and his companions e, that</p>
<p>"they went down to the sea by Seleucia, where having got a ship, "they sailed to Cyprus:" and so it follows here,''</p>
<p><strong>and from thence they sailed to Cyprus</strong>; an island in the Mediterranean sea, the native country of Barnabas, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:36">Acts 4:36</span></p>
