<p><strong>And there came thither certain Jews</strong>,.... Either just at the same time, or however whilst the apostles were in this city: in four manuscripts of Beza's, and in some other copies, it is read, "as they abode there, and taught, there came", c. These Jews were inveterate enemies of the apostles, and seemed to have followed them from place to place, on purpose to oppose them, and to stir up the people against them, and to hinder the success of their ministry all they could: for these came</p>
<p><strong>from Antioch</strong> not Antioch in Syria, but in Pisidia: where they had contradicted and blasphemed the word of God, and was the reason why the apostles turned to the Gentiles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:45">Acts 13:45</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And Iconium</strong>: where also the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles against the apostles, and both of them made an assault upon them, to use them ill, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:2">Acts 14:2</span></p>
<p><strong>who persuaded the people</strong>; in the above manuscripts of Beza's, and in some other copies, are these words,</p>
<p>"and they disputing confidently, persuaded the people to depart from them, saying, that they said nothing true, but in all things lied;''</p>
<p>which though they may not be considered as the text, are a good gloss upon it: they persuaded the people not to hearken to them, told them that they were deceivers and jugglers, and instead of having honours conferred upon them, they ought to be severely punished; and to these Jews they hearkened, as appears by what follows:</p>
<p><strong>and having stoned Paul</strong>; even the same persons that just before were for sacrificing to him as a god; which shows the fickleness and inconstancy of the populace, and how little they are to be depended on; for they were the Gentiles that stoned Paul, at the instigation of the Jews; though the latter might probably join with them in it: a like instance we have in the conduct of the Jews towards Christ, who cried "Hosanna" to him one day, and on another, very quickly after, with great importunity say, Crucify him, Crucify him; of this stoning, the apostle makes mention, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:25">2 Corinthians 11:25</span> When they had stoned him,</p>
<p><strong>they drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead</strong>; which is an addition to their barbarity and inhumanity; for they not only stoned him until he was dead, as they supposed, but they dragged his body through the streets of their city, in contempt of him, and indignation against him, and cast him out of it, where they left him as unworthy of a burial.</p>
