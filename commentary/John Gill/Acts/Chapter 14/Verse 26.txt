<p><strong>And thence sailed to Antioch</strong>,.... In Syria,</p>
<p><strong>from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God</strong>; by the prophets: from this place they first set out on their travels; here they were separated by the order of the Holy Ghost to the work of the ministry, and by them they were sent forth, after they had in prayer commended them to God, and to his grace to assist them, and succeed them, as well as to fit them</p>
<p><strong>for the work which they fulfilled</strong>; that is, for the work of the ministry, for the preaching of the Gospel in several places; and which they had now gone through, and finished with great integrity and faithfulness, and with much success, though through many afflictions and persecutions.</p>
