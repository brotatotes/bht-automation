<p><strong>And there sat a certain man at Lystra</strong>,.... Where the apostle was preaching; and perhaps he sat there to beg, where there was a great concourse of people, and which might be in the open street: this man was</p>
<p><strong>impotent in his feet</strong>; so weak, as not to be able to walk, and even to stand on them, and therefore is said to sit:</p>
<p><strong>being a cripple from his mother's womb</strong>; he was born lame, as was the man cured by Peter, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:2">Acts 3:2</span></p>
<p><strong>who never had walked</strong>; these circumstances are mentioned, to show that his case was incurable by any human art, and to illustrate the following miracle.</p>
