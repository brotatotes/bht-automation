<p><strong>The same heard Paul speak</strong>,.... That is, preach the Gospel; he was one of his hearers, and faith came to hint by hearing; the Arabic version adds, "he cried unto him"; that is, to Paul, whom he heard:</p>
<p><strong>who steadfastly beholding him</strong>; not the lame man beholding Paul, but Paul beholding the lame man, as the Syriac and Ethiopic versions both express it, as also Beza's ancient copy and others; so Peter looked on the man he cured, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:4">Acts 3:4</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And perceiving that he had faith to be healed</strong>; as he might by his looks, his gestures, his attention in hearing, and it may be by somewhat that he said, as well as by revelation, or a spirit of discerning, which he had.</p>
