<p><strong>That the residue of men might seek after the Lord</strong>,.... The rebuilder and proprietor of this tabernacle, and who dwells in it; that is, attend his worship, pray unto him, and seek unto him for life and salvation: in Amos these are called, "the remnant of Edom": and design the remnant according to the election of grace among the Gentiles; the Jews generally call all other nations, and especially the Roman empire, Edom:</p>
<p><strong>and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called</strong>; for God is the God of the whole earth, of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews; and his Gospel was now spread among them, and many of them were converted and called Christians, and the children and people of God: the Jews x understand this of the people of Israel, who are called by the name of the Lord, or on whom his name is called; and some think the words are to be transposed y thus,</p>
<p>"that Israel on whom my name is called might possess the remnant of Edom, and all the people;''</p>
<p>and is true of their possessing or enjoying them in a Gospel church state:</p>
<p><strong>saith the Lord, who doth all these things</strong>; raises up the tabernacle of David, revives the interest of religion, resettles the church, and increases it, calls and converts the Gentiles, causes them to seek after the Lord, and unites them in one church state with the Jews; the word "all" is left out in the Alexandrian copy, and in the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, and is not in Amos.</p>
