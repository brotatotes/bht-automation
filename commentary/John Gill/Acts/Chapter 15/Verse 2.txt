<p><strong>When therefore Paul and Barnabas</strong>,.... Who were the ministers of the uncircumcision, and were just returned from preaching the Gospel among the Gentiles, with success, and were advocates for them, being witnesses of the grace that was bestowed on them, and therefore opposed the sentiments of these men:</p>
<p><strong>and had no small dissension and disputation with them</strong>; which was attended with much heat and sharpness, and continued some time, and occasioned much disturbance and uneasiness; nor could the affair be decided and issued: wherefore</p>
<p><strong>they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them</strong>; that is, the members of the church at Antioch, taking this matter into consideration, and finding that the difference could not be composed, for the peace of the church, wisely came to a resolution, and made an order, that Paul and Barnabas, with others, as Titus, who went with Paul at this time, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1">Galatians 2:1</span> and some others of the brethren, and it may be also certain, on, the other side of the question; that these</p>
<p><strong>should go up to Jerusalem, unto the apostles and elders, about this question</strong>; concerning circumcision, and the necessity of it to salvation, that they might have the sense of James, and Peter, and John, who particularly were at Jerusalem at this time, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:7">Acts 15:7</span> and other apostles that might be there; and also of other ministers of the word, who are called elders. And the church of Jerusalem being the most ancient church, and several of the apostles residing here, who had seen Christ in the flesh, and had received their mission and commission from him, and had been extraordinarily endowed with the Holy Ghost; and here being many other preachers of the Gospel, and there being in a multitude of counsellors safety, the church at Antioch judged it advisable to send to them for counsel and direction; and it becomes churches to assist each other in this way.</p>
