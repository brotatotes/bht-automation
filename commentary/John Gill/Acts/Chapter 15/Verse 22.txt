<p><strong>Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church</strong>,.... The opinion, judgment, and advice of James, being approved of by the whole body of the apostles, ministers, and brethren of the church assembled together on this occasion; they unanimously agreed,</p>
<p><strong>to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas</strong>; that is, they thought fit to choose some persons from among themselves, out of that assembly, or who were members of the church at Jerusalem; and send them to Antioch, where the difference began, along with Paul and Barnabas, to give an account of the sense of the apostles, elders, and brethren, about the affair in controversy, and what was their advice upon the whole: and the rather they took this step, to prevent all suspicion of Paul and Barnabas giving a partial account, or putting a wrong turn upon the sentiments of this assembly, they being parties concerned on one side, wherefore they thought fit to send some indifferent persons along with them, to confirm their narrative, and to compose differences among them, and to bring back an account of the state of the church:</p>
<p><strong>namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span></p>
<p><strong>and Silas</strong>, the same with Sylvanus:</p>
<p><strong>chief men among the brethren</strong>, leading men among them, who went before them, were guides to them, in doctrine and discipline; for these were prophets or preachers, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:32">Acts 15:32</span> and these they pitched upon, partly out of respect to Paul and Barnabas, as being suitable companions for them, and partly out of respect to the church at Antioch, and chiefly because of their ability, and capacity, for such service they were sent upon.</p>
