<p><strong>the apostles, and elders, and brethren</strong>; which belonged to, or were members of the church at Jerusalem; they are severally set in their proper place and order: the apostles, Peter, and James, and John, and it may be some others first; for these God had set in the first place in the church; then the elders, or preachers of the Gospel, such as were Judas and Silas: and then the brethren, or private members of the church; who are called so, because they are of one family, and have one Father, and are partakers of the same grace and privileges: these,</p>
<p><strong>send greeting</strong>; or their Christian salutation, wishing all peace and prosperity, both for soul and body, temporal, spiritual and eternal:</p>
<p><strong>unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria and Cilicia</strong>; the brethren or members of the several churches in these parts, who were Gentiles, are particularly sent to; and not the brethren who were Jews; because they were especially concerned, and to them is the advice directed: Antioch is first mentioned, that being the place where the controversy began; but there being other churches in Syria, besides Antioch, in which were many Gentiles, and also in Cilicia, and particularly at Tarsus, Paul's native place, and where he had preached, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:30">Acts 9:30</span> they are therefore mentioned, and being countries near to one another, it is very likely that the controversy had spread itself among them.</p>
