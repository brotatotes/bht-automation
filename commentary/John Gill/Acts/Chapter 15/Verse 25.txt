<p><strong>It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord</strong>,.... Or together; in one place, as the Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions render it; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:1">Acts 2:1</span> though certain it is, that as they were in one place, so they were in one mind; and their unanimity was proper to be mentioned, in order to engage a regard to their advice:</p>
<p><strong>to send men chosen unto you</strong>; men chosen for this purpose; namely, Judas and Silas:</p>
<p><strong>with our beloved Barnabas and Paul</strong>; who are commended thus, partly to express their affection to them; and partly to observe the wisdom of the church at Antioch, in sending two such agreeable persons; and chiefly to testify their approbation of the doctrine and conduct of these two men.</p>
