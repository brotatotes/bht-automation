<p><strong>For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us</strong>,.... By various things they had reason doubtless to conclude, that they were under the influence and direction of the Holy Ghost in this affair; as by the spirit of prayer that was among them; by that power and energy with which many of them spoke on this occasion, and that so agreeable to the word of God; and by that unanimity with which they came into the advice given. With respect to the form here used, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+13:2">1 Chronicles 13:2</span> and the Targum on it, which renders the words thus;</p>
<p>"if it be beautiful before you, and acceptable before the Lord, let us send, c.''</p>
<p>It follows here,</p>
<p><strong>to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things</strong> not that they were necessary to salvation, but necessary to secure the peace of the churches, and at least were necessary, at that present time; and therefore since it appeared to be necessary to enjoin them for the present, they hoped they would not refuse to bear them; and especially, since, though they must own they were burdens, and a part of the yoke of bondage, yet they were not many, nor very heavy, and for the future they should lay no other, nor more upon them; and what they did, was to prevent any other or greater burden to be laid; and so the Syriac version renders it, "lest any more, or greater burden should be laid upon you."</p>
