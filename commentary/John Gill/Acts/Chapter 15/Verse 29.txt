<p><strong>That ye abstain from meats offered to idols</strong>,.... Which explains what is meant by pollutions of idols, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:20">Acts 15:20</span></p>
<p><strong>and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:20- :">Acts 15:20- :</span></strong></p>
<p>In Beza's most ancient copy, and in three other manuscripts, and in the Complutensian edition, it follows, "and whatsoever ye would not have done to yourselves, that do ye not to another"; in like manner the Ethiopic version also reads, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:20">Acts 15:20</span> "from which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well"; it will be doing a good thing, and make for the peace of the churches; in Beza's most ancient copy it is added, "born", or "moved by the Holy Ghost": being influenced and assisted by him in this, and every good work:</p>
<p><strong>fare ye well</strong>; the Syriac version adds, "in our Lord".</p>
