<p><strong>So when they were dismissed</strong>,.... That is, Paul and Barnabas, with Judas and Silas, by the apostles, elders, and church at Jerusalem:</p>
<p><strong>they came to Antioch</strong>; or "came down to Antioch", as the Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate Latin, and Ethiopic versions read, agreeably to</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:1">Acts 15:1</span></p>
<p><strong>and when they had gathered the multitude together</strong>; the whole church, which consisted of many members; the company, or congregation of the faithful, as the Arabic version renders it: and as Paul and Barnabas were sent by the church at Antioch; and as the letter, which they, with Judas and Silas, brought from Jerusalem, was directed and sent to the brethren at Antioch, it was highly reasonable, and necessary, that they should be called together, and an account of the business they were sent upon be given them, and the letter be delivered to them, as it accordingly was:</p>
<p><strong>they delivered the epistle</strong>; sent by the apostles, elders, and brethren at Jerusalem to them; this they put into the hands of some one or other of the brethren of the church, in order to be read.</p>
