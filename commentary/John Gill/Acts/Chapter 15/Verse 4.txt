And when they were come to Jerusalem,.... Paul and Barnabas, and the rest that came from Antioch with them:they were received of the church; that is, that was at Jerusalem, in a very kind and respectful manner; they were received into their houses, and accommodated with everything convenient for them:and of the apostles; particularly James, and Cephas, and John, who gave to Paul and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, in token of their approbation of them, affection for them, and agreement with them:and elders: the other ministers of the Gospel who preached in that place:and they declared all things that God had done with them: just as they did to the church at Antioch, when they returned from their travels,  :-, the Arabic version here adds, as there, "and that God had opened to the Gentiles the door of faith."
