And also the brethren, or private members of the church, even the whole church, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span>. Whether all the apostles were here present, is not certain; Peter, James, and John were; but who else, cannot be said: these met together</p>
<p><strong>for to consider of this matter</strong>; to hear what was to be said on both sides of the question, and then to judge what advice was proper to be given to the Gentiles.</p>
