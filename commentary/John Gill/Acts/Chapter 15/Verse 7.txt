<p><strong>And when there had been much disputing</strong>,.... Pro and con upon this subject; many had spoken; and much had been said, and a great deal of time had been taken up about the thing in controversy:</p>
<p><strong>Peter rose up</strong>; not only out of respect to this venerable assembly, but to signify that he had something to say; and he stood up that he might be the better heard. Beza's ancient copy reads, "rose up in spirit";</p>
<p><strong>and said unto them, men and brethren</strong>: an usual form of address with the Jews; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:2">Acts 7:2</span></p>
<p><strong>ye know how that a good while ago</strong>; or "from ancient days"; or "from the beginning", as the Ethiopic version renders it; from the beginning of the preaching of the Gospel, after the ascension of Christ; quickly after the effusion of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost: it is thought, by some, to be ten or eleven, and, by others, to be twenty years ago, or thereabout:</p>
<p><strong>God made choice among us</strong>; the apostles; the Alexandrian copy reads, "among you"; the sense is the same, for Peter must be supposed as directing his discourse chiefly to the apostles:</p>
<p><strong>that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the Gospel</strong>, and believe; referring to the case of Cornelius, and his family: and his sense is, that some years ago it pleased God, in his providence, to single him out from the rest of the apostles, and in a very extraordinary manner to call him to go to Caesarea, and preach the gospel to Cornelius, and those that were in his house, that hearing they might believe in Christ.</p>
