<p><strong>Then came he to Derbe and Lystra</strong>,.... Which were cities of Lycaonia, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:6">Acts 14:6</span> after Paul had gone through Syria and Cilicia; in the last of these places, he had been stoned, and yet goes thither again; none of these things moved him from the preaching of the Gospel, and from the care of the churches, such zeal, courage, and intrepidity was he possessed of:</p>
<p><strong>and behold a certain disciple was there</strong>: a converted person, a believer in Christ, one that had learned to know and deny himself, and understood the way of salvation by Christ, and was a follower of him; whether the apostle was an instrument of his conversion, when he was before in these parts, is not certain, though probable, since he often calls him his son; nor is it so evident whether he was at Derbe or at Lystra, though the latter seems most likely, since a report was given of him by the brethren there, and at Iconium, when no mention is made of Derbe, in the following verse:</p>
<p><strong>named Timotheus</strong>; or Timothy, the same person to whom afterwards the apostle wrote two epistles: it is a name much used among the Greeks, and his father was a Greek; one of this name, who was an historian among the Greeks, is frequently mentioned by Laertius r; and there was another of this name, the son of Conon, an Athenian general s; and another that was a captain or general of Antiochus,</p>
<p>"Afterward he passed over to the children of Ammon, where he found a mighty power, and much people, with Timotheus their captain.'' (1 Maccabees 5:6)</p>
<p>"Now Timotheus, whom the Jews had overcome before, when he had gathered a great multitude of foreign forces, and horses out of Asia not a few, came as though he would take Jewry by force of arms.'' (2 Maccabees 10:24)</p>
<p>the name signifies one that honoured God, or was honoured by God; both were true in this disciple of Christ:</p>
<p><strong>the son of a certain woman which was a Jewess, and believed</strong>; his mother was a Jewish woman, but a believer in Christ, her name was Eunice, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:5">2 Timothy 1:5</span></p>
<p><strong>but his father was a Greek</strong>; a Gentile, an uncircumcised one, and so he seems to have remained, by his sons not being circumcised.</p>
