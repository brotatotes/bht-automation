<p><strong>And after he had seen the vision</strong>,.... And considered it, and related it to his companions: and when they had well weighed it, and the circumstances of it:</p>
<p><strong>immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia</strong>; they determined upon it, and took all the proper methods, and made the necessary provisions for it. Here Luke, the writer of this history, first appears, saying, "we endeavoured"; whether he came with the apostle from Antioch, since he is commonly said to have been a physician of Antioch; or whether he met the apostle at Troas, since here is the first hint of him, is not certain:</p>
<p><strong>assuredly gathering, that the Lord had called us for to preach the Gospel unto them</strong>; they concluded from the vision with great certainty, that they had a manifest call from God to go into Macedonia, and preach the Gospel to the inhabitants of it, not doubting but that they should meet with success. The Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, read "God", instead of "Lord".</p>
