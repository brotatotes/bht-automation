<p><strong>And when her masters saw</strong>,.... As they might by her sedateness and composure; she not being wild and frantic, and not having such motions and agitations she had whilst under the possession of the evil spirit:</p>
<p><strong>that the hope of their gains was gone</strong>; the Syriac version adds, "out of her"; namely, the evil spirit which was the ground and foundation of all their hope of gains, they expected to acquire for themselves; that being gone, they had no more work to do, nor tricks to play, nor profit to expect from the maid: wherefore</p>
<p><strong>they caught Paul and Silas</strong>; they being the chief speakers, and principally concerned in the ejection of the evil spirit; they laid hold on them, took them by the collar, or held them by their clothes,</p>
<p><strong>and drew them into the market place</strong>: or rather into the court of judicature, as the word also signifies; there to accuse them, and to have them tried, condemned, and punished:</p>
<p><strong>unto the rulers</strong>; the judges of the court, it may be the Decuriones; for in a Roman colony as Philippi was, they chose out every tenth man, that was of capacity and ability, to make and establish a public council, and who therefore were called by this name.</p>
