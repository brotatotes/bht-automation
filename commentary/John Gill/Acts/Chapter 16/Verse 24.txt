<p><strong>Who having received such a charge</strong>,.... So strict an one from the magistrates, was doubly careful and diligent:</p>
<p><strong>thrust them into the inner prison</strong>: the innermost part of it, the lowest or furthest part of the prison; so that there were the more doors, bolts, and bars, to break open, and pass through, should they attempt to make their escape:</p>
<p><strong>and made their feet fast in the stocks</strong>; or "wood", a wooden machine, in which the feet of prisoners were put for security, and which we call "the stocks"; some say it was such an one, in which the neck as well as the feet were put, and so might be the same with our "pillory".</p>
