<p><strong>And suddenly there was a great earthquake</strong>,.... An extraordinary and unusual one; which did not arise from natural causes, from wind being pent up in the earth, but from the prayers and praises of the saints, going up to heaven; when God was pleased to testify his presence and power this way; and the effects which followed upon this earthquake, show it to be a supernatural one:</p>
<p><strong>so that the foundations of the prison were shaken</strong>; not the roof and walls only, as is common in earthquakes, but the very foundation also; and yet the edifice was not thrown down, as is usual when the foundation is shaken:</p>
<p><strong>and immediately all the doors were opened</strong>; both of the outer and inner prisons, which is another unusual effect of earthquakes:</p>
<p><strong>and everyone's bands were loosed</strong>; not only the bands of Paul and Silas, but of the rest of the prisoners; though the Arabic version reads, "all the fetters and bands of both were loosed", referring it only to Paul and Silas; this circumstance shows also, that the earthquake was miraculous, for when was it ever known that such an effect ever followed one?</p>
