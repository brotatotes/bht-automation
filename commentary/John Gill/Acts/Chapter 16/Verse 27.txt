<p><strong>And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep</strong>,.... Not so much by the loud voices of Paul and Silas, as by the uncommon motion of the earth, which so shook him, as thoroughly to awake him:</p>
<p><strong>and seeing the prison doors open</strong>; which was the first thing in his fright he was looking after, and careful of, and which he might perceive, though it was midnight, and though as yet he had no light:</p>
<p><strong>he drew out his sword</strong>; from its scabbard, which was girt about him; for it may be he had slept with his clothes on, and his sword girt to him; or if he had put on his clothes upon awaking, he had also girt himself with his sword:</p>
<p><strong>and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled</strong>; especially Paul and Silas, concerning whom he had received such a strict charge from the magistrates; and he knew that according to law, he must suffer the same punishment that was designed for them; and therefore in fear of the magistrates, and what they would inflict upon him, he was just going to destroy himself.</p>
