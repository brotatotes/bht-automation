<p><strong>And they said, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ</strong>,.... Not with a bare historical faith, as only to believe that he was the Son of God, and the Messiah, and that he was come in the flesh, and had suffered, and died, and rose again, and was now in heaven at the right hand of God, and would come again to judge both quick and dead, for there may be such a faith and no salvation; but so as to look unto him alone for life and salvation, to rely upon him, and trust in him; to commit himself, and the care of his immortal soul unto him, and to expect peace, pardon, righteousness, and eternal life from him; the answer is much the same our Lord returned to the Jews, when they asked, though not with the same affection and sincerity as this man, what they must do to work the works of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:28">John 6:28</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And thou shalt be saved</strong>; from sin, and all its miserable effects and consequences; from the curses of the law, from the power of Satan, from the evil of the world, from the wrath of God, hell and damnation: this is to be understood of a spiritual and eternal salvation; for it is said, after that the jailer was inquiring about it, being terrified in his conscience with a sense of sin and wrath; and between believing in Christ, and being saved with an everlasting salvation, there is a strict and inseparable connection, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:16">Mark 16:16</span> though not faith, but Christ is the cause and author of salvation; faith spies salvation in Christ, goes to him for it, receives it from him, and believes unto it:</p>
<p><strong>and thy house</strong>; or family, provided they believe in Christ also, as they did, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:34">Acts 16:34</span> or otherwise there can be no salvation, for he that believeth not shall be damned.</p>
