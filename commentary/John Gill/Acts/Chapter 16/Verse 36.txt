<p><strong>And the keeper of the prison told this, saying to Paul</strong>,.... The Ethiopic version adds, "and to Silas"; this was the same person with the jailer, whom Paul had baptized; and indeed, the same word is here used, though a little differently rendered, who no doubt reported this message to Paul with great joy:</p>
<p><strong>the magistrates have sent to let you go</strong>; they have sent an order to let you out of prison:</p>
<p><strong>now therefore depart, and go in peace</strong>; which expresses the jailer's pleasure of mind, and joy of heart, in executing his orders; and his sincere and hearty wishes for peace and prosperity to go along with them wherever they went, who had been instrumental of so much good to him and his family.</p>
