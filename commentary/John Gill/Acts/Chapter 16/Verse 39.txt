<p><strong>And they came</strong>,.... To the prison in person, as Paul had insisted on they should:</p>
<p><strong>and besought them</strong>; that they would put up the injury that had been done them, and quietly depart out of prison:</p>
<p><strong>and brought them out</strong>; that is, out of prison; took them by the arms, and led them out, as they had put them in, which was what the apostle required:</p>
<p><strong>and desired them to depart out of the city</strong>; lest there should be any further disturbance about them: in Beza's most ancient copy, and in another manuscript copy, this verse is read thus, and which more clearly explains the passage;</p>
<p>"and they came with many friends unto the prison, and desired them to go out, saying, we are not ignorant of your case, that you are righteous men; and bringing them out they besought them, saying, go out of this city, lest they (the people) should turn again upon you, crying against you;''</p>
<p>which looks as if they took along with them some persons, who were friends to the apostles as well as to them, to prevail upon them to depart quietly; and they excuse themselves by attributing what had passed to popular rage and fury, and pretend they consulted the safety of the apostles, by desiring them to go out of the city.</p>
