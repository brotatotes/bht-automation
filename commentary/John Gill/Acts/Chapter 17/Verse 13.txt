<p><strong>had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea</strong>; which they came at, either by persons that came from thence to Thessalonica, or by letters sent them:</p>
<p><strong>they came thither also</strong>; as the Jews from Antioch and Iconium came to Lystra on a like account, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:19">Acts 14:19</span></p>
<p><strong>and stirred up the people</strong>; the common people, the natives of the place, against the apostles; suggesting that they were wicked men, and enemies to all laws, human or divine, civil or religious.</p>
