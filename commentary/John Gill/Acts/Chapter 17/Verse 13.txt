But when the Jews of Thessalonica,.... The unbelieving Jews there,had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea; which they came at, either by persons that came from thence to Thessalonica, or by letters sent them:they came thither also; as the Jews from Antioch and Iconium came to Lystra on a like account, Acts 14:19and stirred up the people; the common people, the natives of the place, against the apostles; suggesting that they were wicked men, and enemies to all laws, human or divine, civil or religious.
