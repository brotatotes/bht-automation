<p><strong>And then immediately the brethren</strong>,.... That were at Berea, the new converts there:</p>
<p><strong>sent away Paul</strong>, whom they knew the Jews mostly sought after, and were offended with:</p>
<p><strong>to go as it were to the sea</strong>; the Aegean sea, or Archipelago, near to which Berea was: this seems to have been done, in order to make the people conclude that he intended to take shipping, and go into some other parts of the world, when the design was to go to Athens by foot, and so be safe from any lying in wait of his persecutors: the Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate Latin, and the Oriental versions read, "to go to the sea"; to the sea side, whither it seems he did go; and yet it looks as if he did not go by sea, but by land, to Athens:</p>
<p><strong>but Silas and Timotheus abode there still</strong>; at Berea, to confirm and strengthen the young converts there made.</p>
