<p><strong>Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill</strong>,.... Or of Areopagus, as it is better rendered in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:19">Acts 17:19</span> for it is the same place, and it is the same word that is here used: Paul stood in the midst of that court of judicature, amidst the Areopagites, the judges of that court, and the wise and learned philosophers of the different sects that were assembled together:</p>
<p><strong>and said, ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious</strong>; or "more religious", than any other persons, in other places, which has been observed before on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:16">Acts 17:16</span> they had more gods, and more altars, and more festivals, and were more diligent and studious in the worship of the gods, than others. And this manner of addressing them, both as citizens of Athens, and as very religious persons, and who, as such, greatly exceeded all others, must greatly tend to engage their attention to him.</p>
