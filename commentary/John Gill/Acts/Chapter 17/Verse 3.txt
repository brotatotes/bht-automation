<p><strong>Opening</strong>,.... That is, the Scriptures of the Old Testament, explaining and expounding them, giving the true sense of them; so this word is frequently used in Jewish writings e, as that such a Rabbi פתח, "opened", such a Scripture:</p>
<p><strong>and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead</strong>; he set this matter in a clear light, and made it plain and manifest, from the writings of the Old Testament, that there was a necessity of the Messiah's suffering and rising from the dead; or otherwise these Scriptures would not have been fulfilled, which have said that so it must be; for these things were not only necessary on account of God's decrees, and the covenant transactions the Son of God entered into, and on the account of the salvation of his people; but because of the types, promises, and prophecies of the Old Testament: the Scriptures which the apostle opened and set before them, and reasoned upon, showing the necessity of these things, very likely were such as these, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:1">Isaiah 53:1</span> with many others:</p>
<p><strong>and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ</strong>; he showed that all the things which were spoken of Christ, or the Messiah, in those Scriptures, were fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth, who was the subject matter, the sum and substance of his ministry; and therefore he must be the Messiah, and the only Saviour and Redeemer of lost sinners.</p>
