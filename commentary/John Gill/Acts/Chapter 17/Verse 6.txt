<p><strong>And when they found them not</strong>,.... In Jason's house, as they expected:</p>
<p><strong>they drew Jason, and certain brethren</strong>: the Syriac version adds, "who were there": in Jason's house, who either came along with the apostle, and lodged with him there; or they were some of the inhabitants of Thessalonica, who were lately converted, and were come thither in order to have some Christian conversation; these with Jason the rabble seized on, and in a rude and violent manner dragged them out of the house, and had them,</p>
<p><strong>unto the rulers of the city</strong>: the civil magistrates, the judges in courts of judicature, to which some of these belonged;</p>
<p><strong>crying</strong> in a very noisy and clamorous way;</p>
<p><strong>these that have turned the world upside down</strong>: the Syriac version reads, "the whole earth": the apostles, according to the cry of these men, had thrown the whole world into disorder, and had made disturbances in kingdoms and cities, wherever they came; and had made innovations in religion, and turned men from their old way of worship to another; these; say they,</p>
<p><strong>are come hither also</strong>; to make the like disorders and disturbances, as elsewhere.</p>
