And when they found them not,.... In Jason's house, as they expected:they drew Jason, and certain brethren: the Syriac version adds, "who were there": in Jason's house, who either came along with the apostle, and lodged with him there; or they were some of the inhabitants of Thessalonica, who were lately converted, and were come thither in order to have some Christian conversation; these with Jason the rabble seized on, and in a rude and violent manner dragged them out of the house, and had them,unto the rulers of the city: the civil magistrates, the judges in courts of judicature, to which some of these belonged;crying in a very noisy and clamorous way;these that have turned the world upside down: the Syriac version reads, "the whole earth": the apostles, according to the cry of these men, had thrown the whole world into disorder, and had made disturbances in kingdoms and cities, wherever they came; and had made innovations in religion, and turned men from their old way of worship to another; these; say they,are come hither also; to make the like disorders and disturbances, as elsewhere.
