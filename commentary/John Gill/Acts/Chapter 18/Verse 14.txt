And when Paul was now about to open his mouth,.... In his own defence, and plead his own cause, and answer to the charge exhibited against him:Gallio said unto the Jews, if it was matter of wrong; of injury to any man's person or property, as murder, theft, c.or wicked lewdness as fraud, forgery, perjury, treason, c.O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: his sense is, that it would be according to right reason, and agreeably to his office as a judge, to admit them and their cause, and try it, and hear them patiently, and what was to be said on both sides of the question, what the charges were, and the proof of them, and what the defendant had to say for himself. The Vulgate Latin version reads, "O men Jews" and so Beza's ancient copy.
