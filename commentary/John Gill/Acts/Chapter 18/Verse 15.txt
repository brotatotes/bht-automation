<p><strong>But if it be a question of words</strong>,.... "Or of the word", what the Jews called the word of God, which Gallio did not pretend to understand: "and names"; as the names of God, of Jesus, and of Christ, whether he is God, and the Messiah:</p>
<p><strong>and of your law</strong>; concerning circumcision, whether these Christians, and the proselytes they make, are obliged unto it:</p>
<p><strong>look ye to it</strong>; suggesting that this was a matter that lay before them, and they were the proper judges of, and might determine for themselves, since they had the free exercise of their religion, and a right of judging of everything that respected that within themselves, and for which they were best furnished, as having a more competent knowledge of them; as the Arabic version renders it, "and ye are more learned in these things"; and most conversant with them:</p>
<p><strong>for I will be no judge of such matters</strong>; and it would be well if every civil magistrate would act the same part, and not meddle with religious affairs, any further than to preserve the public peace.</p>
