<p><strong>Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes</strong>,.... These were not the Greeks or Gentiles that were devout persons, or converted to Christianity, and were on the side of Paul, and fell foul on Sosthenes, as being his chief accuser; for this is not agreeably to the spirit and character of such persons, but the profane and unconverted Greeks, who observing that Gallio sent the Jews away, with some resentment and contempt, were encouraged to fall upon the principal of them, and use him in a very ill manner; it is very likely that this person was afterwards converted, and is the same that is mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span>. The name is Greek, and there is one of this name mentioned among the executors of Plato's will w. This man was now</p>

<p><strong>and beat him before the judgment seat</strong>; of Gallio; before he and his friends could get out of court:</p>
<p><strong>and Gallio cared for none of these things</strong>; which might not be owing to any sluggishness in him, but to an ill opinion he had of the Jews, as being a turbulent and uneasy people, and therefore he connived at some of the insolencies of the people towards them; though it did not become him, as a magistrate, to act such a part, whose business it was to keep the public peace, to quell disorders, to protect men's persons, and property, and prevent abuse and mischief, and to correct and punish for it. The Arabic version renders it, "and no man made any account of Gallio"; they did not fear his resentment, he having drove the Jews from the judgment seat.</p>
