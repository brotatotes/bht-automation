<p><strong>And when he had landed at Caesarea</strong>,.... This was Caesarea Stratonis, formerly called Strato's tower: it would have been nearest for the apostle to have landed at Joppa, in order to go to Jerusalem, but that haven was a dangerous one; this was the safest, and which therefore Herod had repaired at a vast expense, and in honour of Caesar had called it by this name: of the port at Caesarea, and what a convenient and commodious one, as it was made by Herod, Josephus i gives a particular account, and who often calls this place Caesarea, παραλιος, "Caesarea by the sea" k; and in other Jewish l writings mention is made of this place as a sea port, and of שונתא דימא דקיסרין, "the shore of the sea of Caesarea": Josephus m sometimes calls it the port Sebastus, or Augustus, it being, as before observed, made by Herod, and so called in honour of Augustus Caesar; and in another place n, Sebastus the port of Caesarea: according to Jerom o, or a writer under his name, this was neither Caesarea Philippi, which indeed it could not be, that being an inland town; nor Caesarea formerly called Strato's tower, but a third Caesarea, the metropolis of Cappadocia: in which he must be mistaken, seeing that was no sea port, and the apostle could not be said to land there; nor did it lie in the way to Jerusalem from Ephesus; but this city was in Phenice, and lay between Joppa and Dora; which cities were maritime ones, but very disagreeable havens, because of the vehement strong winds from Africa: which rolling up the sand out of the sea upon the shore, would not admit of a quiet station p; wherefore the apostle chose to land here, and not at either of the said ports;</p>
<p><strong>and gone up</strong>; not to Caesarea, but to Jerusalem, from thence, which lay higher; and going to and from these places, is signified by a going up and down, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:30">Acts 9:30</span>. Moreover, the apostle had told the Ephesians, that he must go and keep the feast in Jerusalem, as he undoubtedly did: and yet if this does not refer to his going up thither, it will not be easy to observe that he went thither at all before his return to Ephesus; and besides, to suppose him to go from Caesarea to Antioch, was all one as to go back to Ephesus; and so to go, as one observes, by the same place to Jerusalem, into which he promised, in his return from Jerusalem, to come again, if God would:</p>
<p><strong>and saluted the church</strong>; at Jerusalem, the mother church:</p>
<p><strong>he went down to Antioch</strong>; in Syria, from whence he first set out.</p>
