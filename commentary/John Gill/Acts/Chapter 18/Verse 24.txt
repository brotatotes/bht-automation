<p><strong>And a certain Jew named Apollos</strong>,.... Who by some is thought to be the same with Apelles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:10">Romans 16:10</span>, his name is Greek, though he was a Jew, not only by religion, but by birth, being of a Jewish extract:</p>
<p><strong>born at Alexandria</strong>; in Egypt, which was built by Alexander the great, from whence it had its name; it was the metropolis of Egypt, and the seat of the kings of it; great numbers of Jews were in this place; here lived Philo the famous Jew:</p>
<p><strong>an eloquent man</strong>; in speech, as well as learned, wise, and "prudent", as the Ethiopic version renders it:</p>
<p><strong>and mighty in the Scriptures</strong>; of the Old Testament, particularly in the prophecies of them concerning the Messiah; he had thoroughly read them, and carefully examined them, and could readily cite them; as well as had great knowledge of them, and was capable of explaining them; he was "skilful in the Scriptures", as the Syriac version renders it; or he "knew" them, as the Ethiopic; he had large acquaintance with them, and was well versed in them: it is a Jewish way of speaking; so Ahithophel is said to be גבור בתורה, "mighty in the law" d; the same is said of the sons of Reuben e: this man</p>
<p><strong>came to Ephesus</strong>; after the departure of the Apostle Paul, and while Aquila and Priscilla were there; the reason of his coming hither was to preach the word, as he did.</p>
