<p><strong>And when they opposed themselves</strong>,.... To the truth, and contradicted themselves in many instances, and their own prophecies; or those books which they themselves allowed to be the oracles of God, and blasphemed both Christ, and the apostle, and the doctrine which he taught; and railed at him, and spoke evil of him, and used him in a very contumelious and reproachful manner, as they were used from contradicting to go to blaspheming; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:45">Acts 13:45</span></p>
<p><strong>he shook his raiment</strong>; his outer garment, and the dust off from it, as a testimony against them; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:14">Matthew 10:14</span></p>
<p><strong>and said unto them, your blood be upon your heads</strong>; meaning, that they were the authors of their own ruin and destruction; that they could not impute it to any other, when it came upon them; and that they were left inexcusable, and must bear their own iniquities, and the punishment of them: this clause is wanting in the Syriac version.</p>
<p><strong>I am clean</strong>; meaning from their blood; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:26">Acts 20:26</span>. The apostle seems to allude to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+33:4">Ezekiel 33:4</span> signifying, that he had discharged his duty as a preacher, and so had delivered his own soul from their blood being required at his hands; and that it rested entirely on themselves, and they were answerable for all their impenitence, unbelief, and blasphemy:</p>
<p><strong>from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles</strong>; in that city, and preach the Gospel to them, and no more enter into their synagogue, as it is very likely he afterwards never did; for though Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, was afterwards converted, yet his conversion seems to have been not in the synagogue, but in the house of Justus, which was hard by it. Compare with this <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:46">Acts 13:46</span>.</p>
