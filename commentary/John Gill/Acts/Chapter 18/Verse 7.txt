<p><strong>And he departed thence</strong>,..... Not from Corinth, but from the synagogue:</p>
<p><strong>and entered into a certain man's house named Justus</strong>; he did not return to Aquila and Priscilla, because they were Jews, lest he should be thought not to abide by his words, that he would henceforth go to the Gentiles; wherefore as he came out of the synagogue, he turned into a house adjoining to it, which belonged to one Justus: in one copy of Beza's, and in some others, and in the Vulgate Latin version, he is called "Titus Justus"; and in the Arabic version, "Titus the son of Justus"; the Syriac version only reads "Titus": whether this is not the same Titus, who afterwards was a companion of the apostle, and to whom he wrote an epistle, may be inquired.</p>
<p><strong>One that worshipped God</strong>; a Gentile, but a religious man, such an one as Cornelius: he might be a proselyte either of the gate, or of righteousness; though if he was the same with Titus, he could not be the latter, because he was not circumcised, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:3">Galatians 2:3</span> whose house joined hard to the synagogue; had this man been a Jew, his house might very well have been taken for the house which was</p>
<p>סמוך לבית הכנסת, "near to the synagogue", in which travellers were entertained, and ate, and drank, and lodged i; and that he was the person appointed to take care of them, and so a very suitable house for Paul, a stranger, to take up his lodging in. The Ethiopic version adds, very wrongly, taking it from the beginning of the next verse, "because he was the ruler of the synagogue"; as if Justus was the ruler of the synagogue; and this the reason why his house was so near; whereas not he, but Crispus, was the ruler, as follows.</p>
