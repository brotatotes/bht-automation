<p><strong>Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision</strong>,.... On a certain night as he was asleep, the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to him in a dream, and spake after this manner to him:</p>
<p><strong>be not afraid</strong>; it is very likely that after the baptism of Crispus and his family, and of many of the Corinthians, that both the Jews and the Gentiles were exasperated against the apostle; and his life might seem to be in danger, and he might be thinking of removing from hence for his preservation and safety; and might be advised to it by his friends, or at least that he should be incognito, and not be seen publicly: wherefore the Lord appears to him, and bids him not indulge any fears, or conceal himself and be silent,</p>
<p><strong>but speak, and hold not thy peace</strong>; preach freely and boldly the Gospel without fear of men; the fear of men should not stop the mouths of Christ's ministers.</p>
