<p><strong>And it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth</strong>,.... Whither he came after the Apostle Paul, and where he watered what the apostle had planted, and where he became very famous and eminent; insomuch that he was set up, though not with his will, at the head of a party, in opposition to the chief of the apostles, Peter and Paul; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Paul having passed through the upper coasts</strong>; that is, of Phrygia, Galatia, Pontus, Bithynia, Lydia, Lycaonia, and Paphlagonia;</p>
<p><strong>came to Ephesus</strong>; into Ionia, of which Ephesus was the chief city, and lay near the sea; wherefore the other countries are called the upper coasts; hither he came, according to his promise in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:21">Acts 28:21</span></p>
<p><strong>And finding certain disciples</strong>; such as believed in Christ, made a profession of him, and had been baptized in his name, for such were commonly called disciples: these do not seem to be persons, who were either converted by Paul, when he was at Ephesus before, or by Apollos, who had been there since, and was gone; but rather some who came hither from other parts, since the apostle was at this place; though indeed his stay at Ephesus before was so short, that they might be here, and he not hear of them, or meet with them.</p>
