<p><strong>Then certain of the vagabond Jews</strong>,.... Who strolled about from place to place, pretending to tell fortunes, cure diseases by charms, and dispossess devils by conjuration, and therefore are called as follows,</p>
<p><strong>exorcists</strong>; such there were among the Jews, as Justin Martyr observes h, who adjured by the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: these</p>
<p><strong>took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus</strong>; they imitated the Apostle Paul, and attempted to do as he did, using the same: name; hoping to get money or applause, or both, in this way; and it may be observed, that there were some who really did cast out devils in the name of Christ, who did not belong to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:22">Matthew 7:22</span></p>
<p><strong>Saying, we adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth</strong>; that is, to come out the bodies of those men which they had possessed: and the Jews made use of the name of Jesus for healing diseases; for it is said of one i, that</p>
<p>"he swallowed something which almost choked him, and one came, and muttered to him in the name of Jesus ben Pandira, and he was well''</p>
<p>The Alexandrian copy, Beza's ancient one, and others, the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions, read, "I adjure you", &amp;c.</p>
