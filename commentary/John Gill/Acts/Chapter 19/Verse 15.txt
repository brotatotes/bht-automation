<p><strong>And the evil spirit answered and said</strong>,.... The Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, add, "to them"; to the seven sons of Sceva:</p>
<p><strong>Jesus I know</strong>; to be the Son of God and Messiah, and own that he has power of dispossessing spirits, of which there were many instances in the days of his flesh:</p>
<p><strong>and Paul I know</strong>; and own to be a servant of the most high God, by whom miracles of this kind have been wrought:</p>
<p><strong>but who are ye</strong>? you are not the disciples of Jesus, nor the servants of God, but the children of the devil, and have no power over us, but on the other hand are subject to us.</p>
