<p><strong>And the man in whom the evil spirit was</strong>,.... Being agitated by him:</p>
<p><strong>leapt upon them</strong>; with great agility and force, and laid hold on them, and struggled with them, and beat and wounded them, and stripped them naked:</p>
<p><strong>and overcame them, and prevailed against them</strong>; the Alexandrian copy, Beza's most ancient one, and some others, and the Vulgate Latin version read, "and overcame both"; as if only two of these seven sons had made this attempt, and were so used; though the Ethiopic version reads, "and overcame them all"; all the seven sons:</p>
<p><strong>so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded</strong>; having their clothes tore off, and their bodies beat and bruised.</p>
