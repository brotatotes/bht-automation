In Jesus Christ, whose name was spoken of with great respect, and which spread fear in every person:came; to the apostle:and confessed; their sins; and acknowledged what a wicked life they had led:and showed their deeds; their former evil deeds, which they had been guilty of; one copy reads, "their sins"; see Matthew 3:6.
