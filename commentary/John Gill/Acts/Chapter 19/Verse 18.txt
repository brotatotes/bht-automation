<p><strong>And many that believed</strong>,.... In Jesus Christ, whose name was spoken of with great respect, and which spread fear in every person:</p>
<p><strong>came</strong>; to the apostle:</p>
<p><strong>and confessed</strong>; their sins; and acknowledged what a wicked life they had led:</p>
<p><strong>and showed their deeds</strong>; their former evil deeds, which they had been guilty of; one copy reads, "their sins"; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:6">Matthew 3:6</span>.</p>
