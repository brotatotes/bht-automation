<p><strong>After these things were ended</strong>,.... After that the apostle had disputed with the Jews in their synagogue, for the space of three months, and in the school of Tyrannus about two years; and after many souls had been converted at Ephesus, and were formed into a church state, and were established in the faith:</p>
<p><strong>when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia</strong>: in the former of which were the cities of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea, and in the latter, Corinth; where the apostle had already been, and preached the Gospel with success, and had laid the foundation of a Gospel church state in each place; but was willing to visit them again, both to confirm them in the doctrines of the Gospel, and, if it was the will of God, that he might be the instrument of converting others, and adding them to them, as well as to make some collections among them, for the poor saints at Jerusalem: for through these places he intended</p>
<p><strong>to go to Jerusalem</strong>; to visit the church there, and distribute to the poor what he had gathered, or should gather for them among the Gentile churches:</p>
<p><strong>saying, after I have been there, I must also see Rome</strong>; the metropolis of the empire, and the glory of the whole world; and which to see was one of Austin's three wishes: but the apostle's desire was not so much to see the magnificence of the city, as the saints in it; and that he might impart some spiritual gift unto them, and have some fruit among them; and be a means of quickening and comforting them, and of gaining others to them; and it was the will of God that he should go there; and this he spake by a prophetic spirit, and as being under the impulse of the Spirit of God; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:11">Acts 23:11</span>.</p>
