<p><strong>two of them that ministered unto him</strong>; that were his assistants in preaching the Gospel:</p>
<p><strong>Timotheus and Erastus</strong>; the former of these was a disciple he found at Lystra, and took along with him, and to whom he afterwards wrote two epistles; and the latter seems to be the same with him, who was chamberlain of the city of Corinth, and is said to abide there, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span> The Ethiopic version, instead of Erastus, wrongly reads Aristarchus; whereas it is certain, he was not sent into Macedonia, but was with the apostle at Ephesus in the tumult, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span>.</p>
<p><strong>But he himself stayed in Asia for a season</strong>; that is, at Ephesus, as the following narration shows.</p>
