<p><strong>For a certain man, named Demetrius, a silversmith</strong>,.... Who worked in silver, not in coining silver money, but in making silver vessels, in melting silver, and casting it into moulds, and forming it into different shapes; and particularly,</p>
<p><strong>which made silver shrines for Diana</strong>; who Diana was,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, these were not coins or medals of silver, struck by Demetrius, with the figure of the temple of Diana on them, nor images of Diana, as the Ethiopic version reads; but they were chaplets, or little temples made of silver, in imitation of the temple of Diana at Ephesus, with her image included in it; the words may be rendered, "silver temples": in some manuscripts it is added, "like little chests": which being sold to the people,</p>
<p><strong>brought no small gain to the craftsmen</strong>: who were of the same trade with him; masters of the same business, who employed others under them, as appears by what follows.</p>
