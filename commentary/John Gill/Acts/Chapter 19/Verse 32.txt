<p><strong>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another</strong>,.... Not in the church at Ephesus among the disciples, and friends of the apostle, as if they were divided in their sentiments about his going into the theatre, some being for it, and others against it; but the people that were gathered together in the theatre, these were not agreed about the reason of this tumult, some said it was on account of one thing, and some another:</p>
<p><strong>for the assembly was confused</strong>; the multitude of people that were gathered together were made up of different persons, of different employments and sentiments, and were in no manner of form or order:</p>
<p><strong>and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together</strong>; there was a noise and a hubbub in the city; but what was the reason and meaning of it, they were ignorant of; they were got together into the theatre in great numbers, but what was to be done there they knew not. And this is too often the case in religious assemblies, that the majority, at least many, can give no account of the reason, end, and design of their assembling together.</p>
