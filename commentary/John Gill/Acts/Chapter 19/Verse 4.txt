<p><strong>Then said Paul</strong>,.... In reply to their answer, understanding them that they were baptized by John, he takes it up, and gives an account of John's baptism: showing how agreeable it was, and that it was the same baptism with the baptism of Christ, being administered in his name:</p>
<p><strong>John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance</strong>; which required repentance antecedent to it, and was a fruit and effect, and so an evidence of it:</p>
<p><strong>saying unto the people</strong>; the people of the Jews, the common people, the multitude that attended on his ministry:</p>
<p><strong>that they should believe on him, which should come after him</strong>, that is, on Jesus Christ; so that he preached faith in Christ, as well as repentance towards God; and made the one as well as the other a necessary prerequisite unto baptism; which shows, that his baptism and Christian baptism are the same.</p>
