<p><strong>For we are in danger of being called in question</strong>,.... Or are liable to be called to an account, reproved, and punished by the Roman proconsul, appointed over this city, or by the Roman emperor, or the Roman senate: for this day's uproar; it being capable of being interpreted as a riot, tumult, and sedition:</p>
<p><strong>there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse</strong>: or no reason can be assigned, why such a number of people should gather together; none can be given that will justify it, or that can be alleged in favour of it.</p>
