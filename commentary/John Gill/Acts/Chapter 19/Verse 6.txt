<p><strong>And when Paul had laid his hands upon them</strong>,.... They having been before baptized, not by him, but by John, or one of his disciples, in the name of the Lord Jesus; just as Peter and John laid their hands upon the believing Samaritans, who had been before baptized by Philip, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:14">Acts 8:14</span> and the same extraordinary effects followed:</p>
<p><strong>the Holy Ghost came on them</strong>; in his extraordinary gifts, whose special grace they had before an experience of:</p>
<p><strong>and they spake with tongues</strong>; with other tongues, or in other languages, which they had never learned, or had been used to, as the disciples did at the day of "Pentecost": and prophesied; preached, having an extraordinary gift at once, of explaining the prophecies of the Old Testament, and also foretold things to come.</p>
