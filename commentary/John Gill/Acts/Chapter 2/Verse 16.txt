But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel. This affair, which is a matter of wonder and amazement with some, and of speculation with others, and of ridicule and contempt with the most, not the effect of wine, but the fulfilment of a prophecy in Joel 2:28 and is that effusion of the Spirit there foretold; and this prophecy is by the Jews themselves allowed to belong to the world to come, or to the times of the Messiah. Some of their commentators o say, that it refers לעתיד, "to time to come"; by which they frequently mean the times of the Messiah; and another says p expressly, that they belong לימית המשיח, "to the days of the Messiah"; and in one of their Midrashes q it is observed, that"the holy blessed God says in this world they prophesy single, (particular persons,) but "in the world to come" all "Israel" shall become prophets, as it is said, Joel 2:28 "and it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your old men", &c. So expounds R. Tanchums with R. Aba.''o Jarchi in Joel ii. 28. & R. Jeshuah in Aben Ezra in loc. p R. David Kimchi in loc. q Bemidbar Rabba, sect. 15. fol. 219. 2.
