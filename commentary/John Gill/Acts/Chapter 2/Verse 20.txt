<p><strong>The sun shall be turned into darkness</strong>,.... As at the death of Christ, by a total eclipse of it:</p>
<p><strong>and the moon into blood</strong>; as at the opening of the sixth seal, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:12">Revelation 6:12</span></p>
<p><strong>before that great and notable day of the Lord come</strong>; when he shall come in power and great glory, as he did in a few years after this, to take vengeance on the Jews, and destroy their nation, city, and temple; in which there was a display of his greatness, and power, and which was awful and "terrible" to them, as in Joel it is called;</p>
