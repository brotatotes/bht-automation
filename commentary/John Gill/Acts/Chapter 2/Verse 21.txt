<p><strong>And it shall come to pass</strong>,.... Even at that time, when these signs shall appear, and the destruction is hastening on, that</p>
<p><strong>whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord</strong>; shall believe in the Lord Jesus Christ with the heart, and shall confess him with the mouth, and shall worship him in Spirit and in truth, and submit to all his ordinances and commands; for invocation of the Lord includes the whole of worship, internal and external:</p>
<p><strong>shall be saved</strong>; or delivered from that temporal destruction which came upon the Jews, as the Christians were by removing from Jerusalem to Pella, as they were directed u; and shall be saved with a spiritual and everlasting salvation by Jesus Christ;</p>
