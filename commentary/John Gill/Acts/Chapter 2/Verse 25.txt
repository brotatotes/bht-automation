<p><strong>For David speaketh concerning him</strong>,.... The Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:8">Psalms 16:8</span>. The whole psalm belongs to the Messiah, and everything concerning the person in it agrees with him; such as his trust in God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:1">Psalms 16:1</span> as he was man and Mediator; his very great regard to the saints, and delight in them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:2">Psalms 16:2</span> his disregard to others who were hastening after another God, or another Saviour, whose sacrifices, as an high priest, he would not offer up, nor make intercession for them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:4">Psalms 16:4</span> his exceeding great satisfaction in having the God of Israel for his portion, and in having his lot cast among his peculiar people, who were a delightful inheritance to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:5">Psalms 16:5</span> his thankfulness for advice and direction in the time of his sorrows and sufferings; and his dependence on the almighty power of God to support and protect him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:7">Psalms 16:7</span> and the joy and comfort he was filled with in the view of his resurrection from the dead, and his enjoyment of the heavenly glory, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:9">Psalms 16:9</span>,</p>
<p><strong>I foresaw the Lord always before my face</strong>; Christ always had Jehovah in view throughout the whole of his life; and in his last moments he had respect unto the glory of his perfections, as the ultimate end of his obedience and sufferings; and to his purposes, council, and covenant, which were to be accomplished by him; and to his will and command in preaching the Gospel, working miracles, going about to do good, in obeying the precept, and bearing the penalty of the law; as well as to his promises, and his power to assist, support, and preserve him, as man and Mediator:</p>
<p><strong>for he is on my right hand</strong>; which expresses his nearness to him, his presence with him, his readiness to assist him, and his protection of him; as if he was his second that stood by him, to take his part, and, if need be, to take up his cause, and defend him from his enemies; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+109:31">Psalms 109:31</span></p>
<p><strong>that I should not be moved</strong>; from his station, place, and duty; from the cause he was engaged in, so as to relinquish it; or with the fear of men, or fury of devils, or wrath of God, whilst he was doing and suffering, according to the will of God.</p>
