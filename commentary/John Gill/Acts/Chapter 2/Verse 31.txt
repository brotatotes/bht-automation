He seeing this before,.... Or by a spirit of prophecy foreseeing it, that according to God's promise and oath, the Messiah would be raised up, and spring from his seed; and also by the same Spirit foresaw that he would suffer and die, and be laid in the grave, the pit of corruption:spake of the resurrection of Christ; from the dead, to the sense of the following words, in Psalms 16:10.that his soul was not left in hell: neither his separate soul in Hades, nor his body in the grave;neither his flesh did see corruption; or his body, or his "carcass", as the Syriac version renders it, did not lie so long in the grave as to rot and putrefy.
