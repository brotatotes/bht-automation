<p><strong>He seeing this before</strong>,.... Or by a spirit of prophecy foreseeing it, that according to God's promise and oath, the Messiah would be raised up, and spring from his seed; and also by the same Spirit foresaw that he would suffer and die, and be laid in the grave, the pit of corruption:</p>
<p><strong>spake of the resurrection of Christ</strong>; from the dead, to the sense of the following words, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:10">Psalms 16:10</span>.</p>
<p><strong>that his soul was not left in hell</strong>: neither his separate soul in Hades, nor his body in the grave;</p>
<p><strong>neither his flesh did see corruption</strong>; or his body, or his "carcass", as the Syriac version renders it, did not lie so long in the grave as to rot and putrefy.</p>
