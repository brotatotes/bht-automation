<p><strong>Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted</strong>,.... After his resurrection he ascended to heaven, and was exalted in human nature; "to the right hand of God", as the Ethiopic version; and the Arabic version used by De Dieu read; an honour that never was conferred on any creature, angels or men, besides: or he was exalted and raised to the high honour and dignity of a Prince and Saviour, of Lord, Head, and King, so as to have a name, dominion, and authority over all, by the mighty power of God, which is sometimes called his right hand; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:15">Psalms 118:15</span>.</p>
<p><strong>and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost</strong>; which the Father had promised to pour forth in the last days, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+44:3">Isaiah 44:3</span> and which Christ had promised to send from the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16">John 14:16</span> and which, upon his ascension and exaltation, he received as Mediator from him; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:18">Psalms 68:18</span> compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:8">Ephesians 4:8</span></p>
<p><strong>he hath shed forth this</strong>; this Holy Spirit, or promised Spirit, these gifts of his; and so the Syriac version renders it, "he hath shed forth this gift"; which expresses both the plenty and abundance of the gifts bestowed, and the liberality of Christ in the donation of them: it is added,</p>
<p><strong>which ye now see and hear</strong>; meaning the cloven tongues, as of fire, which they saw sitting on the disciples, and the various languages which they heard them speak. The Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, leave out the word "now": and the Syriac, in the room of it, reads, "behold".</p>
