<p><strong>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost</strong>,.... With the gifts of the Holy Spirit; they had received the Spirit before, as a Spirit of grace, and were endowed with great gifts; but now they had great plenty of them, a large abundance; they were like vessels filled to the brim; they were as it were covered with them; there was an overflow of them upon them; and now it was, that they were baptized with him; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. Not only the twelve apostles, but the seventy disciples; and it may be all the hundred and twenty, that were together, even women as well as men: <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And began to speak with other tongues</strong>; besides, and different from that in which they were born and brought up, and usually spake; they spake divers languages, one spoke one language, and another, another; and the same person spoke with various tongues, sometimes one language, and sometimes another. These are the new tongues, Christ told them they should speak with, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:17">Mark 16:17</span> such as they had never heard, learned, nor known before:</p>
<p><strong>as the Spirit gave them utterance</strong>; they did not utter anything of themselves, and what came into their minds, things of little or no importance; nor in a confused and disorderly manner; but they were wise and weighty sentences they delivered, as the word signifies; even the wonderful works of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:11">Acts 2:11</span> the great doctrines of the Gospel; and though in different languages, yet in a very orderly and distinct manner, so as to be heard and understood by the people. The Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions read, "as the Holy Spirit", &amp;c.</p>
