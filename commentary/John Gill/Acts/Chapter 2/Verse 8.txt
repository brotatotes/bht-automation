<p><strong>And how hear we every man in our own tongue</strong>,.... Them speaking, as the Ethiopic version reads; that is, we everyone of us hear one or another, speak in the same language,</p>
<p><strong>wherein we were born</strong>; our native language; for though these men were Jews by descent, yet were born and brought up in other countries, which language they spake; and not the Hebrew, or Syriac, or Chaldee.</p>
