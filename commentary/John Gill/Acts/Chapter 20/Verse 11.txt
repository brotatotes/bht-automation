When he therefore was come up again,.... Into the upper room, where he was before, and where the disciples were gathered together:and had broken bread and eaten; administered the Lord's supper, and also eat for his bodily refreshment:and talked a long while: about the ordinance and the doctrines of the Gospel, and spiritual experience, and such like divine things:even till break of day; not knowing when to leave off:so he departed; without taking any rest; though before he departed, what follows was done; it was at this time he left his cloak, books, and parchments here, 2 Timothy 4:13.
