<p><strong>and had broken bread and eaten</strong>; administered the Lord's supper, and also eat for his bodily refreshment:</p>
<p><strong>and talked a long while</strong>: about the ordinance and the doctrines of the Gospel, and spiritual experience, and such like divine things:</p>
<p><strong>even till break of day</strong>; not knowing when to leave off:</p>
<p><strong>so he departed</strong>; without taking any rest; though before he departed, what follows was done; it was at this time he left his cloak, books, and parchments here, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:13">2 Timothy 4:13</span>.</p>
