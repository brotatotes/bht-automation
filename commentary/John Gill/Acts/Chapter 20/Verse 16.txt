<p><strong>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus</strong>,.... That is, to sail by it, without calling at it, as he did, for it lay by the shore before he came to Miletus; but he chose not to stop there, fearing he should be detained by the brethren there:</p>
<p><strong>because he would not spend the time in Asia</strong>; of which Ephesus was the metropolis:</p>
<p><strong>for he hasted, if it were possible, for him to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost</strong>: which was near at hand; for it was but fifty days from the second day of the passover, which feast was over when he sailed from Philippi; and at Troas he stayed seven days, and he had been several days sailing already; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:6">Acts 20:6</span>. And his great desire to be at the feast of Pentecost was not in order to keep that feast, according to the usage of the Jews; but that he might have an opportunity of preaching the Gospel to a great number of Jews, out of all countries, whom he knew would come to that feast.</p>
