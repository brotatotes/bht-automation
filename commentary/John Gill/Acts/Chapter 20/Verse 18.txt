<p><strong>And when they were come to him</strong>,.... That is, when the elders or pastors of the church at Ephesus were come to the apostle at Miletus:</p>
<p><strong>he said unto them, ye know, from the first day I came into Asia</strong>; to Ephesus the chief city in it:</p>
<p><strong>after what manner I have been with you at all seasons</strong>; what was his conduct, conversation, and constant manner of life; which the apostle takes notice of, not to commend himself, or to obtain applause of men; but either in vindication of himself, against those that were ready to charge and censure him; or to recommend the doctrine which he taught; and chiefly for the imitation of these elders, he had sent for, and convened in this place; and he appeals to themselves, as eyewitnesses of what he was going to say.</p>
