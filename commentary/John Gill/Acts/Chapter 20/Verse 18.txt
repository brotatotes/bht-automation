And when they were come to him,.... That is, when the elders or pastors of the church at Ephesus were come to the apostle at Miletus:he said unto them, ye know, from the first day I came into Asia; to Ephesus the chief city in it:after what manner I have been with you at all seasons; what was his conduct, conversation, and constant manner of life; which the apostle takes notice of, not to commend himself, or to obtain applause of men; but either in vindication of himself, against those that were ready to charge and censure him; or to recommend the doctrine which he taught; and chiefly for the imitation of these elders, he had sent for, and convened in this place; and he appeals to themselves, as eyewitnesses of what he was going to say.
