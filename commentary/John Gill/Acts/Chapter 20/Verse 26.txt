<p><strong>Wherefore I take you to record this day</strong>,.... This is a solemn appeal to the elders of the church at Ephesus, who knew his doctrine and manner of life for a considerable time among them:</p>
<p><strong>that I am pure from the blood of all men</strong>: or "of you all", as some copies, and the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read; which seems most natural, since they could only bear a testimony for him with respect to themselves, and the people at Ephesus, where he had so behaved both in the faithful discharge of his ministry, and in his exemplary life and conversation; as that the ruin and destruction of no one of them could be laid to his charge, or any one perish for want of knowledge, or through any negligence of his; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+33:6">Ezekiel 33:6</span>.</p>
