<p><strong>Yea, you yourselves know</strong>,.... So far was the apostle from desiring to have other men's money, or to wear their apparel, or to eat their bread, that he could appeal to these elders for the truth of it, they having been eyewitnesses of it:</p>
<p><strong>that these hands have ministered unto my necessities</strong>; meaning, that he had wrought with his hands, which he then held up, or stretched out, at tent making, along with Aquila and Priscilla, at Ephesus, as he had done before at Corinth, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</span> and therewith supplied himself with necessaries for food and clothing; for though he had a power, as a minister of the Gospel, to forbear working, and to insist upon a maintenance from the churches, yet in some cases, and in some places, he chose rather to forego that, lest he should either any ways hinder the progress of the Gospel at the first preaching of it, or be burdensome to the churches, or give the false teachers any handle against him; and he not only supported himself in this way, but assisted others also:</p>
<p><strong>and to them that were with me</strong>; as Luke, Timothy, and others; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>.</p>
