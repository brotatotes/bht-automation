Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake,.... InActs 20:25 it filled them with sorrow to part with him; but this was increased, and made almost intolerable by what he said,that they should see his face no more: could they have hoped to have seen him again, it would have made their parting with him more easy; but to be told they should never see him more in this world, it cut them to the heart; which shows what a share the apostle had in their hearts and affections, and not without good reason: however, that they might have a sight of him as long as they could, they went along with him to see him take shipping, and to see the last of him.And they accompanied him unto the ship: which lay at Miletus waiting for him.
