<p><strong>there came down from Judea a certain prophet named Agabus</strong>; of whom mention is made in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span> who is there said to come from Jerusalem, to Antioch, and here from Judea to Caesarea; he had been many years going about from place to place prophesying, for between that and this account must be a space of about sixteen or seventeen years.</p>
