<p><strong>And when he was come unto us</strong>,.... In Philip's house:</p>
<p><strong>he took Paul's girdle and bound his own hands and feet</strong>; and so prophesied by types and symbols, and gestures, as the prophets of old did; as Isaiah in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+20:2">Isaiah 20:2</span> and Jeremiah in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+13:1">Jeremiah 13:1</span>, and Ezekiel in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+4:1">Ezekiel 4:1</span> and Hosea in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ho+1:2">Hosea 1:2</span>, some understand this of his binding Paul's hands and feet, but it seems rather to design his own:</p>
<p><strong>and said, thus saith the Holy Ghost</strong>; who was in Agabus, and spoke by him, and foretold some things to come to pass; and which did come to pass, and is a proof of the foreknowledge, and so of the deity of the blessed Spirit:</p>
<p><strong>so shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owns this girdle</strong>; meaning Paul, and who accordingly was bound in like manner, a very little time after this; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:33">Acts 21:33</span></p>
<p><strong>and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles</strong>; the Romans, as they afterwards did.</p>
