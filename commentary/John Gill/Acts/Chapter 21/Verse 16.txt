<p><strong>There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea</strong>,.... Members of the church at Caesarea; of the church here, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. To which may be added the account of the pastors or bishops of this church, as given by Reland o; Theophilus, who was in the council held at Caesarea, in the year 198; Agricola, who subscribed in the council at Ancyra, in the year 314; though some, he says, do not acknowledge this Agricola, but give the order of them after Theophilus thus; Theoctistus, Domnus, Theotecnus, Agapius, Eusebius; which last was in the council at Palestine, in the year 318, and in the council at Nice, in the year 325. Acacius succeeded him, and was in a little council at Seleucia, in the year 359, and in another at Antioch, in the year 363. Thalassius subscribed in the council at Constantinople, in the year 381. Eulogius, or perhaps Euzoius, was in the council at Diospolis, in the year 415. Glyco, bishop of this church, subscribed by Zozimus in the Chalcedon council, held in the year 451. Mention is made of Irenaeus, who presided over it in the acts of the same council; and Elias, another bishop of it, subscribed in the council at Jerusalem, in the year 536; and there is an account of John bishop of this church, in the acts of the council at Constantinople, in the year 553.</p>
<p><strong>And brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus</strong>; the name of Mnason is Greek; there was one of this name among the disciples of Aristotle, who was of Phocea, or Phocis, a place in Greece p; and another called Mnaseas, which seems to be the same whom Ammonius q makes mention of; and we frequently read of Mnaseas, the name of an author in Greek writers, and Menestheus, in:</p>
<p>"Now when Apollonius the son of Menestheus was sent into Egypt for the coronation of king Ptolemeus Philometor, Antiochus, understanding him not to be well affected to his affairs, provided for his own safety: whereupon he came to Joppa, and from thence to Jerusalem:'' (2 Maccabees 4:21)</p>
<p>all which are so called from remembrance, and signify one that has a memory, is mindful of, and remembers things; so Zachariah with the Jews, is a name that is taken from remembrance, as this: some copies read Jasson, for Mnason. This Mnason was an</p>
<p><strong>old disciple</strong>; not of Aristotle, or of his sect of philosophers, or any other, but of Jesus Christ; probably he might have seen Christ in the flesh, and he is by some thought to be one of the seventy disciples; or at least he might be one of those who became disciples and followers of Christ; through the ministry of Paul and Barnabas in that island, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:4">Acts 13:4</span> though that seems scarcely long enough ago, being but fifteen years before this time, to denominate him an old disciple:</p>
<p><strong>with whom we should lodge</strong>; when come to Jerusalem; for though he was of the island of Cyprus, as Barnabas was, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:36">Acts 4:36</span>, yet he dwelt at Jerusalem; and if he was one of the seventy disciples, it should seem that he had not sold his house at Jerusalem, when others did; nor did all that had houses and land, nor were they obliged to do it; or he might have bought or hired one since; however, he had one at Jerusalem, and here the apostle and his company were fixed to lodge, during their stay there; and there was the more reason to provide for a lodging at this time, because of the feast of Pentecost, when the city was full of people: unless this is to be understood of any place by the way, where they should lodge; since Beza's ancient copy adds, "and coming to a certain village, we were with one Mnason".</p>
