<p><strong>And finding a ship sailing over unto Phoenicia</strong>,.... For it seems that the ship they went aboard at Assos, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:13">Acts 20:13</span> went no further, at least in the way the apostle was going, than Patara; but lighting on another ship, which was bound for Phoenicia, for the city of Tyre, which bordered on the land of Israel, and indeed originally belonged to Canaan; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span>.</p>
<p><strong>we went aboard</strong>; the said ship:</p>
<p><strong>and set forth</strong>; on the voyage.</p>
