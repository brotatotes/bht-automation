<p><strong>Them take, and purify, thyself with them</strong>,.... That is, join thyself to them, make one of their number, and attend to the rules prescribed to a Nazarite, who is to be holy to the Lord; and in case of any ceremonial uncleanness, is to be cleansed, or purified in the manner directed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:5">Numbers 6:5</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And be at charges with them</strong>; join with them in the expense, for the offerings to be made at the end of the vows, or when the days of separation are fulfilled, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:13">Numbers 6:13</span>.</p>
<p><strong>That they may shave their heads</strong>; according to the law in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:18">Numbers 6:18</span>. This was done in לשכת הנזירים, the chamber of the Nazarites r; for there the Nazarites boiled their peace offerings, and shaved their hair, and put it under the pot, in the fire that was under it: Maimonides says s,</p>
<p>"if he shaved in the city it was excusable; but whether he shaved in the city or in the sanctuary, under the pot his hair must be cast; and he did not shave until the door of the court was opened, as it is said, "at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:18">Numbers 6:18</span> not that he shaved over against the door, for that would be a contempt of the sanctuary.''</p>
<p>Moreover, it may be observed, that a person who had not made a vow, or fulfilled a Nazariteship himself, which was the apostle's case, yet he might join in bearing the expenses of others, at the time of their shaving and cleansing: for so run the Jewish canons t;</p>
<p>"he that says, upon me be the shaving of a Nazarite, he is bound to bring the offerings of shaving for purification, and he may offer them by the hand of what Nazarite he pleases; he that says, upon me be half the offerings of a Nazarite, or if he says, upon me be half the shaving of a Nazarite, he brings half the offerings by what Nazarite he will, and that Nazarite perfects his offerings out of that which is his.''</p>
<p><strong>That all may know that those things whereof they were informed concerning thee are nothing</strong>; that there is no truth in them; that they are mere lies and calumnies; as they will easily judge by this single instance, in complying with the law concerning a Nazarite's vow:</p>
<p><strong>but that thou thyself walkest orderly, and keepest the law</strong>; and therefore can never be thought to teach others to walk disorderly, or to neglect the law, the rites and customs of it.</p>
