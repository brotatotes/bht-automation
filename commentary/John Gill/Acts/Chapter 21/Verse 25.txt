<p><strong>As touching the Gentiles which believe</strong>,.... This is said, to show that the Jews were not offended with Paul, for not insisting upon the circumcision of the believing Gentiles, and their conformity to the ceremonial law; and to remove an objection that Paul might make, that should he comply with this advice, and the believing Gentiles should hear of it, it might be a stumblingblock and a snare to them; who by his example, might think themselves obliged to regard the law: Beza's ancient copy adds, "they have nothing to say to thee"; for as it follows,</p>
<p><strong>we have written and concluded</strong>; some years ago, at a meeting of the apostles, elders, and brethren at Jerusalem, when Paul was present; and of which he reminds him, to prevent any objection of this kind; where it was unanimously agreed on and determined,</p>
<p><strong>that they observe no such things</strong>; as circumcision, and other rites and customs of the law, and particularly the vow of the Nazarite, which Gentiles are free from: hence it is said u,</p>
<p>"Gentiles have no Nazariteship;''</p>
<p>upon which one of the commentators says w, if a Gentile vows Nazariteship, the law of the Nazarite does not fall upon him, he is not obliged to it:</p>
<p><strong>save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols</strong>, &amp;c. see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:19">Acts 15:19</span>.</p>
