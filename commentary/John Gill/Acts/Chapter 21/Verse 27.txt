<p><strong>And when the seven days were almost ended</strong>,.... The Syriac version renders it, "when the seventh day was come"; from the time that Paul came to Jerusalem: some understand this of the seven weeks from the passover to Pentecost, and that it was when they were almost ended, and the day of Pentecost was at hand, for which Paul came up to Jerusalem; but rather, the seven days of purification of the Nazarites are meant:</p>
<p><strong>the Jews which were of Asia</strong>; and it may be chiefly of Ephesus, the metropolis of Asia; who knew Paul there, and were his implacable enemies; for this is to be understood of the unbelieving Jews, who were come up to the feast of Pentecost:</p>
<p><strong>when they saw him in the temple</strong>; where he was come to bring his offering, on account of his vow:</p>
<p><strong>stirred up all the people</strong>; against the apostle; incensed them with stories about him, how that he was an opposer of Moses and his laws, and was now defiling the temple, by bringing in Heathens into it:</p>
<p><strong>and laid hands on him</strong>; in a violent manner, and dragged him out of the temple.</p>
