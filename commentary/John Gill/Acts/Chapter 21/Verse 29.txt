<p><strong>For they had seen before with him in the city</strong>,.... Not of Ephesus, but of Jerusalem:</p>
<p><strong>Trophimus an Ephesian</strong>; the same that is mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span> whom these Jews of Asia, and who very probably were inhabitants of Ephesus, knew very well to be a Gentile:</p>
<p><strong>whom they supposed Paul had brought into the temple</strong>; for seeing him walk with the apostle very familiarly through the streets of Jerusalem, they concluded from thence, that he took him with him into the temple, which was a very rash and ill grounded conclusion; and which shows the malignity and virulence of their minds, and how ready they were to make use of any opportunity, and take up any occasion against him, even a bare surmise, and which had no show of probability in it; for it can never be thought, that while Paul was using methods to remove the prejudices of the Jews against him, he should take such a step as this, to introduce a Gentile into the holy place, which he knew was unlawful, and would greatly irritate and provoke them.</p>
