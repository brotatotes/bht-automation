<p><strong>And all the city was moved, and the people ran together</strong>,.... The outcry in the temple reached the ears of some that were without, and these alarmed others; so that the report of a disturbance in the temple soon went through the whole city; and brought people out of their houses, who ran together in great numbers, to see what was the matter:</p>
<p><strong>and they took Paul and drew him out of the temple</strong>; as unworthy to be in that holy place; and that it might not be defiled with his blood; for their intention was nothing less than to take away his life:</p>
<p><strong>and forthwith the doors were shut</strong>; not of themselves, as if there was something miraculous in it, as some have thought, but by the door keepers, the Levites; and which might be done, partly to prevent Paul's returning into it for refuge at the horns of the altar, and partly to keep out the Gentiles from coming in, they were alarmed with.</p>
