<p><strong>Then the chief captain came near</strong>,.... To the place where the Jews were beating Paul:</p>
<p><strong>and took him</strong> the Arabic version adds, "from them"; he rescued him out of their hands, as he himself says, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:27">Acts 23:27</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And commanded him to be bound with two chains</strong>: partly to appease the people, and partly to secure Paul; who, he supposed, had been guilty of some misdemeanour, which had occasioned this tumult; these two chains were put, one on one arm, and the other on the other arm; and were fastened to two soldiers, who walked by him, having hold on those chains, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left; and thus Agabus's prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:11">Acts 21:11</span> was fulfilled:</p>
<p><strong>and demanded who he was</strong>; or asked and inquired about him, who he was, of what nation he was, what was his character, business, and employment: this inquiry was made, either of the apostle himself, or of the people; and so the Arabic version renders it, "he inquired of them who he was"; also</p>
<p><strong>and what he had done</strong>; what crime he had been guilty of, that they used him in such a manner.</p>
