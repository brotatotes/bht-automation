<p><strong>And as Paul was to be led into the castle</strong>,.... Just as he was got up to the top of the steps, or stairs, that led up to the castle, and was about to go into the door of it:</p>
<p><strong>he said unto the chief captain, may I speak unto thee</strong>? the apostle was one that had had a good education, and was a man of address, and this his modest and respectful way of speaking to the chief captain shows; and the question he put to him, was in the Greek language: hence it follows,</p>
<p><strong>who said to him, canst thou speak Greek</strong>? or "dost thou know the Hellenistic language?" which the Jews who were born and lived in Greece spoke; hence such were called Hellenists; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span> of this language we read in the Talmud h;</p>
<p>"R. Levi bar Chajethah went to Caesarea, and heard them reading "Shema", (hear O Israel), c. <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+6:4">Deuteronomy 6:4</span></p>
<p>אלוניסתין in the Hellenistic language he sought to hinder them; R. Rose heard of it, and was angry; and said, he that knows not to read in the Hebrew language, must he not read at all? yea, he may read in whatsoever language he understands.''</p>
<p>The nearest to this language spoken by the Jews dispersed in Greece, must be the Greek language, in which Jews have written; as the books of the Old Testament translated by the "seventy" interpreters, who were Jews; and indeed it was this Bible which the Jews called Hellenists made use of; and the writings of Josephus, and Philo the Jew of Alexandria, and even the books of the New Testament, which are written by Jews; and Paul being a Jew of Tarsus, and so an Hellenist, could speak this language; as he did, when he disputed against the Hellenists, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:29">Acts 9:29</span>. This the chief captain said, either as wondering to hear him speak Greek, when he thought he had been a Jerusalem Jew, or rather an Egyptian, as in the next verse; or it may be he put this question to him, as choosing rather that he should speak in Greek, it being the language he might best understand himself, and was the least known to the people, who he might not care should hear what he had to say; since if he took him for the Egyptian, the Greek tongue was what was chiefly spoken by such.</p>
