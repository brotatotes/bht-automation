And when we had accomplished those days,.... The seven days before mentioned:we departed and went our way; from their quarters where they lodged, or from some one house of the disciples, where they met, and had conversed together:and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city; that is, the disciples, even all of them that dwelt in that city, with their whole families, their wives and children, accompanied the apostle and those that were with him, through the streets of the city of Tyre, till they came out of it to the shore, where lay the ship they were to go aboard; and which was a mark of their affection and respect to the apostle, as well as a token of their public spirit, that they were not ashamed of Christ and his ministers, nor of their profession of the Gospel:and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed; which was agreeably to the custom of the Jews, who had, as Tertullian observes w, their "orationes litterales", their prayers at the sea shore; :-.w Ad nationes, l. 1. c. 13.
