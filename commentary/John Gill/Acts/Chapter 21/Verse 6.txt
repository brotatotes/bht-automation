<p><strong>And when we had taken our leave one of another</strong>,.... The Alexandrian copy reads, "having prayed, we saluted one another"; with a kiss, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:37">Acts 20:37</span> and so parted:</p>
<p><strong>we took ship</strong>; or went aboard the ship,</p>
<p><strong>and they returned home again</strong>; to their own houses, as the Syriac version renders it; for by "their own", as it is in the Greek text, cannot be meant their families, their wives, and children, for these were along with them, but their habitations; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:32">John 16:32</span>.</p>
