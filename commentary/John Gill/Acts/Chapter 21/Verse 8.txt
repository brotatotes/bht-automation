<p><strong>And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed</strong>,.... From Ptolemais, as Sopater, Aristarchus, Secundus, Timotheus, Tychicus, Trophimus, and Luke, the writer of this history; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span></p>
<p><strong>and came unto Caesarea</strong>; not Caesarea Philippi, mentioned in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:13">Matthew 16:13</span> but that Caesarea which was formerly called Strato's tower, and was a very good sea port; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:40">Acts 8:40</span>.</p>
<p><strong>and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist</strong>; not a writer of a Gospel, but a preacher of the Gospel, and perhaps not an ordinary one, but was one of those spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span> which was an office inferior to an apostle, and yet above an ordinary pastor and teacher; this man, very likely, was the same that taught in Samaria, and baptized the eunuch, and who after that settled at Caesarea; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:40">Acts 8:40</span>.</p>
<p><strong>which was one of the seven</strong>; of the seven deacons of the church at Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:5">Acts 6:5</span> and abode with him; so long as they continued at Caesarea.</p>
