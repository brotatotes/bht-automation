So that he was a married man, which may be observed against the Papists, who forbid marriage to ecclesiastics: and they were,virgins: not under any vow of virginity, but they had not as yet changed their state of life, and were pure and incorrupt:which did prophesy; not explain and interpret Scripture, or preach in public assemblies; for these were not allowed women, neither in the Jewish synagogues, nor in Christian assemblies; but they were endowed with a gift of foretelling future events, as was promised such should have in Gospel times, Joel 2:28.
