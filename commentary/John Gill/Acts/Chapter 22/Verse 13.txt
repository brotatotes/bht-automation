<p><strong>Came unto me</strong>,.... Being at the house of Judas, in that street of Damascus called Straight, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:11">Acts 9:11</span> and stood; at the side of him, or by him, putting his hands on him:</p>
<p><strong>and said unto me, brother Saul</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:11- :">Acts 9:11- :</span>.</p>
<p><strong>receive thy sight</strong>, "or look up",</p>
<p><strong>and the same hour I looked up upon him</strong>; that is, immediately, directly: for so the phrase, "that same hour", is frequently used by the Jews: the words in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:21">Numbers 16:21</span> "that I may consume them in a moment", are rendered by Onkelos, "that I may consume them in an hour"; for an hour is used for a moment with them.</p>
