Came unto me,.... Being at the house of Judas, in that street of Damascus called Straight, Acts 9:11 and stood; at the side of him, or by him, putting his hands on him:and said unto me, brother Saul; Acts 9:11- :.receive thy sight, "or look up",and the same hour I looked up upon him; that is, immediately, directly: for so the phrase, "that same hour", is frequently used by the Jews: the words in Numbers 16:21 "that I may consume them in a moment", are rendered by Onkelos, "that I may consume them in an hour"; for an hour is used for a moment with them.
