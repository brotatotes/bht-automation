<p><strong>And it came to pass, that when I was come again to Jerusalem</strong>,.... Which was three years after his conversion; for he did not immediately return to Jerusalem, but went into Arabia; and when he returned to Damascus, which was three years after he came to Jerusalem; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:17">Galatians 1:17</span></p>
<p><strong>even while I prayed in the temple</strong>; the temple was an house of prayer; hither persons resorted for that purpose; and as the apostle had been used to it, he continued this custom, and during the time of prayer he fell into an ecstasy:</p>
<p><strong>I was in a trance</strong>: and knew not whether he was in the body, or out of the body: whether this was the time he refers to in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:2">2 Corinthians 12:2</span> is not certain, though probable.</p>
