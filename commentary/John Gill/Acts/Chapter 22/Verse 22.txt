<p><strong>And they gave him audience unto this word</strong>..... The Ethiopic version reads, "and I heard him so speaking unto me"; as if it was to be understood of the apostle hearing Christ speaking to him concerning his mission to the Gentiles; whereas the words refer to the Jews attending quietly to the apostle, till he came to that part of his oration. They heard him patiently, and did not offer to molest him, or hinder his speaking, and being heard, till he came to mention his mission to the Gentiles: all the rest they either did not understand, or looked upon it as an idle tale, as the effect of madness and enthusiasm, at least as containing things they had nothing to do with; but when he came to speak of the Gentiles, and to pretend to a divine mission to them, this they could not bear; for nothing was more offensive, irritating, and provoking to them, than to hear of the calling of the Gentiles, whom they were for depriving of all blessings, and for engrossing all to themselves; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:20">Romans 10:20</span>.</p>
<p><strong>and then lift up their voices</strong>; in a very loud and clamorous manner, as one man:</p>
<p><strong>and said, away with such a fellow from the earth</strong>; take away his life from the earth: this they said either to the chief captain, to do it, or as encouraging one another to do it:</p>
<p><strong>for it is not fit that he should live</strong>; he does not deserve to live, he is unworthy of life; it is not agreeable to the rules of justice that he should be spared; it is not convenient, and it may be of bad consequence should he be continued any longer; he may do a deal of mischief, and poison the minds of the people with bad notions, and therefore it is not expedient that he should live.</p>
