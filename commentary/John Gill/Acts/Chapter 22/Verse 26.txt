<p><strong>When the centurion heard that</strong>,.... The question put by Paul, which strongly suggested that he was a Roman:</p>
<p><strong>he went and told the chief captain; what Paul had said: saying, take heed what thou dost</strong>; or "art about to do"; lest some bad consequences should follow; lest he should affront the Roman people and senate, and lose his place, if not incur some corporeal punishment:</p>
<p><strong>for this man is a Roman</strong>; and it can never be answered to bind and beat a Roman.</p>
