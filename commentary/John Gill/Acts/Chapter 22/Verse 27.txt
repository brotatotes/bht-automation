<p><strong>tell me, art thou a Roman</strong>? he had told him before that he was a Jew of Tarsus, and which was true, and had said nothing of his being a Roman; wherefore the chief captain desires that he would tell him the whole truth of the matter, whether he was a Roman or not:</p>
<p><strong>he said yea</strong>; that he was one.</p>
