<p><strong>On the morrow</strong>,.... The next day; so that Paul was kept in the castle all night: because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews; which, as yet, he could not come at, some saying one thing, and some another; and which he ought to have known before he had bound him, and ordered him to be scourged:</p>
<p><strong>he loosed him from his bands</strong> not from his being bound with thongs to the pillar, that he had been loosed from before, but from the two chains with which he was bound, and held by two soldiers; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:33">Acts 21:33</span>.</p>
<p><strong>and commanded the chief priests, and all the council to appear</strong>, the whole Jewish sanhedrim, which was now very much under the direction and influence of the Romans: and this he the rather did, because, though he could not come at the certainty of the charge and accusation, he perceived it was a matter of religion, and so belonged to them to examine and judge of:</p>
<p><strong>and brought Paul down</strong>; from the Castle of Antonia, into the temple, and to the place where the sanhedrim sat, which formerly was in the chamber Gazith, but of late years it had removed from place to place, and indeed from Jerusalem itself, and was now at Jabneh; only this was the time of Pentecost, and so the chief priests and sanhedrim were at Jerusalem on that account:</p>
<p><strong>and set him before them</strong>; or "among them"; in the midst of them, to answer to what charges should be brought against him.</p>
