<p><strong>And when there arose a great dissension</strong>,.... When that was come to a very great height, hot words were spoken, and they were ready to come to blows, and there was like to be a riot and tumult among them:</p>
<p><strong>the chief captain fearing lest Paul should be pulled in pieces of them</strong>; either of the Sadducees, whom he had greatly offended and provoked, or of both Sadducees and Pharisees, the one laying hold on him to preserve him from the fury of the other, and the other endeavouring to pluck him out of their hands; and the fears of the chief captain were not so much out of affection to Paul, but lest there should be an uproar, which might issue in sedition, and rebellion against the Roman government, of which the Roman officers were always jealous; and because that Paul was a Roman, and should he suffer him to be destroyed in an illegal manner, he must be accountable for it: wherefore he</p>
<p><strong>commanded the soldiers to go down</strong>: either from the castle of Antonia, or from a superior part of the temple, where he with his guards were, to hear this cause before the sanhedrim, to that part where it sat, and Paul was: and</p>
<p><strong>take him by force from among them</strong>; if they refused to deliver him up, to make use of their arms:</p>
<p><strong>and bring him into the castle</strong>; of Antonia, where he was before.</p>
