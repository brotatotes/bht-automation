<p><strong>Now therefore ye with the council</strong>,.... The whole sanhedrim; their sense is, that they would have the sanhedrim convened by the chief priests and elders, and being met together, then to</p>
<p><strong>signify to the chief captain</strong>; or let him know that they were assembled together, upon the affair of Paul, and that they here desirous he might be brought before them:</p>
<p><strong>that he bring him down unto you tomorrow</strong>; from the castle of Antonia to the place where the sanhedrim met; the word "tomorrow" is not in the Alexandrian copy, nor in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions; and then it should seem that they desired him to be brought down forthwith, or otherwise they must propose to fast all that day, and so long on the morrow, till Paul was brought down; but that the common reading is right, appears from the chief captain's sending away Paul at the third hour of the night following, to prevent their designs on the morrow, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:23">Acts 23:23</span>. The pretence formed for his being brought down is,</p>
<p><strong>as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him</strong>; what he had done, which had occasioned this uproar, what it was he was charged with, and whether he was guilty or not:</p>
<p><strong>and we, or ever he come near</strong>: where the sanhedrim sat;</p>
<p><strong>are ready to kill him</strong>; lying in wait in some private place between the castle and the temple, from whence they intended to rush out at once upon him, and murder him; far enough both from the temple and the council, that both the one might not be defiled, though they did not greatly stick at that in those times, and that the other might not be charged with having any hand in his death.</p>
