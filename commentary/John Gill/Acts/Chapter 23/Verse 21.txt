<p><strong>But do not thou yield unto them</strong>,.... Or be persuaded by them, to bring Paul down from the castle to the sanhedrim; this must not be imputed to the young man's pride and vanity, in taking upon him to give advice to the chief captain; but to his great affection for his uncle, which moved him to entreat, rather than to direct him, for which he gives a good reason:</p>
<p><strong>for there lie in wait for him more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p><strong>and now are they ready</strong>; to execute their designs, being met together, and lying in ambush in some place, between the castle and the place where the sanhedrim met:</p>
<p><strong>looking for a promise from thee</strong>; that when the sanhedrim should apply to him, he would promise them to bring Paul down according to their request; and for the making and performing of this promise, these men were waiting.</p>
