<p><strong>And he called to him two centurions</strong>,.... Who had each of them an hundred soldiers under them:</p>
<p><strong>saying, make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea</strong>; which was formerly called Strato's tower, a sea port town, where Felix the Roman governor now was; it was six hundred furlongs, or seventy five miles f from Jerusalem: these two hundred soldiers were foot soldiers, as appears by their being distinguished from horsemen in the next clause, and were just the number that the two centurions had the command of; the making of them ready, was their seeing to it, that they were properly clothed, and accoutred with arms and ammunition, and with sufficient provision for their journey:</p>
<p><strong>and horsemen threescore and ten</strong>; the Ethiopic version reads, "a hundred"; but without support from any copy: "and spearmen two hundred"; who carried spears in their right hand; the word used signifies such who receive, lay hold on, or hold anything in their right hand: some think it designs such who were employed in the militia, to lay hold on guilty persons, and hold them; the Alexandrian copy reads, δεξιοβολους, "those that cast with the right hand"; and so reads the Syriac version, to which the Arabic agrees, which renders it "darters"; such as carried darts in their hands, and did not shoot out of a bow, but cast darts with their hands: now these being got ready, were ordered to march,</p>
<p><strong>at the third hour of the night</strong>; at nine o'clock at night, that they might go out unobserved, and before the petition from the sanhedrim was presented to him.</p>
