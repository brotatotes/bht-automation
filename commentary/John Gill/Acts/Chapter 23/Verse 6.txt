<p><strong>But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees</strong>,.... That is, that one part of the sanhedrim consisted of Sadducees, which was often the case; sometimes the high priest was of this sect, as Ananias probably was, and sometimes the greater part of the sanhedrim were Sadducees, and even sometimes the whole;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, but this sanhedrim were only part of them Sadducees:</p>
<p><strong>and the other Pharisees</strong>; of both these sects, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p><strong>he cried out in the council</strong>; with a loud voice, that he might be heard by all:</p>
<p><strong>men and brethren</strong>, <strong>I am a Pharisee</strong>; he was not only brought up in that sect from his youth, and lived according to it before his conversion, but he was still a Pharisee; wherefore he does not say, I "was", but I "am" a Pharisee; for whatever distinguished the Pharisee from the Sadducee, whether in principle, or in practice, and manner of living, which agreed with Christianity, the apostle still retained; as the belief of the immortality of the soul, the resurrection of the dead, and a future state, and strict holiness of life and conversation.</p>
<p><strong>The son of a Pharisee</strong>; the Alexandrian copy, and some others, and the Vulgate Latin version, read in the plural number, "the son of Pharisees"; his father and his mother were both Pharisees; for there were women Pharisees w, as well as men; so that he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees, as well as an Hebrew of the Hebrews; and this is said to show that he was by education of that sect.</p>
<p><strong>Of the hope and resurrection of the dead, I am called in question</strong>; that is, either for the hope of the resurrection of the dead, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:15">Acts 24:15</span> or for professing the hope of eternal life, and happiness in a future state, and the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, when the soul and body will be reunited, and enjoy endless felicity together: not that these were the particular things now charged upon him, and for which he was now trying and judging; but that these were the ground and foundation of the hatred and persecution of him, because he preached the resurrection of Christ from the dead, and the resurrection of men through him, and that there was hope of eternal life and salvation by him. And in this the apostle showed the prudence and wisdom of the serpent, along with the innocence of the dove, hereby to divide the assembly, and free himself from them; and it was but just and right; for since they would not hear him about to make a fair and open defence of his cause, but ordered him to be smitten on the mouth, it was but justice to throw them into confusion, and save himself.</p>
