<p><strong>And when he had so said</strong>,.... He stopped and made a pause:</p>
<p><strong>and there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees</strong>; about the things which he had spoken of, particularly the resurrection of the dead; and this was what the apostle intended, so that his end was answered by the speech he made:</p>
<p><strong>and the multitude was divided</strong>; that is, the members of the sanhedrim were divided, some being on one side of the question, and some on the other; for this multitude cannot design the multitude of the common people, who were not convened together on this occasion.</p>
