<p><strong>Because that thou mayest understand</strong>,.... By what Paul now asserted, and by the witnesses which he could produce to certify the truth of it:</p>
<p><strong>that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship</strong>; that is, from the time that he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem, to the present time, in which he stood before Felix, pleading his own cause; which may be reckoned, thus, he came in one day from Caesarea to Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:16">Acts 21:16</span> the next day he visited James and the elders, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:18">Acts 21:18</span> on the third day he purified himself in the temple, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:26">Acts 21:26</span> where he was taken and used ill by the Jews; on the fourth day, he was brought before the sanhedrim, and defended himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:30">Acts 22:30</span> on the fifth day forty Jews conspire to take away his life, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:11">Acts 23:11</span>, on the sixth day he came to Caesarea, being sent there by Lysias, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:32">Acts 23:32</span> and five days after this, which make eleven, Ananias, and the elders, with Tertullus, came down to accuse him; and this day was the twelfth, on which his trial came on. And of these twelve days he was a prisoner nine, and therefore could not have done so much mischief, and stirred up so much sedition as was insinuated; and in opposition to the charge of profaning the temple, he observes that he came up to Jerusalem to "worship"; namely, at the feast of Pentecost.</p>
