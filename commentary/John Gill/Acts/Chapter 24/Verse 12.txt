<p><strong>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man</strong>,.... Either about civil or religious affairs: not that it was criminal to dispute in the temple; it was a common thing for the doctors to dispute about matters of religion, in the porches, and courts, and chambers of the temple, as it may be observed they often did with Christ; but the apostle mentions this to show, that he was so far from moving sedition among the people of the Jews, that he never so much as entered into any conversation with them, upon any subject whatever: true indeed, he was in the temple, and was found there, but not disputing with any, but purifying himself according to the law of Moses:</p>
<p><strong>neither raising up the people</strong>; stirring them up to sedition, and tumult, to rebel against the Roman government:</p>
<p><strong>neither in the synagogues</strong>; where there were the greatest concourse of people, and the best opportunity of sowing seditious principles, and of which there were many in the city of Jerusalem. The Jews say p there were four hundred and sixty synagogues in Jerusalem; some say q four hundred and eighty:</p>
<p><strong>nor in the city</strong>; of Jerusalem, in any of the public streets or markets, where there were any number of people collected together; the apostle mentions the most noted and public places, where any thing of this kind might most reasonably be thought to be done.</p>
