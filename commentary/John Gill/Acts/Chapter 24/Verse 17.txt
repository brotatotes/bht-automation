<p><strong>Now after many years</strong>,.... Absence from Jerusalem; it was now about five and twenty years since his conversion, and most of this time he spent among the Gentiles; three years after it he went up to Jerusalem, and fourteen years after that, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:18">Galatians 1:18</span> but it had now been some years since he had been there:</p>
<p><strong>I came to bring alms to my nation</strong>; the collections which were made among the Gentile churches, particularly in Macedonia, for the poor saints at Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:25">Romans 15:25</span>.</p>
<p><strong>and offerings</strong>; either for the day of Pentecost, according to the usages of that feast, or the offerings on the account of the vow of the Nazarite, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:26">Acts 21:26</span>. The Vulgate Latin version adds, "and vows"; unless the spiritual and evangelical sacrifices of prayer and praise can be thought to be meant, since the ceremonial law was now abrogated; though it is manifest the apostle did at some times, and in some cases, comply with the Jews in the observance of it, in order to gain some.</p>
