Or "among which"; while the apostle was busy about the offerings of the Nazarites:certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple; and therefore could not be said to profane it; this he observes in answer to the charge of his attempting to profane it, and acquaints the governor how that was; as that having joined himself to four men that had a vow upon them, and being in the temple purifying himself with them, certain Jews that came from Ephesus, in Asia, who knew him there, and had a pique against him, found him here; not profaning the temple, as they pretended, but acting according to the worship and service of it; and that,neither with a multitude; for there were but four men with him;nor with tumult; making any noise and riot, or stirring up persons to sedition and rebellion.
