<p><strong>Whereupon</strong>,.... Or "among which"; while the apostle was busy about the offerings of the Nazarites:</p>
<p><strong>certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple</strong>; and therefore could not be said to profane it; this he observes in answer to the charge of his attempting to profane it, and acquaints the governor how that was; as that having joined himself to four men that had a vow upon them, and being in the temple purifying himself with them, certain Jews that came from Ephesus, in Asia, who knew him there, and had a pique against him, found him here; not profaning the temple, as they pretended, but acting according to the worship and service of it; and that,</p>
<p><strong>neither with a multitude</strong>; for there were but four men with him;</p>
<p><strong>nor with tumult</strong>; making any noise and riot, or stirring up persons to sedition and rebellion.</p>
