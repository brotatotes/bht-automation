<p><strong>having more perfect knowledge of that way</strong>; the Christian religion, which the Jews called heresy, and Paul had embraced; the sense is, either that he had a more perfect knowledge of it than he had before; and by what Paul had said, he saw that it was not contrary to the law, nor had any tendency to promote sedition and tumult; or rather, when he should have more perfect knowledge of this new way, called the sect of the Nazarenes, he would determine this cause, and not before: wherefore</p>
<p><strong>he deferred</strong> them; put them off to longer time, and would make no decision in favour of one side or the other:</p>
<p><strong>and said, when Lysias the chief captain shall come</strong> from Jerusalem to Caesarea,</p>
<p><strong>I will know the uttermost of your matters</strong>: as for the way, or religion of the Christians, he proposed doubtless to consult other persons; and as for the profanation of the temple, and especially about stirring up of sedition, he would inquire of Lysias about that; and when he had got full information of these particulars, then he promised them to bring things to an issue, and finish the cause.</p>
