<p><strong>Who also hath gone about to profane the temple</strong>,.... By introducing a Greek into it; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:28">Acts 21:28</span> which was only a supposition and conjecture of the Asiatic Jews, and was a false and groundless one:</p>
<p><strong>whom we took</strong>; as they did in the temple, and dragged him out of it:</p>
<p><strong>and would have judged according to our law</strong>; which was another untruth, for they had him not before any court of judicature; they brought no charge in form against him, nor did they examine his case, and inquire into the truth of things, or hear what he had to say, but fell upon him, and beat him; and if it had not been for the chief captain and his soldiers, would have destroyed him, so far were they from proceeding according to their law: it seems by Tertullus calling the law, "our law", that he was a Jewish proselyte; or else he speaks after the manner of lawyers, who call what is their clients, theirs.</p>
