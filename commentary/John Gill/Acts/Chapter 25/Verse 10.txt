<p><strong>Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat</strong>,.... Not that here was a seat in the judgment hall built by Herod for Caesar himself to sit in, should he ever come there, as some have thought; but the seat on which Festus sat is called Caesar's judgment seat, because it was in a Raman court of judicature, and because Festus, who filled it, represented Caesar himself:</p>
<p><strong>where I ought to be judged</strong>: being a Roman citizen, and not at Jerusalem by the sanhedrim of the Jews, who had nothing to do with him:</p>
<p><strong>to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest</strong>; it may be by his predecessor Felix, who had informed him of this case; or by Lysias's letter, which might come to his hands; or by the apostle's answer and vindication of himself, which he now made.</p>
