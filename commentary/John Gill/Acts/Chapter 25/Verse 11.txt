For if I be an offender,.... Against the law of Moses, or the temple at Jerusalem, or Caesar the Roman emperor:or have committed anything worthy of death; by the laws of the Romans, as sedition, murder, c.I refuse not to die signifying that he did not decline going to Jerusalem, either through any consciousness of guilt, or fear of death; for if anything could be proved against him, that was of a capital nature, he did not desire to escape death; he was ready to die for it; this was no subterfuge, or shift, to evade or defer justice:but if there be none of these things; to be found, or proved, and made to appear:whereof these accuse me; pointing to the Jews, that came down to be his accusers, and had laid many and grievous charges against him:no man may deliver me unto them; not justly, or according to the Roman laws; suggesting that Festus himself could not do it legally;I appeal unto Caesar; to this the apostle was induced, partly by the conduct of the governor, who seemed inclined to favour the Jews; and partly by the knowledge he might have of their intention to lie in wait for him, should he go up to Jerusalem; and chiefly by the vision he had had, which assured him that he must bear witness of Christ at Rome, Acts 23:11.
