<p><strong>To whom I answered</strong>,.... As follows:</p>
<p><strong>it is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die; or to give any man to destruction</strong>; to pass sentence of death upon him, without hearing his cause, and purely at the request of another, and merely to gratify him:</p>
<p><strong>before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face</strong>; so as to speak to his face, or before him, what they have to charge him with:</p>
<p><strong>and have licence to answer for himself, concerning the crime laid against him</strong>; and this was also according to the law of the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:51">John 7:51</span> though Festus, from such an application to him by the chief priests and elders, might conclude that their manner was different, he being ignorant of their laws and customs; but their prejudice to the apostle carried them to act such an illegal part, or at least to desire it might be acted: it is one of the Jewish canons, that it is unlawful for a judge to hear one of the contending parties, before the other is come in.</p>
