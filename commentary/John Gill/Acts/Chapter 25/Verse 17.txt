<p><strong>Therefore when they were come hither</strong>,.... To Caesarea, namely the chief priests and elders of the Jews:</p>
<p><strong>without any delay on the morrow, I sat on the judgment seat</strong>: that is, the next day after they came down, Festus went into the judgment hall, and took his place there, in order to hear this cause; which circumstance he mentions, to show how expeditious he was:</p>
<p><strong>and I commanded the man to be brought forth</strong>: from his place of confinement, to the hall, to answer for himself.</p>
