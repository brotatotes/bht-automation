<p><strong>And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come</strong>,.... Into the hall, or court of judicature:</p>
<p><strong>and Bernice</strong>; his sister, along with him:</p>
<p><strong>with great pomp</strong>: in rich dress, with the "regalia", or ensigns of royalty carried before them, and attended with a large train and retinue of servants:</p>
<p><strong>and was entered into the place of hearing</strong>; the causes that were tried in court, that particular part of the hall, which was assigned for that purpose; for as there were the proper places for the judge and council, and for the plaintiffs and defendants, so for those that came to hear:</p>
<p><strong>with the chief captains</strong>; or tribunes, who had the command of the Roman soldiers; and who had each of them a thousand men under them, as their title signifies:</p>
<p><strong>and principal men of the city</strong>; that is, of Caesarea; the magistrates, and chief inhabitants of the place:</p>
<p><strong>at Festus's commandment Paul was brought forth</strong>; and became a spectacle to a vast number of men, as he himself says; and which in part fulfilled what Christ had foretold to his disciples, that they should be brought before kings and governors for his sake; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:9">1 Corinthians 4:9</span>.</p>
