And Festus said, King Agrippa,.... He addressed himself to him in the first place, as being the principal person, and of great dignity, as well as knowledge:and all men which are here present with us; the chief captains, and principal inhabitants of the city:ye see this man the prisoner at the bar, meaning Paul:about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me: applied unto him, interceded with him, and very importunately pressed and desired him to give judgment against him:both at Jerusalem and also here; at Caesarea, whither they came from Jerusalem to accuse him:crying: in a very noisy and clamorous way:that he ought not to live any longer; as they did before Lysias the chief captain, Acts 22:22 and so in the hearing of Festus; for it was his death they sought, and nothing else would satisfy them.
