<p><strong>And Festus said, King Agrippa</strong>,.... He addressed himself to him in the first place, as being the principal person, and of great dignity, as well as knowledge:</p>
<p><strong>and all men which are here present with us</strong>; the chief captains, and principal inhabitants of the city:</p>
<p><strong>ye see this man</strong> the prisoner at the bar, meaning Paul:</p>
<p><strong>about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me</strong>: applied unto him, interceded with him, and very importunately pressed and desired him to give judgment against him:</p>
<p><strong>both at Jerusalem and also here</strong>; at Caesarea, whither they came from Jerusalem to accuse him:</p>
<p><strong>crying</strong>: in a very noisy and clamorous way:</p>
<p><strong>that he ought not to live any longer</strong>; as they did before Lysias the chief captain, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:22">Acts 22:22</span> and so in the hearing of Festus; for it was his death they sought, and nothing else would satisfy them.</p>
