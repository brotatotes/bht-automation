<p><strong>And when he had tarried among them more than ten days</strong>,.... The Alexandrian copy, and three of Beza's copies, and some others, and the Vulgate Latin version read, "no more than eight or ten days"; and the Syriac and Ethiopic versions leave out the phrase "no more", and read "when he had stayed there", as the former; that is, at Jerusalem; or "when he had remained among them", as the latter; the Jews, chief priests, and others, "eight or ten days"; the historian, not being certain to a day, expresses himself in this manner:</p>
<p><strong>he went down to Caesarea</strong>; from whence he came, and where Paul was:</p>
<p><strong>and the next day sitting in the judgment seat</strong>; the day after he was come to Caesarea, he sat upon the bench in the court of judicature, to try causes, and particularly the apostle's, which he was very desirous of knowing, for which reason he so soon took the bench: and</p>
<p><strong>commanded Paul to be brought</strong>; from the place where he was kept a prisoner, to the judgment hall where Festus was.</p>
