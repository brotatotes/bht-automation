<p><strong>And when he was come</strong>,.... Into court:</p>
<p><strong>the Jews which came down from Jerusalem</strong>; along with Festus, perhaps the high priest with the elders, and Tertullus the orator, as before:</p>
<p><strong>stood round about</strong>; either the Apostle Paul, or the judgment seat; the witnesses and accusers were to stand, as well as the person accused; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And laid many and grievous complaints against Paul; which they could not prove</strong>; for his moral conversation, both before and after conversion, was very strict and conformable to the laws of God and man; and yet as pure and inoffensive as he was, he was not exempt from the calumnies of men; and these many and very grievous; but it was his happiness, and to his honour through the grace of God, that his enemies could not make good anyone thing against him.</p>
