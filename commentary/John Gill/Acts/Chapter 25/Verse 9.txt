<p><strong>But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure</strong>,.... As did his predecessor Felix, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:27">Acts 24:27</span> he being just entered upon his new government, and having met with some caresses and civilities from the Jews at Jerusalem, by whom he had been much pressed and urged about the affair of the apostle:</p>
<p><strong>answered Paul, and said, wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me</strong>? meaning by the Jewish sanhedrim, he Festus being present: this was what the Jews had requested of him when he was at Jerusalem, that he would send for Paul thither, and there let him be judged, and which request he had denied; but having been solicited and importuned by the Jews, perhaps as, they came down together, he was inclined to gratify them, and to admit of it that he should be tried at Jerusalem, before the sanhedrim, he being present; and yet he was unwilling to do this without the prisoner's consent, he being a freeman of a Roman city; fearing he should be charged with delivering up a Roman into the hands of the Jews, which might be resented by the emperor and the Roman senate, should it come to their knowledge.</p>
