<p><strong>Then Agrippa said unto Paul</strong>,.... After Festus had made the above speech to him, and to all present, and had introduced the affair of Paul, who now stood before them:</p>
<p><strong>thou art permitted to speak for thyself</strong>; which a prisoner might not do, until he had leave; and this leave was granted by Festus the Roman governor, who was properly the judge, and not Agrippa, though the permission might be by both; and so the Arabic and Ethiopic versions read, "we have ordered", or "permitted thee", c.</p>
<p><strong>Then Paul stretched forth the hand</strong> as orators used to do, when they were about to speak; or else to require silence; or it may be to show the freedom of his mind, and how ready he was to embrace the opportunity of pleading his own cause; being conscious to himself of his innocence, and relying on the ingenuity and integrity of his judge; and especially of the king, before whom he stood:</p>
<p><strong>and answered for himself</strong>; or made an apology, or spoke in vindication of himself, in order to remove the charges brought against him.</p>
