<p><strong>Which thing I also did in Jerusalem</strong>,.... The metropolis of Judea, where he had had his education, and was well known; here he consented to the death of Stephen, and held the clothes of the witnesses while they stoned him; and here he haled men and women out of their houses, and committed them to prison, and made havoc of the church of Christ, and destroyed the faith, and those that professed it, as much as in him lay.</p>
<p><strong>And many of the saints I shut up in prison</strong>; at Jerusalem; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span>.</p>
<p><strong>having received authority from the chief priests</strong>; to take them up, and imprison them.</p>
<p><strong>And when they were put to death</strong>; for it seems there were more than Stephen put to death, though we have no account of them:</p>
<p><strong>I gave my voice against them</strong>; not that he sat in council, or was a member of the Jewish sanhedrim, and voted for the execution of the Christians, but he was pleased with the sentence they passed, and approved of it; or he joined the zealots, who, without any form of law, seized on the Christians, and put them to death wherever they found them; and this he assented to, and encouraged: some render the words, "I carried the sentence"; as the Vulgate Latin version; that is, the sentence of condemnation, which the Jewish sanhedrim passed upon the disciples and followers of Christ: this Saul took, and carried, it may be, both to the Roman governor, to be signed by him, and to the officers to put it in execution; so industrious and forward was he in persecuting the saints.</p>
