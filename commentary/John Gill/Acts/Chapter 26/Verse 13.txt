At midday, O king,.... So in Acts 12:6. This circumstance is omitted in Acts 9:3. King Agrippa is called upon by the apostle, to excite his attention to what he was about to relate, it being very wonderful, and of great importance.I saw in the way; that is, to Damascus, when near the city;a light from heaven; which descended from thence:above the brightness of the sun; it was a greater light than that, or otherwise it could not have been discerned at noon, or have had the effect it had upon Saul, and his company. This account of the greatness of the light, is not in the other places where this narrative is given:shining round about me: so in Acts 9:3and them which journeyed with me; this is not mentioned in the other accounts.
