<p><strong>But rise and stand upon thy feet</strong>,.... This, and what follows in this and the two next verses, are not in any of the former accounts; and these words are used not only because Saul was fallen to the earth, and are an encouragement to rise up, and stand corporeally, but to take heart, and be of good cheer; for though he had acted so vile and cruel a part by Christ, and his people, yet he had designs of grace, and good will to him; and this appearance was not for his destruction, but for his honour, comfort, and usefulness:</p>
<p><strong>for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose</strong>; not to take vengeance for past offences, but for the ends hereafter mentioned: and this appearance of Christ was real, corporeal, and personal, and not imaginary, or merely visionary and intellectual; and it was to this sight of Christ he more than once refers, partly in proof of Christ's resurrection from the dead, and partly to demonstrate the truth of his apostleship, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span>.</p>
<p><strong>to make thee a minister and a witness, both of those things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee</strong>; so that he was an apostle, not of men, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ, as he himself says, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span>. He was a minister, not of man's making, but of Christ's; and they are the only true ministers of the Gospel, who are made by Christ, who have their mission and commission, their qualifications, gifts, and abilities, their doctrine, work, and wages from him: and the apostle's work, as a minister, was to be a witness; it was to testify what he had seen of Christ corporeally; and what knowledge of his person, office, and grace was now communicated to him by the spirit of wisdom and revelation; and what should hereafter be made known to him, either mediately by Ananias, or immediately by Christ and his Spirit; for the apostle had after appearances, visions, and revelations; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17">Acts 22:17</span>.</p>
