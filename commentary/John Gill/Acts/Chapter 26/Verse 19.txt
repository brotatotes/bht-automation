<p><strong>Whereupon, O King Agrippa</strong>,.... Having been favoured with this illustrious appearance of the Lord and with this declaration and commission from him:</p>
<p><strong>I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision</strong>; to Christ himself, who appeared from heaven in so much light and glory, and spoke unto him, and appointed him what he should be, and do, and declared what use he should be of: he did not disbelieve what Christ said, nor was he disobedient to the orders he gave, but immediately set about the work he called him to, without consulting flesh and blood; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:16">Galatians 1:16</span>.</p>
