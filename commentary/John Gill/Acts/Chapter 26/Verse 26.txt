<p><strong>For the king knoweth of these things</strong>,.... Something of them, of the sufferings and resurrection of the Messiah, and of his showing light to Jews and Gentiles, as they are spoken of by Moses and the prophets, whose writings Agrippa was conversant with, and of these things as fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth; at least he had heard the report of them, how that they were said to be accomplished in him.</p>
<p><strong>Before whom also I speak freely</strong>; because of the knowledge he had of these things:</p>
<p><strong>for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him</strong>; as that Moses and the prophets have foretold then, and that they have had their fulfilment in Jesus;</p>
<p><strong>for this thing was not done in a corner</strong>: the ministry of Jesus was, public, his miracles were done openly, his suffering the death of the cross under Pontius Pilate was generally known, and his resurrection from the dead was a well attested fact, and the ministration of his Gospel to Jews and Gentiles was notorious. The Arabic and Ethiopic versions refer this to Paul's words and actions, that what he had said and done were not private but public, and of which Agrippa had had, by one means or another, a full account; but the other sense is best.</p>
