<p><strong>King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets</strong>?.... What they have said concerning the person, office, sufferings, death, and resurrection of Christ, and that what they have said is fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth?</p>
<p><strong>I know that thou believest</strong>; that what the prophets said were true, and are accomplished.</p>
