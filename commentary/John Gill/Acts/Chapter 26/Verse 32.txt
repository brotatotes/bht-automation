<p><strong>Then said Agrippa unto Festus</strong>,.... As declaring his sense, and by way of advice and counsel; but not as determining anything himself, for that lay in the breast of Festus, the Roman governor and judge:</p>
<p><strong>this man might have been set at liberty</strong>; from his bonds and imprisonment; for ought that appears against him, or any law to the contrary:</p>
<p><strong>if he had not appealed unto Caesar</strong>; wherefore an inferior judge could not release him; but so it was ordered in divine Providence, that he should appeal to Caesar, that he might go to Rome, and there bear a testimony for Christ; however, this declaration of Agrippa, and what he and the governor and the rest said among themselves, are a considerable proof of the innocence of the apostle.</p>
