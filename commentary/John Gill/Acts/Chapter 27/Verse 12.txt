<p><strong>And because the haven was not commodious to winter in</strong>,.... Which was called the "Fair Havens", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:8">Acts 27:8</span> which name it might have by an antiphrasis, it being just the reverse; it might be a good summer haven, but not be fit for winter: perhaps it might be an open road or bay, and having nothing to shelter from the boisterous waves, was a place very improper for a ship to be in, in stormy weather; for in open places, as bays and roads, the sea tumbles in very violently in bad weather: this was a haven fit for fair weather only, and therefore might be so called:</p>
<p><strong>the more part advised to depart thence also</strong>; the major part of the ship's company were of the same opinion with the master and owner of it, and advised as well as they, to sail from the Fair Havens in quest of a better port; the Syriac version reads, "the most of ours", of the apostle's companions; so that they were against him, according to that version, which is not likely; however, the majority in the ship were for sailing:</p>
<p><strong>if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter, which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west</strong>: this place is called in the Syriac version Phoenix; and Ptolomy q makes mention both of the city and haven of Phoenix, as on the south side of the island of Crete: and whereas it is here said to lie towards the south west and north west, this may be reconciled to that, as well as to itself; for the haven considered in general lay towards the south, but having its windings and turnings, with respect to them it lay towards both the south west and the north west, and so was a very commodious haven to winter in.</p>
