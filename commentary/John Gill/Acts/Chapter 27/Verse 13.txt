<p><strong>supposing that they, had obtained their purpose</strong>; that things would succeed according to their wish, and favour their design:</p>
<p><strong>loosing thence</strong>; from the Fair Havens; the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions render it, "loosing from Assos"; which could not be Assos of Troas, mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:13">Acts 20:13</span> which was many miles from hence; rather Asum, a town in Crete, of which Pliny r makes mention, though, according to him, it seems to be an inland town; wherefore it is best to take the word ασσον, to be an adverb, and render it "thence", as we do; or join it with the next word, and render it,</p>
<p><strong>they came near, or they sailed close by Crete</strong>; along the shore, the wind favouring them, that they were in no danger of being dashed upon it, it being a soft gentle wind.</p>
