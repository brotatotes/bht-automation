And when the south wind blew softly,.... Or moderately, which was a good wind for them:supposing that they, had obtained their purpose; that things would succeed according to their wish, and favour their design:loosing thence; from the Fair Havens; the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions render it, "loosing from Assos"; which could not be Assos of Troas, mentioned in Acts 20:13 which was many miles from hence; rather Asum, a town in Crete, of which Pliny r makes mention, though, according to him, it seems to be an inland town; wherefore it is best to take the word ασσον, to be an adverb, and render it "thence", as we do; or join it with the next word, and render it,they came near, or they sailed close by Crete; along the shore, the wind favouring them, that they were in no danger of being dashed upon it, it being a soft gentle wind.r Nat.
