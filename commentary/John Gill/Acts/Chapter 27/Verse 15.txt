<p><strong>And when the ship was caught</strong>,.... By the wind, snatched up by it, and forcibly carried away:</p>
<p><strong>and could not bear up into the wind</strong>; and against it, or look it in the face, as the word signifies; could not ply to windward, the wind being so high and the sea so strong:</p>
<p><strong>we let her drive</strong>; about the sea, at pleasure, it being in vain to attempt to get her forward against the wind, or to direct her course.</p>
