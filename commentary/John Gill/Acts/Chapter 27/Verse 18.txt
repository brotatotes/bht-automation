<p><strong>And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest</strong>,.... Sometimes being lifted up as it were to the heavens, and then presently sinking down, as if they were going into the bottom of the sea; such a condition at sea is described to the life by the Psalmist, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+107:25">Psalms 107:25</span>.</p>
<p><strong>the next day they lightened the ship</strong>; of its burden, its lading, the goods and merchandise that were in it; as the mariners did in the ship in which Jonah was, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jon+1:5">Jonah 1:5</span> the Ethiopic version renders it, "they cast the goods into the sea"; the Arabic version, the "merchandise".</p>
