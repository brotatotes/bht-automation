<p><strong>But after long abstinence</strong>,.... From food, not for want of it, as appears from what follows, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:36">Acts 27:36</span> nor in a religious way, in order to obtain the favour of God; but either for want of appetite, and a nauseousness and loathing of food, through the tossing of the ship, fright at the storm, and fears of death; and chiefly for want of time, being employed for the security of themselves and the ship.</p>
<p><strong>Paul stood forth in the midst of them</strong>; that all might hear him:</p>
<p><strong>and said, sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me</strong>: it would have been better for them to have taken his advice, and stayed at the Fair Havens,</p>
<p><strong>and not have loosed from Crete</strong>; or sailed from thence:</p>
<p><strong>and to have gained this harm and loss</strong>; whereby they would have shunned the injuries of the weather, the storm and tempest which they had endured, to the prejudice of their health, and the terrifying of their minds, and have prevented the loss of the goods and merchandise of the ship, and its tackling, utensils, instruments, and arms; the former of these is expressed by "harm" or injury, and the latter by "loss". The apostle addresses them in a very courteous manner, and does not use sharp reproofs, severe language, or upbraid and insult them, only reminds them of the counsel he had given, which had it been taken, would have been to their advantage; and the rather he mentions this, that since what he had foretold was in part already come to pass, they might give the more heed to what he was about to say to them.</p>
