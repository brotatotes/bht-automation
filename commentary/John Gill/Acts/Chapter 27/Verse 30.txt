<p><strong>And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship</strong>,.... To save their lives, concluding that it was in the utmost danger, and that it would quickly, notwithstanding the anchors cast out, break away, and fall upon the rocks, and split to pieces:</p>
<p><strong>when they had let down the boat into the sea</strong>; which before they had taken up into the ship, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:16">Acts 27:16</span> and now they let it down, in order to get into it, and make their escape:</p>
<p><strong>under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship</strong>; the foremost part of the ship, the prow of it; their pretence in attempting to get out of the ship, and into the boat, was, that whereas there were anchors cast out of the stern, or hinder part of the ship, so they would cast out others, from the fore part of it; and "stretch" them "out", as the word signifies, or carry them further out into the sea, for the security of the ship; and to do which, it was necessary to use the boat.</p>
