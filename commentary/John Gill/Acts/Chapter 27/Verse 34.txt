<p><strong>Wherefore I pray you to take some meat</strong>,.... To sit down composedly, and eat meat cheerfully and freely:</p>
<p><strong>for this is for your health</strong>; the Alexandrian copy reads, "for our health"; it was for the health of them all, that they might be better able to bear the shock and fatigue of the shipwreck, and be in better spirits, and in a better capacity to help themselves, and one another:</p>
<p><strong>for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you</strong>; a proverbial phrase, expressing the utmost safety of their lives, and therefore might cheerfully eat their food, and rest themselves, and be satisfied. To dream of shaving the hair, portended shipwreck to sailors; nor was it lawful for any to pare his nails, or cut off his hair, but in a storm; to which custom, some think, the apostle here alludes w; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+14:45">1 Samuel 14:45</span>.</p>
