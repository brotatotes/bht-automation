<p><strong>And when it was day they knew not the land</strong>,.... What place it was, or the name of it:</p>
<p><strong>but they discovered a certain creek with a shore</strong>; a gulf or bay, with a shore near it; the Ethiopic version explains it,</p>
<p><strong>an arm of the sea</strong>, where was a port, where they thought they could secure themselves, or get ashore:</p>
<p><strong>into which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship</strong>; whither they had a mind, and consulted to run the ship, if it could be done by any means, believing it was the most likely method of saving themselves, and that; for notwithstanding the assurance they had that no man's life should be lost, they made use of all proper means for their safety and security.</p>
