<p><strong>And it came to pass, that after three days</strong>,.... From his first coming to Rome, when he had hired himself a house, or lodging, and was settled in it, and was rested from the fatigue of his voyage and journey:</p>
<p><strong>Paul called the chief of the Jews together</strong>: he sent to the principal men among them; for though the Jews, were expelled from Rome in the reign of Claudius, they were now returned, and had their liberty of residing there; very likely by means of Poppea, Nero's concubine, who favoured the Jews: but whether they had a synagogue, and these men were the chief and leading men in it, the doctors, rulers, and officers of it, are things not certain; however, these the apostle desired to come to him where he was, for whether he had the liberty of going about where he would, the soldier attending him, is not so clear a point:</p>
<p><strong>and when they were come together</strong>; to his house, or lodging:</p>
<p><strong>he said unto them, men and brethren</strong>: which was the usual form of address with the Jews; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:2">Acts 7:2</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Though I have committed nothing against the people and customs of our fathers</strong>; meaning he had said nothing disrespectfully of the people of the Jews; nor had done anything to the prejudice of their temporal, spiritual, and eternal good, but just the reverse; nor had he said or done anything contrary to the laws and customs enjoined the Jews by Moses, even those that were of a ceremonial nature; for though he had everywhere declared that the Gentiles were not obliged to an obedience to them, yet he did not dissuade the Jews from the use of them; and oftentimes complied with them himself, things he had been charged with:</p>
<p><strong>yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans</strong>; he was first seized by the Jews in the temple of Jerusalem, and then fell into the hands of Lysias, the chief captain; who bound him, and by whom he was sent to Caesarea, where he was retained a prisoner both by Felix and Festus, Roman governors.</p>
