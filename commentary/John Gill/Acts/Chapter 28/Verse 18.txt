<p><strong>would have let [me] go</strong>; released him from his bonds, and set him at liberty to go where he pleased:</p>
<p><strong>because there was no cause of death in me</strong>; no crime proved upon him, which was worthy of death; and this was the sense of Lysias the chief captain, and of Felix and Festus the Roman governors, and of King Agrippa.</p>
