<p><strong>For the heart of this people is waxed gross</strong>,.... Or fat; stupefied with notions of carnal and temporal things, and become hardened against, and unsusceptible of, divine and spiritual things:</p>
<p><strong>and their ears are dull of hearing</strong>; the Gospel, and its joyful sound; to which they stop their cars, as the deaf adder to the voice of the charmer:</p>
<p><strong>and their eyes have they closed</strong>; and wilfully shut, against all evidence from facts, miracles, prophecies, and preaching:</p>
<p><strong>lest they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>and understand with [their] heart, and should be converted</strong>; that is, see the evidence of miracles, take in the truth of doctrine, understand the meaning of prophecy, and so be turned from darkness, ignorance, and unbelief, to light, knowledge, and faith:</p>
<p><strong>and I should heal them</strong>; or "have mercy on them", as the Ethiopic version renders it; that is, forgive their sins: hearing the Gospel preached, is the ordinary means of understanding spiritual things; and the understanding being enlightened through the ministry of the word, by the Spirit of God, whereby the sinner sees his lost state by nature, his impurity and impotency, the danger he is in, and the destruction that is imminent on him, and he is liable to, and also his need of Christ, and salvation by him; this issues in conversion, in the turning of a man from the evil of his ways, to believe in Christ, walk on in him, and worthy of him; when he is healed of the diseases of his soul, which are many, are natural, and hereditary, mortal and incurable, but by Christ the great physician; by whose stripes, wounds, and blood, there is healing, that is, pardon; for healing diseases, and pardoning iniquities, are one and the same; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+103:3">Psalms 103:3</span>; and at conversion, when a soul is enlightened, and made sensible of the evil of sin, and that there is no cure of this disease, by anything that he or any creature can do, or prescribe for him, but only by the blood of Christ; a discovery of pardoning grace is made unto him; and he is made whole, and cured of every disease that attended him; from whence spring joy, peace, and comfort to him:, but when through hearing the word, the understanding is not enlightened, and conversion does not follow upon it, there is no healing of the disease of sin, no pardon applied; and consequently such must be in a most deplorable and miserable condition, as all ignorant hearers and despisers of the Gospel are; <scripref content="[See comments on Mt 13:14;&lt;br&gt;See Gill on ]" passage="Mt 13:14;&lt;/p&gt;
