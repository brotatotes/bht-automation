<p><strong>And as the lame man which was healed</strong>,.... This is left out in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, and in the Alexandrian copy, which only read, and as he</p>
<p><strong>held Peter and John</strong>; by their clothes or arms, either through fear, lest his lameness should return on their leaving him; or rather out of affection to them for the favour he had received, and therefore hung about them, and was loath to part with them; unless it was to make them known, and point them out as the authors of his cure, that they might be taken notice of by others, and the miracle be ascribed unto them:</p>
<p><strong>all the people ran together unto them</strong>; to the man that was healed, and to Peter and John, when they saw him standing, walking, and leaping, and clinging about the apostles; who were</p>
<p><strong>in the porch that is called Solomon's</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span></p>
<p><strong>greatly wondering</strong>; at the man that was cured; at the cure that was wrought upon him; and still more at the persons who did it, and the manner in which it was done.</p>
