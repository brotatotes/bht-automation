<p><strong>And when Peter saw it</strong>,.... That the people ran to them, and looked wistly upon them, and wondered at what was done:</p>
<p><strong>he answered unto the people, ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this</strong>? either at this man, who was cured of his lameness, or at the cure itself:</p>
<p><strong>or why look ye so earnestly on us</strong>; suggesting, that they ought to look to God, and observe his divine power, and to the Lord Jesus Christ, whom they had crucified, whose apostles they were, and in whose name, and by whose power they had wrought this miracle; which shows that they were not self-seeking and vain glorious men, but discovers great sincerity and integrity, much love to Christ, and great regard to his honour, and to the glory of God:</p>
<p><strong>as though by our own power and holiness we had made this man to walk</strong>? as if it was any natural power of theirs; or for any merit of theirs, because of their strict religion and piety; or "laudable conversation", as the Arabic version; because they were mightier in themselves and holier than others, that they had such a faculty of curing lame persons; all which they utterly reject, and place it to a right account in the next verse. Instead of "holiness", the Syriac version reads "authority"; and to the same, or like sense, the Vulgate Latin, which seems most agreeable.</p>
