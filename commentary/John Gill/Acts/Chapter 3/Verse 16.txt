<p><strong>And his name, through faith in his name</strong>,.... That is, the name of Christ, or the power of Christ, through the faith of the apostles in him, while they made use of his name, and said, "in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth", c. <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:6">Acts 3:6</span> or Christ, through the faith of the lame man in him and when his name was used in this manner by the apostles; not that either their faith, or his, had any causal influence on the cure, but was the way and means in which they, glorifying Christ, he was pleased to effect this cure:</p>
<p><strong>hath made this man strong</strong>; who was before exceeding weak; strengthened the parts that were infirm, his feet and ankles, and consolidated them, so that he could use them, and walk with them:</p>
<p><strong>whom ye see and know</strong>; they knew him before, when he was lame, and now knew him to be the same man, and whom they saw now perfectly well; so that they could be appealed to that there was no fraud or imposture in the case:</p>
<p><strong>yea, the faith which is by him</strong>; by Christ, of which he is the object, and the author, and finisher: this is repeated out of affection to Christ, and a passionate concern for the glory of his name; or because that faith, in one clause, may regard the faith of the apostles, and in the other, the faith of the man that was cured:</p>
<p><strong>hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all</strong>: he had perfect soundness both in body and mind; though the former may chiefly be designed, it being that which was only visible to these persons; and which was done, not in a corner, but publicly, before them all, at the gate of the temple, where the multitude passed to and fro.</p>
