<p><strong>But those things which God before had showed</strong>,.... In the Scriptures of the Old Testament, concerning the betraying of the Messiah, and his sufferings and death, with the various causes, concomitants, and circumstances of them:</p>
<p><strong>by the mouths of all his prophets</strong>; which were since the world began; some pointing out one thing or circumstance, and some another:</p>
<p><strong>that Christ should suffer</strong>. The Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions read, "that his Christ should suffer"; but then they leave out the word "his" in the preceding clause, which they put into this; and this entire clause is omitted in the Alexandrian copy:</p>
<p><strong>he hath so fulfilled</strong>; in the manner he has, so exactly, so perfectly agreeable to the predictions of them, and yet were unknown to the persons by whom they were fulfilled. So wisely and surprisingly are things ordered and overruled by the wise providence of God, who is a God of knowledge, and by whom all actions are weighed.</p>
