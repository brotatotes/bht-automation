<p><strong>Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel</strong>,.... Who was, as the Jews call him, רבן של נביאים, "the master of the prophets" l; and they say, that Samuel the prophet is הנביא הראשון, "the first prophet" in the chain of the Kabbala m; and therefore is here particularly mentioned, as at the head of the prophets, and next to Moses; there being but very few prophets between him and Moses, when there were many after him; and in his days, the schools of the prophets were set up: now not only Moses spoke of Christ, but all the prophets from the time of Samuel; in the books that bear his name, stands a famous prophecy concerning Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:13">2 Samuel 7:13</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And those that follow after</strong>; in order, as David, Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, c.</p>
<p><strong>and as many as have spoken</strong> anything by way of prophecy:</p>
<p><strong>have likewise foretold of these days</strong>; of the days of the Messiah, of his person, office, incarnation, obedience, sufferings, death, resurrection, ascension, the pouring down of the Spirit, the times of refreshing, the Gospel dispensation, the conversion of the Jews, the calling of the Gentiles, and the gathering in all the elect of God.</p>
