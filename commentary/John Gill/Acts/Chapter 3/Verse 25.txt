<p><strong>Ye are the children of the prophets</strong>,.... Of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are called prophets, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+105:15">Psalms 105:15</span> being lineally and naturally descended from them; to them belonged the prophecies of the Old Testament concerning the Messiah, and the promises of him; they were heirs of them;</p>
