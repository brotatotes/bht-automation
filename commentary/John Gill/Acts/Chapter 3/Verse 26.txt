<p><strong>Unto you first, God having raised his Son Jesus</strong>,.... Which may be understood, either of the incarnation of Christ, and his exhibition in the flesh; which is sometimes expressed by raising him up, and is no other than the mission, or manifestation of him in human nature, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:69">Luke 1:69</span>. Or of the resurrection of him from the dead, and the exaltation of him at the right hand of God:</p>
<p><strong>sent him to bless you</strong>; in person, according to the former sense; for he was indeed sent only to the people of Israel, and to them he preached; many of whom were blessed with converting grace under his ministry; but according to the latter sense, and which seems most agreeable, he was sent in the ministry of the word, and came by his Spirit, first to the Jews, among whom the Gospel was first preached for a while, and was blessed to the conversion of many thousands among them, both in Judea, and in the nations of the world, where they were dispersed:</p>
<p><strong>in turning away everyone of you from his iniquities</strong>; in this the blessing lay, and is rightly in our version ascribed to Christ, and to the power of his grace, in the ministration of the Gospel and not to themselves, as in many other versions; as the Syriac version, "if ye convert yourselves, and turn from your evils"; making it both their own act, and the condition of their being blessed; and the Arabic version likewise, "so that everyone of you departs from his wickedness"; but that work is Christ's, and this is the blessing of grace he himself bestows, and is a fruit of redemption by his blood, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:14">Titus 2:14</span>.</p>
