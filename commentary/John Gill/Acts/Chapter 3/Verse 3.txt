<p><strong>Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple</strong>,.... Just as they were entering through the gate at which he lay, he looked at them; and though they were strangers to him, he concluded they were Israelites by their going into the temple at that time:</p>
<p><strong>asked an alms</strong>; of them; prayed them to give him something for his relief and support.</p>
