And he gave heed unto them,.... Or "he looked at them", as the Syriac version renders it, as they bid him: he was not only attentive to them in his mind, but he directed his eyes towards them, and looked wistly at them. This clause is left out in the Ethiopic version.Expecting to receive something of them; not a cure for his lameness, which he little thought of, but some money, as an alms.
