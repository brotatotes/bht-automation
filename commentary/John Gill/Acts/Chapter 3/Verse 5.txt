<p><strong>And he gave heed unto them</strong>,.... Or "he looked at them", as the Syriac version renders it, as they bid him: he was not only attentive to them in his mind, but he directed his eyes towards them, and looked wistly at them. This clause is left out in the Ethiopic version.</p>
<p><strong>Expecting to receive something of them</strong>; not a cure for his lameness, which he little thought of, but some money, as an alms.</p>
