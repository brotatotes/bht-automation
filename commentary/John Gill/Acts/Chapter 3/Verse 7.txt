<p><strong>And he took him by the right hand</strong>,.... In imitation of Christ, whom he had often seen using the same action on such occasions:</p>
<p><strong>and lift him up</strong>; believing he was cured, and that it might be manifest. The word him is expressed in the Alexandrian copy, and in some others, and in the Oriental versions, which is a supplement in our translation:</p>
<p><strong>and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength</strong>; where, it seems, his lameness lay. The Vulgate Latin renders it, his bases and soles, which may include his legs and thighs, as well as feet; and the Syriac version, "his feet and soles"; and the Arabic version, "his soles, and the muscles adjoining to his heels"; and the Ethiopic version furthest off of all, "he was strengthened in his feet, and in his loins"; his disorder might be of the paralytic kind.</p>
