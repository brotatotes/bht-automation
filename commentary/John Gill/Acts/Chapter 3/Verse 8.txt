<p><strong>And he leaping up</strong>,.... From off the bed or couch, or ground on which he lay:</p>
<p><strong>stood and walked</strong>; stood firm and strong upon his feet, and walked about; by which it was abundantly manifest to himself and others, that he had a perfect cure. The Ethiopic version is a very ridiculous one, "and he went with them catching fishes"; as if upon this, before they went into the temple, he and the apostles went a fishing together, which has not the least foundation in the text:</p>
<p><strong>and entered with them into the temple</strong>; to join with them in divine worship, to acknowledge the goodness of God to him, and to show respect to the instruments he made use of in his cure:</p>
<p><strong>and leaping</strong>; for joy of the mercy, and that it might appear to all that he was thoroughly cured of his lameness: and thus the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:6">Isaiah 35:6</span> "then shall the lame man leap as an hart", was literally fulfilled:</p>
<p><strong>and praising God</strong>; and not the apostles; for he knew that this was owing to the power of God, and could never have been done by man; though he might not be ungrateful to the instruments.</p>
