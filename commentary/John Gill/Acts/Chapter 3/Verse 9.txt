<p><strong>And all the people</strong>,.... That were in the temple,</p>
<p><strong>saw him walking</strong>; who before lay on a couch, or on the ground, and was so lame, that he was obliged to be carried;</p>
<p><strong>and praising God</strong>; for this miraculous cure. The Arabic version renders it, "saw him walking to praise God": that is, entering into the temple with the apostles, in order to offer up the sacrifice of praise to God there.</p>
