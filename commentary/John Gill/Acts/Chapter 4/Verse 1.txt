<p><strong>And as they spake unto the people</strong>,.... For though only mention is made of Peter's preaching in the preceding chapter, yet doubtless John preached as well as he; either in turn, or to a part of the people at some distance: and this shows their diligence, faithfulness, and integrity, in the ministration of the word; and it is recorded to their honour, that whilst they were about their master's business, and discharging the duty of their office,</p>
<p><strong>the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came upon them</strong>; by agreement, with great violence, and at unawares: the "priests" might be those who kept the watch in the temple; for</p>
<p>"in three places the priests kept watch, in the house of the sanctuary; in the house of Abtines, in the house of Nitsots, and in the house of Moked, and the Levites in one and twenty places p.''</p>
<p>And it now being eventide, they might be about to take their stands; "and the captain of the temple" might be he, whom they call,</p>
<p>איש הר בית, "the man of the mountain of the house"; who was שר, a ruler, or governor, and ממונה, a president over all the wards q; he is sometimes called ראש משמר, "the head of the ward" r; and of him it is said s,</p>
<p>"the man of the mountain of the house goes his round through every ward, with burning torches before him; and every ward that does not stand (is not on his feet), the man of the mountain of the house, says to him, peace be to thee; and if he observes that he is asleep, he strikes him with his staff, and he has power to burn his garments.''</p>
