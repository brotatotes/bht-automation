But when they had commanded them,.... That is, when the sanhedrim had ordered the apostles; or "commanded that both", as the Arabic version reads, both Peter and John; and, it may be, the man that was healed too:to go aside out of the council; or place where the council, or sanhedrim sat; which, whether it was in the chamber "Gazith", in the temple where they used to sit g, or in the shops, or in the city, whither they removed, is not certain. We are told h, that"the sanhedrim removed from the chamber Gazith, to the shops, and from the shops to Jerusalem, and from Jerusalem to Jabneh;''that is, after the destruction of the city. And the first remove was much about this time; for it is said i, that"forty years before the destruction of the temple, the sanhedrim removed, and sat in the shops.''Not in the shops where things were sold for the use of the temple, but in a court adjoining to them, which took its name from them.They conferred among themselves; what was proper to be done, the apostles being withdrawn.g Misn.
