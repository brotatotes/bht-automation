<p><strong>But Peter and John answered and said unto them</strong>,.... With great boldness and courage, and without any fear of man, but in the true fear of God</p>
<p><strong>whether it be right in the sight of God</strong>; who is omniscient, and sees, and knows all things, all the actions of men, and the springs of them; who is holy, just, and true, and sits and judges among the gods, that which is right:</p>
<p><strong>to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye</strong>: it is not denied that magistrates are to be hearkened to, and obeyed: but not more than God, or in things that are contrary to his nature, will, law, honour, and glory: whatever is agreeable to the law and will of God, commanded by magistrates, should be attended to, and cheerfully obeyed; but what is not should be disregarded, whatever follows upon it: and this was so just and reasonable, that the apostles appeal to the sanhedrim, or council itself, to determine.</p>
