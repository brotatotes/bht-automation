<p><strong>The kings of the earth stood up</strong>,.... Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee, sometimes called a king, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:14">Mark 6:14</span> and Pilate the Roman governor, who represented his master Caesar; these stood, or rose up in an hostile manner, and set themselves against, and opposed themselves to the Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth:</p>
<p><strong>and the rulers were gathered together</strong>; the Jewish rulers, Annas, Caiaphas, and the rest of the members of the sanhedrim, who met together more than once; and particularly at the high priest's palace, to consult how they should take Jesus and put him to death; and who also gathered together at the same place, when he was taken, to arraign, examine, and condemn him. And this opposition, and these conspiracies and consultations, were</p>
<p><strong>against the Lord</strong>: Jehovah, the Father of Christ, who sent him, and anointed him; so that what was done against Christ, was done against the Lord, their views and designs, their interest and glory, being the same:</p>
<p><strong>and against his Christ</strong>; or anointed one, who was anointed by him, with the Holy Ghost, from his birth, and at his baptism, to be prophet, priest, and King.</p>
