<p><strong>And they laid hands on them</strong>,.... The Arabic version renders it, "on both"; on Peter and John; seized them by force, and drew them out of the temple:</p>
<p><strong>and put them in hold unto the next day</strong>; not in the common public prison, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:18">Acts 5:18</span> but they put them into the hands, and under the care and custody of a set of men, to keep and guard them; that they might not go away, until they had an opportunity of bringing them before the sanhedrim, to be examined and punished by them:</p>
<p><strong>for it was now eventide</strong>; it was at the ninth hour, or about three o'clock in the afternoon, when Peter and John went up to the temple, where they healed the lame man; after which, both of them preached to the people; so that it must now be evening; at least, as the Syriac version renders it, "the evening was near", or was drawing on.</p>
