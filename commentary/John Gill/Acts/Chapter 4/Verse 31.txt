<p><strong>And when they had prayed</strong>,.... Either while they were praying, or as soon as they had done; for sometimes, as here, prayer is immediately heard, and an answer is returned, whilst the saints are speaking, or as soon as prayer is ended:</p>
<p><strong>the place was shaken where they were assembled together</strong>; which, whether it was a private house, or the temple, is not certain: the latter seems more probable, because their number was so great, that no private house could hold them; and since this was the place where they used to assemble; this was now shaken with a rushing mighty wind, as on the day of Pentecost, and was a symbol of the divine presence, and a token that their prayers were heard, and an emblem of the shaking of the world by the ministry of the apostles:</p>
<p><strong>and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost</strong>; with the gifts of the Holy Ghost, even with extraordinary ones, such as speaking with divers tongues, as before on the day of Pentecost; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</span> and this was the case not only of the apostles, but of the other ministers of the word, and it may be of the whole church:</p>
<p><strong>and they spoke the word of God with all boldness</strong>; that is, the apostles, and preachers of the Gospel, spoke it with great freedom, and without fear, not only privately, in their community, but publicly, in the temple: this was what was particularly prayed for, and in which they had a remarkable answer.</p>
