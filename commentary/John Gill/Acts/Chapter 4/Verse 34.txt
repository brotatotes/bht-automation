Bread to eat, or clothes to wear, or any of the necessaries of life; which shows their great charity, and gives a reason why they were in so much favour with the people, because they took so much care of their poor; and this flowed from the grace of God bestowed upon them:</p>
<p><strong>for as many as were possessors of lands and houses</strong>; or "vineyards", as the Ethiopic version reads, whether in Jerusalem or elsewhere;</p>
<p><strong>sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold</strong>; whether lands, houses, or vineyards.</p>
