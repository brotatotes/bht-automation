<p><strong>And Annas the high priest</strong>,.... So called, either because he had been an high priest, though he was not now, but Caiaphas his son-in-law; or because he was the Sagan of the high priest, and had all the other priests under his government; and is mentioned first, because he was father-in-law to Caiaphas; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> he could not be called so, because he was נשיא, "prince", or president of the council; for not he, but Gamaliel, was president at this time. And</p>
<p><strong>Caiaphas</strong>; who was properly high priest, and continued so for three years after the death of Christ:</p>
<p><strong>and John</strong>; who is thought by Dr. Lightfoot to be the same with Jochanan, or John ben Zaccai; a famous Jewish Rabbi, who lived at this time, and until, and after the destruction of Jerusalem: this Rabbi was כהן, "a priest" t, as this John was, of the kindred of the high priest; he lived also at Jerusalem; for it is said of him u, that he sat in the shadow of the temple, and expounded all the whole day; and a very remarkable story is told of him, which happened just about this time w; which is, that</p>
<p>"forty years before the destruction of the temple--the doors of the temple opened of themselves, when Rabban Jochanan ben Zaccai reproved them, saying, O temple, temple, wherefore dost thou fright thyself? I know thee, that thine end shall be, to be destroyed; for so prophesied of thee Zechariah, the son of Iddo, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+11:1">Zechariah 11:1</span>. "Open thy doors, O Lebanon", c.''</p>
<p>The chief objection to him, as that learned writer observes, is, that he lived and died a Pharisee, whereas this John seems to have been a Sadducee see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:17">Acts 5:17</span>. This puts me in mind of John the high priest, who ministered in the high priesthood fourscore years, and at last became a Sadducee x: Beza's ancient copy reads "Jonathan: and Alexander"; whose surname was Lysimachus, and had the title of "Alabarcha"; he was a very rich man y: after Alexander the great had been at Jerusalem, this name became frequent among the Jews; and it is said z to be promised him, and was fulfilled, that every son that was born to the priests that year he entered Jerusalem, should be called Alexander; and therefore it is no wonder to hear of an Alexander among the kindred of the high priest; frequent mention is made of רבי אלכסנדרי, "Rabbi Alexander", in the Jewish writings a:</p>
<p><strong>and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest</strong>; by whose means they were become members of the sanhedrim:</p>
<p><strong>were gathered together at Jerusalem</strong>; where the great council only sat, until the destruction of it; it seems by this, that some of the members of it lived in the country; it may be in some of the villages adjacent, where they might be easily and quickly sent for, upon any occasion, as they very likely now were; the Syriac version leaves out the words "at Jerusalem".</p>
