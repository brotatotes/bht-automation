Then fell she down straightway at his feet,.... In like manner, and by the same hand of God as her husband before:and yielded up the ghost; died directly:and the young men came in and found her dead; the young men who had been to inter her husband came into the house at that instant, and found her dead upon the floor, at the feet of the Apostle Peter:and carrying her forth, buried her by her husband; as it was usual with the Jews to do. So they say i, that in the cave of Machpelah were buried Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Leah.i Cippi Hebraici, p. 4. T. Bab. Sota, fol. 13. 1.
