<p><strong>But when the officers came</strong>,.... The Arabic version adds, "to it"; that is, to the prison;</p>
<p><strong>and found them not in the prison</strong>. The Vulgate Latin version reads, "the prison being opened they found them not"; when they came to the prison, they opened the doors of it, or the keepers for them; for though the angel had opened them for the apostles, yet he shut them again, as he brought them out; for these men found the doors shut, as the following verse shows, and who upon opening them and searching the prison, for the apostles, could find none of them in it; wherefore they returned; the Arabic version reads, "to them"; to the sanhedrim:</p>
<p><strong>and told</strong>; that is, them, as both the Arabic and Ethiopic versions read.</p>
