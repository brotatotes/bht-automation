Saying, the prison truly found we shut with all safety,.... Locked, barred and bolted;and the keepers standing without before the doors; both inner and outer in their proper places, diligently discharging their office:but when we had opened we found no man within; that is, none of the apostles, for there might be other prisoners in it, who were not released by this means.
