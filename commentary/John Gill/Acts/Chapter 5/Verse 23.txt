<p><strong>Saying, the prison truly found we shut with all safety</strong>,.... Locked, barred and bolted;</p>
<p><strong>and the keepers standing without before the doors</strong>; both inner and outer in their proper places, diligently discharging their office:</p>
<p><strong>but when we had opened we found no man within</strong>; that is, none of the apostles, for there might be other prisoners in it, who were not released by this means.</p>
