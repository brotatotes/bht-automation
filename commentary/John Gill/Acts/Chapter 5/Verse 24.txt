<p><strong>Now when the high priest</strong>,.... Or "the priests", as it is read in most copies; the Complutensian edition reads, "the high priest"; and he is certainly designed, since he is distinguished from the chief priests after mentioned: the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, leave out this word; as does also the Alexandrian copy:</p>
<p><strong>and the captain of the temple</strong>; the same versions read in the plural number; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,</p>

<p><strong>and the chief priests heard these things</strong>; which the officers related, that the prison doors were shut and sure, and the keepers upon their watch, and yet the apostles gone:</p>
<p><strong>they doubted of them, whereunto this would grow</strong>; they did not doubt of the truth of the things their officers told them, but they were amazed at them, and hesitated in their minds about them, and were anxiously thoughtful; what this would, or should be, or how this should be done; that the prison doors should be shut, and yet the prisoners gone; they were in suspense and anxiety of mind, what to impute it to; whether to a divine and supernatural power, or to magic art; and were uneasy in their minds what would be the issue of so strange and surprising an event.</p>
