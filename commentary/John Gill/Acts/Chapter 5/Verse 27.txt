And when they had brought them,.... From the temple, to the place where the sanhedrim sat, which, by this, seems to have been not in the room Gazith, nor in the shops, which were both in the temple, but in some part of the city of Jerusalem:they set them before the council; whereby was fulfilled what Christ had foretold, Matthew 10:17 "they will deliver you up to the councils"; they placed them before the whole sanhedrim; in the midst of it,Matthew 10:17- :; and as the Ethiopic version here reads:and the high priest asked them; though he was not president of the council, but Gamaliel, after mentioned; yet being in so high an office, and a principal member of the council, took upon him the examination of the apostles.
