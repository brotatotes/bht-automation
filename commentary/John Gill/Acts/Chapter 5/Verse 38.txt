<p><strong>And now I say unto you</strong>,.... This is the sum of my advice upon the observation of these and other instances:</p>
<p><strong>refrain from these men, and let them alone</strong>; keep your hands off of them, do not attempt to take away their lives, but dismiss them quietly, nor go about to hinder them, in what they are concerned:</p>
<p><strong>for if this counsel, or this work be of men</strong>; if the doctrine these men preach is an human device; or this business they are engaged in is only an human affair, projected by men, and carried on upon selfish principles, and worldly views, seeking only themselves, and their secular interests, and not the glory of God:</p>
<p><strong>it will come to nought</strong>; as did the designs of Theudas and Judas.</p>
