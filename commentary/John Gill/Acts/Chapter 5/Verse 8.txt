<p><strong>And Peter answered unto her</strong>,.... Who might be inquiring for her husband; though such a way of speaking was common with the Jews, when nothing goes before to which the answer is made; of which there are frequent instances in the sacred writings:</p>
<p><strong>tell me whether ye sold the land for so much</strong>; naming the sum of money which Ananias had brought; though the historian does not mention it. The Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions read, "tell me, O woman", c. not calling her by her name, as he did her husband, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:3">Acts 5:3</span></p>
<p><strong>yea, she said for so much</strong> just that sum, and no more.</p>
