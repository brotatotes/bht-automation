<p><strong>And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied</strong>,.... From an hundred and twenty to three thousand more, from thence to five thousand more, and after that a multitude of men and women were added, and still they were increasing; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15">Acts 1:15</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:41">Acts 2:41</span>. This increase of the disciples agrees with what Maimonides says z, before observed, that</p>
<p>"in the days of Gamaliel, רבו מינים, "the heretics were multiplied in Israel".''</p>
<p>The word "disciples" was a common name to all Christians, to all that believed in Christ, and was the name they went by, before they were called Christians, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span></p>
<p><strong>there arose a murmuring of the Grecians, or Hellenists, against the Hebrews</strong>; by the Hebrews are meant the Jews that dwelt in Judea, and were the inhabitants of that country, and chiefly of Jerusalem, who spoke the Hebrew, or rather the Syriac language; and by the Grecians, or Hellenists, are meant, not the Greeks that were proselyted to the Jewish religion, though there might be some few among them; but Jews who were born, and had dwelt, in some parts of Greece, and spoke the Greek language, and used the Septuagint version of the Bible; between these two a murmuring arose, a complaint was made by one against the other: so that, as it appears from the instance of Ananias and Sapphira, that this first and pure Gospel church was not free from hypocrites; it is also manifest, that though they were at first so united and harmonious in their affections and judgments, yet they were not always clear of feuds, animosities, and contentions; Satan bestirred himself, and got footing among them, as he commonly does where the Gospel is preached, and there is an increase of it: the reason of this uneasiness was,</p>
<p><strong>because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration</strong>; that is, they had not that distributed which was necessary for them, nor so much as the Hebrew widows; they complained of partiality, as if because the Hebrew widows were the natives of the country, and might be nearly related to many of the community, that therefore they were more regarded and better supplied every day, than their widows were, whose husbands had dwelt in foreign lands, and were not so well known, and had fewer acquaintance and relations; for it seems the ministration or distribution was made every day: and such a practice obtained among the Jews in common, who used to collect every day for the poor, and give it daily to them. Maimonides a speaks of it in this manner;</p>
<p>"they appoint collectors, who receive "every day", from every court, a piece of bread, or any sort of food, or fruit, or money, from whomsoever that offers freely for the time; and they divide that which is collected, "in the evening", among the poor, and they give to every poor person of it "his daily sustenance"; and this is called</p>
<p>תמחוי, "Tamchui", or "the alms dish".''</p>
<p>And from hence the apostles might take up this custom, and follow it. The Ethiopic version renders it, "because they saw their widows minister", or "employed daily"; as if the complaint was, that their widows were too much made use of, and obliged to more frequent and to harder service in taking care of the poor, the sick, and helpless, than the other widows were, who had not their share of labour with them, but lived more at ease. Though others rather think the murmur was, because the Grecian widows were not taken into the number, and employed in taking care of the poor, as the Hebrew widows were; but the sense first given, of not having so good a share in the distribution, seems to be the best.</p>
