<p><strong>But when the time of the promise drew nigh</strong>,.... That is, the time of the four hundred years; when God promised to deliver the seed of Abraham out of their affliction and servitude, and bring them into the land of Canaan to inherit it:</p>
<p><strong>which God had sworn to Abraham</strong>; in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:13">Genesis 15:13</span> for though there is no express mention made of an oath, yet there is a most solemn affirmation, which is equivalent to one; the Alexandrian copy and some others, and the Vulgate Latin version read,</p>
<p><strong>which God promised unto Abraham; the people grew and multiplied in Egypt</strong>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+1:7">Exodus 1:7</span> insomuch, that though their number were but threescore and ten when they went down to Egypt, and though various methods were taken to destroy them, and lessen their numbers, yet in little more than two hundred years, their number was increased to six hundred thousand, and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men, besides old men, women, and children, and besides two and twenty thousand Levites, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+1:46">Numbers 1:46</span>. And it seems, that they multiplied the more towards the time when the promise of deliverance drew nigh to be accomplished, and even when they were the most afflicted, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+1:12">Exodus 1:12</span>.</p>
