<p><strong>Till another king arose</strong>,.... In, or over Egypt, as the Alexandrian copy, and others, and the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions read; in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+1:8">Exodus 1:8</span> it is a new king; the Jewish writers are divided about him, whether he was a different king from the former; or only so called, because he made new edicts d:</p>
<p>"Rab and Samuel, one says a new one absolutely: and the other says, because his decrees were renewed; he that says a new one absolutely, (thinks so) because it is written a new one; and he who says, because his decrees are renewed (or he makes new decrees, he thinks so) from hence, because it is not written, and he died, and there reigned; and (it makes) for him that says, because his decrees are renewed, what is written, "who knew not Joseph"; what is the meaning of that, "who knew not Joseph?" that he was like one who knew not Joseph at all.''</p>
<p>The Septuagint version of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+1:8">Exodus 1:8</span> renders it "another" king, as does Stephen here; another king from the Pharaoh of Joseph: the name of this was Ramesses Miamun; and one of the treasure cities built for him seems to be called after his name, Raamses, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+1:11">Exodus 1:11</span>. The Jews call him Talma e and by Theophilus of Antioch f he is called Tethmosis; and by Artapanus g, Palmanotha: "which knew not Joseph"; nor what great things he had done, to the advantage of the Egyptian nation; he was acquainted with the history of him, and of his worthy deeds, and therefore had no regard to his people, as the other Pharaoh had Josephus h says, the kingdom was translated to another family; which might be the reason why he was not known, nor his friends taken notice of: Aben Ezra says, he was not of the seed royal; wherefore it is written, "and there arose"; he the kingdom, and had not a just right and title so that being a stranger, it is no wonder that he should not know Joseph; Jarchi's note is,</p>
<p>"he made himself as if he did not know him''</p>
<p>he dissembled, he pretended ignorance of him, because he would show no respect unto his people. Beza's ancient copy, and another in the Bodleian library, read, "which remembered not Joseph".</p>
