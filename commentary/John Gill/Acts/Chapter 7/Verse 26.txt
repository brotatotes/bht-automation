<p><strong>And the next day he showed himself to them, as they strove</strong>,.... To two men of the Hebrews, who were quarrelling and contending with one another: these are said by the Jews w to be Dathan and Abiram; who were disputing and litigating the point, and were very warm, and at high words. The occasion of their contention is x said to be this,</p>
<p>"the Hebrew man (that had been abused) went to his house to divorce his wife, who was defiled, but she fled and told the affair to Abiram her brother: and on the morrow, Moses returned a second time to the Hebrew camp, and found Dathan and Abiram contending about the divorce.''</p>
<p>Though some think this is prophetically said, because they afterwards contended and divided in the business of Korah y Moses came up to them, and let them know who he was; and this was the day after he had killed the Egyptian. So Stephen explains the "second day" in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:13">Exodus 2:13</span> and to this agrees what a Jewish writer z says, that in the morning, Moses returned a second time to the camp of the Hebrews:</p>
<p><strong>and would have set them at one again</strong>; persuaded them to peace and concord, composed their difference, reconciled them, and made them good friends:</p>
<p><strong>saying, sirs, ye are brethren</strong>; as Abraham said to Lot, when there was a strife between their herdsmen, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+13:8">Genesis 13:8</span> and if these two were Dathan and Abiram, they were brethren in the strictest sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:1">Numbers 16:1</span></p>
<p><strong>why do ye wrong one to another</strong>? by abusing each other, calling ill names, or striking one another; or by lifting up the hand to strike, as Jonathan the Targumist says Dathan did against Abiram.</p>
