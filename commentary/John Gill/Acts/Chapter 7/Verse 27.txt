<p><strong>But he that did his neighbour wrong</strong>,.... Who seems to be the same person whom Moses had defended the day before; and, according to the Jews, must be Dathan a: the same</p>
<p><strong>thrust him away</strong>; from them, when he went to part them, and persuade them to be good friends:</p>
<p><strong>saying, who made thee a ruler and a judge over us</strong>? which was very ungrateful, if he was the man he had delivered the day before; and very impertinent, since he did not take upon him to rule and judge, but only to exhort and persuade to peace and brotherly love: the language suits with the spirit of Dathan or Abiram; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:3">Numbers 16:3</span> This is thought to be said to him by way of contempt of him, as being a very young man: the words are thus commented on in one of the ancient commentaries of the Jews b,</p>
<p>"R. Judah says, Moses was twenty years of age at that time: wherefore it was said to him, thou art not yet fit to be a prince and a judge over us, seeing one of forty years of age is a man of understanding. And R. Nehemiah says, he was forty years of age; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:3- :">Numbers 16:3- :</span> and it was said to him, truly thou art a man, but thou art not fit to be a prince and a judge over us: and the Rabbans say, he said to him, art thou not the son of Jochebed, though they call thee the son of Bithiah? and dost thou seek to be a prince and a judge over us? it is known concerning thee what thou didst to the Egyptian.''</p>
