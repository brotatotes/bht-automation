<p><strong>Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans</strong>,.... The same with Mesopotamia; so Pliny says b, that</p>
<p>"because of Babylon the head of the Chaldean nation---the other part of Mesopotamia and Assyria is called Babylonia.''</p>
<p>And he places Babylon in Mesopotamia; it was out of Ur, in the land of the Chaldeans particularly, that Abraham came, upon his first call:</p>
<p><strong>and dwelt in Charan</strong>: according to the Jewish writers c, he dwelt here five years:</p>
<p><strong>and from thence, when his father was dead</strong>; who died in Haran, as is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:32">Genesis 11:32</span> and that it was after the death of Terah his father, that Abraham went from thence, is manifest from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:31">Genesis 11:31</span> and yet a Jew d has the impudence to charge Stephen with a mistake, and to affirm, that Abraham went from Haran, whilst his father was yet living; proceeding upon a false hypothesis, that Terah begat Abraham when he was seventy years of age: but Philo the Jew is expressly with Stephen in this circumstance; he says e,</p>
<p>"I think no man versed in the laws can be ignorant, that Abraham, when he first went out of the land of Chaldea, dwelt in Charan; τελευτησαντος τε αυτω του πατρος εκενθι "but his father dying there", he removed from thence:''</p>
<p>and so says Stephen:</p>
<p><strong>he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell</strong>; the land of Canaan; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:5">Genesis 12:5</span> or "he removed himself", as the Ethiopic version renders it; or rather "God removed him", as the Syriac version reads, and so one copy in the Bodleian library; for it was by the order and assistance, and under the direction and protection of God, that he came into that land: after the words</p>
<p><strong>wherein ye now dwell</strong>, Beza's ancient copy adds, "and our fathers that were before us".</p>
