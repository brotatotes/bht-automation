Saying unto Aaron, make us gods to go before us,.... This is a proof of their disobedience to the law of Moses, and of their rejection of him, and of the inclination of their hearts to the idolatry of the Egyptians; which shows the gross stupidity, as well as ingratitude of this people, to think that gods could be made; and that those that are made could go before them, be guides unto them, and protectors of them; when they have eyes, but see not, and hands, but handle not, and feet, but walk not:for as for this Moses; whom they speak of with great contempt, and in a very irreverent way:which brought us out of the land of Egypt; which they mention not with gratitude, but as reflecting upon him for doing it:we wot not what is become of him; they thought he was dead, according to the Targum of Jonathan on Exodus 32:1 they concluded he was consumed with fire on the mount which flamed with fire. b The following story is told by the Jews;"when Moses went up on high, he said to the Israelites, at the end of forty days, at the beginning of the sixth hour I will come; at the end of forty days came Satan, and disturbed the world; he said to them, where is Moses your master? they answered him, he is gone up on high: he said to them, the sixth hour is come; they took no notice of him; he is dead (says he); they had no regard to him; he showed them the likeness of his bier; then they said to Aaron, "as for this man Moses", &c.''b T.
