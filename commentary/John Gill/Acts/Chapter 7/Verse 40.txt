<p><strong>Saying unto Aaron, make us gods to go before us</strong>,.... This is a proof of their disobedience to the law of Moses, and of their rejection of him, and of the inclination of their hearts to the idolatry of the Egyptians; which shows the gross stupidity, as well as ingratitude of this people, to think that gods could be made; and that those that are made could go before them, be guides unto them, and protectors of them; when they have eyes, but see not, and hands, but handle not, and feet, but walk not:</p>
<p><strong>for as for this Moses</strong>; whom they speak of with great contempt, and in a very irreverent way:</p>
<p><strong>which brought us out of the land of Egypt</strong>; which they mention not with gratitude, but as reflecting upon him for doing it:</p>
<p><strong>we wot not what is become of him</strong>; they thought he was dead, according to the Targum of Jonathan on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:1">Exodus 32:1</span> they concluded he was consumed with fire on the mount which flamed with fire. b The following story is told by the Jews;</p>
<p>"when Moses went up on high, he said to the Israelites, at the end of forty days, at the beginning of the sixth hour I will come; at the end of forty days came Satan, and disturbed the world; he said to them, where is Moses your master? they answered him, he is gone up on high: he said to them, the sixth hour is come; they took no notice of him; he is dead (says he); they had no regard to him; he showed them the likeness of his bier; then they said to Aaron, "as for this man Moses", &amp;c.''</p>
