<p><strong>And they made a calf in those days</strong>,.... Whilst Moses was in the mount; this was done in imitation of the Egyptian idol Apis or Serapis, which was an ox or a bullock; and it was made of the golden earnings of the people, which were melted down, and cast into the form of a calf, and graved by Aaron with a graving tool, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:2">Exodus 32:2</span> And so the Syriac version here reads in the singular number, "and he made them a calf"; this was a most shameful and scandalous piece of idolatry. The Jews themselves are so sensible of the horribleness of it, and of the guilt of it, and of the reproach that lies on them for it, that it is common for them to say c,</p>
<p>"there is not a generation, or an age, in which there is not an ounce of the sin of the calf.''</p>
<p>Or, as elsewhere d expressed,</p>
<p>"no punishment befalls thee, O Israel, in "which there is not an ounce of the sin of the calf".''</p>
<p><strong>And offered sacrifice unto the idol</strong>; an altar was built, and proclamation made, that the next day would be the feast of the Lord; and accordingly early in the morning the people rose, and offered both burnt offerings and peace offerings, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:5">Exodus 32:5</span> and rejoiceth in the works of their own hands; for so the calf was; and which rejoicing they showed by eating, and drinking, and singing, and dancing.</p>
