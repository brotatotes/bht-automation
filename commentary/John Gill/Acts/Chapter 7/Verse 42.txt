<p><strong>Then God turned</strong>,.... Away from them, withdrew his presence, and his favours from them:</p>
<p><strong>and gave them up to worship the host of heaven</strong>; not angels, but the sun, moon, and stars; for since they liked not to retain the knowledge and worship of the true God, who made the heavens, and the earth, God in righteous judgment, in a judicial way, gave them up to a reprobate mind, to commit all the idolatry of the Gentiles, as a punishment of their former sin in making and worshipping the calf:</p>
<p><strong>as it is written in the book of the prophets</strong>; of the twelve lesser prophets, which were all in one book; and which, as the Jews say e, were put together, that a book of them might not be lost through the smallness of it; among which Amos stands, a passage in whose prophecy is here referred to; namely, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="am+5:25">Amos 5:25</span> "O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness"; no; they offered to devils, and not to God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+32:17">Deuteronomy 32:17</span> and though there were some few sacrifices offered up; yet since they were not frequently offered, nor freely, and with all the heart, and with faith, and without hypocrisy, they were looked upon by God as if they were not offered at all.</p>
