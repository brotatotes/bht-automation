<p><strong>Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness</strong>,.... The Ethiopic version adds, "of Sinai"; there it was that the tabernacle was first ordered to be built, and there it was built, and set up; which was a sort of a portable temple, in which Jehovah took up his residence, and which was carried from place to place: of it, and its several parts and furniture, there is a large account in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:1">Exodus 25:1</span>. It is sometimes called Ohel Moed, or "the tabernacle of the congregation", because there the people of Israel gathered together, and God met with them; and sometimes "the tabernacle of the testimony", or "witness", as here; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+38:21">Exodus 38:21</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+1:50">Numbers 1:50</span> because the law, called the tables of the testimony, and the testimony, it being a testification or declaration of the will of God, was put into an ark; which for that reason is called the ark of the testimony; and which ark was placed in the tabernacle; and hence that took the same name too. The Jewish writers say k, it is so called,</p>
<p>"because it was a testimony that the Shekinah dwelt in Israel'';</p>
<p>or as another l expresses it,</p>
<p>"it was a testimony to Israel that God had pardoned them concerning the affair of the calf, for, lo, his Shekinah dwelt among them.''</p>
<p>This tabernacle, in which was the testimony of the will of God, what he would have done, and how he would be worshipped, and which was a token of his presence, was among the Jewish fathers whilst they were in the wilderness; and is mentioned as an aggravation of their sin, that they should now, or afterwards, take up and carry the tabernacle of Moloch. The Alexandrian copy reads, "your fathers"; the sense is the same.</p>
<p><strong>As he had appointed</strong>; that is, as God appointed, ordered, and commanded:</p>
<p><strong>speaking unto Moses</strong>, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:40">Exodus 25:40</span></p>
<p><strong>that he should make it according to the fashion he had seen</strong>; when in the Mount with God; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span> for it was not a bare account of the tabernacle, and its vessels, which he hearing, might form an idea of in his mind; but there was a visible form represented to his eye, a pattern, exemplar, or archetype of the whole, according to which everything was to be made; which teaches us, that everything in matters of worship ought to be according to the rule which God has given, from which we should never swerve in the least.</p>
