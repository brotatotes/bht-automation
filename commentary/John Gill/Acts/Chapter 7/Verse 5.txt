<p><strong>And he gave him none inheritance in it</strong>,.... To be personally enjoyed by him; and which was a great trial to Abraham's faith, to be brought out of his country, and into another land, and which was promised to him and his; and yet, as not the whole, so not a single part of it was given him to possess:</p>
<p><strong>no, not so much as to set his foot on</strong>: so that when Sarah his wife died, he was obliged to buy a piece of ground for a burying place to bury her in: and which could not be said to be given him by the Lord, for he bought it with his money:</p>
<p><strong>yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child</strong>; which was another exercise of Abraham's faith, that he should have a whole country promised him and his seed, and yet had no seed given him; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:7">Genesis 12:7</span>.</p>
