<p><strong>Who have received the law, by the disposition of angels</strong>,.... Who attended the angel that spake to Moses on Mount Sinai, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:38">Acts 7:38</span> who is the head of all principality and power, and whom he might make use of in giving the law to Moses: hence the law is said to be ordained by angels, in the hand of a Mediator, and is called the word spoken by angels, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19">Galatians 3:19</span> and certain it is, that there were great numbers of angels on Mount Sinai, when the law was given, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+33:2">Deuteronomy 33:2</span> And so the Jews say m, that</p>
<p>"when the holy blessed God descended on Mount Sinai, there came down with him many companies of angels, Michael and his company, and Gabriel and his company''</p>
<p>Indeed they often say n,</p>
<p>"the law was not given to the ministering angels:''</p>
<p>their meaning is, it was not given to them to observe and keep, because there are some things in it, which do not concern angels; but then it might be given to them to deliver to Moses, who gave it to the Israelites, and so may be said to receive it by the ministration of angels, through the hands of Moses. And now the law being given and received in so grand a manner, was an aggravation of the sin of the Jews in violating it, as it follows:</p>
<p><strong>and have not kept it</strong>; but broke it in innumerable instances, and scarce kept it in any; for no man can keep it perfectly.</p>
