And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage,.... At the end of the four hundred years, and which was the Egyptian nation:I will judge, said God; that is, condemn and punish them, as he did, by inflicting the ten plagues upon them:and after that they shall come forth; out of the land of Egypt, and their hard bondage there; and which was brought about by the judgments executed upon the Egyptians:and serve me in this place; in the land of Canaan; though these words are not to be found in Genesis 15:13 what comes nearest them is in Exodus 3:12. "Ye shall serve God upon this mountain"; meaning Mount Horeb, where Moses then was, and from whence the law was afterwards given.
