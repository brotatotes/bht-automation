<p><strong>And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage</strong>,.... At the end of the four hundred years, and which was the Egyptian nation:</p>
<p><strong>I will judge, said God</strong>; that is, condemn and punish them, as he did, by inflicting the ten plagues upon them:</p>
<p><strong>and after that they shall come forth</strong>; out of the land of Egypt, and their hard bondage there; and which was brought about by the judgments executed upon the Egyptians:</p>
<p><strong>and serve me in this place</strong>; in the land of Canaan; though these words are not to be found in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:13">Genesis 15:13</span> what comes nearest them is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:12">Exodus 3:12</span>. "Ye shall serve God upon this mountain"; meaning Mount Horeb, where Moses then was, and from whence the law was afterwards given.</p>
