Or the covenant, of which circumcision was a sign or token, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:11">Genesis 17:11</span>. Stephen speaks here in the language of the Jews, who are wont to speak of circumcision after this manner; hence in the Jewish liturgy, there is a collect, לברית מילה, "for the covenant of circumcision" h; and so it is said i,</p>
<p>"when Joseph died, they made void the "covenant of circumcision":''</p>

<p><strong>and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs</strong>; the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
