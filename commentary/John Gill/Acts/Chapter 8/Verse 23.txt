<p><strong>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness</strong>,.... Alluding to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+29:18">Deuteronomy 29:18</span> with which compare <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:15">Hebrews 12:15</span> and signifying, that he was in a state of nature and unregeneracy; under the power and dominion of covetousness, ambition, and hypocrisy; and in a way pernicious to himself, infectious to others, and ungrateful to God, and to good men; and that instead of the root of the matter, the truth of grace being in him, there was nothing in him but the bitter root of sin; which bore gall and wormwood, and everything that was nauseous and disagreeable:</p>
<p><strong>and in the bond of iniquity</strong>; referring to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+5:22">Proverbs 5:22</span> and suggesting, that he was held fast bound in the bonds of sin, and with the cords of iniquity, or was entirely under the government of his lusts: the preposition εις, which we render "in", may retain here, as is by some observed, its proper sense of "for", or "into"; and have the same signification it has in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5">Hebrews 1:5</span> "I will be to him for a father", or "a father", and "he shall be to me for a son", or "a son": and then the sense of Peter is, I plainly perceive and clearly see by thy words and actions, that thou art nothing else but a lump of bitter gall, and a bundle of sin and wickedness.</p>
