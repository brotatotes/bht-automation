<p><strong>And they, when they had testified</strong>, c. That is, Simeon (or Peter) and John, as the Syriac version expresses it when they had bore their testimony to, and by it confirmed the Gospel as preached by Philip, and had established the young converts in it, and against the errors of Simon Magus:</p>
<p><strong>and preached the word of the Lord</strong>; or of "God", as read the Alexandrian copy, and the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions; when they had preached the Gospel in the city of Samaria, the same as Philip had preached before; whereby it appeared, that there was an harmony and agreement between them:</p>
<p><strong>returned to Jerusalem</strong>; to the rest of the apostles there, to give them an account, how they found things at Samaria; what they had done, and what they had met with: and upon their return, whilst on their journey, they stopped at several places, which lay in their way;</p>
<p><strong>and preached the Gospel in many villages of the Samaritans</strong>; their first commission in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:5">Matthew 10:5</span> being now cancelled, and a new one given them to preach the Gospel to every creature; and being appointed witnesses for Christ in Samaria, as well as in Jerusalem and Judea; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:8">Acts 1:8</span>.</p>
