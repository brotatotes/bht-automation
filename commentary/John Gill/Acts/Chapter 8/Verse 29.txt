<p><strong>Then the Spirit said unto Philip</strong>,.... Not the angel, a ministering Spirit, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:26">Acts 8:26</span> but the Holy Spirit, as the Syriac and Ethiopic versions read, the same with the Spirit of the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:39">Acts 8:39</span> who spoke unto him, either by an articulative voice, such as was the Bath Kol among the Jews; or inwardly, by a secret impulse upon him, he directed him, saying:</p>
<p><strong>go near, and join thyself to this chariot</strong>; he bid him make up to the chariot, he saw driving on the road at such a distance, and follow it, and attend it closely; and not leave it, till an opportunity of conversing with the person in it offered.</p>
