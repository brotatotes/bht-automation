<p><strong>As for Saul, he made havoc of the church</strong>,.... Did evil to the saints, destroyed them that called upon the name of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:13">Acts 9:13</span> and persecuted and wasted the church of God, as he himself says, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:13">Galatians 1:13</span> and now did Benjamin, of which tribe Saul was, ravine as a wolf, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:27">Genesis 49:27</span></p>
<p><strong>Entering into every house</strong>; where the saints dwelt:</p>
<p><strong>and haling men and women</strong>: in a violent manner, without any regard to age or sex:</p>
<p><strong>committed them to prison</strong>; delivered them up into the hands of the chief priests and magistrates, in order to be committed and sent to prison; this he himself confesses, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:4">Acts 22:4</span>.</p>
