<p><strong>went every where</strong>; or <strong>went through</strong> the countries of Judea and Samaria, as far as Phenice, Cyrus, and Antioch:</p>
<p><strong>preaching the word</strong>; the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions add, "of God", and so some copies; the Gospel, which is the word of God, and not man; which was not of men, nor received from men, but came from God, and by the revelation of Christ; and which was good news and glad tidings, of peace, pardon, righteousness and salvation, by Jesus Christ.</p>
