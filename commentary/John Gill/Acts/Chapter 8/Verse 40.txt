<p><strong>But Philip was found at Azotus</strong>,.... The same with the Ashdod of the Philistines, famous for the temple of Dagon, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+5:1">1 Samuel 5:1</span> where the Septuagint call it Azotus, as here: and so it is called in the Apocrypha:</p>
<p>"Howbeit all the hindmost of them were slain with the sword: for they pursued them unto Gazera, and unto the plains of Idumea, and <strong>Azotus</strong>, and Jamnia, so that there were slain of them upon a three thousand men.'' (1Mac 4:15)</p>
<p>"Whereof when Apollonius heard, he took three thousand horsemen, with a great host of footmen, and went to <strong>Azotus</strong> as one that journeyed, and therewithal drew him forth into the plain. because he had a great number of horsemen, in whom he put his trust.'' (1Mac 10:77)</p>
<p>"But Jonathan set fire on <strong>Azotus</strong>, and the cities round about it, and took their spoils; and the temple of Dagon, with them that were fled into it, he burned with fire.'' (1Mac 10:84)</p>
<p>"And when he came near to <strong>Azotus</strong>, they shewed him the temple of Dagon that was burnt, and <strong>Azotus</strong> and the suburbs thereof that were destroyed, and the bodies that were cast abroad and them that he had burnt in the battle; for they had made heaps of them by the way where he should pass.'' (1Mac 11:4)</p>

<p><strong>and passing through</strong>; or, as he passed along through that and other places:</p>

<p><strong>till he came to Caesarea</strong>; not Caesarea Philippi, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:13">Matthew 16:13</span> but that which was before called Strato's tower, and was rebuilt by Herod, and called Caesarea, in honour of Augustus Caesar u; and not by Caesar himself, as R. Benjamin says w: it was six hundred furlongs, or seventy five miles from Jerusalem x, This place was famous for Jewish Rabbins, and their schools of learning; frequent mention is made of רבנין דקיסרין, "the Rabbins of Caesarea" y; here Philip seems to have stopped, and stayed awhile.</p>
