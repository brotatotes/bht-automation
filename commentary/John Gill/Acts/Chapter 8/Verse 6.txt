<p><strong>And the people with one accord</strong>,.... The inhabitants of the city of Samaria, as one man, came to hear the word:</p>
<p><strong>and gave heed to those things which Philip spake</strong>; they listened to them, took notice of them, gave their ascent to them, believed and embraced them; being induced thereunto, not only upon the evidence by which these things came, but by reason of the miracles which he wrought, for the confirmation of them: for it follows,</p>
<p><strong>hearing and seeing the miracles which he did</strong>; and which are particularly mentioned in the next verse.</p>
