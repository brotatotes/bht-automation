Who perhaps came hither upon the persecution at Jerusalem, or rather might have lived here some time; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:13">Acts 9:13</span> that he was more than a private or ordinary disciple of Christ seems manifest, from his being sent to Saul on such an, important affair; from his putting his hands upon him, upon which he was filled with the Holy Ghost; and from his baptizing him: some think he was one of the seventy disciples; some say he was a deacon; but it is certain he was not one of the first seven; others affirm he was a presbyter, and some report that he was afterwards bishop of Damascus, and died a martyr there; but these are things not to be depended on:</p>

<p><strong>and he said, behold, I am here, Lord</strong>; in like manner as Samuel did, when a child, when the Lord called to him; showing his readiness to hearken to his voice, to do his will, and obey his orders, be they what they would.</p>
