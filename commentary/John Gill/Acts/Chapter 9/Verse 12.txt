<p><strong>And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias</strong>,.... Some read this verse in a parenthesis, and take them to be the words of Luke the historian; but it is rather a continuation of the words of Christ, telling Ananias, for his greater encouragement to go to Saul, that he had seen him in a vision, and had knowledge both of his person, and of his name, and of what he was to do to him; for in the vision or dream, he had been represented to him as</p>
<p><strong>coming in</strong>; to the house, and into the room where he was:</p>
<p><strong>and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight</strong>; without which he had been three days, and which he did receive upon Ananias's putting his hands on him.</p>
