<p><strong>But the Lord said unto him, go thy way</strong>,.... The Syriac version reads, "arise, go thy way"; make no delay, nor any excuse, there is no reason for it; nothing is to be feared from him:</p>
<p><strong>for he is a chosen vessel unto me</strong>; a choice and excellent one, full of the heavenly treasure of the Gospel, full of the gifts and graces of the Spirit, and so very fit and richly qualified for the use and service of Christ; and was כלי חמדתה, "a vessel of desire", or a desirable one, as the Jews speak n: or he was, to render the words literally, "a vessel of election"; both an instrument gathering in the election, or the elect of God, through the preaching of the Gospel; and was himself chosen of God, both to grace and glory, a vessel of mercy, and of honour prepared for glory; and was separated, predestinated, and appointed to the Gospel of God, to preach it among the Gentiles; which sense is confirmed by what follows:</p>
<p><strong>to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel</strong>; by "the name" of Christ is meant his Gospel, which is a declaration of his person, perfections, glories, and excellencies, of his offices, grace, righteousness, and salvation; and to "bear" it, is to preach it, to carry it about, spread abroad, and propagate it; in allusion either to the prophets of old, whose prophecies are often called a "burden", which they bore and carried to the several nations to whom they were sent; or to the Levites bearing the tabernacle of the Lord, and its vessels, "be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:11">Isaiah 52:11</span>. Upon which Aben Ezra has this note,</p>
<p>"they are the Israelites, נושאי התורה, "that bear the law";''</p>
<p>but Saul was a chosen vessel to bear the Gospel; or to the sower of seed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+126:6">Psalms 126:6</span> "before the Gentiles", or nations of the world; and he was an apostle, and teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity; the Gospel of the uncircumcision was particularly committed to him: and before "kings", as he did before Agrippa, king of the Jews, and before Nero, emperor of Rome; and his bonds for the Gospel, and so the Gospel through his bonds became manifest in all the palace, or court of Caesar. And before</p>
<p><strong>the children of Israel</strong>; the Jews, to whom he first preached it; but when they put it away he turned to the Gentiles, and afterwards, before the Jews, he bore a testimony for it.</p>
<p>n T. Bab. Megilla, fol. 6. 1.</p>
