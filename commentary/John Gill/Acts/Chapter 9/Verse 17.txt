<p><strong>And Ananias went his way</strong>,.... He arose from off his bed or seat, where he was, went out of his house, and on the way to the place where Saul was; he had nothing more to say, his objections were answered; there was no room to excuse himself, nor did he now desire it, but quietly yields, and cheerfully obeys:</p>
<p><strong>and entered into the house</strong>; or "that house", the house of Judas, where Saul was, and whither Ananias was directed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:11">Acts 9:11</span></p>
<p><strong>and putting his hands on him</strong>; on Saul, in the same form Saul had seen him, in vision, doing it: and which was done, either as a prayer gesture; or for the healing of him, the restoring him to his sight; or that he might receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost; and it may be on all these accounts: and</p>
<p><strong>said, brother Saul</strong>; he calls him "brother", not because he was of the same nation, but because he was now of the same faith; because he was a regenerate person, and belonged to the family of God, and was of the same household of faith: and this he said, not upon what he had received from Saul's own mouth, for he addressed him in this manner as soon as he came to him; but upon what the Lord had said concerning him; though it was indeed common with the Jewish doctors to salute one another with this name.</p>
<p>"When R. Jose ben Kisma was sick, R. Chanina ben Tradion went to visit him; he said unto him, Chanina, אחי אחי "my brother, my brother", c. o.''</p>
<p>So Shemaiah called Abtalion his brother p. And in like manner R. Eleazar ben Azariah saluted R. Ishmael q. And R. Joshua speaks of R. Tarphon in the same language r:</p>
<p><strong>the Lord, even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest</strong> that is, who appeared to Saul as he was in the way to Damascus; not that Jesus was in the way, for he was in heaven, and appeared from thence to Saul, who was in the way: and he mentions Jesus by name, and this appearance of his, partly to assure him of his mission from him; for otherwise he could have known nothing of his appearance to him; and partly to show the love of Christ to him, and though he had persecuted him in so violent a manner, he had a compassionate regard for him; as also to encourage and comfort him, who had been trembling, and astonished at what he had heard from Jesus. This same glorious person, adds he,</p>
<p><strong>hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight</strong>; his bodily sight, which he had been without three days, by the imposition of hands:</p>
<p><strong>and be filled with the Holy Ghost</strong>; with the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, such as speaking with divers tongues, healing diseases, and the like; for as for the graces of the Spirit, and even Gospel light and knowledge, and gifts for preaching it, he had received these already.</p>
