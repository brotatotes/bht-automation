<p><strong>Then the disciples took him by night</strong>,.... The Alexandrian copy reads, "his disciples"; the disciples of Saul, such as he had been instrumental in making at Damascus: but it is not usual for the saints to be called in Scripture the disciples of any man; therefore the common reading is best, and designs the disciples and followers of Christ; who being concerned for the preservation of so valuable a life, took Saul in the night season,</p>
<p><strong>and let him down by the wall in a basket</strong>. Damascus was a walled city; hence we read of the wall of Damascus, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+49:27">Jeremiah 49:27</span>. And the house where Saul was, and which very likely was one of the disciples, was built upon the wall, as the house of Rahab was upon the town wall of Jericho; and as she let down the spies from thence by a cord through the window, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jos+2:15">Joshua 2:15</span> so the disciples let down Saul in a basket with cords through the window of the house, as appears from 2Co 11:33. <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jos+2:15- :">Joshua 2:15- :</span>: no doubt, the disciples were directed by the overruling providence of God, in order to preserve the life of the apostle, who had much work to do for Christ in several parts of the world, and therefore must not fall into the hands of his enemies and die, his time not being yet come; and this shows, that it is lawful to make use of all prudent means and proper methods to prevent the designs of wicked men, and escape out of their hands, and preserve life when in danger; by which means Saul escaped their hands.</p>
