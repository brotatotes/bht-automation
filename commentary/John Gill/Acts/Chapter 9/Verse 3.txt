<p><strong>And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus</strong>,.... Some say it was a mile from Damascus: though, no mention is made of his obtaining letters from the high priest, only of his desiring them; yet there is no doubt but they were granted him; the design of the historian, under a divine direction, being to give an account of the temper and disposition of Saul; and he having got them, set out on his journey in high spirits, and proceeded on with the same wicked intentions, till he came near the city; where he designed to open and show his commission, and execute his wrathful purposes; but he is not suffered to go into the city with such a Spirit:</p>
<p><strong>and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven</strong>; which exceeded the light and brightness of the sun, for it was at midday, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:13">Acts 26:13</span> and so the Ethiopic version here inserts this clause, "and it was noon time"; which circumstance shows that the light was very extraordinary; and it was an emblem of that inward and spiritual light which was now quickly communicated to him, light being the first thing in the new, as in the old creation; and of that Gospel light he was hereafter to spread in the world.</p>
