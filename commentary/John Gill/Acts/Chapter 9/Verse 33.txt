<p><strong>And there he found a certain man</strong>,.... In a house in that city, into which he entered:</p>
<p><strong>named Aeneas</strong>; which is a Gentile name, and so might the person be; though there is mention made of this name among the Jews. We read of one R. Samuel Bar, אנייא "Aenea, or Aeneas" l; but it was more common among the Greeks. Aeneas the Trojan is well known in history, who, after the destruction of Troy, went into Italy, and settled there; and from him the Trojans are sometimes called Aeneadae. The name comes from the Greek word αινω, "ainoo", which signifies "to praise"; and Aeneas is one "worthy of praise": though Jerom m takes it to be an Hebrew name, which he interprets "one that answers", or a "poor man", or "misery"; as if it came from the Hebrew word ענה, "anah", which signifies "to answer, or to afflict".</p>
<p><strong>Which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy</strong>; so that the distemper was grown stubborn, and thought incurable; nor perhaps had he, or his friends, any hope of his ever being restored to health again.</p>
