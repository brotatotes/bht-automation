<p><strong>And Peter said unto him, Aeneas</strong>, c. He called him by his name, which he might without divine revelation know, though he was a stranger to him, by the people of the house, where he was:</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Christ maketh thee whole</strong> Peter knew, by some secret impulse upon his mind, that Christ would cure this man by him as an instrument at this time, and therefore said these words; not as a prayer, as some render them, "may Jesus Christ heal thee", though was it so, it was a prayer of faith; but as a promise that he would, or rather as a declaration of the then present exertion of his power to heal him; which he ascribes not to himself, but to Christ, in whose name, and by whose power the apostles wrought all their miracles; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:12">Acts 3:12</span> "arise, and make thy bed"; which would be a full demonstration that he was perfectly whole:</p>
<p><strong>and he arose immediately</strong>; and also, no doubt, made his bed, as the man at Bethesda's pool was bid by Christ, to take up his bed and carry it, as a proof of his soundness.</p>
