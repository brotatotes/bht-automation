<p><strong>And he fell to the earth</strong>,.... Not being able to bear the light, and still less the divine glory and majesty which he perceived was present; and therefore, in great confusion, amazement, and fear, he fell with his face to the ground, and lay there prostrate and so did also those that were with him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</span></p>
<p><strong>and heard a voice, saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me</strong>? this voice was the real voice of Christ in his human nature, and who visibly and in person appeared, and was seen by the apostle;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:16">Acts 26:16</span> the language he spoke in was the Hebrew tongue, and he calls him by his Hebrew name Saul, and which is doubled to denote vehemency and affection; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:16- :">Acts 26:16- :</span> he knew him as one of his sheep, though straying, and calls him by name, and expostulates with him, wherefore he should persecute him in his members as he did; for the union between Christ and his people is so close, that what is done to them is done to him. There seems to be a considerable emphasis on the word "me"; "me", who have been they surety from everlasting; "me", who hath loved thee and given myself for thee; "me", who have shed my blood, laid down my life, and died for thee; "me", who am now at my Father's right hand, interceding for thee, that grace might be bestowed upon thee, the set time being now come.</p>
