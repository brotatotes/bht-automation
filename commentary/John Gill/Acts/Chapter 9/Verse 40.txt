<p><strong>But Peter put them all forth</strong>,.... As he had seen his Lord and Master do, when he raised the daughter of Jairus from the dead, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:54">Luke 8:54</span></p>
<p><strong>and kneeled down and prayed</strong>; it may be, as yet, he had not the mind of God in this matter, and therefore betook himself to prayer, in which he chose to be private and alone:</p>
<p><strong>and turning him to the body</strong>; the corpse of Dorcas, after he had prayed, and was well assured that the power of Christ would be exerted in raising of it:</p>
<p><strong>said, Tabitha, arise</strong>; which words were spoken in the name and faith of Christ, and were all one as, if Christ himself had spoken them; for to his power, and not to the apostles, is the following miracle to be ascribed: and she opened her eyes; which, upon her death, had been closed by her friends; and perhaps the napkin was not yet bound about her face: or if it was, she must remove it ere she could open her eyes and see Peter:</p>
<p><strong>and when she saw Peter</strong>; whom she might know:</p>
<p><strong>she sat up</strong>; upon the bed or bier on which she lay.</p>
