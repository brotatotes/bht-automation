<p><strong>And he gave her his hand, and lift her up</strong>,.... Off of the bed or bier where she was:</p>
<p><strong>and when he had called the saints and widows</strong>; the disciples, brethren and sisters, who were come together on this occasion, as well as the poor widows she had been kind to; the Ethiopic version reads without a copulative, "the holy widows"; and so might these widows be, even such as are described in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:10">1 Timothy 5:10</span></p>
<p><strong>presented her alive</strong>; as Christ did the widow's son of Naam to her, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:15">Luke 7:15</span> and which no doubt was matter of great joy as well as astonishment to all the saints, and especially to the poor widows.</p>
