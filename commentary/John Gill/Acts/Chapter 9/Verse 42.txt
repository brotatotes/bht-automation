<p><strong>And it was known throughout all Joppa</strong>,.... The report of such a miracle, and wrought upon a person of note, was soon spread all over the place, which was very large, for it was a city, as it is called, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:5">Acts 11:5</span>, and it had, as Josephus q says, villages and little towns or cities round about it; all which might go by the name of Joppa, and throughout which the fame of this miracle might pass:</p>
<p><strong>and many believed in the Lord</strong>; in the Lord Jesus Christ, whom Peter preached, and the saints in Joppa professed, and in whose name, and by whose power, this miracle was done.</p>
