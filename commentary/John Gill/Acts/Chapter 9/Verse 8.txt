And Saul arose from the earth,.... As he was bid by Christ, Acts 9:6and when his eyes were opened he saw no man; neither Christ, who appeared to him from heaven, whom he had before seen, nor even any of his companions, nor indeed any object: the Syriac version renders it, "he saw nothing"; not anything at all; and the Ethiopic version, "he could not see": when he opened his eye lids, he perceived his sight was gone, and this showed it to be real blindness; and which was an emblem of the ignorance and blindness he had been in:but they led him by the hand; the men that were with him, perceiving that he could not guide himself, took him by the hand, and led him on his journey;and brought him into Damascus; and now was fulfilled, at least in part, the prophecy in Zechariah 9:1.
