<p><strong>And Saul arose from the earth</strong>,.... As he was bid by Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:6">Acts 9:6</span></p>
<p><strong>and when his eyes were opened he saw no man</strong>; neither Christ, who appeared to him from heaven, whom he had before seen, nor even any of his companions, nor indeed any object: the Syriac version renders it, "he saw nothing"; not anything at all; and the Ethiopic version, "he could not see": when he opened his eye lids, he perceived his sight was gone, and this showed it to be real blindness; and which was an emblem of the ignorance and blindness he had been in:</p>
<p><strong>but they led him by the hand</strong>; the men that were with him, perceiving that he could not guide himself, took him by the hand, and led him on his journey;</p>
<p><strong>and brought him into Damascus</strong>; and now was fulfilled, at least in part, the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:1">Zechariah 9:1</span>.</p>
