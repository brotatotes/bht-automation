<p><strong>Servants, obey in all things your masters</strong>,.... That is, in all things relating to the body, and bodily service; not to the conscience, and religious worship; in things worldly, and not spiritual; in all things that are within a master's power, and it is lawful for him to command; and in all things that are fitting and proper that a servant should do; and even in such things as may be difficult, troublesome, and disagreeable to the flesh unto them; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:7">Luke 17:7</span> who those servants are that are to obey, and who their masters, said to be according to the flesh, to whom they are to be subject, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:7- :">Luke 17:7- :</span>.</p>
<p><strong>not with eyeservice, as menpleasers, but in singleness of heart</strong>;</p>

<p><strong>fearing God</strong>; who sees and knows all things, what servants do when their masters are absent from them, and to whom they are accountable; and a servant that fears God will make conscience of discharging his service faithfully, will not misspend his master's time, nor embezzle his goods, or waste his substance; but from a principle of reverential affection for God, and fear of him, with a concern for his name, and a view to his glory, will with all diligence, uprightness, faithfulness, and sincerity, do his duty, seek his master's good and interest, and cheerfully obey all his lawful commands. The Alexandrian copy reads, "fearing the Lord"; and so the Syriac version, "in the fear of the Lord".</p>
