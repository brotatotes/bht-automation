<p><strong>Lie not one to another</strong>.... Which is another vice of the tongue, and to which mankind are very prone, and ought not to be done to any, and particularly to one another; since the saints are members one of another, and of the same body, which makes the sin the more unnatural; of this vice, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, and is another sin that is to be put off, or put away; that is to be abstained from, and not used. The arguments dissuading from this, and the rest, follow,</p>
<p><strong>seeing that ye have put off the old man, with his deeds</strong>. The Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read this as an exhortation, as they do the next verse also. Who is meant by the old man,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, and what by putting him off,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, and as for "his deeds", they are the same with the deceitful lusts there mentioned, and the works of the flesh in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:19">Galatians 5:19</span> and with the members of the body of sin in the context, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:5">Colossians 3:5</span>. Some, as Beza, think, that here is an allusion to the rite of baptism in the primitive church; which, as he truly observes, was performed not by aspersion, but immersion; and which required a putting off, and a putting on of clothes, and when the baptized persons professed to renounce the sins of the flesh, and their former conversation, and to live a new life.</p>
