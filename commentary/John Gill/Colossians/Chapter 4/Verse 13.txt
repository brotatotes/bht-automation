<p><strong>For I bear him record</strong>,.... The apostle was an eye and ear witness of his fervent prayers, his labour of love, and zealous affection for these saints and others; and therefore, as he judged he ought, he bears a testimony for him,</p>
<p><strong>that he hath a great zeal for you</strong>; for their spiritual welfare, that the Gospel might continue with them, and they in that, against false teachers, and their attempts to subvert them; that they might grow in the grace of the Gospel, and walk worthy of it, and be at peace among themselves:</p>
<p><strong>and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis</strong>; cities in Phrygia, which lay near to Colosse, the one being situated by the river Lycus, and the other by the Maeander; here were many believers, for whom Epaphras had a like zeal and affections as for the Colossians, and to whom very likely he had been useful, either in conversion or edification, or both. The apostle takes no notice to the Colossians of Epaphras being his fellow prisoner, as, he does in his epistle to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:23">Philemon 1:23</span> it may be for this reason, lest they should be over much distressed and cast down with it.</p>
