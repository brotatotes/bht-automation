<p><strong>All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you</strong>,.... This Tychicus was an Asian by birth; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>. His name signifies "fortunate", and is the same with "Fortunatus" in Latin, which name is mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:17">1 Corinthians 16:17</span> whether he is the same person may be inquired. It is said that this Tychicus was one of the seventy disciples, and was afterwards bishop of Chalcedon. However, he was employed by the apostle as a messenger to Colosse, as he also was to Ephesus, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:21">Ephesians 6:21</span>, to inform the members of the church of his state and condition, how it was with him; as that he was in prison at Rome, for the sake of the Gospel, which he continued to abide by, and held fast the profession of, not being in the least moved and intimidated by what he suffered, being supported by the presence of Christ, and the discoveries of his love; and therefore, though his outward state was very mean and uncomfortable, yet the inward state of his soul was right and good; the inward man was renewed day by day. He might also send word by him what his thoughts were about his deliverance, or his dissolution, and what expectation he had of either of these: and that they might give the greater credit to what Tychicus should relate from him, he gives him the following character,</p>
<p><strong>who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister</strong>: the same character is given of him in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:21">Ephesians 6:21</span></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:21- :">Ephesians 6:21- :</span> to which is here added,</p>
<p><strong>and fellow servant in the Lord</strong>; he was a "brother" in Christ, being a partaker of the same grace, and in the same spiritual relation; and "beloved" of God, and Christ, of all the churches and saints that knew him, and especially by the apostle; and was also a "minister" of the Gospel, a preacher of Jesus Christ, and a "faithful" one to Christ, to his Gospel, and the souls of men; than which a greater character cannot well be given: and though the apostle was endued with such superior gifts, grace, and usefulness; yet he calls this ministering brother a "fellow servant in the Lord"; he having a commission to preach from the same Lord, and having the same Gospel intrusted with him, and being engaged in the same good work, and having the same ends in view, the glory of Christ, and the good of souls; though he had not equal abilities and qualifications, and was not in the same high post and office as an apostle of Jesus Christ.</p>
