<p><strong>Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose</strong>,.... That is, to relate to them his affairs both temporal and spiritual; and also,</p>
<p><strong>that he might know your estate</strong>. The Arabic version renders it, "that I may know your estate" by him when he returned again; as whether they continued steadfast in the Gospel, and observed the order, ordinances, and discipline of it; how it prospered, and was succeeded among them, to their comfort and edification, and to the conversion of others; and what reception the false teachers had among them; and what love, concord, and harmony were among themselves; or what were their afflictions and distresses from their enemies. The Ethiopic version renders it, "that ye may know the history of me"; which agrees with a manuscript mentioned by Grotius, which reads, "that ye may know the things concerning us", as does the Alexandrian copy; and with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:22">Ephesians 6:22</span> where it is added, as here, and "comfort your hearts"; who might be greatly cast down upon hearing of the sufferings of the apostle, and also with those they themselves endured both from within and from without, from sin, Satan, and the world; <strong>see on Gill "Eph 6:22"</strong>.</p>
