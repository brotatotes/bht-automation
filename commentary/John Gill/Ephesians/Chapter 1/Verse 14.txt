<p><strong>Which is the earnest of our inheritance</strong>,.... The incorruptible and never fading one in heaven, or the heavenly kingdom; this is the Father's gift, his bequest, and belongs only to children; it comes to them through the death of the testator, Christ, and is for ever; and of this the Spirit of God is the pledge and earnest: an earnest, is what confirms an agreement, and assures the right to the thing agreed to, and is a part of it, and lesser than it, and is never returned; so the Spirit of God certifies the right to the heavenly inheritance, as well as gives a meetness for it; he is the firstfruits of eternal glory and happiness, and of the same kind with it; and as he is enjoyed in measure by the saints now, is lesser than the communion which they shall have with him, and with the Father, and the Son, hereafter, for the best things are reserved till last; and being once given into the heart as an earnest, he always continues, he never removes more, or is ever taken away:</p>
<p><strong>until the redemption of the purchased possession</strong>, or "of the peculiar people"; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>, for this is not to be understood of heaven, which is never said to be purchased, nor can it with any propriety be said to be redeemed; but of saints, of the church of God, who are bought with a price, and are purchased with his blood; and who, as they were redeemed from sin, Satan, and the law, when they were purchased, so will be redeemed again in the resurrection morn, which is called the day of redemption, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:30">Ephesians 4:30</span>, and which will be a redemption of them from the weakness, corruption, and mortality of the body; from their present state of absence and pilgrimage; from the body of sin and death; from all sorrows and afflictions, both inward and outward; from the reproaches and persecutions of men; from a tempting devil, and an unbelieving heart; from all doubts and fears; and from death and the grave; and so the Syriac version very justly renders it, "until the redemption of them that are saved". Now till such time, the Spirit of God abides as an earnest, even until the whole felicity is enjoyed both in soul and body; and this shows the perpetuity of the Spirit's inhabitation, and grace, the final perseverance of the saints, and the security of the inheritance to them.</p>
<p><strong>Unto the praise of his glory</strong>; as to the glory of the Father, by whom the saints are chosen and predestinated, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:6">Ephesians 1:6</span> and to the glory of the Son, by whom they are redeemed, in whom they obtain the inheritance, and in whom they trust, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:12">Ephesians 1:12</span>, so to the glory of the Holy Spirit, by whom they are sealed, and who is their earnest; for he must have his share of glory in the salvation of the elect, as well as the other two persons.</p>
