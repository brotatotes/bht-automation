<p><strong>Far above all principality and power</strong>,.... Good angels and bad angels, and civil magistrates, who also may be intended by the following words:</p>
<p><strong>and might and dominion</strong>; good angels may be so called, because of their employment under God in the affairs of Providence, and the government of this world; and Christ is not only above them, as he is God, being their Creator, who has made them, and on whom they depend, and is the Lord whom they serve, and is the object of their worship and adoration, and as he is Mediator, to whom they minister, and so is above them in nature, name, and office; but also as he is man, in union with the Son of God; and chiefly he here is said to be above them on account of place, being at the right hand of God, where they are not, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:13">Hebrews 1:13</span>. And evil angels may be so called, because of the government which subsists among themselves, and the power and influence they have over mankind; Christ was above them when here on earth, as appears by his resisting the temptations of Satan, and defeating him in them; by his dispossessing devils from the bodies of men; by his spoiling and destroying them and their works at his death; and by his leading them captive, and triumphing over them at his ascension; and by delivering souls out of his hands at conversion, through his power attending the ministration of his Gospel; and his being above them will still be more manifest, in the binding of Satan a thousand years, and in the final condemnation of him, and of all his angels under him: civil magistrates are sometimes called by these names, and Christ is above them; they receive their governments from him, they rule by him, and are accountable to him, and are set up and put down at his pleasure; all these senses may be taken in; but the first seems chiefly designed: it is added,</p>
<p><strong>and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come</strong>; persons of authority and dignity, of fame and renown, whether in earth or heaven; as emperors, kings, princes, nobles, generals of armies c. in this world, and cherubim, seraphim, &amp;c. in the other world: this phrase denotes both the extensiveness of Christ's kingdom, and the eternity of it as reaching to both worlds, and being over everything in them, and as lasting to the end of this, and unto that which is to come.</p>
