<p><strong>And came and preached peace to you which were afar off</strong>,.... Which is to be understood not of Christ's coming in the flesh; for when he came in the flesh, he came only to the Jews that were nigh, and preached the Gospel in his own personal ministry to them, and not to the Gentiles, who are the persons afar off; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12">Ephesians 2:12</span> but of his coming by his Spirit in the ministry of his apostles, to whom he gave a commission after he had made peace and reconciliation by the blood of his cross, to go into all the world and preach the Gospel to the Gentiles in the furthest parts of the earth; and on whom he bestowed gifts, qualifying them for such service, and succeeded them in it by his power and grace: and the subject of their ministry was peace, Christ who is our peace, and peace made by his blood, and the Gospel of peace, which declares both these; and it is the means of making persons of peaceable dispositions; its doctrines and promises, when powerfully applied, give peace to distressed minds, and quiet to doubting saints; and it shows the way to eternal peace:</p>
<p><strong>and to them that were nigh</strong>; to the Jews, to whom the Gospel of peace was preached in the first place, not only by Christ and his apostles, before his death; but by his apostles after his resurrection, and after the commission was given to preach it to the Gentiles; though they are mentioned last, because the apostle was speaking to Gentiles; and this also verifies what Christ says, the first shall be last, and the last first: the Alexandrian copy, some others, and the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, read "peace", in this clause, as in the former; the apostle seems to have respect to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:19">Isaiah 57:19</span> a like description and distinction of Jews and Gentiles may be observed in the writings of the Jews h; so they say,</p>
<p>"the Israelites are near unto the holy King, and the rest of the nations are far from him.''</p>
<p>h Zohar in Numb. fol. 89. 3.</p>
