<p>INTRODUCTION TO EPHESIANS 3</p>
<p>In this chapter the apostle hints at his state and condition as a prisoner, and at the afflictions he endured for the sake of the Gospel; and whereas he knew these would be objected to his ministry, and be discouraging to the saints, he chiefly insists on these two things; namely, to assert his office of apostleship, and observe the knowledge of divine mysteries, and gifts of grace bestowed on him, which he does with all modesty and humility; and also to exhort the saints to constancy and perseverance, notwithstanding his tribulations; for which purpose he puts up several petitions for them; and the whole is concluded with a doxology, or an ascription of glory to God. In <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span>, he declares himself a prisoner of Christ, for the sake of the Ephesians; and which was no objection to his being an ambassador of Christ, and an apostle of his, seeing he had a commission from him to dispense the word of his grace, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:2">Ephesians 3:2</span>, of which, his knowledge in the mystery of Christ, he had by revelation, was an evident proof, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:3">Ephesians 3:3</span>, which might easily be understood by what he had written in the former part of his epistle, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:4">Ephesians 3:4</span>, and was such as had not been given to the saints in former times, as it was to him, and others, now, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5">Ephesians 3:5</span>, particularly the knowledge of the mystery of the calling of the Gentiles by the Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:6">Ephesians 3:6</span>, of which Gospel to the Gentiles he was made a minister, through the gift of grace, and the energy of divine power, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:7">Ephesians 3:7</span>, of which high honour he was unworthy, being, in his own esteem, the meanest of all the people of God; and the grace and favour was the greater, inasmuch as it was the unsearchable riches of Christ he was sent to publish, and that among the Gentiles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span>, and to give men light into a mysterious affair, which from eternity had been hid, and kept a secret in the heart of God, the Creator of all things, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:9">Ephesians 3:9</span>, but was now committed to him with this view, not only to be made known to the church, but by that to the heavenly principalities and powers, even that wise scheme of things which displays the manifold wisdom of God, and was formed according to an eternal purpose in Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</span>, through whom a way of access is opened to God, with boldness, faith, and confidence, as the Gospel declares, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:12">Ephesians 3:12</span>. Wherefore, though he endured much tribulation for the sake of preaching this Gospel, this should not at all sink their spirits, or move them away from the hope of it; but they should rather glory that they had such a faithful preacher and defender of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:13">Ephesians 3:13</span>. And as he desired their perseverance, so he prays for it, and for several things in order to it; the posture in which he prayed was by bowing the knee; the person to whom he prayed is described by his relation to Christ, as his Father, of whom, or of Christ, the whole family of God in heaven and earth are named, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:14">Ephesians 3:14</span>. The petitions made by him are for internal strength from the Spirit of God, that so they might be enabled to persevere, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:16">Ephesians 3:16</span>, and also, that Christ might continue to dwell in their hearts by faith, which would keep them from falling; and likewise, that they might have a lively sense, and a full persuasion of their interest in the love of God; even so as to comprehend with others its breadth, length, depth, and height, which would engage them to press forward, and to hold on, and out, and not faint at tribulations, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:17">Ephesians 3:17</span>, And particularly he prays; that they might know more of the love of Christ, which is not fully to be known, and which would constrain them to follow him, and cleave to him with full purpose of heart; and that they might have a full supply of all grace to support, influence, and assist them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:19">Ephesians 3:19</span>, and for his own, and their encouragement, with respect to having the petitions made, the apostle ascribes glory to God by Christ, as it should be done in the church throughout all ages of time, under this consideration, as being able to do for his people abundantly more than they are able to ask of him, or can think of asking of him, or receiving from him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:20">Ephesians 3:20</span>. </p>
