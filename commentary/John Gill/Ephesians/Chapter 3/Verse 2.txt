<p><strong>If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God</strong>,.... Not the free love and favour of God in his heart towards his people; nor internal grace wrought in the heart of the apostle; but either the gift of grace, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:7">Ephesians 3:7</span> qualifying him for the work of the ministry; and so the Ethiopic version renders it, "if ye have heard the gift of the grace of God"; or rather the doctrine of grace, the Gospel, the subject matter of which is the grace of God; it is a declaration of the free grace of God in the salvation of men; and it is the means of conveying the grace of God into their hearts.
