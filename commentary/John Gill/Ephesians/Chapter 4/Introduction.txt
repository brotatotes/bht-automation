<p>INTRODUCTION TO EPHESIANS 4</p>
<p>The apostle having in the three former chapters treated of the doctrines of grace, and explained and established them, proceeds in the three following to exhort to the duties of religion; and in this advises to a becoming conversation in general, and to brotherly concord and unity in particular; and dehorts from several vices, and encourages to the contrary virtues. And inasmuch as these Ephesians were called with an holy calling, he entreats them, if they had any regard for him as a prisoner of Christ, that they would walk worthy of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>, and directs to the manner in which they should act becoming it, with all humility, patience, forbearance, and love; seeking to preserve a spiritual harmony, unity, and peace, one among another, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:2">Ephesians 4:2</span>, for the encouragement of which, he makes use of various arguments, taken from the unity of the body, of which they were members; from their being quickened and influenced by one and the same Spirit; from having the same hope of eternal happiness, to which they were called; from their having one Lord over them, who is Christ; from their having the same like precious faith in him; from their being baptized with the same baptism in him; and from their having one, and the same God and Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:4">Ephesians 4:4</span>, and from all of them having gifts, though different, for mutual usefulness; which gifts are described by the author and donor of them, Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:7">Ephesians 4:7</span>, which is proved <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:8">Ephesians 4:8</span>, out of a passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:18">Psalms 68:18</span>, which is explained of the humiliation and exaltation of Christ, of his descent from heaven, and ascension thither; the end of which latter was to fill all things, or persons, with gifts, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:9">Ephesians 4:9</span>, of which a particular enumeration is given, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>, the design of which is, to fit men for the work of the ministry, and by them to convert sinners, and edify saints, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:12">Ephesians 4:12</span>, which ministry is to be continued, until all the saints arrive to a perfection of spiritual knowledge, and make up one perfect man, or body of men in Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span>, for the use and end of the Gospel ministry is not, that such who are converted by it should continue children, be in suspense about truth, and under the deceptions of men, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span>, but that through speaking the truth in love, they should grow up into Christ their head; from whom supplies of grace are communicated, for the increase and edification of every member of the body, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:15">Ephesians 4:15</span>, and seeing these Ephesians to whom the apostle writes were separated in the effectual calling from the rest of the Gentiles, they ought not to walk as the others did; whose minds were vain, their understandings darkened, and their hearts blinded, hardened, and ignorant; and had no sense of things, but were given up to all manner of wickedness, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17">Ephesians 4:17</span>, whereas they had learned Christ, and through hearing had been taught the truth of the Gospel, as it was in him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:20">Ephesians 4:20</span>, wherefore it became them in their conversation, not to follow the dictates of corrupt nature, called the old man, that being full of lusts, corrupt, and deceitful, but to act becoming the renewing work of the Spirit upon their souls, and agreeably to the new principles of the grace of God created in them, in order to righteousness and holiness, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22">Ephesians 4:22</span>, and in particular it became them to avoid lying, and on the contrary to speak truth to one another; and that for this reason, because they were members of the same body, and of one another, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:25">Ephesians 4:25</span>, and likewise to abstain from sinful anger, and not continue a wrathful disposition, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:26">Ephesians 4:26</span>, nor was it advisable to yield to the suggestions, solicitations, and temptations of Satan, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:27">Ephesians 4:27</span>, nor to commit theft, but on the other hand give themselves to manual labour at some commendable calling, that they might have for their own use, and others too, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:28">Ephesians 4:28</span>, and it was also right to be careful not to suffer corrupt and unchaste words to come out of their mouths, but such as would be grateful and useful to others, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:29">Ephesians 4:29</span>, and the rather this, and all the rest of the things mentioned, and likewise what follows, should be attended to; since by such evil lusts, words, and actions, the Holy Spirit of God is grieved, who should not, since he is the sealer of the saints unto the day of redemption, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:30">Ephesians 4:30</span>. And the chapter is concluded with a dehortation from several vices of the mind and tongue, respecting wrath and revenge; and an exhortation to the contrary virtues, kindness, tenderness, and forgiveness; to which encouragement is given, by the example of God, who forgives for Christ's sake, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:31">Ephesians 4:31</span>. </p>
