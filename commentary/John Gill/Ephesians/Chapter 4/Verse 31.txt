<p><strong>Let all bitterness</strong>,.... These words are a dehortation from several vices good men are liable to, by which the Spirit of God is grieved: "bitterness" sometimes designs the corruption of nature, which is the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity; and sometimes actual sins and transgressions, even those of God's own people, which are evil and bitter things; and sometimes heretical doctrines, which are roots of bitterness; and sometimes sinful words spoken by the saints, one against another; and here perhaps it signifies, the first offence taken in the mind, against any person, upon any account, which should at once be put away, and not encouraged:</p>
<p><strong>and wrath</strong>: heat of spirit, which follows upon bitterness, or upon the spirit being embittered and offended; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+3:14">Ezekiel 3:14</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And anger</strong>; a sinful one, cautioned against before, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:26">Ephesians 4:26</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And clamour and evil speaking</strong>; such as brawlings, contentions, contumelies, reproaches, slanders, c. arising from an embittered, wrathful, and angry disposition: these should all</p>
<p><strong>be put away from you, with all malice</strong> being the deeds of the old man, unbecoming such as are born again, and grieving to the Spirit of God.</p>
