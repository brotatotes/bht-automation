Let all bitterness,.... These words are a dehortation from several vices good men are liable to, by which the Spirit of God is grieved: "bitterness" sometimes designs the corruption of nature, which is the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity; and sometimes actual sins and transgressions, even those of God's own people, which are evil and bitter things; and sometimes heretical doctrines, which are roots of bitterness; and sometimes sinful words spoken by the saints, one against another; and here perhaps it signifies, the first offence taken in the mind, against any person, upon any account, which should at once be put away, and not encouraged:and wrath: heat of spirit, which follows upon bitterness, or upon the spirit being embittered and offended; see Ezekiel 3:14.And anger; a sinful one, cautioned against before, Ephesians 4:26.And clamour and evil speaking; such as brawlings, contentions, contumelies, reproaches, slanders, c. arising from an embittered, wrathful, and angry disposition: these should allbe put away from you, with all malice being the deeds of the old man, unbecoming such as are born again, and grieving to the Spirit of God.
