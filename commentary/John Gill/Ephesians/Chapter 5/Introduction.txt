<p>INTRODUCTION TO EPHESIANS 5</p>
<p>The apostle, in this chapter, goes on with his exhortations to the duties of religion; and such in general as relate to purity of life, and against uncleanness; and particularly treats of the duties of married persons. And whereas in the latter part of the preceding chapter, he had exhorted to kindness and tenderness, and which he enforced by the example of God himself, he here repeats and urges it; and to it adds the example of Christ in loving his people, and giving himself for them a propitiatory sacrifice, acceptable to God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:1">Ephesians 5:1</span>, then follows a dehortation from several vices of the impure kind, some as being filthy actions, and unbecoming saints, and not to be named by them, and much less done, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3">Ephesians 5:3</span>, others, and such as are vices of the tongue, as being inconvenient, and to which thanksgiving is preferred, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:4">Ephesians 5:4</span>, and the former especially, as excluding from having any part or portion in the kingdom of God and Christ <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>, and all of them, as bringing the wrath of God upon men, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:6">Ephesians 5:6</span>, wherefore professors of religion should avoid such sins, and not join with the children of disobedience in the commission of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:7">Ephesians 5:7</span>, to which exhortation they should the rather give heed, from the consideration of their present state, illustrated by their former one; who were once darkness, but now light, and therefore should walk as enlightened persons, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:8">Ephesians 5:8</span>, and as having the Spirit of God, which is known by its fruits, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:9">Ephesians 5:9</span>, studying to know, approve of, and do that which is acceptable to God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:10">Ephesians 5:10</span>, and on the contrary, should have no society and communion with men in the commission of sins, the works of darkness, but should reprove them for them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:11">Ephesians 5:11</span>, since the things done by them were such, that it was a shame to relate them, and much more to commit them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:12">Ephesians 5:12</span>, and the rather this was incumbent upon them, since it was agreeably to their character, as being made light in the Lord; seeing it is the property of light to make manifest and detect what is done in the dark, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:13">Ephesians 5:13</span>, which is confirmed by a passage of Scripture pertinently produced, to stir up drowsy and lifeless professors to the discharge of their duty, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:14">Ephesians 5:14</span>, and from hence the apostle enforces a wise and circumspect walk and conversation, one part of which lies in redeeming time; and which should be done for this reason, because the present days were evil ones, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:15">Ephesians 5:15</span>, and that they might avoid a foolish walk, and order their conversation wisely and aright, he suggests it would be proper to learn what was the will of the Lord, which is the rule of a Christian's walk and conversation, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:17">Ephesians 5:17</span>, and whereas drunkenness is oftentimes the cause of all the above mentioned vices, the apostle cautions against that, and on the contrary advises them to be concerned for a larger measure of the Spirit of God; that under his influence they might sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, in a melodious manner, and heartily to the Lord; and so express their thankfulness to him, for all mercies from him; and not abuse their mercies and themselves, spend their time in singing lewd and profane songs, as drunkards often do, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:18">Ephesians 5:18</span>, and hence he passes to the special duties of wives and husbands, to which he premises a general exhortation to submission to one another, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:21">Ephesians 5:21</span>, and begins with the subjection of wives to their husbands, this being the will of the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:22">Ephesians 5:22</span>, and besides, the relation which the wife stands in to her husband, being her head, requires it; and which is illustrated by Christ being the head and Saviour of his body, the church, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:23">Ephesians 5:23</span>, and which is further urged and enforced by the instance and example of the church's subjection to Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:24">Ephesians 5:24</span>, and next the apostle exhorts husbands to love their wives, in imitation of Christ, who has loved his church; and as an instance of it, has given himself to death for her; than which, there cannot be a greater instance of love, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:25">Ephesians 5:25</span>, the ends of which were, the sanctification and cleansing of the church with his blood, by means of water and the word; and the presentation of her to himself, all glorious and beautiful, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:26">Ephesians 5:26</span>, and then another argument is used, to engage the affections of husbands to their wives, they being their own bodies; so that loving them, is loving themselves, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:28">Ephesians 5:28</span>, nor was it ever known, and it would be unnatural, for a man to hate his own flesh, but on the contrary, he nourishes and cherishes it; and therefore seeing the wife is a man's own flesh, he ought not to hate her, but to nourish and cherish her; and this is also enforced by the example of Christ, who does not hate his church, but nourishes and cherishes her, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:29">Ephesians 5:29</span>, the reason of which is, because the saints which make up the church are members of him, one flesh and blood with him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:30">Ephesians 5:30</span>, which is the case of a man and his wife; and hence it is, that according to the original law of marriage, a man was to leave father and mother, and cleave to his wife, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:31">Ephesians 5:31</span>, the whole of which is a mystery, and typical of the marriage relation and union between Christ and his church, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:32">Ephesians 5:32</span>, and the chapter is closed with a recapitulation of the mutual duties of husband and wife, love in the one, and reverence in the other, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:33">Ephesians 5:33</span>. </p>
