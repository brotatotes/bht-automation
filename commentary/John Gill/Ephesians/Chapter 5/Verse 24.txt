Her head, being wholly dependent upon him, and entirely resigned to him, and receiving all from him; from whom alone is all her expectation of provision, protection, comfort, and happiness; wherefore she has respect to all his commands, and esteems all his precepts concerning all things to be right; and yields a cheerful, voluntary, sincere, and hearty obedience to them; arising from a principle of love to him, and joined with honour, fear, and reverence of him:</p>
<p><strong>so [let] the wives [be] to their own husbands in everything</strong>: political, domestic, and ecclesiastic; that is consistent with the laws of God, and the Gospel of Christ.</p>
