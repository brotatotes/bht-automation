<p><strong>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies</strong>,.... It is a common saying with the Jews, that a man's wife is כגופו, "as his own body" r; and it is one of the precepts of their wise men, that a man should honour his wife more than his body, ואהבה כגופו, and "love her as his body" s; for as they also say, they are but one body t; the apostle seems to speak in the language of his countrymen; however, his doctrine and theirs agree in this point: wherefore</p>
<p><strong>he that loveth his wife loveth himself</strong>; because she is one body and flesh with him.</p>
