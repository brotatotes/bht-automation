<p><strong>For ye were sometimes darkness</strong>,.... Not only dark, but darkness itself; exceeding blind, dark, and ignorant, respecting spiritual things; so the Gentiles were wont to be called by the Jews, הושך, "darkness" k itself; of this darkness,</p>

<p><strong>But now [are ye] light in the Lord</strong>; either in, or by the Lord Jesus Christ, the light of men, from whom all spiritual light comes; or by the Lord the Spirit, by whom the eyes of their understandings were enlightened, to see the exceeding sinfulness of sin, in heart and life; the insufficiency of their own righteousness and moral virtues, to justify them before God; and the true and right way of righteousness, life and salvation by Christ; and to have some light into the several doctrines of the Gospel, and even a glimpse of the invisible glories and realities of another world: and this light is so great, that they are not only said to be enlightened, but to be light itself; and this they have not of, and from themselves, but the Lord; and therefore should</p>
<p><strong>walk as children of light</strong>; not in sins, which are works of darkness, but in faith, truth, and holiness.</p>
<p>k Tzeror Hammor, fol. 1. 2.</p>
