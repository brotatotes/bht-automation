<p><strong>Stand therefore</strong>,.... Keep your ground, do not desert the army, the church of Christ, nor his cause; continue in the station in which you are placed, keep your post, be upon your watch, stand upon your guard:</p>
<p><strong>having your loins girt about with truth</strong>; by which is meant the Gospel, and the several doctrines of it; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span>; and to have the loins girt with it, shows, that it should be near and close to the saints, and never departed from; and that it is a means of keeping them close to God and Christ, and of strengthening them against the assaults and attacks of Satan; and is of great use in the Christians' spiritual conflict with their enemies; the girdle is a part of armour, and so considerable as sometimes to be put for the whole, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+5:27">Isaiah 5:27</span>; and here it is mentioned in the first place:</p>
<p><strong>and having on the breastplate of righteousness</strong>; in allusion to</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:17">Isaiah 59:17</span>, meaning not works of righteousness done by men, though these are a fence when rightly used against the reproaches and charges of the enemy, as they were by Samuel, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+12:3">1 Samuel 12:3</span>, but rather the graces of faith and love, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:8">1 Thessalonians 5:8</span>, though faith has another place in the Christian armour, afterwards mentioned; wherefore it seems best to understand this of the righteousness of Christ, which being imputed by God, and received by faith, is a guard against, and repels the accusations and charges of Satan, and is a security from all wrath and condemnation.</p>
