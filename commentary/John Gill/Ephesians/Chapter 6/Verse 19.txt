<p><strong>And for me</strong>,.... This shows the great humility of the apostle, and the sense he had of the greatness of the work of the ministry; and that it is the duty of people to pray for their ministers; and that no man is perfect in this life; and that the more superior members need the assistance of the inferior ones; for this request is made by the apostle not in dissimulation, or as feigning humility and modesty; but in the sincerity of his heart, and from a real sense of his need of fresh supplies of gifts and grace, to fit him for the work and service of Christ:</p>
<p><strong>that utterance may be given unto me</strong>, or "that the word"; meaning not the subject matter of the ministry, the word of the Gospel, the word of faith, truth, and reconciliation, for that was committed to him; unless he should mean an increase of light and knowledge in it; but rather a faculty of speaking it freely and aptly, and what is commonly called elocution; not speaking with the enticing words of man's wisdom, but with the words of the Holy Ghost: or else an opportunity of preaching the word, and liberty to do it, as follows;</p>
<p><strong>that I may open my mouth boldly</strong>; or "in the opening of my mouth"; the phrase is Rabbinical. The Jews w say, that when Moses came to write that passage, "let us make man in our image", c. <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>, he said before the Lord of the world, why dost thou give פתחון פה, "opening of the mouth", to heretics? i.e. an occasion to them of speaking, objecting to us, and of reproving and convincing us with respect to a plurality of persons in the Deity: and a little after they say,</p>
<p>"wherever you פתחון פה, "an opening of the mouth to heretics", you will find an answer by its side, or along with it.''</p>
<p>Now the apostle desired he might have something to say, to object to, and to reprove and convince the unbelieving Jews that he might do this with boldness, with all faithfulness with Courage, and intrepidity, and with freedom of speech; or "openly" and "publicly", as the Syriac version renders it:</p>
<p><strong>to make known, the mystery of the Gospel</strong>; or the mysterious doctrines of it, such as the doctrines of a trinity of persons, of the union of the two natures in Christ, justification by his righteousness, regeneration by his Spirit and grace, the saints' union to Christ, and communion with him, the resurrection of the dead, c. which are called mysteries, because they were hid until revealed and though revealed, the "modus" and "ratio" of them are not to be accounted for. Now the apostle's work was to make known these mysteries, to prove the truth of them from the word of God, and to defend them against the opposers of them; and that he might be able to do this he entreats the prayers of the saints.</p>
