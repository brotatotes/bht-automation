<p><strong>That it may be well with thee</strong>,.... In this world, and that which is to come; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+5:16">Deuteronomy 5:16</span>. The Jews z say,</p>
<p>"there are four things, which if a man does, he eats the fruit of them in this world, and the capital part remains for him in the world to come; and they are these, אב ואם</p>
<p>כיבוד; "honouring father and mother", doing acts of beneficence, making peace between a man and his neighbour, and learning of the law, which answers to them all.''</p>
<p><strong>And thou mayest live long on the earth</strong>: length of days is in itself a blessing; and though men's days cannot be lengthened beyond God's purpose and decree; and though obedient children do not always live long; yet disobedience to parents often brings the judgments of God on children, so that they die not a common death, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+18:14">2 Samuel 18:14</span>. On those words in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+32:47">Deuteronomy 32:47</span>, the Jews a have this paraphrase;</p>
<p>"because it is your life, זה כיבוד אב ואם, "this is honouring father and mother; and through this thing ye shall prolong your days", this is beneficence.''</p>
<p>It may be observed, that the words in this promissory part are not the same as in the decalogue, where they stand thus, "that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee",</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:12">Exodus 20:12</span>, referring to the land of Canaan; for the law in the form of it, in which it was delivered by Moses, only concerned the people of the Jews; wherefore to suit this law, and the promise of it, to others, the apostle alters the language of it.</p>
