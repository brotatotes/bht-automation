<p><strong>And ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath</strong>,.... Neither by words; by unjust and, unreasonable commands; by contumelious and reproachful language; by frequent and public chidings, and by indiscreet and passionate expressions: nor by deeds; preferring one to another; by denying them the necessaries of life; by not allowing them proper recreation; by severe and cruel blows, and inhuman usage; by not giving them suitable education; by an improper disposal of them in marriage; and by profusely spending their estates, and leaving nothing to them: not but that parents may, and ought to correct and rebuke their children; nor are they accountable to them for their conduct; yet they should take care not to provoke them to wrath, because this alienates their minds from them, and renders their instructions and corrections useless, and puts them upon sinful practices; wrath lets in Satan, and leads to sin against God; and indeed it is difficult in the best of men to be angry and not sin; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:21">Colossians 3:21</span>. Fathers are particularly mentioned, they being the heads of families, and are apt to be too severe, as mothers too indulgent.</p>
<p><strong>But bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord</strong>; instructing them in the knowledge of divine things, setting them good examples, taking care to prevent their falling into bad company, praying with them, and for them, bringing them into the house of God, under the means of grace, to attend public worship; all which, under a divine blessing, may be very useful to them; the example of Abraham is worthy of imitation, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:19">Genesis 18:19</span>, and the advice of the wise man deserves attention, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+22:6">Proverbs 22:6</span>.</p>
