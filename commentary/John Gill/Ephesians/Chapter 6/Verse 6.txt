<p><strong>Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers</strong>,.... Doing nothing but when under the master's eye, and then pretending a great deal of diligence and industry, in order to ingratiate themselves into his affections, and neglecting his business when he is absent; whereas they ought to attend his service in his absence, as well as in his presence, and so seek to please him, which is commendable.</p>
<p><strong>But as the servants of Christ</strong>; acting in like manner as the servants of Christ, who are not menpleasers; or as if they themselves were serving Christ, as indeed they are, when they are doing that which is the will of Christ:</p>
<p><strong>doing the will of God from the heart</strong>; meaning not the will of God in a religious, but in a civil sense, yielding a cheerful and hearty obedience to their own masters.</p>
