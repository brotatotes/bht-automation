<p><strong>With good will doing service</strong>,.... To their masters; not grudgingly, with an ill will; no otherwise, nor longer than when they are forced to it; but of a ready mind, and with a cheerful spirit, taking delight in their work, and reckoning it a pleasure to serve their masters; as an Israelite that is not sold, who does his work ברצונו, "with his good will", and according to his own mind b; doing what they do</p>
<p><strong>as to the Lord, and not to men</strong>; not merely because it is the will of men, and they are commanded by them, and in order to please them, but because it is the will of the Lord, and is wellpleasing in his sight.</p>
<p>b Maimon. Hilchot Abadim, c. 1. sect. 7.</p>
