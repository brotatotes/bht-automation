<p><strong>Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doth</strong>,.... According to the will of God, from right principles in his heart, and with a view to God's glory:</p>
<p><strong>the same shall he receive of the Lord</strong>; that is, he shall receive the fruit and advantage of it, in a way of grace,</p>
<p><strong>whether [he be] bond or free</strong>; a bondman or a free man, a master or a servant.</p>
