<p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO GALATIANS 1</strong></p>
<p>This chapter contains the inscription of the epistle, the apostle's usual salutation of the persons he writes to, and the charge he brought against them for their fickleness and inconstancy, in showing any manner of disposition towards a removal from the Gospel; the truth, certainty, and authority of the Gospel, and an account of himself, who was a preacher of it; of his life before conversion; of the nature and manner of his conversion; of his travels, labours, and usefulness afterwards. The inscription is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span> in which the writer of the epistle is described by his name Paul, and by his office, an apostle; which office he had not of men, but of God, of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, and of God the Father, who is described by his power in raising Christ from the dead. The persons to whom the epistle is inscribed are the churches of Galatia, and those that joined the apostle in the salutation of them were the brethren that were with him. The salutation follows, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:3">Galatians 1:3</span> in which mention being made of Christ, there is a declaration of a singular benefit by him, which contains the sum of the Gospel, as that he gave himself for the sins of his people, to deliver them from the present evil world, according to the will of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:4">Galatians 1:4</span> upon which a doxology, or an ascription of glory is made, either to Christ, who gave himself, or to the Father, according to whose will he did, or to both, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:5">Galatians 1:5</span>. After which the apostle proceeds to exhibit a charge of levity against the Galatians; and which he expresses in a way of admiration, that they should so soon be carried away from the doctrine of grace, to another doctrine the reverse of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span> though he somewhat mitigates this reproof by laying the blame on the false teachers, who were troublers of them, and perverters of the Gospel of Christ; and corrects himself for calling their false doctrine by the name of another Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:7">Galatians 1:7</span> and delivers out, and pronounces an anathema on all such, whether angels or men, that should preach any other Gospel than he had preached, and they had received, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span>. The excellency of which Gospel is set forth, by the matter of it, being not human but divine, and by the manner of preaching it, with all simplicity and honesty, not seeking to please men, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:10">Galatians 1:10</span> and from the efficient cause of it, it being denied to be after man, or received from, or taught by man, but is ascribed to the revelation of Christ Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:11">Galatians 1:11</span>. And that the apostle had it not from men, he proves by the account of himself, and his conversation before conversion, as how that he had been a persecutor of the church of God, of those that professed the Christian religion and doctrine; wherefore he could not have the Gospel, as not from nature and education, so not from the chief priests, Scribes, and elders, who encouraged him to persecute, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:13">Galatians 1:13</span>. And this he further makes to appear by his great proficiency in the religion of the Jews, and his abundant zeal for the traditions of the fathers, which set him at the greatest distance from, and opposition to, the Gospel of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:14">Galatians 1:14</span>. And, on the other hand, that he received it of God, and by the revelation of Christ, he proves by the account he gives of his effectual calling and conversion; the source and spring of which was the sovereign will of God in divine predestination, and the moving cause of it, the free grace of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:15">Galatians 1:15</span>. The manner in which this was done was by a revelation of Christ in him; and the end of it was, that he might preach Christ to the Gentiles, which he immediately did, without consulting flesh and blood, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:16">Galatians 1:16</span>. And as it was a clear point that he could never receive the Gospel from the Jews before his conversion, he and they being enemies to it, and persecutors of it; so it was evident that he did not receive it, after his conversion, even from Christian men, seeing he did not, upon his conversion, go directly to Jerusalem, and confer with the apostles there, who were the most likely persons to have taught him the Gospel; but instead of this he went into Arabia preaching the Gospel, and then came back to Damascus, where he was converted, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:17">Galatians 1:17</span>. And it was three years after his conversion, that he went to Jerusalem to visit Peter; and his stay with him was very short, no longer than fifteen days; and he was the only apostle he saw there, excepting James, the brother of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:18">Galatians 1:18</span> for the truth of all which he appeals to God the searcher of hearts, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:20">Galatians 1:20</span>. And then goes on with the account of himself, and his travels; how that when he departed from Jerusalem, he did not go into any other parts of Judea, and visit the churches there, but went into the countries of Syria and Cilicia; and was not so much as known by thee, or personally, by any of the churches, or members of the churches in Judea, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:20">Galatians 1:20</span> so that as it could not be thought by his short stay at Jerusalem, and the few apostles he saw there, that he received the Gospel he preached from them, so neither from any other ministers, or body of Christians in the land of Judea; for all they knew of him was by hearsay only, as that he who was formerly a persecutor of them, was now become a preacher of the Gospel he had sought to destroy, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:22">Galatians 1:22</span> wherefore it was a clear case he had not received the Gospel from them. Besides, as they had heard that he preached the Gospel of Christ, they glorified God for it, who had revealed it to him, and bestowed gifts upon him, fitting him for such service, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:24">Galatians 1:24</span>. </p>
