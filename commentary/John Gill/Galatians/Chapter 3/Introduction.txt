<p>INTRODUCTION TO GALATIANS 3</p>
<p>In this chapter the apostle reproves the Galatians for their disobedience to the Gospel, and departure from it; confirms the doctrine of justification by faith, by various arguments; shows the use of the law, and the abrogation of it, and makes mention of several privileges which belong to believers in Christ. He begins with a sharp reproof of the Galatians, and represents them as foolish and bewitched, and charges them with disobedience to the truth of the Gospel, which is aggravated by the clearness of the Gospel ministry, in which a crucified Christ, and justification by him, had been so evidently set before them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:1">Galatians 3:1</span>, and by the fruit and effect of it, they having received the Spirit by it, and not by the preaching of the law of works, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:2">Galatians 3:2</span> and it still increased their folly, that whereas they had begun with the Spirit of God, and set out in a dependence on him and his grace, they seemed now as if they would end in a carnal and legal way, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:3">Galatians 3:3</span>. To which is added, the consideration of their having suffered many things for the sake of the Gospel, which must be suffered in vain should they relinquish the Gospel, though the apostle hoped otherwise of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:4">Galatians 3:4</span>, nay, they had not only received through the preaching of the Gospel the Spirit, and his graces, but even extraordinary gifts attended it, for the confirmation of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:5">Galatians 3:5</span>, so that this case of theirs was a very aggravated one, and they were guilty of great folly and madness: from hence the apostle passes to the main thing in dispute, the great truth of justification by faith in the righteousness of Christ, which these persons were departing from, and which he establishes by several arguments; and first from the instance and example of Abraham, who was justified by faith, as appears from that which he believed, being imputed to him as his justifying righteousness, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:6">Galatians 3:6</span>, and as many as are believers in Christ are his spiritual children, and so undoubtedly are justified the same way their father was, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7">Galatians 3:7</span>, and particularly that the Gentiles are justified by faith is clear from the preaching of the Gospel to Abraham, and the promise made unto him, that in his seed all nations should be blessed; that is, with the blessing of justification, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:8">Galatians 3:8</span>. The conclusion of which instance and example is, that as faithful Abraham was blessed with a justifying righteousness through faith, so all that believe are blessed along with him with the same blessing, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:9">Galatians 3:9</span>, and that no man can be justified by the works of the law is certain, since the law is so far from justifying any on account of obedience to it, that it pronounces a curse upon all that do not perfectly and constantly fulfil it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:10">Galatians 3:10</span>. And this is still further evident from a passage in the prophecy of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:4">Habakkuk 2:4</span> which declares, that the just live by faith, or that those who are truly righteous are such who are justified by it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:11">Galatians 3:11</span>. And this is illustrated by the law and faith being contrary; for if a just man lives by faith, then not by the law, for the law does not direct a man to believe, but to work, and to live by his works, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:12">Galatians 3:12</span>. And the apostle having spoken of the law as a cursing law, takes the opportunity of showing how believers are delivered from the curse of it, which is done by Christ's being made a curse for them; and that he was, appears from his being crucified and hanged on a tree; the ends of which were, that the same blessing of justification Abraham had, might come upon the Gentiles through Christ, and that they might by faith receive the promise of the Spirit, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span> so that it is clear from hence, that the blessing of justification is through Christ's being made a curse, and is received by faith, and is not by the works of the law. The apostle next argues from the inheritance being by covenant, testament, or promise, and therefore not by the law: he observes, that a man's covenant or testament, when confirmed, can neither be disannulled, nor have anything added to it, and much less can the covenant or testament of God, confirmed of him in Christ, be disannulled by the law, or the promise in it be made of none effect by that which was several hundred years after a declaration of it to Abraham, to whom, and to whose seed, the promises were made; so that it unavoidably follows, that since the inheritance or blessing of life is by promise, as is clear from its being given to Abraham by promise, then it is not of the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:15">Galatians 3:15</span>. And whereas an objection might arise, if this be the case, of what use and service can the law be? to what purpose, or for what end, was that given? The apostle answers, that it was added because of transgressions; and that it was to endure until Christ should come, to whom the promise was made; and accordingly it was published in a very grand and solemn manner by angels, and was put into the hands of a mediator, Moses, who stood between God as one party, and the people of Israel as another, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19">Galatians 3:19</span>. Moreover, as it might be further objected, that, according to this way of reasoning, the law is against the promises; the apostle replies in a way of detestation and abhorrence of any such thing, and by an argument from the insufficiency of the law to justify, since it cannot give life, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:21">Galatians 3:21</span>. And then proceeds to point out another use of the law, which is to conclude men under sin, or convince men of it, that they, seeing their need of righteousness and life by Christ might receive the promise of it through faith in him <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:22">Galatians 3:22</span>, and so far were men from being justified by the law under the former dispensation, that they were kept under it as in a garrison, and shut up in it as in a prison, until Christ, the object of faith, was revealed, and released them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:23">Galatians 3:23</span>, and was moreover as a rigid and severe schoolmaster; and so it continued until the times of Christ; and these therefore being the uses of the law, it is a clear case that justification is by faith, and not by that, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:24">Galatians 3:24</span>. Besides, Christ being now come, the Jews themselves are no more under this law as a schoolmaster; it is now abolished, and therefore there is no justification by it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:25">Galatians 3:25</span>. And that this is the case of true believers in Christ is evident, because such are the children of God, and are taught and led by the Spirit of God, and are free, and not under the law as a schoolmaster, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:26">Galatians 3:26</span>. Besides, as they are baptized into Christ, they have put him on, as the Lord their righteousness, and so profess to be justified by him, and him only, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:27">Galatians 3:27</span>, and these, let them be of what nation, sex, state, and condition soever, are all one in Christ, and are all justified in one and the same way; and being Christ's they are Abraham's spiritual seed, and so heirs of the same promise of righteousness and life as he, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:28">Galatians 3:28</span>. </p>
