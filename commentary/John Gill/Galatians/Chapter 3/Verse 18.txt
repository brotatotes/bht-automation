<p><strong>For if the inheritance be of the law</strong>,.... By the inheritance is meant, either the eternal inheritance, everlasting life and happiness in heaven, which is the gift of God through Christ, and not attained to and enforced by the works of the law; or particularly the blessing of justification, promised in the covenant to Abraham, and his spiritual seed; even to the Gentiles, and inherited by them; which is not obtained through obedience to the law of works, nor does it belong to those who seek for it by the deeds of the law, for these are not heirs of it; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:14">Romans 4:14</span>. For was this the case,</p>
<p><strong>it is no more of promise</strong>; it cannot be by merit and by promise, by works and grace too; these can never be reconciled, and consist together; if it is by promise, then not of the law; and if it is of the law, it is not by promise: "but" nothing is more certain than this, that</p>
<p><strong>God gave it</strong>, freely, without any consideration of the works of the law,</p>
<p><strong>to Abraham by promise</strong>; wherefore justification is not by works, but by the free grace of God, through faith in the righteousness of Christ; and in this way men become heirs according to the hope of eternal life: all which is directly opposite to the notion of the Jews, who say, that, בשכר מצות ירשו גן עדן,</p>
<p>"for the reward of the commandments, men shall inherit paradise k.''</p>
<p>k Tzeror Hammor, fol. 152. 3.</p>
