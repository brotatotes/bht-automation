<p><strong>For if ye be Christ's</strong>,.... Or seeing ye are his, not by creation only, but by the Father's gift to him, by the purchase of his own blood, by the power of his grace, making them willing to give up themselves to him; not only his by profession, saying they are the Lord's, calling themselves by his name; but by possession, Christ dwelling in their hearts by faith, and they having his Spirit as a spirit of regeneration and adoption:</p>
<p><strong>then are ye Abraham's seed</strong>; not his natural but his spiritual seed, the seed that should come, and to whom the promises were made, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16">Galatians 3:16</span> and so were upon an equal foot even with the Jews that believed:</p>
<p><strong>and heirs according to the promise</strong>; being the children of God, they are heirs of God; and being the spiritual children of Abraham, the children of the promise, which are counted for the seed, they are, according to the promise made to Abraham and his spiritual seed, heirs of the blessings of the grace of life, and of the eternal inheritance; of the blessing of justification of life, and of everlasting salvation; of this world and of the world to come; of all the spiritual blessings of the covenant of grace, and of the incorruptible and undefiled inheritance of the saints in light; to which they are begotten through the abundant mercy of God, for which they are made meet by the grace of Christ; and to which they have a right by his justifying righteousness.</p>
