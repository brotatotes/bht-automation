<p>INTRODUCTION TO GALATIANS 4</p>
<p>In this chapter the apostle discourses concerning the abrogation of the ceremonial law, under which the Old Testament saints were, being as children under tutors; blames the Galatians for returning to it when they were freed from it; puts them in mind of their former affection to him and to his ministry; describes the false apostles, who had been the occasion of their departure from the truth, and by a beautiful allegory sets forth the difference between the legal and Gospel dispensations. And whereas in the latter part of the preceding chapter he had compared the law to a schoolmaster, under which the Jews were till Christ came; he here makes use of another simile to express the same thing by, which is that of an heir while under age being under tutors and governors, until the time fixed by the parent's will, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:1">Galatians 4:1</span> an accommodation of which simile is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:3">Galatians 4:3</span>, by which the Jews under the former dispensation are represented as children, and as in a state of bondage to the ceremonial law, from which there is a deliverance by Christ at the appointed time of the Father, by whom he was sent for that purpose; the act of sending is ascribed to God the Father; the person sent is described as the Son of God; the time when is called the fulness of time; and the circumstances under which he was sent were, that he was made of a woman, and made under the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span>, the ends of his being sent were to redeem his people from it, who were under it; and that they might receive the adoption of children, the privilege and spirit of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:5">Galatians 4:5</span>. Hence because they were the sons of God, and as a fruit and effect of the redemption of them by Christ, the Spirit of God is sent down into their hearts, to make known and witness their adoption, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:6">Galatians 4:6</span>, and the benefits arising from hence are, that such are or should be no longer the servants of the law, but are children and free from it, and are heirs of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:7">Galatians 4:7</span>, and that the grace of God might appear the more illustrious in this privilege of sonship, and the folly of the Galatians be more manifest in returning to the ceremonial law, notice is taken of what they were and did before conversion, and what they were inclined to now; that whereas whilst they were ignorant of God, they served nominal fictitious deities, such as were not by nature gods; and yet now, though they knew God, and were known of him, seemed desirous of being in a state of servitude and bondage to the weak and beggarly elements of the ceremonial law, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:8">Galatians 4:8</span>, of which instances are given in their observing days, months, times and years, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:10">Galatians 4:10</span>, which gave the apostle a great deal of concern, fearing his labour among them was in vain, and to no purpose, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:11">Galatians 4:11</span>, wherefore he entreats them as his brethren to imitate him, who being a Jew, yet had relinquished the observation of the ceremonial law, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:12">Galatians 4:12</span>, and then he reminds them of their former regard unto him; how that though he preached the Gospel to them through much weakness, yet they did not despise him and reject him on account of his infirmities, but received him with all the tokens of respect imaginable, as if he had been an angel; yea, as if he had been Christ himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:13">Galatians 4:13</span>, who then reckoned themselves happy persons on account of the Gospel he preached to them, and then had such an affection for him, that if it had been needful they would have given their eyes unto him; and yet now he was become their enemy for preaching the same truths he did then, justification by faith in Christ's righteousness and the abrogation of the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:15">Galatians 4:15</span>, next he gives an account of the false apostles, who pretended a zealous affection for the Galatians; which was not a good one, nor with right views, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:17">Galatians 4:17</span>, though zeal in a good cause, and which continues, is very commendable, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:18">Galatians 4:18</span>, and such a constant and hearty attachment had the apostle to them; wherefore he calls them his little children, says he travailed in birth on their account, it being his earnest desire that Christ might appear to be formed in them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:19">Galatians 4:19</span>, wherefore since he was in doubt and distress about them, he was very desirous of being with them, and to alter his way of arguing with them; and from the law, and not the Gospel, show them their mistake and folly, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:20">Galatians 4:20</span>, which he does in the following allegorical way, by observing that Abraham had two sons, the one by a servant maid, the other by his lawful wife; the one was after the flesh, the other by promise; which allegorically signified the two covenants of Sinai and of Sion, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:22">Galatians 4:22</span>. Agar the bondmaid represented the covenant made at Mount Sinai in Arabia, under which the carnal Jews and their posterity were in a state of bondage; and Sarah the free woman, the covenant of grace under the Gospel dispensation and the Gospel church state, which is from above, free, fertile, and numerous, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:25">Galatians 4:25</span>, which is confirmed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:27">Galatians 4:27</span>, by a passage out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+44:1">Isaiah 44:1</span> and as these two women were typical of the two covenants, so their respective offspring represented the two sorts of professors, legalists and evangelical Christians. True believers in Christ are like Isaac, the children of the promise; legalists are like Ishmael, men after the flesh, and of the same persecuting spirit with him: wherefore as it was then, that carnal Ishmael persecuted spiritual Isaac, so at this time the carnal Jews persecuted the real Christians, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:28">Galatians 4:28</span> nevertheless for the comfort of the latter, it is observed out of the Scripture that the former shall be cast out, and not be heir with them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:30">Galatians 4:30</span>, and the conclusion of the whole is, that the saints under the Gospel dispensation are not in bondage to the law, but are made free by Christ; to which freedom they are called, and in which they should stand, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:31">Galatians 4:31</span>. </p>
