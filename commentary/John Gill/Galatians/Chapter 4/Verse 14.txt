<p><strong>And my temptation which was in my flesh</strong>,.... The same with the infirmity of his flesh, and which was a trial of his faith and patience, and every other grace, as the afflictions of the saints be. The Alexandrian copy, and some others, and the Vulgate Latin version read, "your temptation in my flesh"; that which was a trial of them, whether they would receive him or not. This</p>
<p><strong>ye despised not</strong>; nor the apostle on the account of it, nor his ministry; they thought never the worse of him, nor of the Gospel he preached, because of this:</p>
<p><strong>nor rejected</strong>; him, nor the counsel of God declared by him,</p>
<p><strong>but received me</strong>; as they did, into their cities and places of worship, into their houses, and into their hearts and affections: and that</p>
<p><strong>as an angel of God</strong>; with all that reverence and respect, that high esteem, veneration, and affection, as if one of the celestial inhabitants had been sent down from heaven to bring them the good tidings of the Gospel: or "as a messenger of God", as the phrase may be rendered: as one that had his mission and commission from God, which was not at all disputed by them: but they looked upon him under that character, and regarded him as such,</p>
<p><strong>even as Christ Jesus</strong>; as his ambassador, as representing him, as being in his stead; yea, if he had been personally present as man among them, they could not have shown greater respect to him as such, than they did to the apostle; for as for any religious worship and adoration, that they did not offer to him; and had they, he would have addressed them in like manner he did the inhabitants of Lystra, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:14">Acts 14:14</span>. Now since they showed him so much respect, notwithstanding all his infirmities, temptations, and afflictions, when he first preached the Gospel; what should hinder that they should not pay the same regard to him now, by abiding in his doctrine and following his example, since he was the same man in his principles and practices now as then?</p>
