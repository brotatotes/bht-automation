<p><strong>Idolatry</strong>,.... Which some understand of covetousness, which is so called; but rather it means the worshipping of other gods, or of graven images:</p>
<p><strong>witchcraft</strong>; any real or pretended league and association with the devil, seeking to converse with familiar spirits, to gain unlawful knowledge, or to do hurt to fellow creatures; which, as it is doing honour to Satan, detracts from the glory of God, and rightly follows idolatry; conjuration, soothsaying, necromancy, and all kind of magic are included and condemned hereby:</p>
<p><strong>hatred</strong>: internal hatred of any man's person, even of our very enemies, is forbidden; in the original text it is "enmities": as the carnal mind is nothing else but enmity against God and Christ, against law and Gospel, and all good men, and everything that is good:</p>
<p><strong>variance</strong>, or "contentions"; fighting and quarrelling, by words scandalous and reproachful, what we commonly call scolding:</p>
<p><strong>emulations</strong> or "zeals"; not good, but bad: a boiling and rising up of the spirits and passions, at the honour and happiness of another:</p>
<p><strong>wrath</strong> or "wraths" violent emotions of the mind, moving to revenge, and seeking the hurt and mischief of others:</p>
<p><strong>strife</strong> or "strifes"; perpetual contradictions and cavilings, either expressed by words, or working in the mind; for this strife may be in a man's heart, according to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:14">James 3:14</span></p>
<p><strong>seditions</strong> or "divisions": schisms and factions, dissensions in things domestic, civil, and religious:</p>
<p><strong>heresies</strong>; bad principles and tenets, relating to doctrine, which are subversive of the fundamentals of the Gospel and the Christian religion; and are the produce of a man's own invention, and the matter of his choice, without any foundation in the word of God; and these are works of the flesh, for they spring from a corrupt and carnal mind, and are propagated with carnal views, as popular applause, worldly advantage, and indulging the lusts of the flesh.</p>
