<p><strong>Ye did run well</strong>,.... In the Christian race; when they first set out in a profession of religion, they embraced and held fast, and were zealously attached to the truths of the Gospel; they were in the lively exercise of grace on its proper object, and very diligent in the discharge of duty; they made great proficiency in the knowledge of divine things, and ran with cheerfulness and without weariness in the ways of Christ, and in the paths of truth and holiness. The metaphor is taken from runners in a race; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:24">1 Corinthians 9:24</span> so far this is said to their commendation, but this should have been persisted in:</p>
<p><strong>who did hinder you</strong>; not the apostle, or any of his brethren; no, they encouraged them to go on, and gave them all the assistance they could, to help them forward; but it was the false apostles that hindered them, who did all they could to remove them to another Gospel, and turn them aside out of the right way:</p>
<p><strong>that ye should not obey the truth</strong>? of the Gospel, particularly the truth of justification by the righteousness of Christ; which they did not so cheerfully embrace, and show such a respect unto, as they had formerly done; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:1">Galatians 3:1</span>, and which he says not by way of inquiry, but of complaint and concern; and with some indignation against the persons who had been the means of hindering their Christian progress, and with a view to reclaim the Galatians if possible.</p>
