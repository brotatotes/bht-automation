<p><strong>As we have therefore opportunity</strong>,.... Or "ability", so the phrase is sometimes used z; as occasion requires, objects offer, as there is ability of well doing, and that continues; while the time of life lasts, which is the time for sowing, or doing good works:</p>
<p><strong>let us do good unto all men</strong>; not only to our relations, friends, and acquaintance, but to all men; to them that are strangers to us, of whatsoever nation, Jew or Gentile; and of whatsoever religion or sect, yea, even to our very enemies:</p>
<p><strong>especially unto them who are of the household of faith</strong>: the children of God, that belong to his family, are true believers in Christ, hold the doctrine of faith, make a profession of it, and keep it fast; these are more especially to be the objects of Christian beneficence and liberality. The apostle may have sense reference to a practice among the Jews, who took a particular care of the children of good men that were poor;</p>
<p>"there were two chambers in the temple, the one was called the chamber of secrets, and the other the chamber of vessels: into the chamber of secrets, religious men used to put privately, whereby were privately maintained the poor בני טובים, "of the children of good men" a.''</p>
<p>The Targumist on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+5:3">Jeremiah 5:3</span> has a phrase much like to this applied to God, paraphrasing the passage thus; is it not, O Lord, revealed before thee, לאוטבא לעבדי הימנותא, "to do good to the servants of faith?"</p>
