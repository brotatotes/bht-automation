<p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO HEBREWS 1</strong></p>
<p>The intention of this epistle being to demonstrate the superior excellency of the Gospel revelation to the legal one, the apostle begins with the divine author of it, in which they both agree, and observes that in other things they differ. The revelation under the law was made in times past, the Gospel revelation in these last days; the former was made to the Jewish fathers that were of old, the latter to the then present apostles; the one was made at sundry times, and in divers manners, the other was made at once, and in one way; the one was made by the prophets of the Lord, the other by his own son, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1">Hebrews 1:1</span> and therefore the latter must be the more excellent; in proof of which the author enlarges on the character of the Son of God, with respect to his person, office, and glory; showing that he is heir of all things, the Maker of the worlds, of the same nature and glory with his Father; is omnipotent, and upholds all things by the word of his power; is the High Priest of his people, who has made satisfaction for their sins, and purged them from them, and is now at the right hand of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span> He goes on to prove that he is more excellent than the angels, by a variety of arguments, and these supported by testimonies from the Scriptures; as that he has a more excellent name than any of them, being called the Son of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4">Hebrews 1:4</span> which is proved from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span> that he is the object of the worship of angels, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:6">Hebrews 1:6</span> which is required of them,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+97:7">Psalms 97:7</span> that he is their Maker and Creator, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:7">Hebrews 1:7</span> which appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+104:4">Psalms 104:4</span> that he has an everlasting kingdom, is a righteous King, and is richly anointed above his fellows, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:8">Hebrews 1:8</span> which is the sense of some passages in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:6">Psalms 45:6</span> and that he is the founder and former of the heavens, and of the earth, and will endure when they shall not, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:10">Hebrews 1:10</span> which is confirmed by testimonies out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+102:25">Psalms 102:25</span> that he sits at the right hand of God, where none of the angels were ever admitted, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:13">Hebrews 1:13</span> as is clear from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1">Psalms 110:1</span> and besides, the angels, as they are ministers made by him, they are sent out from him to wait on his people, the heirs of salvation, and minister to them, and therefore he must be greater than they, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>. </p>
