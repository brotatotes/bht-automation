<p><strong>And thou Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth</strong>,.... The person here addressed, as the Lord or Jehovah, and as the Maker of the heavens and the earth, is the same with the Son spoken to, and of, before; for the words are a continuation of the speech to him, though they are taken from another psalm, from</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+102:25">Psalms 102:25</span>. The phrase, "thou, Lord" is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+102:12">Psalms 102:12</span> and is the same with, "O my God", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+102:24">Psalms 102:24</span> and whereas it is there said, "of old", and here, in the beginning, the sense is the same; and agreeably to the Septuagint, and the apostle, Jarchi interprets it by מתחילה, "at", or "from the beginning"; and so the Targum paraphrases it, מן שרויז, "from the beginning", that the creatures were created, c. that in the beginning of the creation, which is the apostle's meaning and shows the eternity of Christ, the Lord, the Creator of the earth, who must exist before the foundation of the world; and confutes the notion of the eternity of the world: and the rounding of it shows that the earth is the lower part of the creation; and denotes the stability of it; and points out the wisdom of the Creator in laying such a foundation; and proves the deity of Christ, by whom that, and all things in it, were made:</p>
<p><strong>the heavens are the works of thine hands</strong>: there are more heavens than one; there are the airy heaven, and the starry heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the third heaven; and they were created the beginning, as the earth was, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:1">Genesis 1:1</span> and are the immediate work of Christ; they were made by himself, not by the means of angels, who were not in being till these were made; nor by any intermediate help, which he could not have, and which he did not need: the phrase is expressive of the power of Christ in making the upper parts of the creation, and of his wisdom in garnishing them, in which there is a wonderful display of his glory; and the whole serves to set forth the dignity and excellency of his person.</p>
