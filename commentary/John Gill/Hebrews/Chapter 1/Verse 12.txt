<p><strong>And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up</strong>,.... In order to lay them aside, and make no use of them in the manner they now are; just as clothes, when they are grown old, or out of fashion, are folded up, and laid aside from use at present, or are put into another form. In the Hebrew text it is, "as a vesture shalt thou change them"; but the sense is the same, for a garment is changed by folding it, or turning it; agreeably to which Jarchi interprets the Hebrew phrase thus,</p>
<p>"as a man turns his garment to put it off;''</p>
<p>the Vulgate Latin version reads as the Hebrew does, and one of the manuscripts of New College, Oxford.</p>
<p><strong>And they shall be changed</strong>; as to their form and use, not as to their being; for a change, and an annihilation, are two things:</p>
<p><strong>but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail</strong>; which is expressive of the immutability of Christ, in his nature and perfections, in his person, and offices, in the virtue of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice; and of his duration or continuance, in opposition to the fading and transitory nature of the heavens and earth, and of all outward enjoyments: and this may serve to take off the heart from the one, and set it upon the other; and to strengthen our faith in Christ, and encourage us to expect a continuance of blessings from him; all supplies of grace now, and eternal glory hereafter.</p>
