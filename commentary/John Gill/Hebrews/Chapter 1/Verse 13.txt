But to which of the angels said he at any time,.... That is, he never said to any of them in his council, or covenant; he never designed to give them any such honour, as hereafter expressed; he never promised it to them, or bestowed it on them; he never called up any of them to so high a place, or to such a dignity:sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool; yet this he said to his Son, Psalms 110:1 for to him, the Messiah, are they spoken, and have had their fulfilment in him: Psalms 110:1- :; and therefore he must be greater than the angels.
