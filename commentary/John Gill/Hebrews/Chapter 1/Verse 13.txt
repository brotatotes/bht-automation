<p><strong>But to which of the angels said he at any time</strong>,.... That is, he never said to any of them in his council, or covenant; he never designed to give them any such honour, as hereafter expressed; he never promised it to them, or bestowed it on them; he never called up any of them to so high a place, or to such a dignity:</p>
<p><strong>sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool</strong>; yet this he said to his Son, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1">Psalms 110:1</span> for to him, the Messiah, are they spoken, and have had their fulfilment in him: <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1- :">Psalms 110:1- :</span>; and therefore he must be greater than the angels.</p>
