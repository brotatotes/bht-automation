<p><strong>For by one offering</strong>,.... The same as before; himself, body and soul; this is a reason why he is set down, and will continue so for ever, and why he expects his enemies to be made his footstool; because by one sacrifice for sin, which he has once offered,</p>
<p><strong>he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified</strong>; that is, who are sanctified by God the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:1">Judges 1:1</span> or, who are set apart by him in eternal election, from the rest of the world, for his own use, service, and glory, to a state of grace and holiness here, and happiness hereafter; for this is not to be understood either of their being sanctified in Christ, though the Syriac version reads, "that are sanctified" in him, or by his Spirit, though both are true of the same persons; these Christ, by his sacrifice, has perfected, and has perfectly fulfilled the law for them; he has perfectly expiated their sins; he has obtained the full pardon of all their sins, and complete redemption; he has perfectly justified them from all things, and that for ever; which shows the continued virtue of Christ's sacrifice, in all generations, to all the elect of God, and the fulness and duration of their salvation; and so Christ by his one sacrifice did what the law, and all its sacrifices, could not do, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span>.</p>
