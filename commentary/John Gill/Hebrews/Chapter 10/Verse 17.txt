The words are cited to a different purpose here than there; the principal thing for which they are cited here, is to observe God's promise of non-remembrance of sin; which is no other than remission of sin, and which is not consistent with legal sacrifices, in which there is a remembrance of sin every year, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:3">Hebrews 10:3</span> and consequently, since this new covenant has taken place, legal sacrifices must be abolished, as the apostle argues in the next verse. In one of Beza's copies are inserted, at the, beginning of this verse, these words, "then he said", which seem necessary to answer to the last clause of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:15">Hebrews 10:15</span>.</p>
