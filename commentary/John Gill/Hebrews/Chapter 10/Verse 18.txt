Now where remission of these is,.... That is, of these sins; and that there is remission of them, is evident from this promise of the covenant, just now produced; from God's gracious proclamation of it; from the shedding of Christ's blood for it; from his exaltation at the Father's right hand to give it; from the Gospel declaration of it; and from the several instances of persons favoured with it:there is no more offering for sin; there may be other offerings, as of praise and thanksgiving, but none for sin; "there is no need", as the Syriac version; or there is not required, as the Arabic version; there is no need of the reiteration of Christ's sacrifice, nor will he be offered up any more, nor of the repetition of legal sacrifices, nor ought they to continue any longer. The Jews themselves say w, that"in the time to come (i.e. in the times of the Messiah) all offerings shall cease, but the sacrifice of praise.''And one of their writers says x, when"the King Messiah, the son of David, shall reign, there will be no need of כפרה, "an atonement", nor of deliverance, or prosperity, for all these things will be had;''w Vajikra Rabba, sect. 9. fol. 153. 1. x R.
