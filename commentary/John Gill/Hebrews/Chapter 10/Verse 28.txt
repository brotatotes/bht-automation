<p><strong>He that despised Moses' law</strong>,.... By breaking it wilfully, and presumptuously, for which there was no sacrifice; meaning the law which Moses was the minister of not the author; and it respects the whole body of laws given by him, from God; and is instanced in for the sake of the comparison between him and Christ, and between the law and the Gospel, and for the illustration of the case in hand. Now one that transgressed that law, either in whole, or in part, by denying it entirely, or by breaking any particular precept of it presumptuously,</p>
<p><strong>died without mercy</strong>; a corporeal death; there was no atonement nor sacrifice for him, nor pity to be shown him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+13:8">Deuteronomy 13:8</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Under two or three witnesses</strong>; who "stood by", or were present, as the Arabic version renders it, when the transgression was committed; or that "accused him", as the Ethiopic version; that were witnesses against him, and plainly and fully proved the fact, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+17:6">Deuteronomy 17:6</span>.</p>
