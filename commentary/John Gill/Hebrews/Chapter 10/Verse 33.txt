Partly whilst ye were made a gazing stock,.... Brought upon the stage or theatre, and made a spectacle to the world, angels, and men, 1 Corinthians 4:9both by reproaches and afflictions; suffering both in their characters and reputations, and in their persons and substance:and partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used; they maintained their communion with them, relieved them in distress, and sympathized with them.
