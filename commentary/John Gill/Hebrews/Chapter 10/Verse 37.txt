<p><strong>For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come</strong>,.... That the person spoken of is the Lord Jesus Christ, is evident from the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:3">Habakkuk 2:3</span> here referred to, and from the character of him that is to come, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:3">Matthew 11:3</span> and from parallel places, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:7">James 5:7</span> and this is to be understood, not of his coming in the flesh, for he was come in the flesh already; though Habakkuk indeed refers to his first coming, yet not to that only, but including his second coming also; but of his coming in his kingdom and power to destroy Jerusalem, and take vengeance on the Jews, for their rejection of him: the kingdom of Christ was at hand, when he began to preach; upon his ascension to heaven, it began to appear more visible; but still the temple was standing, and that worship continued, which stood in the way of the glory of his kingdom; during which time the saints suffered much: but in a little while from the writing of this epistle, he, who was to come, did come, even within about ten years after this, and showed his power and his glory, in delivering his people, and destroying his enemies; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:28">Matthew 16:28</span>. It may be applied to his coming to help his people in time of need; the afflictions of the saints are many; they are all for an appointed time, and but for a while; and Christ has promised to come, and visit them; and which he does often, and speedily, and seasonably: it may also be accommodated to Christ coming to take his people to himself by death; Christ may be said to come in this sense, and he will certainly come; and this will be in a little while; man is but of few days; death is certain, and should be patiently expected: and it may likewise be suitably improved, with respect to Christ's coming to judgment; that he will come is certain, from prophecies, particularly from the prophecy of Enoch, from his own words, from the testimony of angels, from the institution of the Lord's supper, till he comes, and from the general expectation of the saints; and this coming of his is desirable, because it will be the marriage of the Lamb, and the redemption of the saints, and because of the grace and glory that will be brought unto them, and because they shall then be for ever with him; and this will be quickly, in a little time, in comparison of the time that went before his first coming, and of the eternity that will follow after this; and though it may seem long, yet with God it is but a little while, with whom a thousand years are as one day; and however, since it is certain that he will come,</p>
<p><strong>and will not tarry</strong>, beyond the appointed time, patience should be exercised.</p>
