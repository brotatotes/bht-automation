<p><strong>Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith</strong>,.... In</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:7">Psalms 40:7</span>. This was said by David, not of himself, and his own times, for sacrifice and offering were desired and required in his times; nor was he able to do the will of God; so as to fulfil the law, and make void legal sacrifices; nor did he engage as a surety to do this; nor was it written of him in the volume of the book that he should: besides, he speaks of one that was not yet come, though ready to come, when the fulness of time should be up; and who is here spoken of as coming into the world, and who is no other than Jesus Christ; and this is to be understood, not of his coming into Judea, or the temple at Jerusalem; or out of a private, into a public life; nor of his entrance into the world to come, into heaven, into life eternal, as the Targum on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:7">Psalms 40:7</span> paraphrases it, after he had done his work on earth, for the other world is never expressed by the world only; nor did Christ go into that to do the will of God, but to sit down there, after he had done it; besides, Christ's entrance into heaven was a going out of the world, and not into it. To which may be added, that this phrase always signifies coming into this terrene world, and intends men's coming into it at their birth; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:7- :">Psalms 40:7- :</span> and must be understood of Christ's incarnation, which was an instance of great love, condescension, and grace; and the, reason of it was to do what the law, and the blood of bulls and goats, could not do. For it follows,</p>
<p><strong>sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not</strong>; or didst not desire and delight in, as the word חפץ, used in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:6">Psalms 40:6</span> signifies; meaning not the sacrifices of wicked men, or such as were offered up without faith in Christ; but the ceremonial sacrifices God himself had instituted, and which were offered in the best manner; and that not merely in a comparative sense, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:6">Hosea 6:6</span> but the meaning is, that God would not have these continue any longer, they being only imposed for a time, and this time being come; nor would he accept of them, as terms, conditions, and causes of righteousness, pardon, peace, and reconciliation; but he willed that his Son should offer himself an offering, and a sacrifice for a sweet smelting savour to him.</p>
<p><strong>[But a] body hast thou prepared me</strong>; or "fitted for me"; a real natural body, which stands for the whole human nature; and is carefully expressed, to show that the human nature is not a person. This was prepared, in the book of God's purposes and decrees, and in the council and covenant of grace; and was curiously formed by the Holy Ghost in time, for the second Person, the Son of God, to clothe himself with, as the Syriac version renders it, "thou hast clothed me with a body"; and that he might dwell in, and in it do the will of God, and perform the work of man's redemption: in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:6">Psalms 40:6</span> it is, "mine ears thou hast opened"; digged or bored, the ear being put for the whole body; for if he had not had a body prepared, he could not have had ears opened: besides; the phrase is expressive of Christ's assuming the form of a servant, which was done by his being found in fashion as a man, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span> and of his being a voluntary servant, and of his cheerful obedience as such, the opening, or boring of the ear, was a sign, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:5">Exodus 21:5</span>. And thus by having a true body prepared for him, and a willing mind to offer it up, he became fit for sacrifice.</p>
