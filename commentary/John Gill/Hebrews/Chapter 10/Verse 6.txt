<p><strong>In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin</strong>,.... Which were the principal kinds of offerings under the law:</p>
<p><strong>thou hast had no pleasure</strong>; not only in comparison of moral duties, or spiritual sacrifices, such as those of praise and thanksgiving,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:30">Psalms 69:30</span> but so as to accept of the offerers for the sake of them, and smell a sweet savour in them; for these could not satisfy his justice, appease his anger, or expiate sin; and when they were in full force, and offered in the most agreeable manner, they were no otherwise well pleasing to God, than as they were types of, and had respect unto the sacrifice of his Son. In the Hebrew text it is, "thou didst not require, or ask for"; for them, when the time was up that Christ should come into the world.</p>
