<p><strong>Above when he said</strong>, .... In the afore cited place,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:7">Psalms 40:7</span></p>
<p><strong>Sacrifice and offering, and burnt offerings, and offering for sin thou wouldst not, neither hadst pleasure therein</strong>; this is a recapitulation of what is before said; and all kind of sacrifices are mentioned, to show that they are all imperfect, and insufficient, and are abolished; and the abrogation of them is expressed in the strongest terms, as that God would not have them, and that he took no pleasure in them:</p>
<p><strong>which are offered by the law</strong>; according as that directs and enjoins: this clause is added, to distinguish these sacrifices from spiritual ones, under the Gospel dispensation, and which are well pleasing to God; and to prevent an objection against the abolition of them, taken from hence, that they are according to the law; and yet, notwithstanding this, God will not have them, nor accept of them.</p>
