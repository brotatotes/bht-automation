<p>INTRODUCTION TO HEBREWS 11</p>
<p>The apostle having, in the preceding chapter, spoken in commendation of the grace, and life of faith, and of its usefulness to preserve from apostasy, proceeds in this to give some account of the nature and actings of it; and which he illustrates by the examples of many of the Old Testament saints: he begins with a definition of it, which consists of two parts, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span> and with an account of the usefulness of it to the elders in general, who by it obtained a good report, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:2">Hebrews 11:2</span> and of the service it is of in understanding the creation of the worlds, the author and original of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:3">Hebrews 11:3</span> and then goes on to give particular instances and examples of faith among the elders, or ancient believers, which are reduced into several classes; and the first is of the saints before the flood, Abel, Enoch, and Noah. Abel's faith lay in offering a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, in obtaining a testimony from God that he was righteous, and in yet speaking, though dead, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:4">Hebrews 11:4</span>. Enoch's faith is evidenced by his translation of God, that he should not see death, and by the testimony he received from him before it, that he was acceptable to him; by which it is clear he had faith, since, without it, it is impossible to please God; nor can any come aright unto him, without believing that he is, and has a gracious respect to all that diligently seek him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:5">Hebrews 11:5</span>. Noah's faith was seen in preparing an ark, by the order of God, for the saving of his family, and in condemning the world by so doing, and by becoming an heir of righteousness through faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:7">Hebrews 11:7</span>. The next class is that of the saints from the flood, to the times of Moses, in which are Abraham and Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. Abraham's faith is celebrated for his obedience to the divine call, quitting the country where he was, and going he knew not where; and for his sojourning in the promised land, as in a strange one, in which Isaac and Jacob dwelt with him in tents; and for looking by faith for the heavenly city built by the Lord; and for his offering up his son at the command of God, who was the son of promise, believing God was able to raise him from the dead, from whence he received him by faith,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:8">Hebrews 11:8</span>. Sarah's faith lay in receiving strength through it to conceive, bear, and bring forth a child when past age, which was, founded upon the faithfulness of a promising God; hence from Abraham, by her, sprung a large posterity, like the stars of the sky, and the sand on the sea shore, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:11">Hebrews 11:11</span>. Now all these patriarchs, both before and after the flood, as they lived by faith, they died in it; who, though they had not received the things promised, yet by faith saw them at a distance, were very well persuaded they would come to pass, and so, in some sense, enjoyed them; hence, while they lived, they lived like pilgrims and strangers, showing that they had no regard to the country they came from, and had no mind to return thither, but sought another, a better, and an heavenly one; so that God is not ashamed to be called their God, he having prepared a city for them,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>. Isaac's faith is commended in blessing his two sons with respect to things future, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:20">Hebrews 11:20</span> and Jacob's faith is well spoken of for blessing both the sons of Joseph in his last moments, worshipping on the top of his staff, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:21">Hebrews 11:21</span> and Joseph's faith is instanced in two things; in making mention of the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt, as a certain thing; and in giving them strict orders to carry his bones along with them, when they went from thence,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:22">Hebrews 11:22</span> the third class of men, famous for faith, is that of such from the times of Moses to the judges, in which are the parents of Moses, Moses himself, the Israelites in general, and the harlot Rahab. The parents of Moses showed their faith in hiding him three months, seeing him to be a lovely child, contrary to the king's edict,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:23">Hebrews 11:23</span>. Moses's faith lay in refusing to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; in preferring afflictions to the pleasures of sin, and the reproach of Christ to the riches of Egypt; he having, by faith, a respect to the heavenly glory, another instance of it; and by forsaking Egypt, without fear of the king's displeasure, by faith seeing a King who is invisible; and by keeping the passover, with the sprinkling of blood, that so the destroyer of the firstborn of Egypt might not touch the Israelites, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:24">Hebrews 11:24</span>. The instances of the faith of the Israelites are their passage through the Red sea, as on dry land, when the Egyptians, who attempted it, were drowned; and their compassing the walls of Jericho seven days, believing they would fall, as accordingly they did, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:29">Hebrews 11:29</span>. The faith of Rahab, the harlot, is commended for two things; for peaceably receiving the spies that came to her; and for the salvation she believed she should have, and had, when the unbelieving inhabitants of Jericho perished,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:31">Hebrews 11:31</span>. And the last class of heroes for faith, includes the times of the judges, kings, prophets, and the Maccabees; the judges, kings, and prophets, are lumped together, and only a few of their names are observed as a specimen of the rest, the apostle not having time to mention particular one, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:32">Hebrews 11:32</span> and various instances of without reference to particular persons to whom they belong, are recorded; some which lay in doing things greatly heroic, and even miraculous,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:33">Hebrews 11:33</span> and others in suffering things the most cruel and torturing, and death itself in divers shapes, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:35">Hebrews 11:35</span>. And thus, by an induction of particulars, the apostle proves both his definition of faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span> and the usefulness of it to the elders, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:2">Hebrews 11:2</span> they by it obtaining a good report, though they did not receive the thing promised, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:39">Hebrews 11:39</span> wherefore New Testament saints have great encouragement, and much more reason, to exercise this grace; since God has provided for them the better thing he promised to others, that the one without the other might not be perfect, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:40">Hebrews 11:40</span>. </p>
