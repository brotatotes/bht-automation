<p><strong>Through faith also Sarah herself</strong>,.... Some copies add "being barren"; and so read the Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions; which is a circumstance which makes her faith appear the greater: but it is a question whether the apostle speaks of the faith of Sarah, or of Abraham; some think he speaks of Abraham's faith; and that it was through his faith that Sarah conceived; and observe, that the last clause may be rendered, "because he judged him faithful", c. and the rather, because the apostle, both before and after, is speaking of Abraham's faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:8">Hebrews 11:8</span>. And in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:12">Hebrews 11:12</span> mention is made only of one, even of Abraham and in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:17">Romans 4:17</span> only notice is taken of Abraham's faith, respecting this matter; nor is Sarah's faith observed in the history of it, but her diffidence: but why may not Sarah be joined with Abraham, in this commendation, as well as Isaac and Jacob? and though, at first, she distrusted, yet she afterwards feared, and believed: other women are mentioned in this catalogue of believers; and they share in the same grace and privileges as men: and Sarah, being a believer, as well as Abraham,</p>
<p><strong>received strength to conceive seed</strong>: sometimes "strength" itself signifies seed, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+31:3">Proverbs 31:3</span> and so to receive strength is to receive seed; which the female does from the male; hence that saying of the Jews t, the male does not receive strength from another, but the female מקבלת כח "receiveth strength" from another; but here it is to be understood of receiving power from God to retain seed, received from men, and conceive by it; which Sarah, in her circumstances, without the interposition of the almighty power, could never have done. The nymph Anobret is so called, in imitation of this conception of Sarah's; or as she is called in the Phoenician language, חן ענברת, which signifies "conceiving by grace": as this conception must be entirely ascribed to the power and grace of God:</p>
<p><strong>and was delivered of a child when she was past age</strong>; of bearing and bringing forth children, being ninety years of age, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:17">Genesis 17:17</span>. Now though the conception, bearing, and bringing forth of children are things natural, ordinary, and common, yet here was a particular promise respecting this matter; and there were great difficulties in nature attending it, and such as to reason were insuperable; but these were got over, through the power and grace of God, and which is ascribed to faith in the faithfulness of a promising God:</p>
<p><strong>because she judged him faithful who had promised</strong>; that she should have a son at the time of life; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:17- :">Genesis 17:17- :</span>.</p>
