<p><strong>Of whom it is said</strong>,.... That is, of Isaac, Abraham's own son, whom he offered up; or rather, "to whom it was said", as the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions render it; that is, to Abraham, for to him was this said, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:12">Genesis 21:12</span></p>
<p><strong>that in Isaac shall thy seed be called</strong>; that numerous natural seed of his, which should inherit the land of Canaan; and his special famous seed, the Messiah, to whom the promises were made;</p>
