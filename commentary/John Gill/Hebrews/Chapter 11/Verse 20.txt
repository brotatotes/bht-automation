<p><strong>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau</strong>,.... The history of this is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:33">Genesis 27:33</span>. The former of these was a good man, and, though the youngest son, he is set before, and was blessed before the eldest; and the latter was a wicked man, and yet had a blessing; for temporal blessings are enjoyed in common: and this blessing was prophetic, it was concerning things to come. Jacob's blessing was plenty of temporal things, and under which may be signified the dews of divine grace, the fatness of God's house, the bread of life, and wine of divine love, which true Israelites partake of; also dominion over his brother, and government over nations, which had their accomplishment in his posterity; and may be expressive of the spiritual reign of the saints, and their dominion, by grace; and of the kingdom that shall hereafter be put to their hands; and of the extensiveness of Christ's kingdom in the latter day, who was to spring front him. Esau's blessings were merely temporal ones, and respected things future, which were fulfilled in his posterity; and these several blessings Isaac pronounced upon them by faith, believing they would be bestowed upon them; and so his faith answered to the account of faith in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span>. It may be asked, how Isaac can be said to have blessed Jacob by faith, when he was deceived by him? It is certain he took him to be Esau, when he blessed him, wherefore it was not the design of Isaac, though it was the will of God that he should bless him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:18">Genesis 27:18</span>, but yet notwithstanding this, Isaac might do it in faith, believing that the person he blessed would be blessed, though he was mistaken in him; and which he confirmed when he did know him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:33">Genesis 27:33</span> to which the apostle may have respect; and besides, he blessed him after this,</p>
