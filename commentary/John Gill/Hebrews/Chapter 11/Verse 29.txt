<p><strong>By faith they passed through the Red sea, as by dry land</strong>,.... Not through a river, but through the sea, the Red sea, the sea of Suph, or weeds; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. Some say they came out on the same side they went in; but it should seem rather, by the phrase here used, that they passed through it, from one side to the other; and that all one as if it had been on dry ground; even Moses, and all the children of Israel: and this they did by faith, believing, that God would make a passage quite through it for them, and deliver them out of the hands of their enemies, who were closely pursuing them:</p>
<p><strong>which the Egyptians assaying to do, were drowned</strong>. These were Pharaoh, and his numerous army; who, observing the Israelites march on through the sea, as on dry land, thought they could do the same; and so made an attempt, but were everyone of them drowned; in just retaliation for the cruel edict for drowning the male infants of the Israelites, as soon as they were born.</p>
