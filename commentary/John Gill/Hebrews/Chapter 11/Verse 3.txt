<p><strong>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God</strong>,.... The celestial world, with its inhabitants, the angels; the starry and ethereal worlds, with all that is in them, the sun, moon, stars, and fowls of the air; the terrestrial world, with all upon it, men, beasts, c. and the watery world, the sea, and all that is therein: perhaps some respect may be had to the distinction of worlds among the Jews <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, though the apostle can scarce be thought to have any regard to their extravagant notions of vast numbers of worlds being created: they often speak of three hundred and ten worlds, in all which, they say, there are heavens, earth, stars, planets, c. f and sometimes of eighteen thousand g; but these notions are rightly charged by Philo h with ignorance and folly. However, as many worlds as there are, they are made "by the Word of God"; by Christ, the essential Word of God, to whom the creation of all things is ascribed in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>. And this agrees with the sentiments of the Jews, who ascribe the creation of all things to the Word of God, as do the Targumists i, and Philo the Jew k. And these are "framed" by the Word, in a very beautiful and convenient order; the heavens before the earth; things less perfect, before those that were more so in the visible world, or terraqueous globe; and things for men, before men, for whom they were; and it is by divine revelation and faith that men form right notions of the creation, and of the author of it, and particularly of the origin of it, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>so that things which are seen</strong>: as the heaven, earth, and sea, and in which the invisible things of God, the perfections of his nature, are discerned:</p>
<p><strong>were not made of things which do appear</strong>; they were not made from pre-existent matter, but out of nothing, out of which the rude and undigested chaos was formed; and from that invisible mass, covered with darkness, were all visible things brought into a beautiful order; and all from secret and hidden ideas in the divine minds; and this also is the faith of the Jews, that the creation of all things is מאין, "out of nothing" l. There seems to be an allusion to the word ברא, used for creation, which signifies to make appear a thing unseen; and is rendered in the Septuagint version by δεικνυμι, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:30">Numbers 16:30</span> and</p>
<p>καταδεικνυμι, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:26">Isaiah 40:26</span> to show, or make appear; and thus God created, or made to appear, the heavens and earth, which before were not in being, and unseen, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:1">Genesis 1:1</span> and created to make, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:3">Genesis 2:3</span> that is, made them to appear, that he might put them into the form and order they now are.</p>
