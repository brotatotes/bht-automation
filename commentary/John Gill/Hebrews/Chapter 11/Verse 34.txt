<p><strong>Quenched the violence of fire</strong>,.... Which may be said to be done, when a believer, or a righteous man, is delivered out of it, as Lot from Sodom, when God rained fire and brimstone on it; when, by prayer, it is stopped, as by Moses, at Taberah, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:1">Numbers 11:1</span> when persons are not hurt by it, as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, when cast into Nebuchadrezzar's fiery furnace; and many of the martyrs have triumphed in the flames: so believers are delivered out of the fire of afflictions, and are not consumed thereby; and quench the fiery darts of Satan, thrown at them; and are untouched by the fire of God's wrath, in every state and case; and shall not be hurt of the second death, which is a lake of fire, burning with brimstone.</p>
<p><strong>Escaped the edge of the sword</strong>; and were not destroyed by it; as Lot, Abraham, Moses, Joshua, the Judges, David, Elijah, Elisha, and others.</p>
<p><strong>Out of weakness were made strong</strong>; being recovered from bodily diseases, as David, Hezekiah, c. by an increase of bodily strength, as Samson by being filled with courage, and strength of mind; when before timorous, as Barak, c. so believers, when they have been weak in the exercise of grace, have been made strong:</p>
<p><strong>waxed valiant in fight</strong> as Barak, Gideon, David, c. so believers, in the spiritual fight of faith, have waxed valiant being engaged in a good cause, and under a good Captain; being well provided with armour, and assured of victory, and a crown.</p>
<p><strong>Turned to fight the armies of the aliens</strong>: such as the Canaanites, the Moabites, Ammonites, Philistines, and others; who were put to flight by Joshua, the Judges, David, and others.</p>
