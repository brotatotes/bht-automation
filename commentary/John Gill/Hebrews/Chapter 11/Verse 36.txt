And others had trial of cruel mockings,.... As Samson by the Philistines; Elisha by the children, whom the bears devoured; Jeremiah by Pashur, and others; the Jews by Sanballat and Tobiah, when building the temple; the prophets, whom God sent to the Jews, as his messengers, Judges 16:25.and scourgings; or smitings, as Jeremiah and Micaiah,Jeremiah 20:22.yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment; as Joseph, Samson, and Jeremiah, Genesis 39:20. Now of these things they had trial, or experience; their graces were tried by them, and they patiently endured them.
