<p><strong>And others had trial of cruel mockings</strong>,.... As Samson by the Philistines; Elisha by the children, whom the bears devoured; Jeremiah by Pashur, and others; the Jews by Sanballat and Tobiah, when building the temple; the prophets, whom God sent to the Jews, as his messengers, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+16:25">Judges 16:25</span>.</p>
<p><strong>and scourgings</strong>; or smitings, as Jeremiah and Micaiah,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+20:22">Jeremiah 20:22</span>.</p>
<p><strong>yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment</strong>; as Joseph, Samson, and Jeremiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+39:20">Genesis 39:20</span>. Now of these things they had trial, or experience; their graces were tried by them, and they patiently endured them.</p>
