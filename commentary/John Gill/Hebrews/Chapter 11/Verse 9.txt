<p><strong>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise</strong>,.... The land of Canaan, so called, because it was promised to Abraham and his seed; and is typical of heaven, which is not by the works of the law, but by the free promise and grace of God: here Abraham sojourned for a while,</p>
<p><strong>as in a strange country</strong>; which was not his native place, and not his own, but another's; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:5">Acts 7:5</span> and an idolatrous one; here he sojourned by faith, believing that as it was promised, it would be given to him, and his seed: so all God's people are sojourners in this world, strangers and pilgrims in it; this is not their dwelling place; they do not belong to it, but to another; their stay in it is but for a while; and, while they are in it, do not look upon themselves at home, but are looking out for another, and better country; they are unknown to the men of the world, and the men of the world are strangers to them; though they have a civil conversation with them, they separate from them, both as to profaneness and superstition, and live by faith, in the expectation of the heavenly country, as Abraham also did:</p>
<p><strong>dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise</strong>; the same promised land, the same promised blessings, and the same promised seed, the Messiah; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:3">Genesis 12:3</span> with these Abraham dwelt, for he lived until Isaac was seventy five years of age, and Jacob fifteen; he was an hundred years old when Isaac was born, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:5">Genesis 21:5</span> and he lived one hundred and seventy five years, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:7">Genesis 25:7</span> and Isaac was sixty years old when Jacob was born, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:26">Genesis 25:26</span> and Abraham dwelt with them in tabernacles, or tents, which they pitched at pleasure, and moved from place to place. So true believers, as they are Abraham's seed, they are heirs with him, according to the promise; and are heirs together of the grace of life; and dwell in earthly tabernacles, in houses of clay, which are erected for a while, and then taken down.</p>
