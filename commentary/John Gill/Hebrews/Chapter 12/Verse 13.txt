<p><strong>And make straight paths for your feet</strong>,.... By "feet" are meant the walk and conversation of the saints, both in the church, and in the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="so+7:1">Song of Solomon 7:1</span> and there are paths made ready for these feet to walk in; as the good old paths of truth, of the word and worship of God, of faith and holiness: and to make these paths "straight", is to make the word of God the rule of walking; to avoid carefully joining anything with it as a rule; to attend constantly on the ordinances of Christ; to go on evenly in a way of believing on him; to walk in some measure worthy of the calling wherewith we are called, and by way of example to others.</p>
<p><strong>Lest that which is lame be turned out of the way</strong>; a lame member, as the Syriac version, a lame member of the body of Christ, the church; or a lame person, as the Arabic version, a weak believer; one that is ready to halt, either through the corruption of nature, or through the weakness of grace, or through want of light and judgment, and through instability and inconstancy; lest such an one should, through the irregular walk and conversation of others, be stumbled and offended, and go out of the way, and leave the paths of righteousness and truth. God takes care of, and has a regard to such, and he would have others also, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mic+4:6">Micah 4:6</span>. The Ethiopic version reads, "that your halting may be healed, and not offended": that you yourselves may not halt and stumble.</p>
<p><strong>But let it rather be healed</strong>; the fallen believer be restored, the weak brother be confirmed, the halting professor be strengthened, and everyone be built up and established upon the most holy faith, and in the pure ways of the Gospel.</p>
