<p><strong>Lest there be any fornicator or profane person</strong>,.... The first of these is guilty of a sin against the second table of the law, as well as against his own body; and which is opposed to the holiness the apostle had before exhorted to; such who are guilty of it, are not to be continued in the communion of the church; and it is a sin, which, lived in not repented of, excludes from the kingdom of heaven: the latter is one who is a transgressor of the first table of the law; who is an idolater, a swearer, a despiser of public worship and ordinances, and who behaves irreverently in divine service, and mocks at the future state, as Esau; to whom both these characters seem to belong: and this agrees with what the Jews say concerning him: they have a tradition w, that he committed five transgressions on the day he came out of the field weary.</p>
<p>"He committed idolatry: he shed innocent blood; and lay with a virgin betrothed; and denied the life of the world to come (or a future state); and despised his birthright.''</p>
<p>It is elsewhere x a little differently expressed.</p>
<p>"Esau, the wicked, committed five transgressions on that day: he lay with a virgin betrothed; and killed a person; and denied the resurrection of the dead; and denied the root, or foundation, (i.e. that there is a God,) and despised his birthright; and besides, he desired his father's death, and sought to slay his brother.''</p>
<p>It is common for them to say of him, that he was an ungodly man; and particularly, that he was a murderer, a robber, ונואף, "and an adulterer" y; and that he has no part in the world to come z: who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright; the account of which is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:29">Genesis 25:29</span> this includes all the privileges which he had a right unto by being the firstborn; as a peculiar blessing from his father; a double portion of goods; and dominion over his brethren: and it is commonly said by the Jews, that the priesthood belonged to the firstborn, before the Levitical dispensation; and that for this reason, Jacob coveted the birthright a, Esau being a wicked man, and unfit for it. The birthright was reckoned sacred; it was typical of the primogeniture of Christ; of the adoption of saints, and of the heavenly inheritance belonging thereunto; all which were despised by Esau: and so the Jewish paraphrases b interpret the contempt of his birthright, a despising of his part in the world to come, and a denial of the resurrection of the dead: and his contempt of it was shown in his selling it; and this was aggravated by his selling it for "one morsel of meat"; which was bread, and pottage of lentiles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:34">Genesis 25:34</span>. The Jewish writers speak of this bargain and sale much in the same language as the apostle here does; they say c of him, this is the man that sold his birthright בעד ככר להם, "for a morsel of bread"; and apply to him the passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+28:21">Proverbs 28:21</span> "for a piece of bread that man will transgress".</p>
