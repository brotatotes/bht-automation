<p>INTRODUCTION TO HEBREWS 13</p>
<p>The apostle having finished the doctrinal part of this epistle, closes it with practical exhortations to these Hebrews, puts up prayers for them, and sends salutations to them. The exhortations are to brotherly love, and the continuance of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:1">Hebrews 13:1</span> to hospitality, by which some have entertained angels unawares,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:2">Hebrews 13:2</span>, to sympathy with those that are in bonds, and in, afflictions, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:3">Hebrews 12:3</span> to purity and chastity in the honourable state of marriage, urged by the judgment of God on unclean persons,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:4">Hebrews 13:4</span> to avoid covetousness, and to be content with present things, enforced by the promises of God, which give boldness and strength to faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:5">Hebrews 13:5</span>, to remember their spiritual guides and governors, the preachers of the Gospel to them; to follow their faith, and consider the end of their conversation, which is Christ Jesus, the same yesterday, today, and for ever, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7">Hebrews 13:7</span>. And then he cautions them from being carried about with the doctrines of men, which are divers and strange; which he urges from the profitable effect of the Gospel to establish the heart, and from the unprofitableness of meats to legal worshippers, and from the Christians having an altar, which is Christ, which those who are seeking life by the service of the law have nothing to do with,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:9">Hebrews 13:9</span>. And this he illustrates in the type of burnt offerings, which were burnt without the camp, and there was nothing left for the priests to eat of, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:11">Hebrews 13:11</span>. In like manner Christ, the antitype, suffered without the gates of Jerusalem, for the sanctification of his people, by his blood; and who only, and not those who seek for righteousness by the law, have an interest in,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:12">Hebrews 13:12</span>. However, it becomes the saints to quit everything, and all dependence on themselves, and fellowship with others, and go forth to Jesus, believing in him, whatsoever reproach they suffer on his account; for here is nothing permanent and durable in this world; but there is a state of happiness to come, which will last for ever,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:13">Hebrews 13:13</span>. And since Christ has offered himself for his people, they ought to offer up the sacrifices of praise to God by him, and to do acts of beneficence and goodness, which are sacrifices well pleasing to God through him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:15">Hebrews 13:15</span>. And to these exhortations apostle adds others; as to obey their spiritual rulers and governors, and submit unto them; since they watch for their souls, and must give an account, which to do with joy, and not with grief, is best and profitable, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:17">Hebrews 13:17</span> and to pray for the apostle, and other ministers, since they had a good conscience, and were willing to live honestly; and the rather, that he might be restored to them the sooner, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:18">Hebrews 13:18</span> and to engage them to this their duty, he sets them an example, by putting up prayers for them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:20">Hebrews 13:20</span> and desires them to take in good part the letter he had wrote unto them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:22">Hebrews 13:22</span> and acquaints them that Timothy was set at liberty, with whom he hoped to see them in a short time, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:23">Hebrews 13:23</span> and then closes the epistle with his own, and the salutations of others, and with his usual benediction,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:24">Hebrews 13:24</span>. </p>
