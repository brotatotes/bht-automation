<p><strong>For the bodies of those beasts</strong>,.... Not the red heifer,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:1">Numbers 19:1</span> nor the sin offering in general, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+6:30">Leviticus 6:30</span> nor those for the priest and people, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+4:11">Leviticus 4:11</span> but the bullock and goat, on the day of atonement, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:11">Leviticus 16:11</span> which were typical of Christ, in the bringing of their blood into the most holy place, by the high priest, for sin; and in the burning of them, without the camp: these beasts were slain, their blood was shed, and was brought into the most holy place, by the high priest; and was sprinkled on the mercy seat, and the horns of the altar of incense; and, by it, atonement was made for the priest, his house, and all Israel; which was a type of the death of Christ; the shedding of his blood; the carrying of it into heaven; the sprinkling it upon the throne of grace and mercy; by which reconciliation is made for the sins of all God's people:</p>
<p><strong>whose blood is brought into the sanctuary</strong>: that is, into the holy of holies, as the Ethiopic version renders it:</p>
<p><strong>by the high priest for sin</strong>; to make atonement for it, for his own, and for the sins of his family, and of all Israel:</p>
<p><strong>are burnt without the camp</strong>, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:27">Leviticus 16:27</span> even their skins, flesh, and dung; and the men that burnt them were unclean, though, upon being washed, were received: which was typical of the dolorous sufferings of Christ without Jerusalem, as the next verse shows; and points out the extent of his sufferings, reaching to all parts of his body, and even to his soul; and expresses not only the pains, but the shame and reproach he endured, signified by the burning of the dung; and hints at the pardon of the wicked Jews, who were concerned in his sufferings; which was applied unto them upon their repentance.</p>
