But I beseech you the rather to do this,.... To pray earnestly; to strive together in their prayers for them,Romans 15:30that I may be restored to you the sooner: Christ's ministers are sometimes hindered from being with their people, through Satan, or his emissaries, creating troubles, or casting them into prison; which might be the apostle's case now; but God can make their way through all; and for this he should be prayed unto.
