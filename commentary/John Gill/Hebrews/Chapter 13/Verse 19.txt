<p><strong>But I beseech you the rather to do this</strong>,.... To pray earnestly; to strive together in their prayers for them,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:30">Romans 15:30</span></p>
<p><strong>that I may be restored to you the sooner</strong>: Christ's ministers are sometimes hindered from being with their people, through Satan, or his emissaries, creating troubles, or casting them into prison; which might be the apostle's case now; but God can make their way through all; and for this he should be prayed unto.</p>
