<p><strong>Know ye that [our] brother Timothy is set at liberty</strong>,.... This is the same person to whom the Apostle Paul wrote two epistles, and whom he often calls his son, though sometimes his brother, as here, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:1">Colossians 1:1</span> of him he says, that he was set at liberty, or "dismissed"; either by the apostle, by whom he was sent into some parts, upon some business; or rather was loosed from his bonds, having been a prisoner for the sake of Christ and the Gospel; and, it may be; a fellow prisoner with the apostle, at Rome, as Aristarchus and others were; and this very great and useful person being known, very likely, to the Hebrews, since his mother was a Jewess, and he himself was well reported of by the brethren at Lystra and Iconium, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span> it was a piece of good news to them to hear of his release:</p>
<p><strong>with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you</strong>; by which it seems that Timothy was now absent from the apostle, but that he expected him to come in a short time; when, if he should, they would both come together, and visit the Hebrews; which looks as if the apostle was at liberty himself, or at least had some hopes of his deliverance from prison; but whether he ever had his liberty after this, and saw the Hebrews any more, cannot be said; the contrary seems most probable.</p>
