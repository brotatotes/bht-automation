Grace be with you all, Amen. Which is the apostle's usual salutation in all his epistles, 2 Thessalonians 3:17 in which he wishes renewed discoveries of the love and favour of God; fresh communications of grace from Christ; an abundant supply of the spirit of grace; an increase of internal grace and external gifts; and a continuance of the Gospel of the grace of God. Of "Amen",2 Thessalonians 3:17- :. The subscription of this epistle is,written to the Hebrews from Italy by Timothy; in the Alexandrian copy it is, "written to the Hebrews from Rome"; which is very probable, since the Italian brethren send their salutations in it; and the words, "by Timothy", are left out; nor is it likely that it should, since it is clear, from Hebrews 13:23 that he was absent from the apostle; and if he had sent it by him, what need was there to inform them that he was set at liberty?
