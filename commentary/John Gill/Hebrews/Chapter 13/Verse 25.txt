<p><strong>Grace be with you all, Amen.</strong> Which is the apostle's usual salutation in all his epistles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span> in which he wishes renewed discoveries of the love and favour of God; fresh communications of grace from Christ; an abundant supply of the spirit of grace; an increase of internal grace and external gifts; and a continuance of the Gospel of the grace of God. Of "Amen",</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17- :">2 Thessalonians 3:17- :</span>. The subscription of this epistle is,</p>
<p><strong>written to the Hebrews from Italy by Timothy</strong>; in the Alexandrian copy it is, "written to the Hebrews from Rome"; which is very probable, since the Italian brethren send their salutations in it; and the words, "by Timothy", are left out; nor is it likely that it should, since it is clear, from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:23">Hebrews 13:23</span> that he was absent from the apostle; and if he had sent it by him, what need was there to inform them that he was set at liberty?</p>
