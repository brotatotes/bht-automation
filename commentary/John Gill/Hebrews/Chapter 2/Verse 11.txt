<p><strong>For both he that sanctifieth</strong>,.... Not himself, though this is said of him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19">John 17:19</span> nor his Father, though this also is true of him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:13">Isaiah 8:13</span> but his people, the sons brought to glory, whose salvation he is the Captain of; they are sanctified in him, he being made sanctification to them; and they have their sanctification from him, all their grace and holiness; and they are sanctified by him, both by his blood, which expiates their sins, and removes the guilt of them, and by his Spirit, working internal principles of grace and holiness in them, who are by nature, and in their unregenerate state, guilty and unclean:</p>
<p><strong>and they who are sanctified</strong>; the sons brought to glory; they are not naturally holy, nor so of themselves, they are made holy; all that are sons are made holy; whom God adopts into his family, he regenerates: sanctification is absolutely necessary to their being brought to glory; and between the sanctifier and the sanctified there is a likeness, as there ought to be: they are</p>
<p><strong>all of one</strong>: they are both of one God and Father, Christ's God is their God, and his Father is their Father; they are of one body, Christ is the head, and they are members; they are of one covenant, Christ is the surety, Mediator, and messenger of it, and they share in all its blessings and promises; they are of one man, Adam, Christ is a Son of Adam, though not by ordinary generation, they descend from him in the common way; they are all of one nature, of one blood; Christ has took part of the same flesh and blood with them:</p>
<p><strong>for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren</strong>; Christ, and these sons that are sanctified, stand in the relation of brethren to each other; Christ is the firstborn among many brethren; he is a brother born for the day of adversity, and one that sticks closer than a brother: and this relation is founded both upon the incarnation of Christ, who thereby became his people's "Goel"; or near kinsman, yea, brother, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="so+8:1">Song of Solomon 8:1</span> and upon their adoption unto his Father's family, which is made manifest by their regeneration, and by their doing his Father's will under the influence of his grace and Spirit, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:49">Matthew 12:49</span> and this relation Christ owns; he called his disciples brethren, when God had raised him from the dead, and given him glory; and so he will call all his saints, even the meanest of them, in the great day, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:10">Matthew 28:10</span>, and "he is not ashamed" to do it; he does not disdain it, though he is God over all, and the Son of God, and is also in his human nature made higher than the heavens; which shows the wonderful condescension of Christ, and the honour that is put upon the saints; and may teach them not to despise the meanest among them: such a relation the Jews own will be between the Messiah and the Israelites. The Targumist on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="so+8:1">Song of Solomon 8:1</span> paraphrases the words thus;</p>
<p>"when the King Messiah shall be revealed to the congregation of Israel, the children of Israel shall say unto him, Come, be thou with us, לאח, for "a brother", or "be thou our brother".''</p>
<p>Nor can they say this will reflect any discredit upon Christ, when they make such a relation to be between God and them. The Israelites, they say f, are called, אחים להקבה "the brethren of the holy blessed God"; in proof of which they often produce</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+122:8">Psalms 122:8</span> as being the words of God to them; and again, interpreting those words in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+25:48">Leviticus 25:48</span> "one of his brethren may redeem him", this, say g they, is the holy blessed God.</p>
