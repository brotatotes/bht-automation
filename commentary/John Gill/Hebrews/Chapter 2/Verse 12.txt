<p><strong>Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren</strong>,.... These words, with the following clause, are cited from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:22">Psalms 22:22</span> as a proof of what the apostle had before asserted; and that this psalm is to be understood, not of the Jewish nation, or people of Israel, nor of Esther, nor of David, but of the Messiah, appears from the title of it, "Aijeleth, Shahar", which signifies "the morning hind"; from the particular account of Christ's sufferings in it; from his several offices herein pointed to; from the conversion of the Gentiles it prophesies of; and from several passages cited from hence, and applied to Christ; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:35">Matthew 27:35</span>. And these are the words of Christ addressed to his Father; whose name he promises to declare to his brethren; meaning not the Jews, in general, his brethren according to the flesh; but his disciples and followers, particularly the twelve apostles, and the five hundred brethren to whom he appeared after his resurrection; and indeed all the saints and people of God may be included: and by his name he would declare to them, is not meant any particular name of his, as Elohim, El-shaddai, Jehovah, or the like; but rather he himself, and the perfections of his nature, which he, the only begotten Son, lying in his bosom, has declared; though the Gospel seems chiefly to be designed; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:6">John 17:6</span> and this Christ declared with great exactness and accuracy, with clearness and perspicuity, and with all integrity and fidelity: he spoke it out plainly, and concealed no part of it; as he received it from his Father, he faithfully made it known to his people; this is expressive of Christ's prophetic office, of his preaching of the Gospel, both in his own person, and by his ministers:</p>
<p><strong>in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee</strong>; or "a hymn"; this is to be understood not of the church above, but of the church below; and not of the synagogue of the Jews, but of the disciples of Christ, and of his singing an hymn to God, with and among them, as he did at the institution of the supper, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:30">Matthew 26:30</span> for though the number of the apostles was but small, yet they made a congregation or church, and which was a pure and glorious one. With the Jews h, ten men made a congregation.</p>
