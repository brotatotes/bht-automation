<p>Ver. 13 <strong>And again, I will put my trust in him</strong>,.... These words are taken not from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:17">Isaiah 8:17</span> where, in the Septuagint version, is a like phrase; for they are not the words of the Messiah there, but of the prophet; and besides, the apostle disjoins them from the following words, which stand there, by saying, "and again"; but they are cited from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:2">Psalms 18:2</span> in which psalm are many things which have respect to the Messiah, and his times; the person spoken of is said to be made the head of the Heathen, to whom unknown people yield a voluntary submission, and the name of God is praised among the Gentiles,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:43">Psalms 18:43</span>. The Targum upon it makes mention of the Messiah in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:32">Psalms 18:32</span> and he is manifestly spoken of under the name of David, in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:50">Psalms 18:50</span> and which verse is applied to the Messiah, by the Jews, both ancient and modern i: and these words are very applicable to him, for as man he had every grace of the Spirit in him; and this of faith, and also of hope, very early appeared in him; he trusted in God for the daily supplies of life, and that he would help him in, and through the work of man's salvation; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:9">Psalms 22:9</span> he committed his Spirit into his hands at death, with confidence, and believed he would raise his body from the dead; and he trusted him with his own glory, and the salvation of his people: and this is a citation pertinent to the purpose, showing that Christ and his people are one, and that they are brethren; for he must be man, since, as God, he could not be said to trust; and he must be a man of sorrows and distress, to stand in need of trusting in God.</p>
<p><strong>And again, behold I and the children which God hath given me</strong>; this is a citation from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:18">Isaiah 8:18</span> in which prophecy is a denunciation of God's judgments upon Israel, by the Assyrians, when God's own people among them are comforted with a promise of the Messiah, who is described as the Lord of hosts; who is to be sanctified, and be as a sanctuary to the saints, and as a stone of stumbling to others; and the prophet is ordered to bind and seal up the doctrine among the disciples, at which he seems astonished and concerned, but resolves to wait; upon which Christ, to encourage him, speaks these words; for they are not addressed to God, as the Syriac version renders them, "behold I and the children, whom thou hast given me, O God"; in which may be observed, that the saints are children with respect to God, who has adopted them, and with respect to Christ, who is their everlasting Father; that they were given to Christ as his spiritual seed and offspring, as his portion, and to be his care and charge; and that this is worthy of attention, and calls for admiration, that Christ and his people are one, and that he is not ashamed to own them before God and men.</p>
