<p><strong>God also bearing them witness</strong>,.... The apostles of Christ; God testifying to their mission and commission, and the truth of the doctrine they preached:</p>
<p><strong>both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles</strong>; such as taking up serpents without hurt, healing the sick, causing the lame to walk, and raising the dead, and casting out devils, and the like; all which were for the confirmation of the Gospel preached by them: a sign, wonder, or miracle, for these signify the same thing, is a marvellous work done before men, by the power of God, to confirm a divine truth; God is the sole author of miracles; and they were done in the first ages of Christianity, when they were necessary, to give evidence of the truth of it, and to establish men in it; and these were various, as before observed: and gifts of the Holy Ghost; such as besides gifts of healing and working miracles, gifts of foretelling things to come, discerning of spirits, speaking with divers kinds of tongues, and the interpretation of tongues, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8">1 Corinthians 12:8</span> according to his own will; either according to the will of God, who bore testimony by these miracles and gifts; or according to the will of the Holy Spirit, who distributed them to men severally as he pleased, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:11">1 Corinthians 12:11</span>.</p>
