<p><strong>Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet</strong>,.... Good angels, men and devils, all things in heaven, earth, and sea; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22">1 Peter 3:22</span></p>
<p><strong>for in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him</strong>; there is no one person or thing that is not subject to Christ; the subjection is the most universal, either voluntary or involuntary; whether they will or not, they are, and must be subject; God has left nothing but what he has put under his power:</p>
<p><strong>but now we see not yet all things put under him</strong>; this seems to be an objection, and even a contradiction to what is before said; which may be removed by observing, that though this general subjection is not seen by us, it does not follow that it is not; and though it is not as yet visible, yet it will be: and besides, the apostle's sense may be, that no such general subjection to any mere man has ever been seen and known; as not to Solomon, nor Ahasuerus, nor Cyrus, nor Alexander the great, nor Julius, nor Augustus Caesar, nor any other; and this he may observe, to show the non-application of this passage to any but to Jesus Christ; and this sense is confirmed by what follows.</p>
