<p><strong>But we see Jesus</strong>,.... Not with bodily eyes, but with the eyes of the mind, and understanding; that he is Jesus, as the Syriac version reads; and that he is designed in the above words; and that he has all things made subject unto him; and that he was humbled, and now exalted, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>who was made a little lower than the angels</strong>; in his state of humiliation; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span></p>
<p><strong>for the suffering of death</strong>: this clause may be considered either as connected with the preceding; and then the sense is, that Jesus became lower than the angels, by, or through suffering death; in that respect he was lower than they, who die not; this proved him to be in a condition below them, and showed how pertinent the above words were to him, and how they were fulfilled in him: or with the following; and then the meaning is, that because Jesus suffered death in the room and stead of his people; humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross, when he was very low indeed, therefore he is</p>
<p><strong>crowned with glory and honour</strong>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:8">Philippians 2:8</span> and</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:8- :">Philippians 2:8- :</span>.</p>
<p><strong>that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man</strong>; that is, Christ was made a little lower than the angels by becoming man, and assuming a body frail and mortal, that he might die for his church and people: to "taste death", is a Jewish phrase, often to be met with in Rabbinical writings; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:8- :">Philippians 2:8- :</span> and signifies the truth and reality of his death, and the experience he had of the bitterness of it, it being attended with the wrath of God, and curse of the law; though he continued under it but for a little while, it was but a taste; and it includes all kinds of death, he tasted of the death of afflictions, being a man of sorrows all his days, and a corporeal death, and what was equivalent to an eternal one; and so some think the words will bear to be rendered, "that he by the grace of God might taste of every death"; which rendering of the words, if it could be established, as it is agreeable to the context, and to the analogy of faith, would remove all pretence of an argument from this place, in favour of the universal scheme: what moved God to make him lower than the angels, and deliver him up to death, was not any anger towards him, any disregard to him, or because he deserved it, but his "grace", free favour, and love to men; this moved him to provide him as a ransom; to preordain him to be the Lamb slain; to send him in the fulness of time, and give him up to justice and death: the Syriac version reads, "for God himself through his own grace tasted death for all"; Christ died, not merely as an example, or barely for the good of men, but as a surety, in their room and stead, and that not for every individual of mankind; for there are some he knows not; for some he does not pray; and there are some who will not be saved: the word "man" is not in the original text, it is only υπερ παντος, which may be taken either collectively, and be rendered "for the whole"; that is, the whole body, the church for whom Christ gave himself, and is the Saviour of; or distributively, and be translated, "for everyone"; for everyone of the sons God brings to glory, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span> for everyone of the "brethren", whom Christ sanctifies, and he is not ashamed to own, and to whom he declares the name of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:11">Hebrews 2:11</span> for everyone of the members of the "church", in the midst of which he sung praise, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:12">Hebrews 2:12</span> for every one of the "children" God has given him, and for whose sake he took part of flesh and blood, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:13">Hebrews 2:13</span> and for everyone of the "seed" of Abraham, in a spiritual sense, whose nature he assumed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:16">Hebrews 2:16</span>.</p>
