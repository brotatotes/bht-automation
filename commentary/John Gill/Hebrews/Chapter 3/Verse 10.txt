<p><strong>Wherefore I was grieved with that generation</strong>,....</p>
<p>דור המדבר, "the generation of the wilderness", as the Jews often call them; and which they say was more beloved than any generation e; and yet they will not allow them a part in the world to come;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. When God is said to be grieved with them, it is to be considered as an anthropopathy, as speaking after the manner of men, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+6:5">Genesis 6:5</span>. The word signifies, that he was wearied by them, and weary of them; that he loathed them, and was displeased with them; it shows the notice God took of their sin; the heinousness of it, his displicency at it, and determination to punish it: the cause of his grief and indignation were their unbelief, ingratitude, and idolatry:</p>
<p><strong>and said, they do alway err in their heart</strong>; all sins are errors, or aberrations from the law of God; all men err in this sense: these people erred in their hearts, for there is error in the understanding, and will, and affections, as well as in life and actions; and they may be said to err in their hearts, because their sins not only sprung from the heart, but they were done heartily, or with their hearts, and that continually; which shows the sottishness of this people: their stubbornness and rebellion; their want of integrity, and their constancy in sinning: heart sins, as well as others, are taken notice of by God:</p>
<p><strong>and they have not known my ways</strong>; they did not take notice of God's ways of providence towards them; nor did they approve of, and delight in his ways of worship and duty, or in his commands.</p>
<p>e T. Hieros. Avoda Zara, fol. 39. 2.</p>
