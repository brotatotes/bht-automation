<p><strong>But with whom was he grieved forty years</strong>?.... As is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:10">Psalms 95:10</span>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:10- :">Psalms 95:10- :</span>,</p>
<p><strong>was it not with them that had sinned</strong>; not merely by committing personal iniquities, and particular provocations, which all men are guilty of, but by committing public sins; they sinned as a body of men; they joined together in the commission of sin; every sin is grieving to God, because it is contrary to his nature, is an act of enmity to him, is a transgression of his righteous law, and a contempt of his authority; but especially public sins, or the sins of a multitude, and when they are persisted in, which was the case of the Israelites; they sinned against him during the forty years they were in the wilderness; and so long was he grieved with them: the Alexandrian copy reads, "with them that believed not"; which points out the particular sin these men were guilty of, and which was so grieving to God, and suits well with the apostle's design:</p>
<p><strong>whose carcasses fell in the wilderness</strong>? and so never entered into the land of Canaan. They died in the wilderness; and they did not die common and natural deaths, at least not all of them; their deaths were by way of punishment; in a way of wrath; in a judicial way: the Syriac version renders it, "their bones fell in the wilderness"; they lay scattered and unburied, and exposed to view, as an example of divine vengeance, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:29">Numbers 14:29</span>.</p>
