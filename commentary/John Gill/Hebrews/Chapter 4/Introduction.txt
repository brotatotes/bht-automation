<p>INTRODUCTION TO HEBREWS 4</p>
<p>From the punishment inflicted on the unbelieving Hebrews, who died in the wilderness, and entered not into the land of rest made mention of in the preceding chapter, the apostle proceeds to caution the present Hebrews of his time, and who professed faith in Christ, lest seeing there was a rest, and a promise of entering into it, they should seem to come short of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:1">Hebrews 4:1</span>, and the rather, since they that fell in the wilderness had the Gospel preached to them as well as they; and the reason why it did not profit was, because it was not received by faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:2">Hebrews 4:2</span> as also seeing it is by faith that believers now enter into rest, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:3">Hebrews 4:3</span> which rest is not the rest of the seventh day, on which God rested; nor, the rest of the land of Canaan, which Joshua led the Israelites into; for if he had entered them into the rest the apostle means, David, so many hundred years after him, would not have made mention of another rest, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:4">Hebrews 4:4</span> wherefore it follows that there is another rest for the people of God, which he that enters into ceases from his own works, as God did from his, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:9">Hebrews 4:9</span> and this is the rest that everyone that professes faith in Christ, should be solicitous and diligent to enter into, lest he should fall short of it through unbelief; as the unbelieving Israelites did of their rest, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:11">Hebrews 4:11</span> and the arguments engaging to such a concern are taken from the properties and perfections of Christ, the essential Word of God; particularly from his omnipotence and his omniscience, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:12">Hebrews 4:12</span>. And seeing he is by nature the Son of God, and by office a great high priest that is entered into heaven for his people, the encouragement is great to hold fast the profession of faith in him they have made, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14">Hebrews 4:14</span> and the rather since he is a sympathizing high priest, as he must needs be, since he has been tempted, afflicted, and has suffered every way as his people, and is in all respects like them, excepting that he has no sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span> and this consideration should engage believers to come to the throne of grace with all boldness, and in expectation of having grace and mercy bestowed on them for the supply of their daily wants, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span>. </p>
