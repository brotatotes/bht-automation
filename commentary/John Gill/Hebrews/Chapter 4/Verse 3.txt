<p><strong>For we which have believed do enter into rest</strong>,.... Not eternal rest; all believers shall enjoy this, and they only; but this is not now, or at present enjoyed, unless things future may be said to be present, because of faith in them, and the certainty of them but spiritual rest in Christ under the Gospel dispensation, which is a rest from the burden of the law of Moses, and from all toil and labour for life, and salvation by works, and lies in an enjoyment of much inward peace of soul, notwithstanding the world's troubles and Satan's temptations; and such who believe the word or Gospel preached, and Christ in it, not with a general and historical high, or only in profession, but with the heart, and in truth, these enjoy this rest; they are kept in perfect peace, and have much spiritual ease and comfort: this character distinguishes them from the unbelieving Israelites of old, and from present hypocrites and formal professors:</p>
<p><strong>as he said, as I have sworn in wrath, if they shall enter into my rest</strong>; the words are in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:11">Psalms 95:11</span>, and are before cited in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:11">Hebrews 3:11</span></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:11- :">Hebrews 3:11- :</span>: they entered not in because of unbelief; none but believers enter into spiritual rest. The apostle applies this proof to his design, by removing all other rests, and particularly by showing that does not mean God's rest from the works of creation:</p>
<p><strong>although the works were finished from the foundation of the world</strong>; that is, though the works of creation, that God designed to make, were finished and perfected within the first six days of the world, and then God rested, or ceased to work in a creative way; yet this is not the rest designed in the passage of Scripture cited, nor is it that rest which believers enter into.</p>
