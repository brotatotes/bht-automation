<p><strong>For he spake in a certain place</strong>,.... <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:2">Genesis 2:2</span> that is, Moses, the penman of that book spoke, or God by him:</p>
<p><strong>of the seventh day on this wise</strong>; of the seventh day of the world, or from the creation of the heavens and the earth:</p>
<p><strong>and God did rest the seventh day from all his works</strong>: of creation, but not of providence; for in them he works hitherto; nor does this rest suppose labour with fatigue and weariness, and ease and refreshment from it; only cessation from working in a creative way, and the utmost delight, complacency and satisfaction in what he had done. The Alexandrian copy leaves out the phrase, "the seventh day".</p>
