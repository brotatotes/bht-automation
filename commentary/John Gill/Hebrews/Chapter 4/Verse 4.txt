Genesis 2:2 that is, Moses, the penman of that book spoke, or God by him:of the seventh day on this wise; of the seventh day of the world, or from the creation of the heavens and the earth:and God did rest the seventh day from all his works: of creation, but not of providence; for in them he works hitherto; nor does this rest suppose labour with fatigue and weariness, and ease and refreshment from it; only cessation from working in a creative way, and the utmost delight, complacency and satisfaction in what he had done. The Alexandrian copy leaves out the phrase, "the seventh day".
