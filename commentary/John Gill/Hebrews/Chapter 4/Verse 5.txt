<p><strong>And in this place again</strong>,.... In <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:11">Psalms 95:11</span> he speaks again of another rest distinct from that on the seventh day; which, and not the latter, is what believers under the Gospel dispensation enter into:</p>
<p><strong>if they shall enter into my rest</strong>: that is, unbelievers shall not enter into it; as the unbelieving Israelites did not enter into the typical rest, so neither shall any unbeliever enter into the Gospel rest, the antitype of the former.</p>
