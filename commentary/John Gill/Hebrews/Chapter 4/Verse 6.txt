It follows by just consequence,that some must enter therein; for God's swearing concerning some, that they should not enter into his rest, supposes that others should: andthey to whom it was first preached; to whom the Gospel was first preached, namely, the Israelites in the wilderness: entered not in because of unbelief; See Hebrews 3:19.
