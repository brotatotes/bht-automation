<p><strong>For every high priest taken from among men</strong>,.... Every one that was an high priest under the law was a man, and not an angel; and it was proper he should be so, that he might be a priest for men, have compassion on them, and offer for them; and he was among the number of common men, and was taken out from them, and chosen and separated from the rest of men, as Aaron and his sons were from the children of Israel, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:1">Exodus 28:1</span>. And such an one</p>
<p><strong>is ordained for men</strong>; in their room and stead, and for their good; and above them, as the word sometimes signifies; he was exalted unto, and invested with a superior office, to which he was ordained according to the law of a carnal commandment, by anointing with oil, and without an oath.</p>
<p><strong>In things pertaining to God</strong>; in things in which God had to do with men; and so he presided over them in the name of God, and declared the will of God unto them, and blessed them; and in things in which men had to do with God; and so he appeared in their name, and represented their persons, and presented their sacrifices to God, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins</strong>; freewill offerings, peace offerings, burnt offerings, sin and trespass offerings, all kind of sacrifice.</p>
