<p><strong>Who can have compassion on the ignorant</strong>,.... Who have committed sins of ignorance, and bring their sacrifices for them; these he does not insult and upbraid, nor break out into anger and indignation against; but pities them, and sympathizes with them; has a just measure of compassion suitable to their condition, and bears with them with great moderation and temper:</p>
<p><strong>and on them that are out of the way</strong>; of God's commandments; who are like sheep going astray, and turn to their own way; who transgress the law of God, and err from it; perhaps such who sin knowingly and wilfully, and through infirmity, are meant:</p>
<p><strong>for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity</strong>; not of body only, but of mind, sinful infirmity; he had much of it, it beset him all around; he was "clothed" with it, as the Syriac version renders it; as Joshua the high priest was with filthy garments, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:3">Zechariah 3:3</span>.</p>
