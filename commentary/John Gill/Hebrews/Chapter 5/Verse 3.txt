<p><strong>And by reason hereof</strong>,.... Because of his sinful infirmity:</p>
<p><strong>he ought, as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins</strong>; as he offered sacrifice for the sins of the people, so he was obliged to offer for his own sins; in this Christ differed from the high priest, for he had no sin of his own to offer for, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:27">Hebrews 7:27</span> but he had, and therefore offered for them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:11">Leviticus 16:11</span> and made a confession of them: the form of which, as used on the day of atonement, was this;</p>
<p>"he put both his hands upon the bullock, and confessed, and thus he said: I beseech thee, O Lord, I have done wickedly, I have transgressed, I have sinned before thee, I and my house; I beseech thee, O Lord, pardon the iniquities, transgressions, and sins, which I have done wickedly, transgressed, and sinned before thee, I and my house.''</p>
<p>And this he did a second time on that day z.</p>
