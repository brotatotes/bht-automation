<p><strong>For when God made promise to Abraham</strong>,.... The apostle proposes Abraham as a pattern, because he was the father of these Hebrews, and of all believers; and because they were interested in the promise made to him, and had a right to the same blessing with him; and because he was remarkable for his faith and patience: the promise made to him is not that in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:1">Genesis 12:1</span> nor that in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:1">Genesis 15:1</span> but that in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:16">Genesis 22:16</span> for that only had an oath annexed to it: and this was made by Jesus Christ, there called the Angel of the Lord, and here God; and who is truly and properly so; and than whom there is none greater; and who elsewhere, as here, is said to swear by himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:23">Isaiah 45:23</span> as follows:</p>
<p><strong>because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself</strong>; swearing is ascribed to a divine person after the manner of men, and in condescension to them; and who is never introduced swearing, but in matters of moment and of great importance; the note of Philo the Jew n on the passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:16">Genesis 22:16</span> from whence the following words are cited, is worthy of observation, being very near the apostle's words;</p>
<p>"well does he (God) confirm the promise with an oath, and with an oath that becomes God; for you see that God does not swear by another, for nothing is better than himself, but by himself, who is the best of all; but some have suggested as if it was inconvenient to swear, for an oath is taken for the sake of faith; but God alone is faithful, &amp;c.''</p>
