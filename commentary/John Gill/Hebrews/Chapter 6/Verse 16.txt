<p><strong>For men verily swear by the greater</strong>,.... These words contain a reason why God swore by himself, and why his promises, having an oath annexed to them, ought to be believed. Men when they swear, they swear by the greater; not by themselves, as God does, because there is one greater than they; not by any of the creatures on earth, nor by the angels in heaven, but by God; because he is the God of truth, the searcher of hearts, and who can take vengeance on perjurers: and an oath may lawfully be taken, when it is truth that is sworn to, and is just and good; and in cases of weight and moment; and in what is possible and right to perform; and when it is done with deliberation, in the fear of God, with a view to his glory, and the good of men: for an oath is of a moral nature, what God has commanded, and he himself has taken; it has been used by Christ, and by the saints of the Old and New Testament; and is prophesied of the New Testament saints, as what they should practise; and is a part of religious worship:</p>
<p><strong>and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife</strong>; it is used to confirm things that are doubtful, and in dispute; and to put an end to strife and contention; so Philo o the Jew says,</p>
<p>"by an oath things doubtful are determined, and things uncertain are confirmed, and what were not believed receive credit.''</p>
<p>The manner in which an oath was taken among the Jews, to which, the apostle writing to such, must be thought to have respect, was this;</p>
<p>"he that swore took the book of the law in his hand, and he stood and swore by the name (of God), or by his surnames; and the judges did not suffer anyone to swear but in the holy tongue; and thus he said, behold I swear by the God of Israel, by him whose name is merciful and gracious, that I do not owe this man anything p.''</p>
<p>The Hebrew word שבעה, used for an oath, is of the root שבע, which signifies to "fill, satiate, satisfy": for an oath being taken about matters in controversy, not clear but doubtful give content unto and satisfy the minds of men; and the same word also signifies "seven", a number of fulness and perfection; an oath being for the perfecting and finishing an affair in debate; agreeably, when covenants were made by oaths, seven witnesses were used, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:28">Genesis 21:28</span> and Herodotus says q as Cocceius r observes, that the Arabians, when they swore at making covenants, anointed the stones with blood.</p>
