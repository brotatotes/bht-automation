<p>INTRODUCTION TO HEBREWS 7</p>
<p>The apostle having made mention of Melchizedek in the latter part of the preceding chapter, proceeds in this to give some account of him, and of the excellency of his priesthood, and to show that Christ is a priest of his order, and is superior to Aaron and his sons. He first declares what Melchizedek was, that he was both king and priest; he names the place he was king of, and tells whose priest he was, even the priest of the most high God; and goes on to observe what he did, that he met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, that he blessed him, and took tithes of him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:1">Hebrews 7:1</span> and then interprets his name, and royal title, the one signifying king of righteousness, the other king of peace; that for anything that can be learned from the Scriptures, it is not known who was his father or his mother; what his lineage and descent; when he was born, or when he died; and that he is like to the Son of God, and continues a priest, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:2">Hebrews 7:2</span> upon which the apostle calls upon the Hebrews to consider the greatness of his person; and as it appears from that single instance of his receiving tithes from the patriarch Abraham, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:4">Hebrews 7:4</span> by which it is evident, that he is greater than the Levites; and which is demonstrated in the following particulars: the Levites received tithes of their brethren that came out of Abraham's loins, as they did, but Melchizedek, whose descent was not from them, received tithes from Abraham himself, and besides blessed him; and it is a clear case, that the lesser is blessed of the greater, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:5">Hebrews 7:5</span> the Levites were mortal men that received tithes, but a testimony is bore to Melchizedek, that he lives, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:8">Hebrews 6:8</span> yea, Levi himself paid tithes to Melchizedek, since he was in the loins of his father Abraham when Melchizedek met him, and took tithes of him; and therefore must be greater than Levi, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:9">Hebrews 7:9</span>. And next the apostle proves the imperfection of the Levitical priesthood from this consideration, that there is another priest risen up, not of the order of Aaron, but of the order of Melchizedek, of which there would have been no need, if the Levitical priesthood had been perfect; nor would it have been changed, as it is, and which has also made a change of the law, by which it is established, necessary, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:11">Hebrews 7:11</span> that the priest that is risen up is not of the order of Aaron, is clear, because he is of another tribe, even of the tribe of Judah, to which the priesthood did not belong, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:13">Hebrews 7:13</span>, and that he is of the order of Melchizedek, and so not according to the ceremonial law, but after the power of an endless life, is manifest from the testimony of the sacred Scripture, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:15">Hebrews 7:15</span> which lies in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:4">Psalms 110:4</span> and that the ceremonial law, on which the Levitical priesthood stood, is changed and abrogated, is strongly asserted, and the reasons of it given, because it was weak and unprofitable, and made nothing perfect; and this was disannulled by Christ, the better hope brought in, who has made something perfect, and through whom we have access to God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:18">Hebrews 7:18</span>. Moreover, the superior excellency of Christ's priesthood to the Levitical one is shown in several particulars; the priests of Aaron's order were made without an oath; Christ was made with one, as is evident from the above cited testimony, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:20">Hebrews 7:20</span> they were many, he but one; they were mortal, and did not continue, he continues ever, having an unchangeable priesthood, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:23">Hebrews 7:23</span> wherefore, as they were not suffered to continue by reason of death, their priesthood was ineffectual; they could not take away sin, and save sinners; but Christ is able to save to the uttermost all that draw nigh to God by him, as a priest, and that because he ever lives to complete his office by intercession, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span> wherefore such an high priest as he is, must become men, and be suitable to them, especially since he is pure and holy, and in such an exalted state, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26">Hebrews 7:26</span> and this is another difference between him and the priests under the law; they were men that had infirmity, and were guilty of sins themselves, and so had need to offer for their own sins, and then for the sins of others; but Christ, the Son of God, who was consecrated a priest for evermore, by the word of the oath, had no sin of his own to offer sacrifice for, only the sins of his people, which he did once, when he offered himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:27">Hebrews 7:27</span>. </p>
