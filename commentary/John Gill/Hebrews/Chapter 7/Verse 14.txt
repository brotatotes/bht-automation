<p><strong>For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah</strong>,.... Out of the tribe of Judah; it is certain that the Messiah was to spring from that tribe, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span> he was to be of the family of Jesse, and of the house of David; and hence he is sometimes called David himself; and so the Jews expect that he will come from the tribe of Judah, and not from any other p; and it is evident that Jesus, who is our Lord by creation, redemption, and the conquest of his grace, sprung from this tribe: this is clear from the place of his birth, Bethlehem of Judah; and from his reputed father Joseph, and real mother Mary, being both of the house of David; and this was known to the Jews, and it is owned by them that he was near to the kingdom q, which he could not be if he was not of that tribe; and hence he is called the lion of the tribe of Judah;</p>
<p><strong>of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning the priesthood</strong>: he said many things of it in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+33:8">Deuteronomy 33:8</span> and relates many things concerning it as spoken by Jacob, but nothing about the priesthood, as if it belonged to that, or that any that should spring from it should exercise that office, The Alexandrian copy, the Claromontane manuscript, and the Vulgate Latin version, read, "concerning the priests"; whence it follows that there is a change of the priesthood, and that the Messiah, as he was not to be, so he is not a priest of Aaron's order, not being of the same tribe.</p>
