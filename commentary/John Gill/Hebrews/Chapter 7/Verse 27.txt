<p><strong>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests</strong>,.... They being sinners, and he not:</p>
<p><strong>to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the people's</strong>; as they did on the day of atonement; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:6">Leviticus 16:6</span> upon which place the Jews c make the same remark the apostle does here;</p>
<p>"he (the high priest, they say) offers sacrifices for the sins of the people, for his own בקדמיתא, "first", ולבתר, "and afterwards for the sins of the people":''</p>
<p>which was one reason of the imperfection and insufficiency of their sacrifices; but Christ needed not to offer for his own, nor could he, for he had none of his own; what he had was by imputation; wherefore he only needed to offer, and he only did offer, for the sins of the people; not of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles also, even of all God's covenant people; nor did he need to do this daily, as they did; they offered sacrifice daily, the common priests every day, morning and evening, and the high priest on a stated day once a year, on the day of atonement:</p>
<p><strong>for this he did once, when he offered up himself</strong>; and in this also he differed from them; they offered not themselves, but what was inferior to themselves, and what could not take away sin, and, therefore, was repeated; but Christ offered himself, his whole human nature, soul and body, and both as in union with his divine nature; and this being offered to God freely and voluntarily, in the room and stead of his people, was acceptable to God: hereby justice was satisfied; the law fulfilled; sin taken away, and complete salvation obtained; so that there never was since any need of his offering again, nor never will be; which shows the perfection and fulness of his priesthood, and the preference of it to the Levitical one.</p>
