<p><strong>Now consider how great this man was</strong>,.... Melchizedek, of whom so many great and wonderful things are said in the preceding verses: and as follows,</p>
<p><strong>unto whom the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils</strong>; of Abraham's giving tithes to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> and Melchizedek's greatness is aggravated, not only from this act of Abraham's, but from Abraham's being a "patriarch", who did it; he was the patriarch of patriarchs, as the sons of Jacob are called, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:8">Acts 7:8</span> he is the patriarch of the whole Jewish nation, and of many nations, and of all believers, the friend of God, and heir of the world; how great then must Melchizedek be, to whom he paid tithes? and how much greater must Christ, the antitype of Melchizedek, be?</p>
