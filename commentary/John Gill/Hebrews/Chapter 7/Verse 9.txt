<p><strong>And as l may so say</strong>,.... With truth, and with great propriety and pertinence:</p>
<p><strong>Levi also who receiveth tithes</strong>; or the Levites, who receive tithes according to the law of Moses from the people of Israel:</p>
<p><strong>paid tithes in Abraham</strong>; that is, to Melchizedek; and therefore Melchizedek must be greater than they, and his priesthood a more excellent one than theirs; since they who receive tithes from others gave tithes to him.</p>
