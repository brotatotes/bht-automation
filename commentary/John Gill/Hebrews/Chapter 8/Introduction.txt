<p>INTRODUCTION TO HEBREWS 8</p>
<p>The apostle observing that the priesthood of Christ is the sum of what he had treated of in the preceding chapter, proceeds to show the superior excellency of it in other instances, particularly in the place where Christ now officiates, which is in heaven; he being set down at the right hand of God there, and so was a minister of the sanctuary, and true tabernacle pitched by God, and not man; whereas the priests of Aaron's line only ministered on earth, and in the typical sanctuary and tabernacle, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:1">Hebrews 8:1</span> and after he had observed that Christ must have something to offer, meaning his body, to answer to the gifts and sacrifices priests were ordained to offer, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:3">Hebrews 8:3</span> he proves the necessity of his ministering in heaven, because if he was on earth he would not be a priest, a complete one, and would have been useless and needless, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:4">Hebrews 8:4</span> and besides, it was proper that he should go up to heaven, and minister there, as the antitype of the priests, who, to the example and shadow of heavenly things, served in the tabernacle which was made by Moses, by the order of God, and according to the pattern showed him in the Mount, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span> and that the ministry of Christ in the true sanctuary is much more excellent than the ministry of the priests in the shadowy one, is evident from his being the Mediator of a better covenant, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:6">Hebrews 8:6</span> and that the covenant he is the Mediator of is the better covenant, appears froth the better promises of which it consists, and from the faultiness of the former covenant, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:6">Hebrews 8:6</span> and that that was faulty, and succeeded by another, he proves from a passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:31">Jeremiah 31:31</span> in which mention is made of a new covenant, and as distinct from that made with the Jewish fathers, and violated by them; and several of the promises of this new and second covenant are rehearsed, and which manifestly appear to be better than what were in the former, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:8">Hebrews 8:8</span> from all which the apostle concludes, that a new covenant being made, the old one must be antiquated; and that whereas it was decaying and waxing old, it was just ready to vanish away, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:13">Hebrews 8:13</span>. </p>
