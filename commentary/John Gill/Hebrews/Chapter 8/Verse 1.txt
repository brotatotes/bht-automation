<p><strong>Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum</strong>,.... The scope and drift, the compendium and substance; or the principal of what has been said in or from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:4">Psalms 110:4</span> and has been discoursed of in the three preceding chapters, is the priesthood of Christ:</p>
<p><strong>we have such an high priest</strong>; as is described in the foregoing discourse, and in the following words: Christ is a priest, an high priest, and the saints' high priest; they are not without one under the Gospel dispensation; and Christ is he, and always continues, in whose sacrifice and intercession they have a share:</p>
<p><strong>who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens</strong>; he is "set", whereas the Levitical priests stood; which shows that he has done his work, and that with acceptance; and is in a state of ease and rest; and is possessed of honour, glory, majesty, and authority, and which continue: the place where he is set is, "on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty"; the same with the right hand of God; for by the throne of the Majesty is meant God the Father, in his royal glory and dignity; so Tiphereth, one of the ten numbers in the Jews' Cabalistic tree, whose name is Jehovah, is called כסא הכבוד, "the throne of glory" c; so angels are called thrones, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span> but God is a throne of majesty superior to them; and at his right hand sits Christ the great high priest; which is expressive of his high honour, glory, and power, and even of his equality with God: the phrase, "in the heavens", may refer both to God the throne of majesty, who is there, and to Christ the high priest, who is passed into them, and received by them, and sits there.</p>
