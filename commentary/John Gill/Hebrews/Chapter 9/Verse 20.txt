<p><strong>Saying, this is the blood of the testament</strong>,.... The first testament or covenant; this proves what the apostle had asserted in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:18">Hebrews 9:18</span> that it was dedicated with blood, or confirmed by it; compare with this <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:28">Matthew 26:28</span></p>
<p><strong>which God hath enjoined unto you</strong>; the people of Israel, to observe, and which they promised to do; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:7">Exodus 24:7</span>.</p>
