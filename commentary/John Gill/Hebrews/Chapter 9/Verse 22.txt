<p><strong>And almost all things are by the law purged with blood</strong>,.... All "except a few things", as the Arabic version renders it; for some things were cleansed by water, and others purged by fire,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+31:23">Numbers 31:23</span>. Some join the word almost with the word purged, as if the sense was, that all things were purged by blood, but not perfectly, only almost; but the former sense is best.</p>
<p><strong>And without shedding of blood is no remission</strong>; that is, of sin; there was no typical remission without it; and there can be no real remission but by, the blood of Christ; no instance can be given of pardon without it; if it could have been otherwise, the blood of Christ had not been shed; for so it would seem to be shed in vain, and his satisfaction to be unnecessary; nor is it agreeable to the justice of God to forgive sin without satisfaction; nor is it consistent with his veracity, and faithfulness to his word, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:17">Genesis 2:17</span>. It is a common saying with the Jews, and often to be met with in their writings, אין כפרה אלא בדם, "there is no atonement but by blood" k; by the shedding of blood; not by the shedding of it, as it flows out of the body of the sacrifice, but as it is poured out on the altar; for the pouring of the blood at the four corners, and at the bottom of the altar, were the chief rites required in sacrifices; nor did they reckon expiation to be expiation, unless the altar was moistened by the blood of the sacrifice l.</p>
