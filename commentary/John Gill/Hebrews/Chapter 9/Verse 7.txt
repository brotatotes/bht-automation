<p>Ver. 7 <strong>But into the second went the high priest alone, once every year</strong>,.... Though this is not expressed in so many words in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:2">Leviticus 16:2</span> only it is said that "Aaron came not at all times into the holy place within the vail"; yet it is the constant and generally received sense of the Jewish writers, in agreement with the apostle here, that the high priest went into the holy of holies but once a year q, on the day of atonement, which was on the tenth of the month Tisri, and answers to part of September; not but that he went in more than once on that day, for he went in no less than four times r; the first time he went in to offer incense; the second time with the blood of the bullock, to sprinkle it; the third time with the blood of the goat; and the fourth time to bring out the censer s; and if he entered a fifth time, they say he was worthy of death; wherefore Philo the Jew t seems to be mistaken when he affirms that, if he went in three or four times on the same day, he suffered death, nor was there any pardon for him; and as it was but one day in a year he might enter, so when he did, no other man, either Israelite or priest, might go in along with him; he went in alone without any attendance: the Jews say u, that a cord or thong was bound to the feet of the high priest when he went into the holy of holies, that if he died there, the rest might be able to draw him out; for it was not lawful for another priest to go in, no, not an high priest, none besides him on the day of atonement. Pausanias w makes mention of a temple of Minerva into which the priests entered once every year; which very likely was observed in imitation of this custom of the Jewish high priest; who in it was a type of Christ, and of his entrance into heaven, and of his constant and continued intercession there:</p>
<p><strong>not without blood</strong>; for he went in with the blood of the bullock and the blood of the goat; which was typical of the blood of Christ, by which he entered in once into the holy place, into heaven, when he had obtained eternal redemption by it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span> which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people; the bullock was offered by the high priest for himself and his family; and the goat for the sins of the people of Israel, even all their iniquities, transgressions, and sins, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:11">Leviticus 16:11</span>, but Christ the antitype having no sin, had no need to offer for himself, only for the sins of the people; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:11- :">Leviticus 16:11- :</span>.</p>
