<p><strong>Which was a figure for the time then present</strong>,.... The tabernacle in general was a figure of Christ's human nature, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:2">Hebrews 8:2</span> and the most holy part of it was a figure of heaven itself, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:24">Hebrews 9:24</span> the whole service of it was typical and shadowy; but it was but a temporary figure; it was for that present time only; the things of it were suited to that dispensation, and are now abolished, and ought not to be revived, the ordinances of the Gospel being greatly preferable to them; and while it did continue, it was only a parable, as the word here used signifies; it was like a dark saying; it had much obscurity and darkness in it; or as the Vulgate Latin version renders it, it was a "figure of the present time"; that is, of the Gospel dispensation; it was a shadow of good things to come under that; it prefigured what is now accomplished; or rather it was a "figure unto, or until the present time"; till Christ came, when all figures, types, and shadows fled away, and were of no more real use and service:</p>
<p><strong>in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices</strong>; that is, in which tabernacle, or at which then present time, or καθ' ην, "according to which figure or parable", as the Alexandrian copy and Vulgate Latin version read, gifts and sacrifices were offered by the priests; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:1">Hebrews 5:1</span>,</p>
<p><strong>that could not make him that did the service perfect</strong>; neither the priest that offered them, nor the people whom he represented, and for whom he did the service; they could not make real and perfect expiation for sin, nor justify from it, nor cleanse and sanctify; the spiritual worshippers had their sins expiated by the sacrifice of Christ; and their persons were justified by his righteousness, and they were cleansed by his blood: the particular instance in which, legal sacrifices did not make perfect is, "pertaining to the conscience"; there is in every man a conscience, and when sin is charged home upon it, that is filled with a sense of divine wrath; nor can it be pacified with anything short of what will answer the law and justice of God, and which is only done by the blood and righteousness of Christ.</p>
