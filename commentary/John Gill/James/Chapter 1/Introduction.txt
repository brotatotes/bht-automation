<p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO JAMES 1</strong></p>
<p>In this chapter, after the inscription and salutation, the apostle instructs the saints he writes to, how to behave under afflictions, and in every state of life; teaches them not to impute their sins to God, but to themselves; directs them in hearing the word, and cautions against self-deception in religion. The inscription and salutation are in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span> in which the author of the epistle is described by his name and office; and the persons it is written to, by the tribes of Israel they belonged to, and by the condition in which they were scattered about in the world, to whom the apostle wishes all grace. And as they were in an afflicted state, he begins with an exhortation to rejoice in their afflictions; because hereby faith was tried, and that produced patience, and patience being perfect, is the way to be complete, and want nothing, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2">James 1:2</span>, but if any wanted wisdom, how to behave under such exercises, he advises to apply to God for it, from whom it may be expected, since he is the giver of it, and gives it to all, and that liberally, and does not upbraid with the former conduct, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:5">James 1:5</span> but then such should ask in faith, or otherwise it cannot be thought they should receive, and besides would justly deserve the characters of fluctuating and unstable persons, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:6">James 1:6</span>. And the exhortations the apostle had given, he observes, suited all sorts of persons, poor and rich; the one who is exalted amidst his poverty, and the other who is mean, and frail, and mortal, amidst all his riches; which is illustrated by the flower of the grass falling off and perishing, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:9">James 1:9</span>. And upon the whole, he concludes the blessedness of the man that endures affliction patiently, since a crown of life is promised him, and he will receive it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12">James 1:12</span> and from external temptations or afflictions, the apostle proceeds to internal ones, temptations to sin; and denies them to be of God, and imputes them to the lusts of men, and gives a very accurate account of the beginning, progress, and finishing of sin by man; and observes, that to place sin to the account of God, and not man, is a very great error, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:13">James 1:13</span>, which he proves from the pure and holy nature of God; and from the good and perfect gifts, which all, and only, come from him; and instances in regeneration, which is of his will, and by his word, and is the beginning and spring of all good in man, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:17">James 1:17</span>. And having mentioned the word, as a means of that grace, he gives some rules about hearing it; that it should be heard with eagerness, and received with meekness; and whatsoever is contrary thereunto should be avoided; as a forwardness to be teachers of it: wrath and anger at the doctrines of it, which do not work the righteousness of God; and all impurity and naughtiness of the mind, which must render it inattentive to it; and the rather all this should be regarded, since the word is the ingrafted word, and able to save the souls of men, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:19">James 1:19</span> and particular care should be had, that what is heard is put in practice, or otherwise it will be a self-deception; and such will be like a man that beholds his face in a glass goes away, and forgets what sort of a man he is; whereas, if a man looks into the glass of the Gospel hears the word attentively, remembers what he hears, and continues in it, he finds many blessed advantages in so doing, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:22">James 1:22</span> and then the apostle distinguishes between a vain religion, and a pure one; a vain religion is only a seeming one, and may be known to be so by a man's having no guard upon his tongue; wherefore if he thinks himself religious, he is mistaken and his heart deceived, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:26">James 1:26</span> but pure and undefiled religion, which is so in the sight of God, shows itself in a holy life and conversation in general, and particularly in visiting and assisting widows and orphans in distress, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:27">James 1:27</span>. </p>
