<p><strong>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat</strong>,.... As it is about the middle of the day, when it shines in its full strength, and its heat is very great and scorching, especially in the summer season, and in hot climates:</p>
<p><strong>but it withereth the grass</strong>; strikes it with heat, causes it to shrivel, and dries it up;</p>
<p><strong>and the flower thereof falleth</strong>; drops off from it to the ground:</p>
<p><strong>and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth</strong>; its form and colour, its glory and beauty, which were pleasant to the eye, are lost, and no more to be recovered. This shows, that earthly riches, like the flower of the field, have an outward show and glory in them, which attract the mind, and fix an attention to them for a while; they are gay and glittering, and look lovely, are pleasant to behold, and desirable to enjoy; but when the sun of persecution, or any other outward calamity arises, they are quickly destroyed, and are no more.</p>
<p><strong>So also shall the rich man fade away in his ways</strong>; riches are uncertain things now, they often make themselves wings and flee away; they are things that are not, that are not solid and substantial they are a vain show; they sometimes fade away in a man's lifetime, before he dies; and he fades away, and comes to decay, amidst all the ways and means, designs and schemes, he forms and pursues, and all the actions and business he does; and if not, when he fades away, and dies amidst all his riches, his glory does not descend after him, but falls off from him, as the flower of the field before the heat of the sun.</p>
