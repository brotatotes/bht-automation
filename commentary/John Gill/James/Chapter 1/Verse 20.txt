<p><strong>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</strong> This is so far from engaging persons to do that which is right and acceptable in the sight of God, that it puts them upon doing that which is evil. The Alexandrian copy reads, "with the wrath of men do not work the righteousness of God"; do not attend upon the word and ordinances of God with a wrathful spirit. Compare, with this, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:8">1 Timothy 2:8</span>.</p>
