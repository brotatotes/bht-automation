<p><strong>Wherefore lay apart all filthiness</strong>,.... All manner of filthiness, both of flesh and spirit; all pride, vanity, wrath, malice, and evil speaking, under hearing the word: the allusion seems to be to a boiling pot, which casts up scum and filth, which must be taken off: and such is the spirit of wrathful men; it throws up the filth of haughtiness and pride, of anger, wrath, and wickedness, which must be taken off, and laid aside; or the word will not be heard to any profit, or advantage:</p>
<p><strong>and superfluity of naughtiness</strong>, or "malice"; the abundance and overflow of it, which arises from such an evil heart, where wrath prevails, and governs: see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:1">1 Peter 2:1</span>. There seems to be an allusion to the removing of the superfluous foreskin of the flesh, in circumcision, typical</p>
<p><strong>of the foreskin of the heart</strong>, spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+4:4">Jeremiah 4:4</span> which the Targum, in that place, calls רשע לבכון, "the wickedness", or "naughtiness of your hearts" to be removed:</p>
<p><strong>and receive with meekness the ingrafted word</strong>; which becomes so when it is received; when it is put into the heart by the Spirit of God, and is mixed with faith by them that hear it; so that it is, as it were, incorporated into them, and becomes natural to them, which before was not; and taking deep root in them, brings forth much fruit: and where it comes with power, it reduces every high thought into the obedience of Christ, and makes men meek and humble; and only such receive the truth in the love of it; and to such is the Gospel preached, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span>, and none but such hear it with profit and edification:</p>
<p><strong>which is able to save your souls</strong>; even your whole persons, both soul and body: but the soul is only mentioned, as being the more excellent part of man: this must not be understood of the word, as if it was the author or cause of salvation, but as an instrument; it being a declaration of salvation by Christ, or what shows unto men the way of salvation by him; and is the power of God unto salvation to them, when it is attended with the energy of the Spirit, and the efficacy of divine grace. See <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:15">2 Timothy 3:15</span>.</p>
