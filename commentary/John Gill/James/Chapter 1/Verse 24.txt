<p><strong>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way</strong>,.... He takes a slight glance of himself, and departs:</p>
<p><strong>and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was</strong>; he forgets either his spots, blemishes, and imperfections; or his comeliness and beauty; the features of his face, be they comely or not: so a bare hearer of the word, who is not concerned to practise what he hears, while he is hearing, he observes some things amiss in himself, and some excellencies in Christ; but, when the discourse is over, he goes his way, and thinks no more of either.</p>
