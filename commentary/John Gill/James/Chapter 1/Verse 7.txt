<p><strong>For let not that man think</strong>,.... Imagine, conclude, or please himself with such thoughts,</p>
<p><strong>that he shall receive anything from the Lord</strong>; wisdom, or anything else, he is seeking after; for wanting faith, he has nothing to receive with; faith is the grace, which receives the Lord Jesus Christ himself, and all grace from him; which receives a justifying righteousness, pardon of sin, adoption of children, and even the everlasting inheritance, at least, the right unto it; wherefore those who have not faith, as the wavering man, cannot receive any thing.</p>
