<p>INTRODUCTION TO JAMES 2</p>
<p>In this chapter the apostle dissuades from a respect of persons, on account of outward circumstances; shows that the law is to be fulfilled, and that mercy is to be exercised, as well as justice done; and exposes the folly of such who boast of faith without works: he dissuades the saints from all partiality to the rich and poor, from their relation to one another, as brethren, and from their common faith, of which Christ, the Lord of glory, is the object, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1">James 2:1</span> supposes an instance of it, either in a court of judicature, or a religious assembly, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:2">James 2:2</span> and then makes an appeal unto them, and expostulates with them about it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:4">James 2:4</span> and makes use of an argument against it, taken from the divine conduct, and an instance of his grace in the choice of persons to eternal life, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:5">James 2:5</span> a conduct very different from some persons here blamed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:6">James 2:6</span>, and other arguments follow, dissuading from a respect of persons, taken from the characters of rich men, as oppressors of the poor, litigious and quarrelsome with their neighbours, and blasphemers of the name of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:7">James 2:7</span> and from the law of God, which requires the love of the neighbour, and which to fulfil is to do well, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:8">James 2:8</span> and from the breach of it, by having respect to persons, whereby its penalty is incurred, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:9">James 2:9</span> for which a reason is given; because whoever offends in one point of the law, is guilty of the whole, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:10">James 2:10</span> as is a clear case, since the same lawgiver that forbids one sin, forbids another; so that he that is guilty of either of them is a transgressor of the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:11">James 2:11</span> wherefore it is right both to speak and act according to it, since men will be judged by it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:12">James 2:12</span> and he will have no mercy shown him that has shown none to the poor, but merciful ones will escape damnation, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:13">James 2:13</span> and then the apostle argues from the unprofitableness of faith itself without works, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:14">James 2:14</span> and which he exemplifies in the case of a poor brother or sister who are wished well, but nothing given them; which good words, without deeds, are of no profit, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:15">James 2:15</span> so in like manner, faith without works is a dead faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:17">James 2:17</span> nor indeed can it be made out that a man has faith, if he has not works, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:18">James 2:18</span> at least such a faith as has justification and salvation connected with it; his faith, at most, is no better than that of the devils, who are damned, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:19">James 2:19</span> and that such a faith is a dead faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:2">James 2:2</span> and that true faith is attended with, and evidenced by works, the apostle proves by two instances; the one is that of Abraham, whose faith appeared to be genuine, and he to be a justified person, by the works he did; particularly by offering up his son Isaac; in which way his faith operated, and showed itself to be sincere and hearty; and the Scripture was fulfilled that Abraham was a believer; and had righteousness imputed to him, and was a friend of God, and a justified person, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:21">James 2:21</span> and the other instance is that of Rahab, whose faith was also shown by her works, and so a justified person, by receiving the spies with peace, and dismissing them with safety, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:25">James 2:25</span>, and then the apostle explains what he means, by saying more than once, that faith without works is dead; which he illustrates by the simile of a man's body being dead, without the spirit or soul in it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:26">James 2:26</span>. </p>
