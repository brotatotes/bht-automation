<p><strong>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</strong> It is like a lifeless carcass, a body without a soul, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:26">James 2:26</span> for as works, without faith, are dead works, so faith, without works, is a dead faith, and not like the lively hope and faith of regenerated persons: and indeed, such who have no other faith than this are dead in trespasses and sins; not that works are the life of faith, or that the life of faith lies in, and flows from works; but, as Dr. Ames observes b, good works are second acts, necessarily flowing from the life of faith; to which may be added, and by these faith appears to be living, lively and active, or such who perform them appear to be true and living believers.</p>
