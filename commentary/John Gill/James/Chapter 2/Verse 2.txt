<p><strong>For if there come unto your assembly</strong>,.... The place of religious worship where saints are assembled together for that purpose; though some think a civil court of judicature is intended, and to which the context seems to incline; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:6">James 2:6</span></p>
<p><strong>a man with a gold ring</strong>; on his finger, which shows him to be a man of dignity and wealth; so those of the senatorian and equestrian orders among the Romans were distinguished from the common people by wearing gold rings; though in time the use of them became promiscuous q; the ancients used to wear but one r, as here but one is mentioned; and only freemen, not servants, might wear it: however, by this circumstance, the apostle describes a rich man, adding,</p>
<p><strong>in goodly apparel</strong>; gay clothing, bright shining garments, glistering with gold and silver, very rich and costly, as well as whole, neat, and clean:</p>
<p><strong>and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment</strong>; mean and despicable, filthy and ragged: in the courts of judicature with the Jews, two men, who were at law with one another, might not have different apparel on while they were in court, and their cause was trying: their law runs thus s;</p>
<p>"two adversaries (at law with each other), if one of them is clothed "with precious garments", (Myrqy Mydgb, "goodly apparel",) and the other is clothed with בגדים בזויין, "vile raiment", (the judge) says to the honourable person, either clothe him as thou art, while thou contendest with him, or be clothed as he is, that ye may be alike, or on an equal foot.''</p>
