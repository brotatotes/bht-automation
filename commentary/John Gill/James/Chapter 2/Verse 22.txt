<p><strong>Seest thou how faith wrought with his works</strong>,.... Not to justify him before God; for neither faith nor works are ever said in Scripture to justify any man; but his faith being of the right kind, a faith which works by love, it put him upon doing this work, and many others; for this was done in faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:17">Hebrews 11:17</span> as all good works are, which are properly such; and where there is true faith, it will influence and engage a man to do good works, as it did Abraham.</p>
<p><strong>And by works was faith made perfect</strong>? not with an absolute perfection; for though Abraham's faith was very great, yet there were things lacking in it, and he had his fits and times of unbelief; and had he lived till now, his faith, in this sense, would not have been perfect; and he would have had reason to have used the apostle's petition, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:5">Luke 17:5</span> much less would it have been made thus perfect by works; but the sense is, that hereby his faith was declared to be sincere, unfeigned, true, and genuine; just as love is said to be perfected, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:17">1 John 4:17</span>.</p>
