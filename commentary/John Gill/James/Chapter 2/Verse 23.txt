<p><strong>And the Scripture was fulfilled</strong>,.... <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:6">Genesis 15:6</span> which speaks of Abraham's faith, and the imputation of to him for righteousness; for the above action of Abraham, in offering up his son, was a clear proof of the truth of his faith, there commended: by this it was made known what a strong faith he had in God, and what reason there was to believe that he was a justified person.</p>
<p><strong>Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness</strong>;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:6- :">Genesis 15:6- :</span> which shows both that Abraham was justified before he wrought this work, and therefore that could not be the cause or matter of his justification, but only an effect and evidence of it; and that his justification was by faith, or that object which his faith regarded, and had to do with, was his justifying righteousness:</p>
<p><strong>and he was called the friend of God</strong>, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+20:7">2 Chronicles 20:7</span> he was loved by God with an everlasting love, who showed acts of friendship to him; called him by his grace, and blessed him with spiritual blessings, and increased him with the increase of God; favoured him with near communion with him, honoured him with high characters, and distinguished him by peculiar marks of his favour, and reckoned his enemies and friends as his own; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:8">Genesis 12:8</span> and Abraham, on the other hand, loved God, and showed himself friendly to him; trusted in him, and believed every word of his; readily complied with his will, and not only yielded a cheerful obedience to his commands, but enjoined his children after him to observe them: this was a name which Abraham was well known by among the eastern nations; hence he is called by the Mahometans, חליל אללה, "Khalil Allah", the friend of God; and Mahomet says himself c,</p>
<p>"God took Abraham for his friend.''</p>
