<p><strong>For as the body without the spirit is dead</strong>,.... This simile is made use of to illustrate what the apostle had asserted in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:17">James 2:17</span> that as a body, when the spirit or soul is departed from it, or the breath is gone out of it, is dead, and without motion, and useless; which the Jews d express in like manner,</p>
<p>פגר גוף בלא רוח, "the body without the spirit", or "breath, is a carcass".</p>
<p><strong>So faith without works is dead also</strong>: a vain thing, useless and unprofitable, can neither justify, nor save, nor prove that a man is justified, or will be saved.</p>
<p>d Ohel. Moed, fol. 15. 1.</p>
