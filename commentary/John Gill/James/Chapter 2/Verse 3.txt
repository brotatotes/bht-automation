<p><strong>And ye have respect to him that wears the gay clothing</strong>,.... Take notice of him, and show favour to him, to the neglect and contempt of the other. This is an instance of respect of persons condemned and dissuaded from:</p>
<p><strong>and say unto him, sit thou here in a good place</strong>; the best place; whether it be in a religious assembly, or in a civil court of judicature:</p>
<p><strong>and say to the poor, stand thou there</strong>; or in a lower and meaner place:</p>
<p><strong>or sit thou here under my footstool</strong>; this also was contrary to the Jewish canons t, that one should sit, and another stand, while their cause was trying; the law runs thus:</p>
<p>"one shall not sit, and another stand, but both shall stand; but if the sanhedrim, or court, please to let them sit, they sit; but one does not sit above, and the other below; but one by the side of the other.''</p>
