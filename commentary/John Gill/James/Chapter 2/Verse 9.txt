<p><strong>But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin</strong>, c] This is not doing well, but is a transgression of the law, as every sin is hence it follows,</p>
<p><strong>and are convinced of the law as transgressors</strong>; which carries on a formal process against such persons; it accuses them of sin, and charges them with it; it proves it upon them, and convicts them of it; it pronounces them guilty, and curses them for it; and passes the sentence of condemnation and death upon them; wherefore care should be taken not to commit this sin, and so fall under the convictions and reproofs of the law.</p>
