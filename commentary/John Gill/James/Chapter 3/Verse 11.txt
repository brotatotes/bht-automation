Doth a fountain send forth at the same place,.... "Or hole"; for at divers places, and at different times, as Pliny m observes, it may send forthsweet [water] and bitter: and it is reported n, there is a lake with the Trogloditae, a people in Ethiopia, which becomes thrice a day bitter, and then as often sweet; but then it does not yield sweet water and bitter at the same time: this simile is used to show how unnatural it is that blessing and cursing should proceed out of the same mouth.m Nat.
