<p><strong>Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries</strong>?.... Every tree bears fruit, according to its kind; a fig tree produces figs, and an olive tree olive berries; a fig tree does not produce olive berries, or an olive tree figs; and neither of them both:</p>
<p><strong>either a vine, figs</strong>? or fig trees, grapes; or either of them, figs and grapes:</p>
<p><strong>so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh</strong>. The Alexandrian copy reads, "neither can the salt water yield sweet water"; that is, the sea cannot yield sweet or fresh water: the Syriac version renders it, "neither can salt water be made sweet": but naturalists say, it may be made sweet, by being strained through sand: the design of these similes is to observe how absurd a thing it is that a man should both bless and curse with his tongue.</p>
