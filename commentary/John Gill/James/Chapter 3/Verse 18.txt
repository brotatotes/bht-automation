<p><strong>And the fruit of righteousness</strong>,.... Which is either eternal life, which is the fruit of Christ's righteousness, and shall be enjoyed by all those who are justified by it; and who, in consequence of it, through the grace of God, live soberly, righteously, and godly; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:22">Romans 6:22</span> or else what is enjoyed in this life, as the fruit and effect of a righteous and holy conversation, which is peace of conscience; and may be truly called the peaceable fruit of righteousness; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+32:17">Isaiah 32:17</span></p>
<p><strong>is sown in peace of them that make peace</strong>; that is, either such as are possessed of that wisdom which is peaceable, and makes them so; that peace which they make, pursue after, exercise, and maintain, is a seed, which, being sown by them, will, in the issue, be followed with eternal happiness and felicity; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:9">Matthew 5:9</span> or such who live a godly life and conversation, and are filled with the fruits of righteousness, and, among the rest, with this of making and preserving peace among men, shall enjoy, as what will spring up from such good seed sown, much conscience peace and spiritual pleasure of mind: righteousness and peace promise a large and comfortable harvest both here and hereafter.</p>
