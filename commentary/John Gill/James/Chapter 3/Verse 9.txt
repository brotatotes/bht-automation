<p><strong>Therewith bless we God, even, the Father</strong>,.... Of Jesus Christ, and of spirits, and of mercies: this is the instrument that is used in blessing God daily every meal that is eaten; and in joining with the saints, though only verbally and outwardly, in blessing God for all spiritual blessings in Christ, both in prayer, and in singing psalms:</p>
<p><strong>and therewith curse we men</strong>: make imprecations, and wish evils upon them:</p>
<p><strong>which are made after the similitude of God</strong> as man was originally, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> and though sin has greatly defaced it, yet there are still some remains of it: and now, what an absurd and monstrous thing is this, that one and the same instrument should be used in blessing God, the Father of all creatures, and in cursing his children, his offering, as all men are by creation, and bear some resemblance to him.</p>
