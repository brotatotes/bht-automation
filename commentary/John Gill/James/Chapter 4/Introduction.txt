<p>INTRODUCTION TO JAMES 4</p>
<p>In this chapter the apostle gives the true cause of contentions and strifes; and cautions against intemperance, covetousness, pride, detraction, and vain confidence. Having, in the latter part of the preceding chapter, inveighed against strife and contention, he here shows from whence they spring, from a covetous desire of riches and honour; and which yet are not obtained, because they did not ask these things of God with submission to his will; or they asked with a wrong view, namely, to gratify their lusts, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:1">James 4:1</span> and he dissuades from such unlawful desires, partly because they were no other than adultery; and partly because indulging them was declaring themselves enemies of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:4">James 4:4</span> and he deters from pride, under the name of envy, proud men being generally envious; from the sense of the Scripture, which says, not in vain, that the spirit lusts unto it; and from the consequence of it, such as are proud being resisted by the Lord, when he gives more grace to humble ones, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:5">James 4:5</span> hence follow several exhortations, and various duties relating to humility; as to submit to God, and resist the devil, encouraged thereunto by this motive, he will flee, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:7">James 4:7</span>, to draw nigh to God in a way of religious worship, who will draw nigh in a way of grace to his people; to purity of action, and of heart, or to that which is outward and inward, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:8">James 4:8</span> to be humbled, mourn, and weep, instead of joy and laughter, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:9">James 4:9</span> to lie low before the Lord, who will raise such up, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:10">James 4:10</span> and not to speak evil of anyone, since this is judging a brother; nay, a speaking evil of the law, and a judging of that; which is to invade the prerogative of God, the lawgiver, who is able to save, and to destroy; and therefore one man should not take upon him to judge another, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:11">James 4:11</span> and as another instance of great neglect of God, and his providence, and disrespect unto it, the apostle takes notice of a common practice among men, and even professors of religion, who resolve to go to such a place, and continue so long, and there make merchandise, and promise themselves success; not considering what frail short lived creatures they are, and how much all depends upon the will of God; and which they should consider, submit to, and be determined by, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:13">James 4:13</span> and he reproves them for their boastings and joy in them, as evil, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:16">James 4:16</span>, and observes, that it is not enough to know what is right and good, unless it is done; and that such knowledge is but an aggravation of the evil of sin committed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:17">James 4:17</span>. </p>
