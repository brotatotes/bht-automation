<p><strong>But now ye rejoice in your boastings</strong>,.... Of tomorrow, and of the continuance of life, and of going to such a place, and abiding there for such a time, and of trading and trafficking with great success, to the obtaining of much gain and riches; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+27:1">Proverbs 27:1</span></p>
<p><strong>all such rejoicing is evil</strong>; wicked and atheistical, as expressing a neglect of and independence on Providence; arrogating and ascribing too much to themselves, their power and will, as if they had their lives and fortunes in their own hands, and at their own dispose, when all depend upon the will of God. The Syriac version renders it, "all such rejoicing is from evil"; from an evil heart, and from the evil one, Satan.</p>
