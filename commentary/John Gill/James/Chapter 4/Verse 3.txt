<p><strong>Ye ask, and receive not</strong>,.... Some there were that did ask of God the blessings of his goodness and providence, and yet these were not bestowed on them; the reason was,</p>
<p><strong>because ye ask amiss</strong>; not in the faith of a divine promise; nor with thankfulness for past mercies; nor with submission to the will of God; nor with a right end, to do good to others, and to make use of what might be bestowed, for the honour of God, and the interest of Christ: but</p>
<p><strong>that ye may consume it upon your lusts</strong>; indulge to intemperance and luxury; as the man that had much goods laid up for many years did, to the neglect of his own soul, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:19">Luke 12:19</span> or the rich man, who spent all upon his back and his belly, and took no notice of Lazarus at his gate; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:19">Luke 16:19</span>.</p>
