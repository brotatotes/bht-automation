<p><strong>And the prayer of faith shall save the sick</strong>,.... That is, the prayer of the elders, being put up in faith by them, and in which the sick person joins by faith; such a prayer is a means of bringing down from God a blessing on the sick man, and of restoring him to his former health:</p>
<p><strong>and the Lord shall raise him up</strong>; from his bed of sickness, on which he is laid, and bring him forth to praise his name, and to fear and glorify him.</p>
<p><strong>And if he have committed sins</strong>; not that it is a question whether he has or not, for no man lives without sin, nor the commission of it; but the sense is, if he has been guilty of any sins, which God in particular has taken notice of, and on account of which he has laid his chastising hand upon him, in order to bring him to a sense of them, and to acknowledge them; which is sometimes the case, though not always, at the same time that his bodily health is restored:</p>
<p><strong>they shall be forgiven him</strong>; he shall have a discovery, and an application of pardoning grace to him: and indeed the removing the sickness or disease may be called the forgiveness of his sins, which is sometimes the sense of this phrase in Scripture, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:34">1 Kings 8:34</span>.</p>
