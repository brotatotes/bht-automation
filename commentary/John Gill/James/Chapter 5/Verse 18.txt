<p><strong>And he prayed again</strong>,.... <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:42">1 Kings 18:42</span>. Here also is no express mention of his prayer, but it may be concluded from his gestures; and so the Jewish interpreters understand these words, "Elijah went up to the top of Carmel", להתפלל, "to pray, and he cast himself down upon the earth", להתפלל על הגשמים, "to pray for rain; and he put his face between his knees", והתפלל, "and prayed, and said to his servant, go up now, look toward the sea"; and this he said while he was בתפילתו, "in his prayers" i: and the effect of this his prayer was,</p>
<p><strong>and the heaven gave rain</strong>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:45">1 Kings 18:45</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And the earth brought forth her fruit</strong>: which for the years past it had not; hence there was a sore famine in the land, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:2">1 Kings 18:2</span>. Now the apostle chose to give this example, because it was a common thing for the Jews to ask for rain: we often read of such a doctor, that he prayed for rain, and it came; and of another, that he asked for the rains, and they descended k: and his view is to observe, that the weakness and infirmities of the saints ought not to discourage them from prayer; and that they should be earnest and fervent in it, as was Elias, a man of like passions with themselves.</p>
