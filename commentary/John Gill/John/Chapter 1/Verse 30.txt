Either the day before, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:27">John 1:27</span>, or some time before that, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span>, when he first began to baptize, even before Christ came to be baptized by him, and before he personally knew him; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>.</p>
<p><strong>After me cometh a man</strong>; not a mere man, but the man God's fellow: and this is said, not because he was now a grown man, or to show the truth of his human nature; but seems to be a common Hebraism, and is all one as if it had been said, "after me cometh one", or a certain person: for the sense of this phrase, and what follows,</p>
<p><strong>see Gill "Joh 1:15"</strong>.</p>
