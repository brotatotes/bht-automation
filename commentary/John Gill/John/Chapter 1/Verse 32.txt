<p><strong>And John bare record</strong>,.... The same day that he said the above things, and at the same time:</p>
<p><strong>saying, I saw the Spirit</strong>; that is, of God, as is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span> and which Nonnus here expresses; and the Ethiopic version reads, "the Holy Ghost",</p>
<p><strong>descending from heaven like a dove</strong>; at the time of his baptism;</p>
<p><strong>see Gill "Mt 3:16"</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>And it abode upon him</strong>; for some time; so long as that John had a full sight of it, and so was capable of giving a perfect account of it, and bearing a certain and distinct testimony to it.</p>
