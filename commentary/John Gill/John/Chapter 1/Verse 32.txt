And John bare record,.... The same day that he said the above things, and at the same time:saying, I saw the Spirit; that is, of God, as is said in Matthew 3:16 and which Nonnus here expresses; and the Ethiopic version reads, "the Holy Ghost",descending from heaven like a dove; at the time of his baptism;see Gill "Mt 3:16".And it abode upon him; for some time; so long as that John had a full sight of it, and so was capable of giving a perfect account of it, and bearing a certain and distinct testimony to it.
