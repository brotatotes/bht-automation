<p><strong>And I knew him not</strong>,.... That is, before he came to be baptized by him; when it was secretly suggested to him who he was, and the following signal was given him, to confirm him in it:</p>
<p><strong>but he that sent me to baptize with water</strong>; or "in water"; that is, God; for John's mission was from God, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:6">John 1:6</span>, and his baptism from heaven; he had a divine warrant and commission for what he did:</p>
<p><strong>the same said unto me</strong>; either by an articulate voice, or by a divine impulse on his mind, or by the revelation of the Spirit:</p>
<p><strong>upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost</strong>; that is, the Messiah; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:6- :">John 1:6- :</span>,</p>
