<p><strong>And I saw</strong>,.... The Spirit descending from heaven as a dove, and lighting upon Jesus, and remaining some time on him; this he saw with his bodily eyes:</p>
<p><strong>and bore record</strong>; at the same time, before all the people that were with him, when he baptized Jesus:</p>
<p><strong>that this is the Son of God</strong>; the natural, essential, and eternal Son of God; who being sent in the fulness of time, had assumed an human nature, in which he became subject to all ordinances, and had the Spirit without measure bestowed on him; and which was an evidence who he was, and of what he came about.</p>
