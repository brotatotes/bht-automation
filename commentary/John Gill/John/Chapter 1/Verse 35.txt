<p><strong>Again, the next day after</strong>,.... The third day from the priests and Levites having been with John, to know who he was. The Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions, leave out the word "again":</p>
<p><strong>John stood, and two of his disciples</strong>; one of these was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:40">John 1:40</span> and very likely the other was the Evangelist John, the writer of this Gospel, who always chooses to conceal himself. John the Baptist stood, and these disciples by him, in some certain place near Jordan, where he was preaching and baptizing.</p>
