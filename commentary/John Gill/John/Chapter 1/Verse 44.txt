Now Philip was of Bethsaida,.... A town on the lake of Gennesaret, afterwards made a city by Philip the tetrarch, and called Julias, after the name of Caesar's daughter m: it was a fishing town, and had its name from thence; and the disciples that were of it, were of this business:the city of Andrew and Peter; or "Simon", as read the Syriac and Persic versions: three apostles were called out of this place, as mean, and wicked, as it was; see Matthew 11:21; which was no small honour to it: it is a saying of the Jews n, that"a man's place (his native place) does not honour him, but a man honours his place.''This was the case here.m Joseph.
