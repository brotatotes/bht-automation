<p><strong>Now Philip was of Bethsaida</strong>,.... A town on the lake of Gennesaret, afterwards made a city by Philip the tetrarch, and called Julias, after the name of Caesar's daughter m: it was a fishing town, and had its name from thence; and the disciples that were of it, were of this business:</p>
<p><strong>the city of Andrew and Peter</strong>; or "Simon", as read the Syriac and Persic versions: three apostles were called out of this place, as mean, and wicked, as it was; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:21">Matthew 11:21</span>; which was no small honour to it: it is a saying of the Jews n, that</p>
<p>"a man's place (his native place) does not honour him, but a man honours his place.''</p>
<p>This was the case here.</p>
