<p><strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you</strong>,.... To the Scribes and Pharisees, who had taken it ill that they should be thought to be blind; and who had cast out the man that Christ had cured of blindness, for speaking in favour of him; and who had traduced Christ as an impostor, and a deceiver, and set up themselves to be the shepherds of the flock, and the guides and rulers of the people; all which occasion the following parable; the design of which is to show, that Christ is the true and only shepherd, who was appointed, called, and sent of God, whose the sheep are, whose voice they hear, and know, and whom they follow; and that they, the Scribes and Pharisees, were thieves and robbers, and not shepherds of the flock; who were not sent of God, nor did they come in at the right door, but in another way, and usurped a domination, which did not belong to them.</p>
<p><strong>He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold</strong>: the sheepfold, with the Jews, was called דיר; and this, as their writers say o, was an enclosure sometimes in the manner of a building, and made of stone, and sometimes was fenced with reeds, and in it was a large door, at which the shepherd went in and out, when he led in, or brought out the sheep. At tithing, which was done in the sheepfold, they made a little door, so that two lambs could not come out together; and to this enclosure is the allusion here; and by the "sheepfold" is meant the church of God; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:16">John 10:16</span>; and a good fold it is, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:14">Ezekiel 34:14</span>. The church may be compared to a sheepfold, because it is separated from the world: it is where the people of God, and sheep of Christ are gathered together; where there is a strict union between them; have society with each other; keep one another warm and comfortable; and where they are fed and nourished, and are preserved; and where they lie down and have rest; and which, like a sheepfold, will be taken down, and not always continue in the form it now is: and by "the door" into it, is meant Christ himself, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:7">John 10:7</span>; faith in him, a profession of him, and authority from him. Now he that does not come into the church of God, whether as a member of it, or officer in it, at this door,</p>
<p><strong>but climbeth up some other way</strong>; by hypocrisy and deceit: or, like the prophets of old, who ran and were not sent; prophesied when they were not spoken to, but took their place and post by usurpation:</p>
<p><strong>the same is a thief and a robber</strong>; steals into the church, or into an office in it, and robs God or Christ of their power and authority; and such were the Scribes and Pharisees: the Persic version renders the words, "whoever does not introduce the sheep through the door of the sheepfold, know that that man is a thief and a robber"; which these men were so far from doing, that they would not suffer those that were entering to go in, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:13">Matthew 23:13</span>. The difference between a thief and a robber, with the Jews, was, that the former took away a man's property privately, and the latter openly p.</p>
