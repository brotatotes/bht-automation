<p><strong>The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling</strong>,.... And has no propriety in the sheep; had he, he would abide by them, and defend them; but because he has not, he will not expose himself to any danger, but leaves them:</p>
<p><strong>and careth not for the sheep</strong>; what becomes of them, providing only for his own safety. Abarbinel y has a note on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:11">Isaiah 40:11</span> which may serve to illustrate this passage:</p>
<p>""he shall feed his flock like a shepherd"; not as he that feeds the flock of others, for the hire they give him, but as a shepherd that feeds his own flock; who has compassion more abundantly on it, because it is his own flock; and therefore he saith, "behold his reward is with him", for he does not seek a reward from another; "and his work is before him"; for he feeds what is his own, and therefore his eyes and his heart are there.''</p>
<p>Which is not the case of the hireling; he does not care for them, he has not their good at heart; but the good shepherd has, such an one as Christ is.</p>
<p>y Mashmia Jeshua, fol. 20. 4.</p>
