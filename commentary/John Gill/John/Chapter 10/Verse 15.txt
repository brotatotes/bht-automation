<p><strong>As the Father knoweth me</strong>,.... These words, with what follow, are in connection with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:14">John 10:14</span>; and the sense is, that the mutual knowledge of Christ, and his sheep, is like that which his Father and he have of each other. The Father knows Christ as his own Son, and loves him as such, in the most strong and affectionate manner; and has entrusted him with the persons, grace, and glory, of all his people:</p>
<p><strong>even so know I the Father</strong>; or rather, "and I know the Father"; as he needs must, since he lay in his bosom, and still does, and knows his nature, perfections, purposes, and his whole mind and will; and loves him most ardently, which he has shown by his coming down from heaven, to do his will; and trusts in him for the accomplishment of everything he promised unto him:</p>
<p><strong>and I lay down my life for the sheep</strong>; which proves him to be the good shepherd, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>. The Vulgate Latin version reads, "for my sheep"; which were his, by the Father's gift, and for no other has he laid down his life. The Ethiopic version, as before, renders it, or rather explains it, "I lay down my life for the redemption of my sheep".</p>
