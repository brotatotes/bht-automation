<p><strong>But he that entereth in by the door</strong>,.... With a divine commission, and by a divine authority, who comes not of himself, but is sent; does not take the honour to himself, or thrust in himself, and assume an office to himself, but is called unto it, and invested in it, he</p>
<p><strong>is the shepherd of the sheep</strong>; by whom Christ means himself, as is evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>, whose the sheep are, and who takes care of them, and feeds them, as a shepherd does his flock; and which holds true of any under shepherd, having his mission and commission, and deriving his authority from Christ.</p>
