<p><strong>And Jesus walked in the temple</strong>,.... To keep himself warm, and to secure him the better from the inclemency of the weather:</p>
<p><strong>in Solomon's porch</strong>; which was covered over, and the outside of it was enclosed with a wall, which made it very convenient for such a purpose: this was on the outside of the temple eastward, and was a very magnificent structure: the account Josephus n gives of it is this;</p>
<p>"there was a porch without the temple, overlooking a deep valley, supported by walls of four hundred cubits, made of four square stone, very white; the length of each stone was twenty cubits, and the breadth six; the work of king Solomon, who first founded the whole temple.''</p>
<p>Now, though this was not the porch that was built by Solomon, yet as it was built on the same spot, and in imitation of it, it bore his name; mention is made of it in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:11">Acts 3:11</span>.</p>
<p>n Antiqu. l. 20. c. 8. sect. 7.</p>
