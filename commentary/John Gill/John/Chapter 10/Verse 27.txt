My sheep hear my voice,.... The voice of Christ in his Gospel, both externally and internally;  :-, :-; and since therefore these Jews did not, it was a plain case they were not of his sheep:and I know them;  :-; but Christ knew not these as the elect of God, or as the Father's gift to him, and therefore they could not be his sheep:and they follow me; both in the exercise of grace, and in the discharge of duty, and whithersoever he the good shepherd leads them;  :-, :-. But now, whereas these Jews did not follow Christ, but turned their backs on him, and rejected him, it was notorious that they were none of his sheep; but both happy and safe are those persons, that are the sheep of Christ, as appears from what is next said of them.
