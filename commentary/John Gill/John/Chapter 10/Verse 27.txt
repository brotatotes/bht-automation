<p><strong>My sheep hear my voice</strong>,.... The voice of Christ in his Gospel, both externally and internally; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; and since therefore these Jews did not, it was a plain case they were not of his sheep:</p>
<p><strong>and I know them</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; but Christ knew not these as the elect of God, or as the Father's gift to him, and therefore they could not be his sheep:</p>
<p><strong>and they follow me</strong>; both in the exercise of grace, and in the discharge of duty, and whithersoever he the good shepherd leads them; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. But now, whereas these Jews did not follow Christ, but turned their backs on him, and rejected him, it was notorious that they were none of his sheep; but both happy and safe are those persons, that are the sheep of Christ, as appears from what is next said of them.</p>
