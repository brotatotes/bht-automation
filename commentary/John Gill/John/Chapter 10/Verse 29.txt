<p><strong>My Father which gave [them] me</strong>,.... So the sheep came to be Christ's, and to be in his hand; the Father gave them to him, put them into his hands, and made them his care and charge:</p>
<p><strong>is greater than all</strong>; than all gods, than all beings, than all creatures, angels and men, and than all the enemies of his people; this must be allowed: the Vulgate Latin version, and so some of the ancients read, "what my Father gave to me, is greater than all"; meaning, that the church given to him, and built on him, is stronger than all its enemies:</p>
<p><strong>and none is able to pluck [them] out of my Father's hand</strong>; so that these sheep have a double security; they are in the hands of Christ, and they are in the hands of the Father of Christ; wherefore could it be thought, which ought not to be, that they could be plucked out of Christ's hands, yet it can never be imagined, that any can pluck them out of the hands of God the Father; and there is no more reason to think that they can be plucked out of the hands of the one, than there is that they can be plucked out of the hands of the other, as is clear from what follows in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:30">John 10:30</span>; see the Apocrypha:</p>
<p>"But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them.'' (Wisdom 3:1)</p>
