<p><strong>If I do not the works of my Father</strong>,.... Not only what the Father had given him to finish, and which he wrought by him as man, but such as were as great as the Father had done, and were equal to them; and which could not be done by any, but by the Father, or by one that is equal with him:</p>
<p><strong>believe me not</strong>: Christ appeals to his miracles as proofs of his deity, sonship, and Messiahship, and desires no other credit than what they demand; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:3">Matthew 11:3</span>.</p>
