<p><strong>into the place where John at first baptized</strong>; that is, Bethabara, where he baptized before he was at Aenon, near Salim, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:28">John 1:28</span>, and was the place where Christ himself was baptized, and where John bore such a testimony of him:</p>
<p><strong>and there he abode</strong>; how long is not certain, perhaps till he went to Bethany, on account of raising Lazarus from the dead.</p>
