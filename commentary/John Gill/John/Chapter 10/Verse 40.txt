Where he had been before; and whither he went; not merely for the security of his person, much less to indulge himself in ease, but to preach the Gospel, work miracles, and bring many souls to believe on him, as did: and he wentinto the place where John at first baptized; that is, Bethabara, where he baptized before he was at Aenon, near Salim, John 1:28, and was the place where Christ himself was baptized, and where John bore such a testimony of him:and there he abode; how long is not certain, perhaps till he went to Bethany, on account of raising Lazarus from the dead.
