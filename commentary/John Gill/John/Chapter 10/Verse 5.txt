And a stranger will they not follow,.... One that knows not Christ, is not sent by him, and who does not preach him:but will flee from him; shun him and his ministry, as not only disagreeable, but dangerous:for they know not the voice of strangers: they do not approve of their doctrine, nor take any delight in it, or receive any profit from it. The Persic version, as before, reads, "neither will the lambs ever go after strange sheep, and if they see [them], they will flee [from them]".
