<p><strong>This parable spake Jesus unto them</strong>,.... To the Pharisees, who were with him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:40">John 9:40</span>;</p>
<p><strong>but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them</strong>; the things spoken by him being delivered in a parabolical way, though in lively figures, and in terms plain and easy to be understood; yet what through the blindness of their minds, and the hardness of their hearts, and their prejudices in favour of themselves, and against Christ, they did not understand what were meant by them; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:13">Matthew 13:13</span>.</p>
