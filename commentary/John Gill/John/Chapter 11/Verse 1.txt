<p><strong>Now a certain man was sick</strong>,.... Very likely of a fever; Nonnus calls it a morbid fire, a hot and burning disease:</p>
<p><strong>[named] Lazarus of Bethany</strong>; for his name, which the Ethiopic version reads "Eleazar", and the Persic version "Gazarus",</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; and for the place Bethany, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The town of Mary and her sister Martha</strong>; where they were both born, as well as Lazarus, or at least where they dwelt; of the former, some account is, given in the next verse, and of the latter,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
