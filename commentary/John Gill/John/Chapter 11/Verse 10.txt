But if a man walk in the night,.... After the sun is set, and there is no light in the air and heavens to direct him:he stumbleth; at everything that lies in the way,because there is no light in him; there being none from above communicated to him. So our Lord suggests, that when the time of his death was come, he should then fall a prey into the hands of his enemies, but till then he should walk safe and secure; nor had he anything to fear from them, and therefore could go into Judea again, with intrepidity and unconcern.
