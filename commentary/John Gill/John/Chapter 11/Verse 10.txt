<p><strong>But if a man walk in the night</strong>,.... After the sun is set, and there is no light in the air and heavens to direct him:</p>
<p><strong>he stumbleth</strong>; at everything that lies in the way,</p>
<p><strong>because there is no light in him</strong>; there being none from above communicated to him. So our Lord suggests, that when the time of his death was come, he should then fall a prey into the hands of his enemies, but till then he should walk safe and secure; nor had he anything to fear from them, and therefore could go into Judea again, with intrepidity and unconcern.</p>
