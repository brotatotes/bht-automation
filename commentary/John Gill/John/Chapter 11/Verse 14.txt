<p><strong>Then said Jesus unto them plainly</strong>,.... Without a figure, when he perceived they did not understand him, and yet it was a very easy and usual metaphor which he had made use of; but such was the present stupidity of their minds, that they did not take in his meaning: wherefore, without reproaching them with it, he said to them in so many words,</p>
<p><strong>Lazarus is dead</strong>. The Persic version reads, "Lazarus is dead indeed", as he really was.</p>
