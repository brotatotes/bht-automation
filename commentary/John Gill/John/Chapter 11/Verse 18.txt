<p><strong>Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem</strong>,.... Which was a reason why them were so many of the Jews come there to condole the two sisters upon the death of their brother; and by this means the following miracle became more known there: it was</p>
<p><strong>about fifteen furlongs off</strong>; that is, about two miles, for seven furlongs and a half made a Jewish mile, as appears from one of their canons c, which runs thus:</p>
<p>"they do not spread nets for doves, except it be distant from an habitable place, שלשים ריס, "thirty furlongs";''</p>
<p>which the commentators say d are "four miles": and still more expressly it is said e, that</p>
<p>"between Jerusalem and Zuck, (the place where the scape goat was had,) there were ten tents, and ninety furlongs, שבעה ומחצה לכל מיל "seven and a half to every mile".''</p>
<p>Hence a furlong was called one seventh and a half of a mile f, which was 266 cubits, and two thirds of one.</p>
