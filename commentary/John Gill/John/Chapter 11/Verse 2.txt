<p><strong>It was [that] Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment</strong>,.... Not the woman in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:37">Luke 7:37</span>, as some have thought, whose name is not mentioned, and which history is not related by John at all: but Mary in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:3">John 12:3</span>, who is both mentioned by name, and along with Lazarus her brother, and with whom all the circumstances of the affair suit; and though the fact was not yet done, yet John writing many years after it was done, and when it was well known, proleptically, and in a parenthesis, takes notice of it here:</p>
<p><strong>and wiped his feet with her hair</strong>; instead of a napkin, after she had anointed them with oil; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:3- :">John 12:3- :</span>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:3- :">John 12:3- :</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Whose brother Lazarus was sick</strong>; this is observed, to show how well they were all acquainted with Christ, and affected to him.</p>
