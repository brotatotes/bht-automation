<p><strong>She saith unto him, yea, Lord</strong>,.... That is, she firmly believed all that he said concerning himself, and the happiness of those that believed in him: and for the confirmation of it adds,</p>
<p><strong>I believe</strong>: or "I have believed", as the Vulgate Latin version renders it; that is, long ago, ever since she knew him:</p>
<p><strong>that thou art the Christ the Son of God, which should come into the world</strong>; that he was the true Messiah, and the proper and natural Son of God, of the same nature with God, equal to him, having the same perfections with him; and who was long promised, much prophesied of, and greatly expected to come into the world; and was now come into the world by the assumption of human nature, to work out salvation for his people, and therefore, since she believed all this of him, she must believe that he was able to raise the dead to life, and to secure those that believe in him from dying eternally.</p>
