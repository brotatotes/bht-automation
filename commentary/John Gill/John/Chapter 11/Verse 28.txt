<p><strong>And when she had so said</strong>,.... Had expressed her faith in Christ in such terms, as the apostles themselves did, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:16">Matthew 16:16</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:49">John 1:49</span>.</p>
<p><strong>She went her way</strong>; from Christ, being ordered by him to go to her sister Mary, and fetch her to him:</p>
<p><strong>and called Mary her sister secretly</strong>; either beckoned her to come to her, or whispered her in the ear privately, as Nonnus paraphrases it, that the Jews, who were enemies to Christ, might not hear:</p>
<p><strong>saying, the master is come</strong>; near the town; is not a great way off: she might use the phrase, "the master", for greater privacy, that should she be overheard, it would not be who she meant; and because it was an usual appellation by which Christ was called in that family, and by which he was well known; and was expressive of honour to him, and subjection in them as his disciples:</p>
<p><strong>and calleth for thee</strong>; to come to him; Christ asked after her, desired to see her, and ordered her to come to him; which was an instance of his respect for her.</p>
