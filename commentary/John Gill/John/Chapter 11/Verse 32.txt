<p><strong>Then when Mary was come where Jesus was</strong>,.... Where Martha met him, and where she left him. Travellers tell us, that close by a well, about a stone's cast out of the town of Bethany, is showed the place where Martha met our Lord when he came to raise Lazarus, and where Mary, being called also, met him; but this is not to be depended on, nor is it of any moment to know it. It is blessed meeting Christ any where; and where he is preached, and his ordinances administered, let it be in what place it will, there may the presence of Christ be expected; and it is an encouragement to go there where others have met with him: Martha had been here before, and had had some conversation with Christ to her great satisfaction, and she goes and calls her sister, that she might enjoy the same: so souls that have met with Jesus under such a ministry, in such a place, invite others to go thither also; and often it is that this is a means, in providence, of finding Christ, and enjoying communion with him.</p>
<p><strong>And saw him, she fell down at his feet</strong>; in great respect to him, and reverence of him, worshipping him as her Lord and God.</p>
<p><strong>Saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died</strong>; which were the same words Martha uttered upon her first meeting Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:21">John 11:21</span>; and it is very likely that they had often expressed themselves in such language one to another, saying to each other, if our Lord Jesus had been but here, our dear brother Lazarus would not have died.</p>
