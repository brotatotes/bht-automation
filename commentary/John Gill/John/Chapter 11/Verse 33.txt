<p><strong>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping</strong>,.... At his feet, who, for sorrow and grief of heart, could say no more to him; but having expressed these words, burst out into floods of tears:</p>
<p><strong>and the Jews also weeping, which came with her</strong>; either through sympathy with her, or hypocritically:</p>
<p><strong>he groaned in the spirit</strong>; in his human soul; and which shows, that he had a real human soul, subject to passions, though sinless ones. The word signifies an inward motion of the mind, through indignation and anger; and it may be partly at the weakness of Mary's faith, and at her immoderate sorrow; and partly at the hypocrisy of the Jews: or else this inward groaning was through grief, sympathizing with Mary, and her friends, his human soul being touched with a fellow feeling of their griefs and sorrows:</p>
<p><strong>and was troubled</strong>; or troubled himself; threw himself into some forms and gestures of sorrow, and mourning, as lifting up his eyes, wringing his hands, and changing the form of his countenance.</p>
