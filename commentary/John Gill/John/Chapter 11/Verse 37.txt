<p><strong>And some of them said</strong>,.... Who were averse to him, and bore him a secret grudge, and were willing to put the worst construction on every action of his:</p>
<p><strong>could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind</strong>; as it is said, at least pretended, that he did, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:6">John 9:6</span>, for this must be understood as calling the miracle into question, and as a sneer upon it, and not as taking it for granted that so it was; and even supposing that, it is mentioned to his reproach, since if so, he might</p>
<p><strong>have caused that, even this man should not died</strong>: for either the above cure was a sham, or, if it was a real thing, he who did that could have prevented Lazarus's death; and if he could, and would not, where is his friendship? and what must be thought of all this show of affection to him? and what are these tears, but crocodile ones? but this reasoning, as specious as it may seem, was very fallacious; for he that cured the man born blind could raise Lazarus from the dead, which he intended; and therefore did not prevent his death, that he might still give more joy to the family, bring more glory to God, and himself, and more shame and confusion to his enemies.</p>
