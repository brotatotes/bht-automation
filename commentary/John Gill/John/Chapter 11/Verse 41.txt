<p><strong>Then they took away the stone</strong>,.... "From the door of the sepulchre", as the Arabic version adds;</p>
<p><strong>from the place where the dead was laid</strong>: this clause is left out in the Alexandrian copy, and in the Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions:</p>
<p><strong>and Jesus lift up his eyes</strong>; to heaven; this is a praying gesture, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span>,</p>
<p><strong>and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me</strong>; which cannot refer to the resurrection of Lazarus from the dead, or to any assistance given him in performing that miracle, because that as yet was not done; and when it was done, was done by his own power, as all the circumstances of it show; but it relates to everything in which he had before heard him, and was a foundation for him, as man, to believe he still would, in whatever was to come; and particularly to the present opportunity of showing his power in so remarkable a manner, and before so many witnesses.</p>
