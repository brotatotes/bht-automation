<p><strong>And I knew that thou hearest me always</strong>,.... Which was not only a support to the faith of Christ, as man, but is also to his people, whose advocate, intercessor, and mediator he is.</p>
<p><strong>But because of the people which stand by, I said [it]</strong>; that he was heard, and always heard by God; and, therefore must have great interest in his affection, and knowledge of his will; yea, their wills must be the same:</p>
<p><strong>that they may believe that thou hast sent me</strong>: for if he had not sent him, he would never have heard him in anything, and much less in everything; wherefore this was a full proof, and clear evidence of his divine mission.</p>
