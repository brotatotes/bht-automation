<p><strong>Then many of the Jews which came to Mary</strong>,.... To her house, to comfort her, and that came along with her to the grave:</p>
<p><strong>and had seen the things which Jesus did</strong>; in raising the dead body of Lazarus, and causing him to walk, though bound in grave clothes:</p>
<p><strong>believed on him</strong>; that he was the true Messiah: such an effect the miracle had on them; so that it was a happy day for them, that they came from Jerusalem to Bethany to pay this visit.</p>
