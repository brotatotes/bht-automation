<p><strong>If we let him thus alone</strong>,.... Going about from place to place, teaching the people, and doing such miracles:</p>
<p><strong>all men will believe on him</strong>; the whole nation will receive him as the Messiah, and proclaim him their king, and yield a cheerful obedience to all his commands:</p>
<p><strong>the Romans will come</strong>; against us, with their powerful armies; interpreting the setting him up as Messiah, to be an instance of rebellion against Caesar, and his government:</p>
<p><strong>and take away both our place and nation</strong>; that is, will destroy the temple, their holy place, the place of their religion and worship; and their city, the place of their habitation, and lay waste their country; and take away from them that little share of power and government they had, and strip them both of their civil and religious privileges: the Persic version renders it, "they will take away our place, and make a decree against our religion".</p>
