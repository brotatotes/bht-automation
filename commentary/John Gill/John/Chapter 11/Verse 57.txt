<p><strong>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees</strong>,.... Who were of the sanhedrim:</p>
<p><strong>had given a commandment</strong>; or published an edict, a decree of the senate:</p>
<p><strong>that if any man knew where he were, he should show [it], that they might take him</strong>; and this made it a doubtful point with some, whether he would come to the feast or not; and was the reason why others sought for him, and inquired after him, that they might discover him to the chief priests and Pharisees, and have the promised reward.</p>
