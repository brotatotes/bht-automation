<p><strong>[His] disciples said unto him, master</strong>,.... Addressing him very reverently, and with great concern for his safety, as well as their own:</p>
<p><strong>the Jews of late</strong>, or but now,</p>
<p><strong>sought to stone thee</strong>; as they had attempted to do twice in a very little time; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:59">John 8:59</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and goest thou thither again</strong>? where there are so many enemies; and so much danger, and but little hope of doing much good; whereas here he was among his friends, and in safety, and very useful.</p>
