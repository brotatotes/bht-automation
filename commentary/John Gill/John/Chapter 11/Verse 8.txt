Addressing him very reverently, and with great concern for his safety, as well as their own:the Jews of late, or but now,sought to stone thee; as they had attempted to do twice in a very little time; see John 8:59;and goest thou thither again? where there are so many enemies; and so much danger, and but little hope of doing much good; whereas here he was among his friends, and in safety, and very useful.
