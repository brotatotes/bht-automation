<p><strong>On the next day, much people that were come to the feast</strong>,.... Of the passover; and they were much people indeed, that came yearly to this feast, from all parts of the nation; for all the males in Israel, were obliged to appear at this time; and though the women were not obliged, yet multitudes of them came, and the fame of Jesus might bring the more; add to which, that there was now a general expectation of the Messiah's coming, which brought the Jews from all parts of the world, to Jerusalem; so that this might be called indeed, פסח מעוכין, "a crowded passover": and though the following account is a stretching it too far, yet it may serve to illustrate this matter:</p>
<p>"would you desire to know what multitudes were at Jerusalem of the priests, you may know, as it is written, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:63">1 Kings 8:63</span>, and the tradition is, that an ox was offered for twenty four, and a sheep for eleven.--King Agrippa sought to know what was the number of the multitude, which were in Jerusalem; he said to the priests, lay by for me one kidney of every passover lamb; they laid by for him six hundred thousand pair of kidneys, double the number of those that came out of Egypt: and there is never a passover lamb, but there are more than ten numbered for it m, c.''</p>
<p>Now the day following the supper at Bethany, and which seems to be the first day of the week, this multitude of people,</p>
<p><strong>when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem</strong> from Bethany, which was soon known, it being so near.</p>
<p>m Echa Rabbati, fol. 42. 3, 4.</p>
