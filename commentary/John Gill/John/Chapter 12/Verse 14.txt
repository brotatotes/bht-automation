<p><strong>And Jesus, when he had found a young ass</strong>,.... Which he sent his disciples for, to a neighbouring village, and they brought to him:</p>
<p><strong>sat thereon, as it is written</strong>; in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:9">Zechariah 9:9</span> though some part of the words seems to be taken out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+62:11">Isaiah 62:11</span>;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+62:11- :">Isaiah 62:11- :</span>; and so Nonnus paraphrases it here, "that it might be fulfilled which Esaias said".</p>
