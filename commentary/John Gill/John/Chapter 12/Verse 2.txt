<p><strong>There they made him a supper</strong>,.... At Bethany, in the house of Lazarus, Martha, and Mary; by whose order, and at whose charge it was prepared for him; and not in the house of Simon the leper, which was four days after this, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:2">Matthew 26:2</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And Martha served</strong>; who was always a busy, active, and stirring woman; and this she did, to testify her love to Christ, and great respect for him; otherwise, as she was a person of substance, she had servants enough to wait at table:</p>
<p><strong>but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him</strong>; and ate, and drank, and conversed; by which it appeared, that he was really risen from the dead, and was in a good state of health.</p>
