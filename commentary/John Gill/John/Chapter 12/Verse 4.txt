<p><strong>Then saith one of his disciples</strong>,.... Who had no true love for his master, was an hypocrite, and a covetous person:</p>
<p><strong>Judas Iscariot</strong>; so called, to distinguish him from another Judas, an apostle; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Simon's [son]</strong>; this is omitted in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;</p>
<p><strong>which should betray him</strong>; and so he did; this was pre-determined by God, foretold in prophecy, and foreknown by Christ; and is observed here, to show the temper and character of the man.</p>
