<p><strong>And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.</strong> Not with bodily eyes, for there were many that saw Christ, who never saw the Father: they saw Christ as a mere man, and were offended at the meanness of his outward appearance; they saw nothing divine in him, nor the glory of the Father through him; but with the eyes of the understanding, whoever saw or perceived the glory of Christ in his miracles, saw the glory of God in them also, for the Father that dwelt in him did the works, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span>, and whoever truly sees Christ with an eye of faith, sees his glory, as the glory of the only begotten of the Father, as the brightness of his Father's glory, as having the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him, the same perfections as in the Father; so that he that hath seen the one, hath seen the other also, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:9">John 14:9</span>.</p>
