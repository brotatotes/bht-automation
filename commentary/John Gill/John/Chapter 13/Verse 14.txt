<p><strong>If I then your Lord and Master</strong>,.... Christ argues from these titles and characters, which his disciples rightly gave him, and from what he had done to them, though he stood in such a superior relation to them, to their duty one towards another; that since, says he, I</p>
<p><strong>have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet</strong>: by which he does not mean barely, that they should perform this single action; but as this was an instance of humility and condescension, and doing a good office to strangers and travellers, and was afterwards an expression of love to the saints, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:10">1 Timothy 5:10</span>, so he would teach them hereby, to behave in a spirit of humility and condescension to one another, to do every kind and good office, and by love to serve one another in all things.</p>
