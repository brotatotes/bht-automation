<p><strong>Jesus answered, he it is</strong>,.... Jesus replied, by whispering; for had he spoken out, the rest could not have been so ignorant, as they still continued, after the sign was given: Christ, I say, whispered to John, and told him by what sign he might know the person, and that it was he,</p>
<p><strong>to whom</strong>, says he,</p>
<p><strong>I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it</strong>. This was not the passover sop, which was dipped into a sauce made of various things, called by the Jews חרוסת; for this was not the "paschal" supper, but a common supper at a private house, two days before the feast of the passover; but this sop, or rather crust of bread, which whether dipped into a liquid, or only a piece of dry bread, which Christ dipped his hand into the dish for, and took, as some think, is not very material, was a piece of common bread, which Christ took up, without regard to any custom, or ceremony used at any feasts, and gave it to the betrayer, as a sign by which John might know him:</p>
<p><strong>and when he, had dipped the sop</strong>; either into some sort of broth, or any other liquid, or had dipped his hand into the dish for it:</p>
<p><strong>he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon</strong>; so called, to distinguish him from another apostle, whose name was Judas, and was then present.</p>
