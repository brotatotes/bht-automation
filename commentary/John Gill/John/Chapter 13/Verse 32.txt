<p><strong>If God be glorified in him</strong>,.... Seeing this is a certain truth, is indisputably matter of fact, that all the perfections of God are glorified in Christ, by his sufferings and death:</p>
<p><strong>God shall also glorify him in himself</strong>; either "with himself"; with his own glory, which was promised to Christ, and which he had before the world was, and for which he prays, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>, or by himself: by his own power, in raising him from the dead, setting him at his own right hand, and crowning him with glory and honour:</p>
<p><strong>and shall straightway glorify him</strong>; this he will do very quickly, he will not leave him in the grave, nor suffer him to see corruption; he will raise him again the third day, and give him glory.</p>
