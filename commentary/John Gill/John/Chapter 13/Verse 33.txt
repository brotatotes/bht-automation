<p><strong>Little children, yet a little while I am with you</strong>,.... Christ having removed the scandal of his death, by observing, that both he and his Father would be glorified by it, begins more freely to open his mind to his disciples, and acquaint them with it; whom he addresses in the most kind, tender, and affectionate manner, "little children", expressing the relation which subsisted between them, of which he was not unmindful; his great affection for them, his consideration of their weakness, and sympathy with them on that account; who were very ill able to bear his departure, which he now thought high time to acquaint them with, that it would be very shortly: it was but a little while he was to be with them, a few days more; the time of his departure was at hand, his hour was as it were come, and the last sands were dropping:</p>
<p><strong>ye shall seek me</strong>; as persons in distress, under great concern, not knowing what to do, or where to go:</p>
<p><strong>and as I said unto the Jews</strong>, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:33">John 7:33</span>;</p>
<p><strong>whither I go ye cannot come, so now I say unto you</strong>; but with this difference, whereas the unbelieving Jews, who died in their sins, could never come whither he went, these his disciples, though they could not come now, yet they should hereafter, all of them, as well as Peter, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:36">John 13:36</span>.</p>
