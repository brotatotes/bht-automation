<p><strong>Peter said unto him</strong>,.... Not understanding Christ's answer, and being dissatisfied with it, inquires:</p>
<p><strong>Lord, why cannot I follow thee now</strong>? is the place inaccessible? are the difficulties in the way to it insuperable? the roughness of the road, or the dangers of it, will not discourage me; I am ready to go through the greatest dangers and difficulties, to follow thee: yea,</p>
<p><strong>I will lay down my life for thy sake</strong>; whatever enemies I should meet with in, following thee, would not dismay me; I would readily hazard my life, and cheerfully lay it down in defence of thee.</p>
