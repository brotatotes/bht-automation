<p><strong>He riseth from supper</strong>,.... In the midst of the entertainment, and which no doubt was considerable, his mind being intent on something else; and it being his meat and drink to do his Father's will, he rises and leaves his disciples sitting to finish their meal; and whilst they were murmuring at the waste of the ointment poured on his head, and were filled with indignation at it, as they all of them were, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:8">Matthew 26:8</span>; he rises up to wash their feet; amazing patience and humility!</p>
<p><strong>And laid aside his garments</strong>; not all his garments, only his upper ones, that he might better dispatch the business he was going about; and which was an emblem of his laying aside, as it were for a while, his glory and dignity as the Son of God, and of his appearing in the form of a servant.</p>
<p><strong>And took a towel</strong>; or "linen cloth", λεντιον, the same with</p>
<p>לונטית in the Jerusalem Talmud r:</p>
<p><strong>and girded himself</strong>; with the towel, or linen cloth, which served both for a girdle, and after he had washed his disciples' feet, to wipe them with. This was a servile habit; so servants used to stand at the feet of their masters, girt about with a linen cloth s; and shows, that the son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.</p>
