<p><strong>Believest thou not that I am in the Father</strong>?.... This surely is, as it must needs be, and ought to be, an article of your faith, "that I am in the Father",</p>
<p><strong>and the Father in me</strong>; phrases which are expressive of the sameness of nature in the Father and the Son; of the Son's perfect equality with the Father, since the Son is as much in the Father, as the Father is in the Son; and also of the personal distinction there is between them; for nothing with propriety can be said to be in itself. The Father must be distinct from the Son who is in him, and the Son must be distinct from the Father, in whom he is; the Father and Son, though of one and the same nature, cannot be one, and the same person:</p>
<p><strong>the words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself</strong>. The doctrines which I preach among you are a proof of what I assert, and to them I appeal; for these are not of myself, as man,</p>
<p><strong>but the Father that dwelleth in me</strong>; and so prove that I am truly God, of the same nature with my Father; that he is in me, and I in him; since they are such as none but the only begotten, who is in the bosom of the Father, could ever have declared and made known unto you; Likewise, the works which I do, as man, I do not of myself; but</p>
<p><strong>he doth the works</strong>: for so this passage must be understood and supplied, in which Christ proceeds to another argument, taken from his works, proving the Father to be in him, and that he is in the Father, which, is enlarged on in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:11">John 14:11</span>.</p>
