<p><strong>These things have I spoken unto you</strong>,.... Concerning his Father, and his Father's house, and the way to both; concerning his being in the father, and the Father in him; concerning keeping his commandments, and the advantages and benefits following upon it:</p>
<p><strong>being</strong>, says he,</p>
<p><strong>[yet] present with you</strong>; which is a strong intimation that in a little time he should not be present with them; and that whilst he was present with them, he was desirous of saying such things to them in a brief compendious manner, as they were able to bear; which might be of future use and instruction to them.</p>
