<p><strong>And now I have told you before it came to pass</strong>,.... This is a strong proof of his true and proper deity, for none but the omniscient God can tell of things before they come to pass; this is peculiar to him, and distinguishes him from the gods of the Gentiles; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+41:22">Isaiah 41:22</span>;</p>
<p><strong>that when it is come to pass, ye might believe</strong>: that is, that when he was removed from them, and gone to his Father, they might then believe that he was truly God, the Son of God, the promised Messiah; and that he was then in glory, and at the right hand of God.</p>
