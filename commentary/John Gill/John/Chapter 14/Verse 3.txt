<p><strong>And if I go and prepare a place for you</strong>,.... Seeing I am going to prepare, and will prepare a place for you, of the truth of which you may be fully assured:</p>
<p><strong>I will come again</strong>; either by death or in person a second time, here on earth:</p>
<p><strong>and receive you unto myself</strong>; I will take you up with me to heaven; I will receive you into glory;</p>
<p><strong>that where I am there you may be also</strong>: and behold my glory, and be for ever with me, and never part more.</p>
