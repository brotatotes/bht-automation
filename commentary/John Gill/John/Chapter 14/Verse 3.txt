And if I go and prepare a place for you,.... Seeing I am going to prepare, and will prepare a place for you, of the truth of which you may be fully assured:I will come again; either by death or in person a second time, here on earth:and receive you unto myself; I will take you up with me to heaven; I will receive you into glory;that where I am there you may be also: and behold my glory, and be for ever with me, and never part more.
