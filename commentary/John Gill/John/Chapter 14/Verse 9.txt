<p><strong>Jesus saith unto him, have I been so long time with you</strong>,.... Conversing familiarly with you, instructing you by my ministry, and performing so many miraculous works among you, for so long a time; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:11">Hebrews 5:11</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and yet hast thou not known me, Philip</strong>? Surely you cannot be so ignorant as this comes to; as you have seen me with your bodily eyes, as a man, you must, know that I am God by the doctrines I have taught you, and the miracles I have wrought among you: and</p>
<p><strong>he that hath seen me</strong>; not with the eyes of his body, but with the eyes of his understanding; he that has beheld the perfections of the Godhead in me:</p>
<p><strong>hath seen the Father</strong>; the perfections which are in him also; for the same that are in me are in him, and the same that are in him are in me: I am the very image of him, and am possessed of the same nature, attributes, and glory, that he is; so that he that sees the one, sees the other:</p>
<p><strong>and how sayest thou then show us the Father</strong>? such a request is a needless one, and betrays great weakness and ignorance.</p>
