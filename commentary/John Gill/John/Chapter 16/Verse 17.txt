<p><strong>Then said some of his disciples among themselves</strong>,.... It may be, some of them might better understand the meaning of Christ than others, or they might all be ignorant of it; for before the effusion of the Spirit on them, they were attended with a great deal of ignorance; and what through their being overwhelmed at this time with sorrow, and what with their national sentiments they retained about a temporal kingdom, they understood very little of what Christ said to them concerning his death, the nature, use, and end of it. Wherefore some might make the motion first, and inquire,</p>
<p><strong>what is this that he saith unto us, a little while and ye shall not see me</strong>? they knew not what he meant by it, though he had so often and so clearly spoken of his death unto them: and as ignorant were they what he should design by saying,</p>
<p><strong>and again a little while and ye shall see me</strong>; though he had expressly told them, in so many words, some time ago, that whereas he should die, he should rise again the third day: and as much at a loss were they to guess what he should intend by the reason he gives,</p>
<p><strong>and because I go to the Father</strong>; though he had often mentioned it already, and as what might be matter of joy unto them.</p>
