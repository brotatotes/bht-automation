<p><strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you</strong>,.... A strong asseveration, a way of speaking often used by him, when he solemnly affirms any thing, and would assure of the truth of it, as here:</p>
<p><strong>that ye shall weep and lament</strong>; meaning at his death, when he should be removed from them, so that they should not see him; when they should be filled with inward grief on account thereof, and express it by mournful gestures, and a doleful voice; and which was fulfilled in them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:10">Mark 16:10</span>; and how pensive the two disciples were that were going to Emmaus, it is easy to observe from the account given of them;</p>
<p><strong>but the world shall rejoice</strong>; the unbelieving Jews; and not only the common people, but the chief priests, with the Scribes and elders, mocked at him, insulted him, and triumphed over him when on the cross, being glad at heart they had got him there; imagining now, that it was all over, the day was their own, and they should be no more disturbed by Christ and his followers:</p>
<p><strong>and ye shall be sorrowful</strong>; Christ repeats it again, and uses a variety of words to express the greatness of their sorrow, and the many ways in which they would signify it:</p>
<p><strong>but your sorrow shall be turned into joy</strong>; as it was, when he was raised from the dead, which was so wonderful and surprising to them, that for joy they could scarce believe their own eyes; it being a mercy unexpected, though they had been told of it, and too great for them to enjoy; yea, that very thing which was the occasion of their sorrow, became the foundation of their joy; namely, the death of Christ, salvation, and all the benefits and blessings of grace coming to them in this way.</p>
