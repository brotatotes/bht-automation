<p><strong>A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow</strong>,.... As was said she should have, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:16">Genesis 3:16</span>; This is God's ordination and appointment for sin:</p>
<p><strong>because her hour is come</strong>; is at hand; the fixed time in nature is up, and there is no avoiding it:</p>
<p><strong>but as soon as she is delivered of the child</strong>; for though the sorrow is great, yet there is a deliverance, and she is saved in child bearing: when</p>
<p><strong>she remembereth no more the anguish</strong>; the sharp pains she has endured in her travail;</p>
<p><strong>for joy that a man is born into the world</strong>. Much such a way of speaking is used by the Jews z, who observe,</p>
<p>"if a woman brings forth a male child, all is forgot, and she repents (i.e. of her impatience, or any unbecoming expression in the time of labour), בשמחת הזכר, "for the joy of a man child".''</p>
<p>And our Lord seems to have respect to a prevailing notion among them, as well as many others, of the felicity of male children: it is a common saying with them a,</p>
<p>"blessed is he whose children are males, and woe to him whose children are females:''</p>
<p>for they say b,</p>
<p>"when שבא זכר בעולם, "that a man child comes into the world", peace comes into the world.''</p>
<p>Now our Lord, by this instance, illustrates the sorrow his disciples should have by his departure, and the joy that they should be possessed of upon his return to them; that as the pains of a woman in travail are very sharp and severe, and the distress of her mind, about the issue of things respecting herself and offspring, is very great, so would be the grief and trouble of the disciples on account of the death of their Lord and master: but as when a woman is safely delivered of a man child, she is so filled with joy, that her sorrow is remembered no more so should it be with them, when Christ should appear to them; all their trouble, concern, anxiety of mind, and fears, that attended them, would all vanish away, and they be distressed with them no more.</p>
