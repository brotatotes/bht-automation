<p><strong>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name</strong>,.... Not that they had never prayed as yet; for they had desired him to teach them to pray, which he did: they had prayed to him particularly for an increase of faith, and for many other things; but either they had only asked him, he being present with them, and not the Father; or if they had asked the Father anything, yet not in the name of Christ: they had made no mention of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, nor any use of his mediation; things they had not as yet such clear knowledge of; or they had not asked as yet any extraordinary thing, as they afterwards did; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:29">Acts 4:29</span>;</p>
<p><strong>ask, and ye shall receive</strong>; that is, in my name, and whatever ye ask for, ye shall have it, to fit you for your work, to carry you through it, and to give you success in it: see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7">Matthew 7:7</span>;</p>
<p><strong>that your joy may be full</strong>; go cheerfully through your work, find much pleasure in it, and with great satisfaction see the Gospel spread, souls converted, Satan's kingdom weakened, and the interest of your Redeemer thrive and flourish; than which nothing can more contribute to complete the joy of the ministers of Christ.</p>
