<p><strong>Behold the hour cometh, yea, is now come</strong>,.... The time is at hand, yea, it may, in a sense, be said to be already come, it was within an hour: and indeed the following prayer might be delivered in less than an hour's time; when he went immediately into the garden, and was apprehended; or at least in a very little while it would come to pass,</p>
<p><strong>that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own</strong>; to his own friends, relations, and acquaintance; to his own house and home; to his own country, Galilee, whither they all went, and to their trade of fishing again; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:3">John 21:3</span>; and so was fulfilled the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:7">Zechariah 13:7</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and shall leave me alone</strong>; as they did in the hands of his enemies; for they all forsook him and fled, some one way, some another; though one or two of them, Peter and John, followed him at a distance; and all came together again, but not to Christ, until his resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>And yet I am, not alone</strong>; he was not alone at this time; and his meaning is, that he should not be alone then when they should be scattered from him:</p>
<p><strong>because the Father is with me</strong>; not only as the Son of God, by virtue of union to him, and as one with him; but as Mediator, in consequence of his promise to uphold him, and assist him in his human nature; and though he withdrew his gracious and comforting presence from him, he bearing the sins, and standing in the room and stead of his people, yet not his powerful and supporting presence.</p>
