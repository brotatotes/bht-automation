<p><strong>But now I go my way to him that sent me</strong>,.... These words seem to belong to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:4">John 16:4</span>, and to contain a reason why Christ spoke of the trials and afflictions of his disciples now, because he was going away from them to his Father; when as they would be at the head of his affairs in this world, so they would the more become the butt of the rage of men:</p>
<p><strong>and none of you asketh me, whither goest thou</strong>? Peter indeed asked the question, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:36">John 13:36</span>; but his meaning was, what part of the country he was going to? what private and inaccessible place he was about to betake himself to? he had no notion of his going out of the world, or to heaven to his Father, and therefore inquired nothing about it; and when Christ had suggested to his disciples, that he was going to his Father's house, to prepare mansions for them, they did not seem to understand him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:2">John 14:2</span>. Nor did they ask what he meant by his Father's house, or what those mansions were he was going to prepare; and what the glory was he was going to possess for himself and them; they ask neither about the place he was going to, nor the way to it, nor the happiness to be enjoyed there.</p>
