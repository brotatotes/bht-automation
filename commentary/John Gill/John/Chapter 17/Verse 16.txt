<p><strong>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</strong> These words are repeated from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:14">John 17:14</span>, where they are given as a reason of the world's hatred to them; and here, as showing that they are exposed to the evil of it; and in both are used as an argument with his Father, that he would take notice of them, and preserve them.</p>
