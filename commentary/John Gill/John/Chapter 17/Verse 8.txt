<p><strong>For I have given unto them the words</strong>,.... Not commands, but doctrines; and these not the doctrines of men; nor any of the divers and strange doctrines; but what are called in Scripture the doctrine of God, of Christ, of the apostles, are agreeably to the Scriptures, and according to godliness; and are styled the word of truth, of faith, of righteousness, of peace and reconciliation, of life and salvation, and of the Gospel; and which Christ gave to his disciples, and gifts along with them to preach them, and abilities to help them:</p>
<p><strong>which thou gavest me</strong>; for the words and doctrines which Christ, as the great prophet in Israel spoke, were not his own, but his Father's; and these were given him to speak and deliver to others, and in which he was faithful; so Jonathan ben Uzziel l paraphrases the text in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+18:18">Deuteronomy 18:18</span>; concerning that prophet, the Messiah, God would raise up, after this manner;</p>
<p>"a prophet will I raise up unto them from among their brethren, in whom the Holy Spirit shall be, like unto thee; ואיתן פתגמי, "and I will give the words", of my prophecy into his mouth, and he shall speak with them all that I have commanded.''</p>
<p>And so the Messiah Jesus did:</p>
<p><strong>and they have received them</strong>; willingly and gladly, with reverence and meekness, with love, and thankfulness; so as to understand them and believe them, and so as to be affectionately and closely attached to them:</p>
<p><strong>and have known surely that I came out from thee</strong>; which is meant, not of his eternal filiation, but of his constitution and commission, as Mediator by his Father: of which they had certain knowledge, full assurance of faith, and sincerely owned and confessed being fully persuaded he was the true Messiah, and no impostor:</p>
<p><strong>and they have believed that thou didst send me</strong>; into this world, to seek and to save lost sinners, to redeem all the chosen ones, and perform everything necessary to their salvation.</p>
<p>l Targum Jon. in Deut. xviii. 18.</p>
