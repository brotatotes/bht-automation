<p><strong>And led him away to Annas first</strong>,.... Who is elsewhere mentioned with Caiaphas as an high priest also, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:2">Luke 3:2</span>. He was the "sagan" of the high priest; he and Caiaphas seem to have had the high priesthood alternately; and either now, because his house lay first in the way, or rather, because he was a man of age, learning, and experience, as these men usually were, that they might supply the deficiencies of the high priests, who were sometimes very weak and unlearned men k; therefore they first lead him to him, to have his advice how to proceed, and to take him along with them to his son-in-law, where the great council was convened, and that he might use his interest and authority, in taking proper measures, in order to put Jesus to death; and especially they led him to him, for the reason here assigned;</p>
<p><strong>for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas</strong>; so that he was, it is very probable, the older man: and being related to him, had an interest in him; and to whom such a sight was equally pleasing as to the high priest himself, or any of the council:</p>
<p><strong>which was the high priest that same year</strong>; for the high priesthood was not for life, but was often changed, being bought and sold for money; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:2- :">Luke 3:2- :</span>; so that this clause is very properly added, though Caiaphas held it longer, or, at least, had it more years than one; for Caiaphas was high priest when John began to preach, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:2">Luke 3:2</span>; but he now succeeded Simeon ben Camhith, who was priest the year before; as was Eleazar the son of Ananus, the year before that; and before him Ishmael ben Phabi, who were all three successively put into the priesthood by Valerius Gratus, the Roman governor; as was also Caiaphas this year, and whose name was Joseph.</p>
