<p><strong>Now Caiaphas was he which gave council to the Jews</strong>,.... The chief priests and Pharisees, who met in council about Jesus,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:47">John 11:47</span>, the counsel he gave was,</p>
<p><strong>that it was expedient that one man should die for the people</strong>; and which advice was given out of ill will and malice to Christ, and to prevent, as he thought, the people of the Jews being destroyed by the Romans; though the words have a very good sense which he did not understand. The people Christ was to die for, was not all the, people of the world, nor only the people of the Jews, nor all of them; but all the elect of God, whom God has chosen for his special and peculiar people, and has given to Christ as such: these Christ were to die for, and did, not merely as a martyr, to confirm his doctrine to them, or as an example to teach them meekness, patience, and courage, but in the room and stead of them, as a surety for them; and it was expedient that he should, in such sense, die for them, because of his suretyship engagements, that he might make satisfaction to the law and justice of God, and procure the salvation of his people, and send forth the Spirit to make application of it to them.</p>
