<p><strong>Why askest thou me</strong>?.... He seems surprised at the high priest's conduct, that he should put such questions to him, who stood bound before him; was brought there as a criminal, and was the defendant, and not obliged to accuse himself; nor could it be thought, that whatever evidence or testimony he should give, would have much weight with the persons before whom he stood.</p>
<p><strong>Ask them which heard me, what I said unto them</strong>; he appeals to his hearers, many of whom were then present; and these his enemies, even his worst enemies, so clear was his case, so free was his doctrine from sedition and blasphemy, so innocent was he in the whole of his deportment and conduct, that he even submits to have his case issued and determined by what his hearers should say of him; and these not his friends, but his enemies; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:8">Isaiah 50:8</span>;</p>
<p><strong>behold, they</strong>, or these,</p>
<p><strong>know what I have said</strong>; pointing at some persons present, perhaps the very officers who had been sent to take him before, but returned without him, declaring that never man spake like him.</p>
