<p><strong>And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself</strong>,.... This is repeated from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:18">John 18:18</span> to connect the history, and carry on the thread of the account of Peter's denial of Christ, which is interrupted by inserting the examination of Christ before the high priest, which was made at the same time. Peter stood among, and continued with the servants and officers of the high priest, warming himself by a fire they had made, it being a cold night; and this proved of bad consequence to him. The company and conversation of wicked men should be abstained from; no good is got thereby; continuance among such is very dangerous; men are too often more concerned for their bodies than their souls; Satan baits his temptations for the fleshly and sensitive part; and that which is thought to be for good, is the occasion of hurt.</p>
<p><strong>They said therefore unto him</strong>; the servants and officers, among whom he stood warming himself, having observed what the maid had said to him:</p>
<p><strong>art thou not also one of his disciples</strong>? suspecting that he was, though he had denied it, and therefore press him to give a direct answer: they might observe his countenance to fall, when the maid put the question to him; there might be something in his dress, and especially in his speech, which increased the suspicion:</p>
<p><strong>but he denied it, and said, I am not</strong>; a second time. This denial of his being a disciple of Christ, as before, did not arise from a sense of his unworthiness to be one; nor from diffidence and distrust of a right to such a character; but from the fear of men; and being ashamed of Christ, he denies that which was his great mercy, privilege, and glory.</p>
