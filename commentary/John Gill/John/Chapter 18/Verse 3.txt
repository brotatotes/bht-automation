<p><strong>Judas then having received a band of men</strong>,.... From the captain of this band, who in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:12">John 18:12</span>; is called a "Chiliarch", that is, a commander of a thousand men, one might conclude there were so many in this band; but it seems, that such an officer might have two bands under his command; and if this was, the case, there were at least five hundred men in this company; a large number indeed, to take an unarmed person; and yet, as if this was not sufficient, it is added,</p>
<p><strong>and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees</strong>; servants that belong to each of these, and who seem to be a considerable number also; for these are said to be "a great multitude"; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:47">Matthew 26:47</span>; nay, not only so, but the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders of the people, were themselves among them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:52">Luke 22:52</span>; to see that the men did their work, and did not return without him; as these officers, when sent by them once before, did:</p>
<p><strong>cometh thither with lanterns, and torches, and weapons</strong>: פנס, which is no other than the Greek word here used for a lantern, the Jews tell us u, was an earthen vessel, in which a candle was put and covered, that the wind might not put it out, and it had holes in the sides of it, through which light was let out; their לפיד, or "lamp", here rendered "torch", they say w, was also an earthen vessel in the form of a reed, at the top of which was a proper receptacle, in which they burnt old rags dipped in oil: now though it was full moon, being the time of the passover, they brought these along with them to discover him by the light of, and find him out with them, if he should hide himself among the trees, or in any of the more shady places in the garden; and they took warlike instruments, as swords, spears, and staves, as if they had a thief or a murderer to apprehend, or a little army of men to encounter with; whereas there were only Christ, and his eleven disciples; and these in no condition, nor had any design, to defend themselves in an hostile manner.</p>
