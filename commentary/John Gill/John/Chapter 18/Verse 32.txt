<p><strong>That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled</strong>,.... That he should be delivered by the Jews to the Gentiles, to crucify him; and that he should be lifted up from the earth, and as the serpent upon the pole:</p>
<p><strong>which he spake, signifying what death he should die</strong>;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:19">Matthew 20:19</span> and which was brought about this way, by the providence of God conducting this whole affair; and was cheerfully submitted to by Christ, in great love to his people, to redeem them from the curse of the law, being hereby made a curse for them.</p>
