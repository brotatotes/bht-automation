<p><strong>Then delivered he him therefore</strong>,.... Perceiving he could not by any means work upon them, and that nothing would satisfy them but his death; he therefore passed sentence on him, and gave him up to their will,</p>
<p><strong>unto them to be crucified</strong>; as they requested, and which was done in a judicial way, and all by divine appointment, according to the counsel and foreknowledge of God:</p>
<p><strong>and they took Jesus and led him away</strong>; directly from the judgment hall, out of the city to the place of execution, whither he was led as a lamb to the slaughter, without opening his mouth against God or man; but behaved with the utmost patience, meekness, and resignation.</p>
