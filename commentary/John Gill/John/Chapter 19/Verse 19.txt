<p><strong>And Pilate wrote a title</strong>,.... Luke calls it a superscription, Mark, the superscription of his accusation, and Matthew, the accusation itself; it contained the substance of the charge against him, and was written upon a table or board, and nailed to the cross, as Nonnus suggests; to this is the allusion, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:14">Colossians 2:14</span>. The form of it was drawn up by Pilate, his judge, who ordered it to be transcribed upon a proper instrument, and placed over him:</p>
<p><strong>and put it on the cross</strong>; not with his own hands, but by his servants, who did it at his command; for others are said to do it,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:37">Matthew 27:37</span>. It was put upon "the top of the cross", as the Persic version reads it; "over him", or "over his head", as the other evangelists say; and may denote the rise of his kingdom, which is from above, the visibility of it, and the enlargement of it, through the cross:</p>
<p><strong>and the writing was</strong>; the words written in the title were,</p>
<p><strong>Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews</strong>: Jesus was his name, by which he was commonly called and known, and signifies a Saviour, as he is of all the elect of God; whom he saves from all their sins, by bearing them in his own body on the cross, and of whom he is the able and willing, the perfect and complete, the only and everlasting Saviour: he is said to be of Nazareth; this was the place of which he was an inhabitant; here Joseph and Mary lived before his conception; here he was conceived, though born in Bethlehem; where he did not abide long, but constantly in this place, till he was about thirty years of age; this title was sometimes given him as a term of reproach, though not always: "the King of the Jews"; which both expresses his accusation, and asserts him to be so.</p>
