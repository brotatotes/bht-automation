<p><strong>Then saith he to the disciple</strong>,.... The same disciple John:</p>
<p><strong>behold thy mother</strong>; take care of her, and provide for her, as if she was thine own mother: this shows the meanness of Christ, who had nothing to leave her, though Lord of all; it is very probable that Joseph was dead, and Mary now a widow; and whereas Christ had taken care of her, and maintained her hitherto, he now, in his dying moments, commits her to the care of this disciple; which is an instance of his humanity, and of his regard to every duty; and this in particular, of honouring parents, and providing for them in distress, and old age:</p>
<p><strong>and hour that disciple took her to his own home</strong>: or house; so the Septuagint render ביתו, "to his house", by εις τα ιδια, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="es+6:12">Esther 6:12</span> the phrase here used, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:32">John 16:32</span>. Some say she lived with John at Jerusalem, and there died; and others say, that she died in the twelfth year after the resurrection of Christ, being 59 years of age, and was buried by John in the garden of Gethsemane: where his house was is not certain, whether at Jerusalem or in Galilee, nor how long she lived with him; but this is not to be doubted, that he took care of her, and provided for her, as if she was his own mother; and his doing this forthwith shows his great regard to Christ, his readiness and cheerfulness to comply with his orders and directions, and his unfeigned love unto him.</p>
