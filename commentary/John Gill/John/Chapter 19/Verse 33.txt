<p><strong>But when they came to Jesus</strong>,.... Whom they passed by before, and now returned to; this they did not out of tenderness to him, but that he might be the longer in his torture, and whom they reserved till last, that they might use him with the greater cruelty and barbarity:</p>
<p><strong>and saw that he was dead already</strong>; as they might, from the bowing down of his head, the ghastliness of his countenance, the falling of his jaws, and other signs:</p>
<p><strong>they brake not his legs</strong>; there being no occasion for it, nor would it have answered any end, were they ever so spiteful and malicious against him; though the true reason was, and which restrained them from it, divine providence would not suffer them to do it.</p>
