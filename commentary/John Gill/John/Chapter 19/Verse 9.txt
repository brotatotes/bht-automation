<p><strong>And went again into the judgment hall</strong>,.... From whence he came out, taking Jesus along with him, in order to interrogate him alone upon this head:</p>
<p><strong>and saith unto Jesus, whence art thou</strong>? meaning not of what country he was, for he knew he was of the nation of the Jews; nor in what place he was born, whether at Bethlehem or at Nazareth, for this was no concern of his; but from whence he sprung, who were his ancestors, and whether his descent was from the gods, or from men; and if from the former, from which of them; for as Pilate was an Heathen, he must be supposed to speak as such:</p>
<p><strong>but Jesus gave him no answer</strong>; for his question was frivolous, and deserved none; and besides, he was not worthy of one, who had used him so ill, when he knew, in his own conscience, that he was innocent; nor was he capable of taking in an answer, or able to judge whether it was right or wrong; and since Christ was come to die for the salvation of his people, it was not proper he should say anything that might be a means of hindering it.</p>
