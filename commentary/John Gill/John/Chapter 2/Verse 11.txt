<p><strong>This beginning of miracles</strong>,.... This miracle of turning water into wine, was the first miracle Christ ever wrought, either in public or private; for as for what miracles he is said to do in his infancy, there is no reason to give credit to them: and this he</p>
<p><strong>did in Cana of Galilee</strong>; not that this was only the first he did in that place; he afterwards working another there, namely, the cure of a nobleman's son, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:46">John 4:46</span>, but the first he did any where, and it was in this place; and which the Syriac and Persic versions again call Kotne of Galilee; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:46- :">John 4:46- :</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and manifested forth his glory</strong>; the glory of his deity and divine sonship, which was hid by his assumption of human nature, but broke forth and showed itself in his miraculous operations, and particularly in this:</p>
<p><strong>and his disciples believed on him</strong>; the above five disciples; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:2">John 2:2</span>; whom he had called, and who were with him at this marriage, and were made acquainted with this miracle: and though they believed in him before, and had declared, and professed him to be the Messiah, Moses and the prophets spoke of, and the Son of God, and King of Israel; yet they were, by this miracle, more and more confirmed in the faith of these things: besides, others might be made his disciples at this time, and be hereby brought to believe in him.</p>
