<p><strong>After this he went down to Capernaum</strong>,.... After he had been at Cana, and at the wedding there: after he had wrought the miracle of turning water into wine; and after he had manifested forth the glory of his deity thereby, and had confirmed the faith of his disciples, he departed from thence, and went lower into the country of Galilee, to Capernaum, a city near the sea of Tiberias; and which, from henceforward, he made the more usual place of his residence, and whither he frequently resorted, and therefore it is called his city, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:1">Matthew 9:1</span>. This refers not to the same journey recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:12">Matthew 4:12</span>, for that was after John was cast into prison, whereas this was before; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:24">John 3:24</span>; the company that went with him, are as follow,</p>
<p><strong>he, and his mother</strong>; who had been with him at Cana, and was a principal person at the wedding: and she now returning home, he accompanies her, to see her to her own habitation; or to settle her in Capernaum, whilst he went about discharging his public ministry.</p>
<p><strong>And his brethren</strong>; or near kinsmen, according to the flesh, the sons of Alphaeus, or Cleophas, and Mary, sister to the mother of our Lord; whose names were James, Joses, Simon, and Judas, three of which afterwards became his apostles:</p>
<p><strong>and his disciples</strong>: as many as he had yet called, which were Andrew, and the disciple that followed Jesus with him, and Simon Peter, and Philip, and Nathanael,</p>
<p><strong>and they continued there not many days</strong>; not because of the impenitence, unbelief, and wickedness of the place, but for the reason following.</p>
