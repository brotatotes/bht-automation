<p><strong>And both Jesus was called</strong>,.... Or invited, as being a relation, according to the flesh:</p>
<p><strong>and his disciples, to the marriage</strong>; who were bidden, on his account; and they seem to be these, Andrew, and the other disciple, that followed Jesus, and Simon Peter, and Philip, and Nathanael, who was of this place; and accordingly they all went to it. Christ, and his five disciples, made six of the ten, which were always necessary to be present at, the benediction of bridegrooms: for so runs the canon m;</p>
<p>"they do not bless the blessing of bridegrooms, but with ten principal and free men; and the bridegroom may be one of the number.''</p>
<p>To attend a wedding, was reckoned, with the Jews, an act of beneficence and kindness n. Our Lord, being at this wedding, was acting like himself, and his general character, of being free, affable, and courteous; who accepted of every invitation, and refused not to be at any entertainment, made by who it would, or on whatever occasion: and particularly in this instance, it shows his humility in not disdaining his poor relations, but giving them his company at such a time; as also it was bearing a testimony to the institution of marriage, as honourable; and teaches us to rejoice with them that rejoice: and as this was, at the first of Christ's ministry and miracles, it is likely it might give the occasion of that calumny cast on him in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:19">Matthew 11:19</span>. The disciples of Christ followed the example of their master. According to the Jewish cations o, a disciple of a wise man might not partake of any feast, but what was according to the commandment, as the feast of espousals, and of marriage; and such a feast was this, which Christ and his disciples were at; and so not to be condemned for it, according to their own maxims.</p>
