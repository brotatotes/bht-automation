<p><strong>But he spoke of the temple of his body.</strong> Which was the antitype of the material temple; and might well be called so, since the bodies of the saints are called temples, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:16">2 Corinthians 6:16</span>; and the human nature of Christ is called a tabernacle, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:2">Hebrews 8:2</span>; and he himself, in prophecy, is said to be למקדש, "for a sanctuary", or temple, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:14">Isaiah 8:14</span>, and that because the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily, the train of the divine perfections filled the temple of his human nature, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9">Colossians 2:9</span>. And because here, as in the temple, God grants his presence, and communes with his saints, accepts of their prayers and praises, and all their spiritual sacrifices through him; and who is the oracle, the true "Urim" and "Thummim", by whom he delivers his whole mind and will to his people.</p>
