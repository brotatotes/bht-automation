<p><strong>Jesus saith unto them</strong>,.... To the servants that waited at the feast,</p>
<p><strong>fill the water pots with water</strong>. The Ethiopic version adds, "to their brims", as they did. Christ chose the water pots, and not the vessel, or vessels, or bottles, now empty, out of which they had drank their wine; that it might not be said that there was any left therein, which gave colour and flavour to the water: and he ordered them to be filled with water by the servants, that they might take notice, and be witnesses, that that, and nothing else, was put into them; and up to the brims, so that they could not he capable of having any other liquor infused into them:</p>
<p><strong>and they filled them up to the brim</strong>; strictly observing the orders of Christ, and the instructions of his mother.</p>
