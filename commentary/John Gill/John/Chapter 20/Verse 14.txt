<p><strong>And when she had thus said</strong>,.... As soon as the words were out of her mouth, before she could have an answer from the angels:</p>
<p><strong>she turned herself back</strong>; perceiving, either by the looks and gesture of one of the angels, or by hearing a noise, that somebody was behind her:</p>
<p><strong>and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus</strong>; she saw a person, but did not know who he was, by reason of the form of his appearance, the difference of his clothes, and not expecting to see him alive; or through modesty, she might not look wistfully at him; and besides, her eyes were filled with tears, and swollen with weeping; so that she could not see clearly; and her eyes might be holden also, as the disciples were, that as yet she might not know him: so sometimes, in a spiritual sense, Christ is with, and near his people, and they know it not: Christ, as God, is omnipresent; he is every where, and in all places; the spiritual presence of Christ, is more or less, in some way or another, always in all his churches, and among his dear people; but the sight of him is not always alike to them, nor does he appear to them always in the same form; sometimes against them, at least in their apprehensions, nor always in a manner agreeably to their expectations; nor is his grace always discovered in the same way, nor has it the same effect.</p>
