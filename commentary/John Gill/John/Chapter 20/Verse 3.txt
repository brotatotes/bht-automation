<p><strong>Peter therefore went forth</strong>,.... Out of the house where he was, upon hearing the account Mary gave:</p>
<p><strong>and that other disciple</strong>; John, the Evangelist and Apostle; the rest of the disciples staying at home and continuing together, waiting to hear what account these two would bring:</p>
<p><strong>and came to the sepulchre</strong>; to see with their own eyes what was done, and whether things were as Mary had related; and to make a more particular inquiry into, and examination of them.</p>
