<p><strong>And many other signs truly did Jesus</strong>,.... Besides these wonderful appearances to his disciples once and again, when the doors were shut about them: and which signs refer not to what was done before, but after his resurrection; and which he did,</p>
<p><strong>in the presence of his disciples</strong>; for he appeared to, and conversed with no other but them after his resurrection:</p>
<p><strong>which are not written in this book</strong>; of John's Gospel; though they may be elsewhere; such as his appearing to the two disciples going to Emmaus, and to the eleven on a mountain in Galilee, and to five hundred brethren at once, which other inspired writers speak of: and many there are which he did; which are not particularly written in this, nor in any other book; for he was seen of his disciples forty days, and showed himself alive, by many infallible proofs; all of which are not recorded.</p>
