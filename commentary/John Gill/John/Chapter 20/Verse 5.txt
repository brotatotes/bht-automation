<p><strong>And he stooping down and looking in</strong>,.... That is, John; when he came to the sepulchre, stooped down to look into it, and see what he could see; he only went into the court, or stood upon the floor, where the bearers used to set down the bier, before they put the corpse into one of the graves in the sepulchre, which were four cubits lower; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. Hence he was obliged to stoop down, ere he could see anything within: when he</p>
<p><strong>saw the linen clothes lying</strong>; in which the body had been wrapped, but that itself not there:</p>
<p><strong>yet went he not in</strong>; to the sepulchre itself, but waited in the court or porch, till Peter came; and perhaps might be timorous and fearful of going into such a place alone; the Arabic version reads it, "he dared not go in".</p>
