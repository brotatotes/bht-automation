<p><strong>Then cometh Simon Peter following him</strong>,.... In a very little time after him:</p>
<p><strong>and went into the sepulchre</strong>; itself, though not without first stooping down, as John did; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:12">Luke 24:12</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And seeth the linen clothes lie</strong>; as John did; and as by the mouth of two or three witnesses everything is confirmed, so was this; both saw the linen in which the body was wrapped, but that was gone; and which was a sign that the body was not stolen away, otherwise the linen would not have been left; and besides, it would have taken up some time, and given a good deal of trouble, to have unwrapped the body, when it is considered how many foldings the Jews used to wind up their corpse in.</p>
