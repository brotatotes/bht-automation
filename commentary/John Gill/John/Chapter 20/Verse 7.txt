<p><strong>And the napkin that was about his head</strong>,.... The word</p>
<p>σουδαριον, rendered "napkin", is thought to be originally Latin, and signifies an handkerchief, with which the sweat is wiped off the face, and so it is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:12">Acts 19:12</span> but Nonnus says it is a common word with the Syrians, and the word סודרא is used in the Syriac version; and which he renders, κεφαλης ζωστηρα, "the girdle, or binding of the head", for with this the head and face of the dead person were bound; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:44">John 11:44</span>. Now Peter, by going into the sepulchre, and looking about him, and examining things more strictly and narrowly, observed that which neither he nor John had taken notice of, when only stooping they looked in: and that is, that this head binder, or napkin, was</p>
<p><strong>not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself</strong>: and was plainly the effect of thought, care, and composure; and clearly showed, that the body was not taken away in a hurry, or by thieves, since everything lay in such order and decency; and which was done, either by our Lord himself, or by the angels.</p>
