<p><strong>For as yet they knew not the Scripture</strong>,.... Meaning not some particular passage of Scripture, but the writings of the Old Testament in general, and the various places in it, which spoke of the resurrection of Christ, either in a way of type, or prophecy; such as <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:3">Genesis 22:3</span> and though our Lord had often referred to some of them, at least as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:40">Matthew 12:40</span> yet such was the dulness of the disciples, or such their prejudices in favour of the Messiah being to continue, and set up a temporal kingdom, that even John, who leaned on his breast, and Peter, who was so inquisitive and desirous of knowing our Lord's meaning in everything, did not understand the sense of his words, nor of those places of Scripture he had reference to:</p>
<p><strong>that he must rise again from the dead</strong>: so it was determined, thus it was predicted, and the justification and salvation of God's elect required it; and yet they knew not the thing, nor the necessity and importance of it.</p>
