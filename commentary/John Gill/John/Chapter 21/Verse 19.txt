<p><strong>This spake he</strong>,.... These are the words of the evangelist, explaining the meaning of Christ in like manner, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:33">John 12:33</span></p>
<p><strong>signifying by what death he should glorify God</strong>; for by the above words Christ not only intimated that Peter should die, not a natural, but a violent death, or that he should die a martyr in his cause, but the very kind of death he should die, namely, by crucifixion; and that Peter was crucified at Rome, ecclesiastical history confirms f, when Christ was magnified, and God was glorified by his zeal and courage, faith and patience, constancy and perseverance to the end:</p>
<p><strong>and when he had spoken this</strong>: concerning the usage and treatment he should meet with, the sufferings he should undergo, and death he should die for his sake, for the present trial of him:</p>
<p><strong>he saith unto him, follow me</strong>: which may be understood literally, Jesus now rising up, and ordering him to come after him; and yet as a sign of his following him, in a spiritual sense, exercising every grace upon him, discharging every duty towards him, faithfully and constantly performing his work and office, as an apostle and preacher of the Gospel, in which he had now reinstated and confirmed him, and patiently bearing and suffering all kind of reproach, persecution, and death, for his name's sake.</p>
