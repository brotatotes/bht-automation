<p><strong>Then Jesus saith unto them, children</strong>,.... And still they knew him not, though he used this endearing and familiar appellation, and which they had been wont to hear from him; and he had called them by a little before his departure from them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:33">John 13:33</span> and which he uses here as expressive of his tender affection for them, their relation to him, and that he might be known by them:</p>
<p><strong>have ye any meat?</strong> that is, as the Syriac renders it, מדם למלעס, "anything to eat"; meaning fish that they had caught; and whether they had got a sufficient quantity to make a meal of for him and them.</p>
<p><strong>They answered him no</strong>; they had got nothing at all; or at least what they had was far from being enough to make a breakfast of; for so a meal early in a morning may be most properly called, though it is afterwards called dining. Christ's children, true believers, are sometimes without spiritual food; there is always indeed enough in Christ, and he has an heart to give it; but either through prevailing iniquity they feed on something else, or do not go to him for food, or go elsewhere; but he will not suffer them to starve; for as he has made provisions for them in the ministry of the word and ordinances; and he himself is the bread of life; if they do not ask him for food, he will ask them whether they have any; will kindly invite them to the provisions he himself makes; will bid them welcome, and bless them to them.</p>
