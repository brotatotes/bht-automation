<p><strong>As soon then as they were come to land</strong>,.... As soon as they were come out of the ship, and safe on shore, not only Peter, but all the rest of the disciples:</p>
<p><strong>they saw a fire of coals there</strong>: on the shore, to their great surprise:</p>
<p><strong>and fish laid there</strong>; which could not be any that they had taken, for, as yet, the net was not drawn up, and the fish took out:</p>
<p><strong>and bread</strong>; not upon the coals baking, but hard by, being ready prepared to eat with the fish, when sufficiently broiled. This was all of Christ's preparing, and a considerable proof of his deity; and a confirmation of that provision he will make for his ministering servants, whilst they are about his work, and in this world; and a representation of that spiritual and eternal refreshment they shall have with him in heaven to all eternity, when they have done their work.</p>
