<p><strong>For every one that doth evil, hateth the light</strong>,.... Every man, the series of whose life and conversation is evil, hates Christ and his Gospel, cause they make manifest his evil deeds, convict him of them, and rebuke him for them:</p>
<p><strong>neither cometh to the light</strong>; to hear Christ preach, or preached; to attend on the Gospel ministration and means of grace:</p>
<p><strong>lest his deeds should be reproved</strong>; or discovered, and made manifest, and he be brought to shame, and laid under blame, and advised to part with them, which he cares not to do; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:11">Ephesians 5:11</span>.</p>
