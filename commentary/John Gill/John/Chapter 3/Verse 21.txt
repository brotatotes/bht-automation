<p><strong>But he that doth truth</strong>,.... That which is true, right and good: "he whose work is just", as the Ethiopic version renders it; or, "he that does that which is right", so the Persic; that which is according to the will of God, and from a principle of love to him, and with a view to his glory:</p>
<p><strong>cometh to the light</strong>; to Christ, and to his word, and ordinances:</p>
<p><strong>that his deeds may be made manifest</strong>; being brought to the light, to the test, and standard, whether they, are right, or wrong; and that it may appear,</p>
<p><strong>that they are wrought in God</strong>; or "by God"; by his assistance, and gracious influence, without which men can do nothing; for it is God that works in them both to will and to do: or, "according to God", as others render it; according to the will of God, both for matter and manner: or "for God", as the Ethiopic version renders it; for the glory of God, which ought to be the aim, and end of every action. The Persic version reads the whole thus, "that the work which is between God and him may be known"; that such deeds may be discovered, which are only known to God and himself.</p>
