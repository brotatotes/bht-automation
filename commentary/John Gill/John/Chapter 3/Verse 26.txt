<p><strong>And they came unto John</strong>,.... The Persic version reads, "he came unto John"; that disciple that had the controversy with the Jew about purifying, who not knowing well how to answer him, and which might be the case of more, applied to John:</p>
<p><strong>and said unto him, Rabbi</strong>; or "master"; or, "our master"; as the Syriac and Persic versions read, which was a title of great respect, and reverence, and much in use in those times; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. The Arabic version joins this word to the following clause, and applies it to Christ, rendering it thus, "the master that was with thee beyond Jordan"; which is making them to speak more honourably of Christ than they intended; for though they speak very respectfully to John, yet with much disdain and neglect of Christ; not so much as mentioning his name, or using any term of honour or respect; only saying,</p>
<p><strong>he that was with thee beyond Jordan</strong>; namely, at Bethabara; who came from Galilee to Jordan, unto John, to be baptized by him, and who was baptized by him; and for some little time continued with him, and attended on his ministry; and as they thought, was a disciple of John's:</p>
<p><strong>to whom thou bearest witness</strong>; that he was before him, and to be preferred unto him; and that he was the Lamb of God, and even the Son of God; suggesting, that by this testimony of his, Christ had gained all the credit and reputation he had; and that therefore he had done a wrong thing in enlarging so much in the praise and commendation of him:</p>
<p><strong>behold the same baptizeth</strong>; takes upon him to administer the ordinance of baptism; at least gives orders to administer it; which John's disciples thought was the proper, and peculiar business of their master; and therefore speak of this as an intrusion into his office, and an entering into his province; and an assuming that which only belonged to him: and what gave still more uneasiness, and increased the complaint, was,</p>
<p><strong>and all men come to him</strong>; that is, "many", as the Syriac and Persic versions render it, even more than came to John; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:1">John 4:1</span>. Large multitudes from all parts flocked to hear Christ preach, and great numbers were made disciples by him, and then baptized. That he should baptize, gave them great offence; and that he was so followed, raised their envy; and his being so near to John, might add to their uneasiness. It is a rule with the Jews, that</p>
<p>"it is not lawful for a disciple to teach the constitutions, or sentences of the law, before his master; but must be twelve miles distant from him, as the camp of Israel.''</p>
<p>And they say, that</p>
<p>"a disciple that teaches before, or in the presence of his master, is guilty of death r.''</p>
