<p><strong>And what he hath seen and heard</strong>,.... Of the Father, of his mind and will, of his purposes and promises, of his love, grace, and mercy, in the council and covenant of peace, lying in his bosom, and being privy to all his secrets. The phrases express the clear and perfect knowledge Christ has of all truths and doctrines; he having all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in him.</p>
<p><strong>That he testifieth</strong>; fully, freely, and faithfully; withholds nothing, but declares the whole counsel of God; and is deservedly called the faithful witness, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And no man receiveth his testimony</strong>; though it was the testimony of God, which is greater than that of man; yet few, and which were next to none at all, gave any heed or credit to it; few or none among the Jews, or among the disciples of John, or even among those that followed Christ. John, and his disciples, widely differed; they thought that all men came to Christ, and believed in him; and John thought few or none, in comparison of the numbers he could have wished, did: and indeed, no one person can receive the testimony of Christ, and believe in him, unless it be given him from above, by the grace of God: for the natural man receives not divine and spiritual things; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:11">John 3:11</span>.</p>
