<p><strong>He that hath received his testimony</strong>,.... For there was here and there one that did, who believed in him as the Messiah, and embraced his Gospel, and submitted to his ordinances, and truly and sincerely followed him: and for the encouragement of such, it is said,</p>
<p><strong>hath set to his seal that God is true</strong>; faithful in fulfilling the promises he has made concerning the Messiah, and his coming: he firmly believes that God is true to every word of his, and will make good every promise; and this he seals, ratifies, and confirms by his embracing the testimony of Christ; whereas, on the contrary, he that believes not makes God a liar, than which, nothing can be more reproachful to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:10">1 John 5:10</span>. The Jews have a saying z that "the seal of the blessed God is truth". The Arabic version renders it, "he is already sealed, because God is true"; and the Ethiopic version, "God hath sealed him, because he is true"; namely, with his holy Spirit; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:22">2 Corinthians 1:22</span>.</p>
