<p><strong>For he whom God hath sent</strong>,.... Still meaning Christ, who was sent in human nature, in the likeness of sinful flesh, in the fulness of time; to be the Saviour of the world, of that which was lost, of the chief of sinners; and to preach the glad tidings of the Gospel, which is more especially here designed; and for which he was abundantly qualified by the Spirit of God, with which he was anointed:</p>
<p><strong>speaketh the words of God</strong>; the words which God gave unto him; the doctrines of grace; the word of truth; the word of faith; the word of righteousness; the word of reconciliation; the words of salvation and eternal life; the whole mind and will of God; and whatever he spoke were as true as the oracles of God, and were such.</p>
<p><strong>For God giveth not the Spirit by measure [unto him]</strong>, as he did to the prophets of the Old Testament, and to the apostles of the New; and to the ordinary ministers of the word, who have gifts differing one from another; to one is given one gift of the Spirit; and to another, another gift, as the Spirit pleaseth; and to everyone is given grace, or gifts of grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:7">Ephesians 4:7</span>. To which agrees what the Jews say a of the Holy Spirit, and his gifts.</p>
<p>"Says R. Joden bar R. Simeon, even the waters which descend from above are not given, but, במדה, "in measure".--Says R. Acha, even the Holy Spirit, which dwells upon the prophets, does not dwell, but במשקל, "in weight".''</p>
<p>But the Lord Jesus has every, gift of the Spirit, and the fulness of grace in him: he is anointed with the oil of gladness, with the Holy Ghost above his fellows; and has an immeasurable unction of the holy one; which, like the precious oil poured on Aaron, descends from him to the members of his body.</p>
