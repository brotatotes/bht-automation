<p><strong>Nicodemus saith unto him</strong>,.... Understanding him of a natural birth, to be repeated:</p>
<p><strong>how can a man be born when he is old</strong>? as it seems by this, he himself now was:</p>
<p><strong>can he enter the second time into his mothers womb, and be born</strong>? the Ethiopic version adds, "again"; and the Arabic version, "and then be born"; this he urges, as absurd, impracticable, and impossible; and which shows him to have been as yet a natural man, who could not receive nor discern spiritual things.</p>
