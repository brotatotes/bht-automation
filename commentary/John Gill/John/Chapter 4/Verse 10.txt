<p><strong>Jesus answered and said unto her</strong>,.... In a very serious manner, in a different way from hers:</p>
<p><strong>if thou knewest the gift of God</strong>; meaning, not the Holy Spirit with his gifts and graces, as some think, but himself; for the following clause is explanatory of it;</p>
<p><strong>and who it is that saith to thee, give me to drink</strong>; and Christ is also spoken of in the Old Testament, as the gift of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span> and he had lately spoken of himself as such, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span> and he is, by way of eminency, "the gift of God"; which is comprehensive of all others, is exceeding large, and very suitable to the wants and cases of men; and is irrevocable, unchangeable, and unspeakable: for he is God's gift, as he is his own and only begotten Son; and he is given for a covenant to the people, with all the promises and blessings of it; and as an head, both of eminence and influence; and to be a Saviour of them, and a sacrifice for their sins; and as the bread of life, for them to feed and live upon; of which gift, men are naturally ignorant, as this woman was: they know not the dignity of his person; nor the nature and usefulness of his offices; nor the way of peace, righteousness, and salvation by him; nor do they see any amiableness, or loveliness in him; and whatever notional knowledge some natural men may have of him, they know him not spiritually and experimentally, or as the gift of God to them:</p>
<p><strong>thou wouldst have asked of him</strong>; a favour and benefit; for such who truly know Christ, the worth and value of him, and their need of him, will apply to him for grace, as they have encouragement to do; since all grace is treasured up in him, and he gives it freely, and upbraideth not; and souls are invited to ask it of him, and take it freely; nor is it to be had anywhere else: but knowledge of Christ, is absolutely necessary, to asking anything of him; for till he is known, he will not be applied to; but when he is made known to any, in his fulness and suitableness, they will have recourse to him, and ask grace and mercy of him; and which is freely had: the Vulgate Latin very wrongly adds, "perhaps"; reading it, "perhaps thou wouldst have asked"; whereas our Lord's meaning is, that she would certainly have asked:</p>
<p><strong>and he would have given thee living water</strong>; pardoning and justifying grace, every branch of sanctifying grace, and all the supplies of it; so called, because his grace quickens sinners dead in sin, and dead in law, and in, their own apprehensions; and causes them to live in themselves, and before God; and because it refreshes and comforts, revives and cheers, and is like rivers of water in a dry land; and because it maintains and supports spiritual life in their souls; and it ever abides, and continues, and springs up unto everlasting life: for the allusion is to spring water, that bubbles up in a fountain, and is ever running; for such water the Jews call "living water"; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+26:19">Genesis 26:19</span>; where in the Hebrew text it is "living water"; which we, and also the Chaldee paraphrase, render "springing water". So living waters with them, are said to be always flowing, and never cease t.</p>
