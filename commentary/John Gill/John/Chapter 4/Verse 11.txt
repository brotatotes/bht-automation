<p><strong>The woman saith unto him, Sir</strong>,.... Which was an usual, way in those countries, of addressing men, and especially strangers; and expresses no uncommon respect to Christ, of whose dignity and greatness she was, entirely ignorant; and at whom she was now scoffing; for so the following words are to be understood:</p>
<p><strong>thou hast nothing to draw with</strong>; no pail, or bucket, or rope, to let it down with, as Nonnus adds; for it seems, there was no bucket, or vessel, fastened at the well for the common use, but everyone brought one with them, when they came to draw: though it is strange there was not one; since, according to common usage, and even of the Jews u,</p>
<p>"a public well had, קול, "a bucket", or pitcher; but a private well had no bucket:''</p>
<p><strong>and the well is deep</strong>; that which is now called Jacob's well, is by some said to be forty cubits deep, and by others thirty five yards:</p>
<p><strong>from whence then hast thou that living water</strong>? this she said in a sneering, scoffing manner: she reasoned with him, either that he must have it out of this well; but that could not be, since he had no vessel to draw with, and the well was so deep, that he could not come at the water without one; or he must have it from some neighbouring spring; upon which she scoffs at him in the following manner.</p>
