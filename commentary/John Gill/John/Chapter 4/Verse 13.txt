<p><strong>Jesus answered and said unto her</strong>,.... In a mild and gentle manner, patiently bearing all her scoffs and flouts, and continuing to instruct and inform her, concerning this living water, showing the preferableness of it to all others:</p>
<p><strong>whosoever drinketh of this water</strong>; meaning in that well called Jacob's well, or any other common water:</p>
<p><strong>shall thirst again</strong>; as this woman had often done, and would again, as she herself knew, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:15">John 4:15</span>, and as Jesus did, who very likely afterwards drank of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:28">John 19:28</span>. For though water allays heat, quenches thirst, and refreshes and revives the spirits for a while, yet in process of time, natural heat increases, and thirst returns, and there is a necessity of drinking water again.</p>
