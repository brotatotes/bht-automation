<p><strong>The woman saith unto him, Sir</strong>,....</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;</p>
<p><strong>give me this water, that I thirst not</strong>. The Syriac and Persic versions add, "again":</p>
<p><strong>neither come hither</strong>; the Ethiopic version adds here, "again";</p>
<p><strong>to draw</strong>. This she said also, in the same sneering and scoffing way, as her talking of not thirsting and coming thither to draw water, shows; and it is as if she had said, pray give me some of this fine water you talk of, that I may never thirst again; and so have no occasion to be at all this fatigue and trouble, to come daily to this well for water: though some think, that she now spoke seriously, having some little knowledge of what our Lord meant by living water, but with a mixture of much ignorance, and that she heartily desired it; but the reason she gives, shows the contrary.</p>
