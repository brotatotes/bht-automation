<p><strong>The woman answered and said, I have no husband</strong>,.... Which was a truth she would not have spoke at another time and place, or to any of her neighbours; but Christ being a stranger, and no odium incurring upon her by it; and this serving a purpose to excuse her going to call him, she declares the truth of the matter:</p>
<p><strong>Jesus said unto her, thou hast well said, I have no husband</strong>; this is the truth, it is really fact, and is the true state of the case, between thee and him, who goes for thy husband.</p>
