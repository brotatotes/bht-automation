<p><strong>Jesus saith unto her</strong>,.... Upon her making mention of the Messiah, of his coming, and of his work, he took the opportunity of making himself known unto her:</p>
<p><strong>I that speak unto thee am [he]</strong>; the Messiah; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:6">Isaiah 52:6</span>. This is a wonderful instance of the grace of Christ to this woman, that he should make himself known in so clear and plain a manner, to so mean a person, and so infamous a creature as she had been: we never find that he ever made so clear a discovery of himself, in such express terms, to any, as to her, unless it were to his immediate disciples; and these he would sometimes charge not to tell who he was.</p>
