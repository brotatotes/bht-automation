<p><strong>Therefore said the disciples one to another</strong>,.... Privately, among themselves, though in his hearing; at least he knew what they said by answer;</p>
<p><strong>hath any man</strong>; or anyone, any angel from heaven, or any of the inhabitants of the city, or any man or woman, or this woman they had found him talking with:</p>
<p><strong>brought him [ought] to eat</strong>? for they thought of nothing else but bodily food; just as when he cautioned them against the leaven of the Sadducees and Pharisees, they imagined he said it, because they had taken no bread; whereas he meant the doctrine of these persons: so dull of understanding spiritual things were the disciples themselves, that it is not so much to be wondered at that the Samaritan woman, whilst in her carnal state, when Christ spoke of living water, should understand him of material water, or spring water.</p>
