<p><strong>And he must needs go through Samaria.</strong> Not the city, but the country of Samaria; for the way to Galilee from Judea, lay through the midst of Samaria; nor was there any other way, without going a great way about; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span>; and which is also confirmed by Josephus c: and this accounts for his going through Samaria, consistently with his forbidding his apostles going in the way of the Gentiles, or into any of the cities of the Samaritans; since here was a necessity for it, or otherwise he himself would not have gone, where he forbid his disciples; though the prohibition may be understood, not of barely going into a Samaritan city; for it was lawful for them, notwithstanding that, to go into one of them, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:8">John 4:8</span>; but of going to preach there,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:5">Matthew 10:5</span>. And besides this necessity, there was another thing that lay upon him, and obliged him to take this tour, and that is, the calling and conversion of a certain woman, and other Samaritans, whom the Father had given to him, and he was to redeem by his blood; and the time of whose effectual calling was now come; and therefore he must needs go this way, and at this particular time. The Arabic and Persic versions represent it, as a purpose and determination in his mind to go this way.</p>
