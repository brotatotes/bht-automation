<p><strong>Then when he was come into Galilee</strong>,.... That part of it in which Cana lay, as appears by what follows:</p>
<p><strong>the Galilaeans received him</strong>; willingly, readily, and cheerfully, with much delight and pleasure, and with marks of great esteem and respect: they received him into their houses, and entertained him, and provided for him and his disciples:</p>
<p><strong>having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem, at the feast</strong> of the passover; the miracles he wrought there, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span>;</p>
<p><strong>for they also went unto the feast</strong>; as well as Jesus and his disciples: they kept the feast of the passover, and went yearly to Jerusalem on that account: so Josephus speaks of the Galilaeans going to the Jewish festivals at Jerusalem, when he says c;</p>
<p>"it was the custom, or usual with the Galilaeans, when they went to the holy city at the festivals, to go through the country of the Samaritans;''</p>
<p>which was the way that Christ now came from thence to them.</p>
