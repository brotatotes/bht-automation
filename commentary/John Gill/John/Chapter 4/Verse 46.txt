<p><strong>So Jesus came again unto Cana of Galilee</strong>,.... Where he had been once before; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:1">John 2:1</span>. The Syriac version here, as there, calls it "Kotne" of Galilee; and the Persic version, "Catneh" of Galilee:</p>
<p><strong>where he made the water wine</strong>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:9">John 2:9</span>;</p>
<p><strong>there was a certain nobleman</strong>; the Vulgate Latin renders it, "a petty king"; the Arabic version, and Nonnus, call him, "a royal man"; and the Syriac version renders it, "a king's servant"; with which agrees the Ethiopic, calling him "a minister, a steward, the king's domestic". The Persic version makes it to be his name, reading it, "there was a great man, whose name was Abdolmelic", which signifies a king's servant: from the whole he seems to be one that belonged to the palace of Herod Antipas, and was one of his courtiers; who, though he was but tetrarch of Galilee, yet is sometimes called a king, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:14">Mark 6:14</span>;</p>
<p><strong>whose son was sick at Capernaum</strong>; some versions, as the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic, read the phrase, "in Capernaum", with the former clause, "there was a nobleman in Capernaum": and others, as we do with this; and both may be true; for he might be an inhabitant of Capernaum, and his house be there where his son lay sick. Some think this nobleman was either Chuza, Herod's steward, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:3">Luke 8:3</span>, or Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>.</p>
