<p><strong>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea</strong>,.... For the fame of Christ, for his doctrine and miracles, was spread every where; so that it was known, and talked of, in most places, where he was, and what course he was steering: and this nobleman understanding that he had left Judea, and was come</p>
<p><strong>into Galilee</strong>; and having inquired in what parts of Galilee he was,</p>
<p><strong>he went unto him</strong>; though it was many miles from Capernaum, where Jesus was, at least a day's journey; since, when the servants met their master, the child had been healed at one o'clock the day before; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:52">John 4:52</span>. Some reckon it about fifteen miles, but one would think it should be more:</p>
<p><strong>and besought him, that he would come down</strong>; for Capernaum, though it was built on a hill, lay lower down in the country of Galilee than Cana did, near the sea of Tiberias: a like way of speaking is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:12">John 2:12</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and heal his son</strong>. The nobleman believed that Christ had power to do it, by what he had heard concerning him, but thought his corporeal presence was absolutely necessary to it:</p>
<p><strong>for he was at the point of death</strong>; or "would die": he was very near it; there was no likelihood of his recovery; the physicians had given him over; and when he left him, he seemed to be near his death, and must die for any human help that could be obtained, or natural means that could be used.</p>
