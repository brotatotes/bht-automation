<p><strong>Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar</strong>,.... Now called Neapolis d; the same with "Sichem", or "Shechem", as appears from its situation,</p>
<p><strong>near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph</strong>; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+33:18">Genesis 33:18</span>; and is either the same, only its termination is changed from "em" into "ar", as Achan into Achar, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+2:7">1 Chronicles 2:7</span>. Or it is a new name that was given it, and by which it went in the time of Christ; and might be so called, either from</p>
<p>סוכר, "Socher", which signifies a grave; because here, Joseph and the rest of the patriarchs were buried, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jos+24:32">Joshua 24:32</span>. Or rather, it was a name of reproach, and so called, from שכר, "drunken"; since the Ephraimites, the posterity of Joseph, which dwelt in these parts, were infamous for the sin of drunkenness; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:1">Isaiah 28:1</span>. Hence "Sychar Sichem", is "drunken Sichem"; mention is made in the Talmud e, of a place called סיכרא, "Sichra". The "parcel of ground", or of a "field", as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+33:19">Genesis 33:19</span>, is in the Persic version, called "a vineyard"; and so Nonnus renders it, "a field planted with vines"; and which may serve to confirm the above conjecture, concerning "Sychar" being a nickname.</p>
