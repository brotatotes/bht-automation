<p><strong>when he began to amend</strong>; or grow better; for he seemed to think, that his recovery might be gradual, and not all at once, as it was:</p>
<p><strong>and they said unto him, yesterday at the seventh hour</strong>; which was one o'clock in the afternoon:</p>
<p><strong>the fever left him</strong>; entirely at once, so that he was perfectly well immediately.</p>
