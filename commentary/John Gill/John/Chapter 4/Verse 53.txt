<p><strong>So the father knew that it was at the same hour</strong>,.... Precisely;</p>
<p><strong>in that which Jesus said to him, thy son liveth</strong>: he had observed what time of day it was, in which he conversed with Jesus; and particularly, when he told him his son was alive and well, and when he took his leave of him; and by comparing the account of his servants, with that, found that things entirely agreed, and that the cure was wrought exactly at the time, that Jesus spoke the words:</p>
<p><strong>and himself believed, and his whole house</strong>; when he came home, he related the whole affair to his family, and he and they all believed, that Jesus was the Messiah, and became his disciples and followers: if this nobleman was Chuza, Herod's steward, we have an account of his wife, whose name was Joanna, that she followed Christ, and ministered to him of her substance, with other women, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:3">Luke 8:3</span>. There is a story, told by the Jews, and which seems somewhat like to this d;</p>
<p>"it is reported concerning R. Chanina ben Dosa, that when he prayed for the sick, he used to say, זה חי, "this liveth", and this dies; it was said to him, whence knowest thou this? he replied, if my prayer be ready in my mouth, I know that he is accepted (of God, i.e. the sick man for whom he prayed); but if not, I know that he will be snatched away (by the disease):''</p>
<p>upon which the Gemarists give the following relation e;</p>
<p>"it happened that the son of Rabban Gamaliel (the Apostle Paul's master) was sick, he sent two disciples to R. Chanina ben Dosa, to ask mercy for him; when he saw them, he went up to a chamber, and sought mercy for him; and when he came down, he said unto them, לכו שחלצתו חמה, "go your way, for the fever has left him"; they said unto him, art thou a prophet? he replied, I am not a prophet, nor the son of a prophet; but so I have received, that if my prayer is ready in my mouth, I know that he is accepted; and if not, I know that he shall be snatched away; and they sat and wrote and observed "the very hour"; and when they came to Rabban Gamaliel, he said unto them, this service ye have not been wanting in, nor abounded in; but so the thing was, that in that hour the fever left him, and he asked of us water to drink.''</p>
<p>Which story perhaps is told, to vie with this miracle of Christ, and to obscure the glory of it.</p>
