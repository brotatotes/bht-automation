<p><strong>This [is] again the second miracle [that] Jesus did</strong>,.... That is, in that place, in Cana of Galilee; for otherwise, in Jerusalem and Judea, he had done many miracles, between the former and this; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span>; and so the following words explain it:</p>
<p><strong>when he was come out of Judea into Galilee</strong>; this was the first he wrought, after his coming out of Judea into Galilee, this time, and was the second that he wrought in Cana of Galilee; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span>.</p>
