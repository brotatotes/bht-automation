<p><strong>Now Jacob's well was there</strong>,.... So called, either because it was dug by him; or because he and his family made use of it, when in those parts, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:12">John 4:12</span>, though no mention is made of it elsewhere, unless any reference is had to it in the blessing of Joseph, to whom this place belonged, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:22">Genesis 49:22</span>, as Dr. Lightfoot thinks, or in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+33:28">Deuteronomy 33:28</span>, as Grotius suggests: in the Talmud f there is mention made, of עין סוכר, "the fountain of Sochar"; and may not improperly be rendered, "the well of Sychar": but whether the same with this, is not certain; that appears to be a great way from Jerusalem, as this also was, even forty miles:</p>
<p><strong>Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey</strong>; having travelled on foot, from Judea thither; and he having a body like to ours, subject to weariness, and which proves the truth and reality of it, was greatly fatigued; having very probably travelled all that morning, if not a day, or days before:</p>
<p><strong>sat thus on the well</strong>; or by it; by the side of it, upon the brink of it, as Nonnus paraphrases it, upon the bare ground. The Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions, leave out "thus"; and the Ethiopic version reads it, "there"; but it is rightly retained, and is emphatical; and signifies, that he sat like a weary person, glad to set himself down any where; and not caring how, or where, he sat to rest his weary limbs:</p>
<p><strong>and it was about the sixth hour</strong>; about twelve o'clock at noon. The Ethiopic version adds by way of explanation, and "it was then noon"; and all the Oriental versions omit ωσει, "about"; rendering it, "it was the sixth hour": and now Christ had been travelling all the morning, and it was a time of day to take some refreshment, which as yet he had not, the disciples being gone to buy food; and a time of day also, when the sun if out, and has any strength, beats with its greatest vehemence; and all which considered, it is no wonder that he should be weary, faint, and thirsty.</p>
