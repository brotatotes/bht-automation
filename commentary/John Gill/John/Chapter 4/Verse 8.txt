<p><strong>For his disciples were gone away</strong>,.... This is related, not so much to give a reason why Christ asked the woman for water, because his disciples were not present, to minister to him; but rather to show, that Christ took the opportunity, in their absence, to converse with her; partly to avoid the scandal and offence they might take, at his conversation with her, being a Samaritan; as it appears to have been astonishing to them, when they found him talking with her, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:27">John 4:27</span>. And partly, that he might not put the woman to shame and blushing before them all; he chooses to tell her of the sins of her former life, in a private way. The disciples were gone</p>
<p><strong>unto the city</strong>: to the city Sychar, which was hard by; and their business there, was</p>
<p><strong>to buy meat</strong>: for though it is said, in the following verse, that the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans; yet this is not to be understood in the strictest sense; for they had dealings with them in some respects, as will be seen hereafter; particularly their food, eatables, and drinkables, were lawful to be bought of them, and used: it is said by R. Juda bar Pazi, in the name of R. Ame g,</p>
<p>"a roasted egg of the Cuthites (or Samaritans), lo, this is lawful: says R. Jacob bar Acha, in the name of R. Lazar, the boiled victuals of the Cuthites (Samaritans), lo, these are free; this he says concerning boiled food, because it is not their custom to put wine and vinegar into it,''</p>
<p>for these were forbidden: hence it is often said h, that</p>
<p>"the unleavened bread of the Cuthites (or Samaritans), is lawful, and that a man is allowed the use of it at the passover.''</p>
<p>And there was a time when their wine was lawful; for one of their canons runs thus i;</p>
<p>"he that buys wine of the Cuthites (Samaritans), says, the two logs that I shall separate, lo, they are first fruits, c.''</p>
<p>It is indeed said in one place, R. Eliezer k</p>
<p>"that, he that eats the bread of the Cuthites (or Samaritans), is as if he eat flesh to when (who reported this) says (R. Akiba) be silent, I will not tell you what R. Eliezer thinks concerning it.''</p>
<p>Upon which the commentators serve l, that this is not to be understood strictly; cause he that eats bread of the Samaritans, does deserve stripes according to the law, but according to the constitutions of the wise men; but these, Christ and his disciples had no regard to.</p>
