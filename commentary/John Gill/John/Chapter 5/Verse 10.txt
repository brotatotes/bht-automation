<p><strong>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured</strong>,.... When they saw him, either at the place, or as he walked through the streets, with his bed on his back:</p>
<p><strong>it is the sabbath day</strong>: do not you know it? surely you forget yourself, or you would never be guilty of such an action as this;</p>
<p><strong>it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed</strong>. It was forbid by the law, to carry any burden on the sabbath day; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ne+13:15">Nehemiah 13:15</span>; for</p>
<p>"carrying out and bringing in anything, from one place to another, is said x to be work, and one of the principal works;''</p>
<p>and therefore forbid by the law, which says, "thou shall not do any work"; and one of the traditions of the elders is this y,</p>
<p>"whoever carries anything out (i.e. on the sabbath day), whether in his right hand, or in his left, in his bosom, or על כתיפו, "on his shoulder", is guilty; for so carried the Kohathites.''</p>
<p>And particularly it is said z, that</p>
<p>"he that rolls up a bed of the brasiers or tinkers (i.e. on the sabbath day) is bound to a sin offering.''</p>
<p>Which was a fold up bed, such as tinkers, and those that went from city to city to work, had; and who carried their beds with them, as the gloss observes; and were so far from being lawful to be carried by them, on the sabbath, that they might not fold them up.</p>
