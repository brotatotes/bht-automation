<p><strong>And he that was healed, wist not who he was</strong>,.... He had never seen, and perhaps had never heard of Christ before, and so knew him not; and besides, Christ gave him no opportunity of conversing with him, or so much as to ask him who he was:</p>
<p><strong>for Jesus had conveyed himself away</strong>; had slipped away, as soon as ever he had wrought the miracle:</p>
<p><strong>a multitude being in [that] place</strong>; or "from the multitude that were in [that] place"; not that he hid himself among them, and there remained undiscovered; but he passed through them, and went his way to the temple, where he found the man he had healed, as in the following verse.</p>
