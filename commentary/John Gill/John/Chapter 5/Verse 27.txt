<p><strong>And hath given him authority to execute judgment also</strong>,.... Both in his church and kingdom, in the present state of things, and at the last day, when all shall stand before his judgment seat: and that</p>
<p><strong>because he is the son of man</strong>; truly and properly man; because though he was in the form of God, and equal to him, yet became man, and was in the form of a servant: and so reads the Ethiopic version, "because the Son of God is the son of man"; and therefore the authority of executing judgment, according to the council and covenant of peace, is committed to him; or that men might have a visible judge, or be judged by one in their own nature: agreeably the Persic version renders it, "because the Son himself is he who judges the sons of men"; or rather because he is that son of man spoken of in prophecy, especially in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span>; by whom is meant the Messiah, as the Jews themselves allow f, and who was not a mere man, but the man God's fellow; and so being omniscient and omnipotent, was equal to such a work, which otherwise he would not have been; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13- :">Daniel 7:13- :</span>. The Syriac version joins this clause to the beginning of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:28">John 5:28</span>, and reads it thus, "because he is the son of man, marvel not at this"; let this be no obstruction to your faith of his quickening the dead, and having authority to execute judgment on all; since, though the son of man, he is not a mere man, but God over all, as what is next ascribed to him manifestly shows.</p>
