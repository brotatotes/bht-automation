<p><strong>I am come in my Father's name</strong>,.... Power and authority; by his consent, with his will, and according to a covenant with him: Christ came not of himself, of his own accord, by a separate power and will of his own, but was called, and sent, and came by mutual agree meat; and brought his credentials with him, doing the works and miracles which his Father gave him to finish:</p>
<p><strong>and ye receive me not</strong>; notwithstanding this they rejected him as the Messiah, and would not receive him as such; yea, traduced him as an impostor, and a deceiver:</p>
<p><strong>if another shall come in his own name</strong>; which some understand of Simon Magus, others of antichrist; rather the false Christs are intended, of whom our Lord speaks, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>, who would rise up of themselves, and not be able to give any proof of their mission; or do anything which might entitle them to the character of the Messiah, or Christ, a name they would take to themselves: and so the Ethiopic version reads, "if another shall come in my name"; saying he is Christ, or the Messiah:</p>
<p><strong>him ye will receive</strong>; as thousands of them did receive Barchocab, the false Christ, who rose up some years after in Adrian's time; and even some of their greatest Rabbins, as particularly the famous R. Akiba, who was his armour bearer: and it is easy to observe, that though they were so backward to receive, and so much prejudiced against the true Messiah, they were always forward enough to embrace a false one: and indeed to follow any, that set up himself for a temporal deliverer of them; as the instances of Theudas, and Judas of Galilee, with others, show; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:36">Acts 5:36</span>. And the true reason why they rejected Christ was, because he did not appear in outward pomp and glory, nor set up a temporal kingdom, or give out that he would deliver them from the Roman yoke.</p>
