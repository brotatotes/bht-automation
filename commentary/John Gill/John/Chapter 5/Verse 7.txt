<p><strong>The impotent man answered him, Sir</strong>,.... Which was a common and courteous way of speaking, much in use with the Jews, especially to strangers. The Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions read, "yea Lord", which is a direct answer to the question:</p>
<p><strong>I have no man</strong>; the Ethiopic version reads, "men"; he had no servant, so Nonnus, or servants, to wait upon him, and take him up in their arms, and carry him into the pool; he was a poor man, and such God is pleased to choose and call by his grace:</p>
<p><strong>when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool</strong>; that is, as soon as it is troubled by the angel, to put him in first before any other; for it was the first man only that had a cure this way:</p>
<p><strong>but while I am coming</strong>; in a slow way, by the help of his crutches, or in the best manner he could:</p>
<p><strong>another steppeth down before me</strong>; not so much disordered, or more active and nimble: so among those that wait on the ministry of the word, some are sooner in Christ, or earlier called by his grace, than others; some lie here a long time, and see one and another come to Christ, believe in him, profess his name, and are received into the church; and they still left, in an uncalled and unconverted estate.</p>
