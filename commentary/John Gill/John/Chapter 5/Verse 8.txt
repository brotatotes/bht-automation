<p><strong>Jesus saith to him, rise</strong>,.... From thy bed, or couch, on which he lay in one of the porches: and</p>
<p><strong>take up thy bed and walk</strong>; these words were spoken by the same power, as those to Lazarus, which called him out of his grave; as appears from the effect they had upon the man, who was in himself impotent, weak, and helpless.</p>
