Jesus saith to him, rise,.... From thy bed, or couch, on which he lay in one of the porches: andtake up thy bed and walk; these words were spoken by the same power, as those to Lazarus, which called him out of his grave; as appears from the effect they had upon the man, who was in himself impotent, weak, and helpless.
