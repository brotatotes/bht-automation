<p><strong>Jesus said, make the men sit down</strong>,.... The Syriac version reads, "all the men"; and the Persic version, "all the people"; men, women, and children: Christ, without reproving his disciples for their unbelief, ordered them directly to place the people upon the ground, and seat them in rows by hundreds and by fifties, in a rank and company, as persons about to take a meal:</p>
<p><strong>now there was much grass in the place</strong>; at the bottom of the mountain; and it was green, as one of the evangelists observes, it being the spring of the year, and was very commodious to sit down upon:</p>
<p><strong>so the men sat down, in number about five thousand</strong>; besides women and children, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:21">Matthew 14:21</span>, so that there was but one loaf for more than a thousand persons.</p>
