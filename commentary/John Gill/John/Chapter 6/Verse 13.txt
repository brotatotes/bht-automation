<p><strong>Therefore they gathered [them] together</strong>,.... The several broken bits of bread, which lay about upon the grass, which the people had left, after they had been sufficiently refreshed:</p>
<p><strong>and filled twelve baskets</strong>; every disciple had a basket filled:</p>
<p><strong>with the fragments of the five barley loaves</strong>; and it may be of the fishes also:</p>
<p><strong>which remained over and above unto them that had eaten</strong>; such a marvellous increase was there, through the power of Christ going along with them; insomuch that they multiplied to such a degree, either in the hands of the distributors, or of the eaters.</p>
