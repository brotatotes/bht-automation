The several broken bits of bread, which lay about upon the grass, which the people had left, after they had been sufficiently refreshed:and filled twelve baskets; every disciple had a basket filled:with the fragments of the five barley loaves; and it may be of the fishes also:which remained over and above unto them that had eaten; such a marvellous increase was there, through the power of Christ going along with them; insomuch that they multiplied to such a degree, either in the hands of the distributors, or of the eaters.
