<p><strong>Then those men</strong>,.... The five thousand men, who had been fed with the loaves and fishes:</p>
<p><strong>when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did</strong>; in feeding so many of them, with so small a quantity of food; in multiplying the provision in such a prodigious manner, that after they had eaten to the full, so many baskets of fragments were taken up:</p>
<p><strong>said, this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world</strong>; meaning that prophet, that Moses spoke of, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>; for the ancient Jews understood this passage of the Messiah, though the modern ones apply it to others; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15- :">Deuteronomy 18:15- :</span>. And these men concluded that Jesus was that prophet, or the true Messiah, from the miracle he wrought; in which he appeared, not only to be like to Moses, but greater than he.</p>
