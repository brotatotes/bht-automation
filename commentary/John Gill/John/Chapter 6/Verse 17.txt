<p><strong>And entered into a ship</strong>,.... In which they came, and was waiting for them; or into another:</p>
<p><strong>and went over the sea towards Capernaum</strong>; steered their course from Bethsaida, where they took shipping over the sea of Galilee; at least over one part of it, a creek or bay of it, as they intended, towards the city of Capernaum, which lay over against Bethsaida:</p>
<p><strong>and it was now dark</strong>; quite night, which made their voyage more uncomfortable, especially as it afterwards was tempestuous: but the worst of all was,</p>
<p><strong>and Jesus was not come to them</strong>; as they expected, and therefore were obliged to set sail and go without him.</p>
