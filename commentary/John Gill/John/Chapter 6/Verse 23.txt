<p><strong>Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias</strong>,.... A city by the sea side, built by Herod, and called so in honour of Tiberius Caesar; though the Jews give a different etymology of it; they say, it is the same with Rakkath, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jos+19:35">Joshua 19:35</span>, and that it was a fortified place from the days of Joshua, and that on one side, ימה חומתה, "the sea was its wall" d: and so Jonathan the Targumist on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+3:17">Deuteronomy 3:17</span> says, that Tiberias was near the sea of salt: this place became famous for many of the wise men that lived here; here was a famous university, and here the Misna and Jerusalem Talmud were written; and here the sanhedrim sat, after it removed from Jerusalem:</p>
<p><strong>nigh unto the place where they did eat bread</strong>; where the day before they had been fed in so miraculous a manner: the meaning is, either that Tiberias was near to the place where the miracle was wrought, or the boats from Tiberias came near that place, and both were true: so that these men that were waiting by the sea side, had an opportunity of going over in these boats in quest of Christ, to whom they were now become greatly attached, by feeding them in so wonderful a manner:</p>
<p><strong>after that the Lord had given thanks</strong>; which clause is added to show, that the multiplication of the bread, and the refreshment the men had by it, were owing to the power of Christ, and his blessing it; though this is wanting in Beza's most ancient copy, and in some others.</p>
<p>d T. Bab. Megilla, fol. 5. 2. &amp; Hieros. Megilla, fol. 70. 1.</p>
