<p><strong>When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there</strong>,.... At the sea side, at the usual place of taking boat; and having reason to think he was not on that side of the lake, but was gone from thence:</p>
<p><strong>neither his disciples</strong>; when they found that there were neither of them there, but both were gone, and considering that it was to no purpose for them to stay there:</p>
<p><strong>they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus</strong>; they might observe, that the disciples steered their course towards this place; and they knew that was a place of general resort with Christ and his disciples; therefore they took boat and came directly thither, and sought for him in the synagogue, it being on a day in which the people used to go thither; and where Christ, as often as he had opportunity, attended.</p>
