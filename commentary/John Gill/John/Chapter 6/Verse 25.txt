<p><strong>And when they had found him on the other side of the sea</strong>,.... At Capernaum, and in the synagogue there; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:59">John 6:59</span>.</p>
<p><strong>They said unto him, Rabbi</strong>; or "master", a name now much in use with the Jewish doctors, and by which they delighted to be called; and these men being convinced by the miracle, that Christ was that prophet that should come, honour him with this title, saying,</p>
<p><strong>when camest thou hither</strong>? since he did not go with his disciples, and there was no other boat that went off the night before, but that in which they went; and they came over in the first that came out that morning, and he did not come in any of them; and therefore it was amazing to them, both when and how he came, since they could not devise how he should get there by shipping, and also how he should so soon get there on foot.</p>
