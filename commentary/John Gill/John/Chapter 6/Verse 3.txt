<p><strong>And Jesus went up into a mountain</strong>,.... In a desert place near Bethsaida, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:10">Luke 9:10</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and there he sat with his disciples</strong>; partly for security from the cruelty of Herod, having just heard of the beheading of John; and partly for privacy, that he might have some conversation alone with his disciples, upon their return from off their journey; as also for the sake of rest and refreshment; and according to the custom of the Jewish doctors, which now prevailed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:10- :">Luke 9:10- :</span>, he sat with his disciples, in order to teach and instruct them.</p>
