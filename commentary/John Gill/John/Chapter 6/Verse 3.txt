And Jesus went up into a mountain,.... In a desert place near Bethsaida, Luke 9:10;and there he sat with his disciples; partly for security from the cruelty of Herod, having just heard of the beheading of John; and partly for privacy, that he might have some conversation alone with his disciples, upon their return from off their journey; as also for the sake of rest and refreshment; and according to the custom of the Jewish doctors, which now prevailed, Luke 9:10- :, he sat with his disciples, in order to teach and instruct them.
