<p><strong>They said therefore unto him</strong>,.... Seeing he proposed believing in him as the grand work of God to be done, and what is most acceptable in his sight:</p>
<p><strong>what sign showest thou then, that we may see and believe thee</strong>? The people of the Jews were always requiring signs and wonders, and when they had one and another shown them, they still sought for more, and were never satisfied; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:39">Matthew 12:39</span>. These men had lately seen various signs and miracles of Christ, as healing the sick, and feeding live thousand of them, and more, with five loaves, and two fishes; and though, for the time present, these had some influence upon them, and they were ready to believe he was that prophet; yet now, at least some of them, begin to retract, and signify, that unless some other, and greater signs were shown, they should not believe in him as the Messiah:</p>
<p><strong>what dost thou work</strong>? more than others, or Moses. They seem to make light of the miracle of the loaves, or at least require some greater sign and miracle, to engage their belief in him as the Messiah; and as they were lovers of their bellies, and expected dainties in the times of the Messiah, they seem to move for, and desire miracles of that kind to be wrought; and which sense the following words confirm.</p>
