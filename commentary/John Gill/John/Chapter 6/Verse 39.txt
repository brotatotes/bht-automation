And this is the Father's will which hath sent me,.... This explains both who he was that sent him; the Father of him, and of his people; whose sending of him does not suppose any change of place, or inequality between them, or disrespect unto him, or compulsion of him, but agreement between them, and love to the persons on whose account he was sent; and also what is the will he came to do, and is what was declared by him to Christ, when he gave the elect to him: for this expresses his secret will in the council and covenant of grace,that of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing; that is, that of all the elect which were given to Christ by his Father, in eternal election, he should not lose anyone of them, not the meanest among them, nor anything of theirs, their grace, or glory, or anything belonging to them, either to their souls or bodies, and particularly the latter;but should raise it up again at the last day; even every part of their bodies, and every dust belonging to them; their bodies being given to Christ, and redeemed by his blood, as well as their souls: so the Jews o, speaking of the resurrection, and making mention of that passage in Numbers 23:10, "who shall count the dust of Jacob?" add,"and he (i.e. God) shall order it all, ולא יתאביד כלום, "and not anything shall be lost", but all shall rise again; for, lo, it is said, Daniel 12:2, "and many of them that sleep in the dust", &c.''o Zohar in Exod. fol. 43. 4.
