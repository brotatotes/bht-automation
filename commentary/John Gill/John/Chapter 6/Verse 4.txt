<p><strong>And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</strong> This was the third passover, since our Lord's baptism, and entrance on his public ministry; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:13">John 2:13</span>. Whether Christ went up to this feast is not certain; some think he did not; but from what is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:1">John 7:1</span>, it looks as if he did: how nigh it was to the feast, cannot well be said. Thirty days before the feast, they began to talk about it; and especially in the last fifteen days, they made preparations for it, as being at hand b; and if there was now so long time to it, there was time enough for Jesus to go to it.</p>
