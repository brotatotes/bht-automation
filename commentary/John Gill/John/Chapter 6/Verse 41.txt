<p><strong>The Jews then murmured at him</strong>,.... When they found that he spoke of himself as the true bread, the bread of God, and bread of life, and as descending from heaven: and which was to be fed upon in a spiritual manner by faith, which they were ignorant of, and had no desire unto: and thus being disappointed of the delicious corporeal food they expected, they grew uneasy, and displeased,</p>
<p><strong>because he said I am the bread which came down from heaven</strong>; for though, as yet, he had not said this in so many words, and in this direct form, as afterwards, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span>; yet he had said what amounted to it, and which might be easily gathered from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:35">John 6:35</span> The Vulgate Latin reads, "I am the living bread"; and the Persic version, "I am the bread of life". And this last renders the first clause "mocked at him".</p>
