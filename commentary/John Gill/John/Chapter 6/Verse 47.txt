<p><strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you</strong>,.... This is a certain truth, and to be depended on:</p>
<p><strong>he that believeth on me hath everlasting life</strong>; not only he may have it, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:40">John 6:40</span>, and shall have it, but he has it; he has it in Christ, his head and representative; he has it in the covenant of grace; he has it in faith and hope; he has a right unto it, and a meetness for it; he has the earnest of it, the grace and Spirit of God; and he has the beginning and foretastes of it in his soul, and shall certainly enjoy it.</p>
