<p><strong>I am the living bread which came down from heaven</strong>,.... This is the same with what is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:33">John 6:33</span>, which is true of Christ, as he has life in him; and is the author and giver of life to others; and is of an heavenly original, and came from heaven to give life to men: and such is the virtue of this living and heavenly bread, that</p>
<p><strong>if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever</strong>; not a natural, but a spiritual life; a life of sanctification, which is begun here, and will be perfected hereafter; and a life of glory, which will never end:</p>
<p><strong>and the bread that I will give is my flesh</strong>; or "body", as all the Oriental versions render it. Here our Lord explains more clearly and fully what he means, under the notion of bread; and which shows, that by bread he did not design merely his doctrine, but his flesh, his human nature; though not as abstracted from his deity, but as in union with it:</p>
<p><strong>which I will give for the life of the world</strong>; and which he did by the offering up of his body, and making his soul, or giving himself an offering, a propitiatory sacrifice for sin; which was done in the most free and voluntary manner, in the room and stead of his people, to procure eternal life for them, even for the whole world of his elect; whether among Jews or Gentiles; particularly the latter are here meant, in opposition to a notion of the Jews, that the world, or the Gentiles, would receive no benefit by the Messiah when he came; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:33- :">John 6:33- :</span>.</p>
