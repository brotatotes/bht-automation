<p><strong>This is that bread which came down from heaven</strong>,.... That true bread, the bread of God, the bread of life, living bread; meaning himself, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:32">John 6:32</span>;</p>
<p><strong>not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead</strong>: this is bread of a quite different nature from that; that was only typical bread, this true; that was the bread of angels, but this is the bread of God; that came but from the air, this from the third heaven; that men ate of, and died; but whoever eats of this, lives for ever; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:49">John 6:49</span>; as follows:</p>
<p><strong>he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever</strong>;</p>
