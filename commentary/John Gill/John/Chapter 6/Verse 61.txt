<p><strong>When Jesus knew in himself</strong>,.... And of himself, without any intelligence from others, or hearing what was said, being the omniscient God:</p>
<p><strong>that his disciples murmured at it</strong>; at the doctrine he had delivered, looking upon it as absurd, incredible, and contrary to sense and reason:</p>
<p><strong>he said unto them, does this offend you</strong>? or trouble you? cannot you get over this? cannot you understand it? or account for it? if not, how will you be able to digest some other things, or reconcile them to your minds, which are less known, and more unexpected, and will appear at first sight more surprising?</p>
