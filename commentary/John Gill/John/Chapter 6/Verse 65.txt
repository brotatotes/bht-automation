<p><strong>And he said, therefore said I unto you</strong>,.... Referring to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44">John 6:44</span>, where the substance of what is here said, is there delivered; though the Ethiopic version reads, therefore I say unto you, what follows:</p>
<p><strong>that no man can come to me, except it be given him of my Father</strong>; which is the same, as to be drawn by the Father; for faith in Christ is the gift of God, and coming to him, is owing to efficacious grace, and is not the produce of man's power and freewill;</p>
