<p><strong>Philip answered him</strong>,.... Very quick and short, and in a carnal and unbelieving way:</p>
<p><strong>two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them</strong>. Two hundred pence, or "Roman denarii", which may be here meant, amount to six pounds five shillings of our money; and this sum is mentioned, because it might be the whole stock that was in the bag, or that Christ and his disciples had; or because this was a round sum, much in use among the Jews; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. Or this may be said by Philip, to show how impracticable it was to provide for such a company; that supposing they had two hundred pence to lay out in this way; though where should they have that, he suggests? yet if they had it, as much bread as that would purchase would not be sufficient:</p>
<p><strong>that everyone of them might take a little</strong>; it would be so far from giving them a meal, or proper refreshment, that everyone could not have a small bit to taste of, or in the least to stay or blunt his appetite: a penny, with the Jews, would buy as much bread as would serve ten men; so that two hundred pence would buy bread enough for two thousand men; but here were three thousand more, besides women and children, who could not have been provided for with such a sum of money.</p>
