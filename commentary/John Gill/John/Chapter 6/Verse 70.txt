<p><strong>Jesus answered them</strong>,.... The disciples, taking Peter's answer to his question, as delivered in the name of them all, and as expressing their mind and sense:</p>
<p><strong>have not I chosen you twelve</strong>; not to grace and glory, to holiness and happiness; though this was true of eleven of them, but to be apostles:</p>
<p><strong>and one of you is a devil</strong>? or like to one, is a deceiver, a liar, and a murderer, as the devil is from the beginning; all which Judas was, and appeared to be, in the betraying of his master. The Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions read, "is Satan"; which name, if given to Peter, as it once was on a certain occasion, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:23">Matthew 16:23</span>, might very well be given to Judas; who, notwithstanding his profession of faith in Christ, was in the hands and kingdom of Satan, and under his influence and power: and this our Lord said, partly that they might not too much presume upon their faith and love, and steady attachment, and be over confident of their standing; and partly, to prepare them for the apostasy of one from among them.</p>
