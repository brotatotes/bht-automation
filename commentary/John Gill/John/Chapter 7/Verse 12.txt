<p><strong>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him</strong>,.... There was a general whisper, and a private controversy and contention among the people about him, upon inquiry being made after him:</p>
<p><strong>for some said he is a good man</strong>; a man of a good principle, of a good life and conversation; and who is good, kind, and beneficent, both to the bodies and souls of men; preaches good doctrine, and does many good things:</p>
<p><strong>others said: nay</strong>, or denied him to be a good man:</p>
<p><strong>but he deceiveth the people</strong>; drawing them off from the law of Moses, teaching them to break the sabbath, setting himself up for the Messiah, and asserting himself to be the son of God.</p>
