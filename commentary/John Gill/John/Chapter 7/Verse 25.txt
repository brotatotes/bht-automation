Then said some of them of Jerusalem,.... Who were inhabitants of Jerusalem, and so are distinguished from the people, John 7:20, who came up out of the country to the feast; so Jose ben Jochanan is called איש ירושלים, "a man of Jerusalem" c; that is, an inhabitant of it: now these men living in the city, knew more of the temper and disposition, the designs and attempts, of the chief priests, Scribes, and elders, to take away the life of Christ; and therefore say,is not this he whom they seek to kill? they knew that they had formed a design to kill him, ever since the passover before the last; when he wrought the miracle referred to in the text, and that they had been ever since plotting against his life, and were now at this feast seeking an opportunity to lay hold on him and kill him.c Pirke Abot, c. 1. sect. 4, 5.
