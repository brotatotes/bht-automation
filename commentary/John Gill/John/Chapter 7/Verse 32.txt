<p><strong>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured</strong>,.... Or whispered, privately talked among themselves:</p>
<p><strong>such things concerning him</strong>; as that surely he must be the Messiah, since such wonderful things were done by him, and might also express some uneasiness and surprise, that the rulers did not receive him as such:</p>
<p><strong>and the Pharisees, and the chief priests, sent officers to take him</strong>: and bring him before the sanhedrim, by them to be condemned, and so a stop be put to the people's receiving him, and believing in him as the Messiah; fearing, that should things go on at this rate, their principles and practices would be rejected, and their persons and authority be brought into contempt.</p>
