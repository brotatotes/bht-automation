<p><strong>Then said Jesus unto them</strong>,.... To the officers that were sent to take him, and other unbelieving Jews that were about him:</p>
<p><strong>yet a little while am I with you</strong>; no longer than till the next passover, which was but about half a year at most: this he might say, partly to quicken the attention of the people to him, to make the best use and improvement of his ministry whilst they had it, since in a little time he would be removed from them; and partly to suggest to the officers that were sent to take him, that they, and their masters, need not have given themselves that trouble, for in a short time he should be gone from them, and till that time he should continue in spite of them.</p>
<p><strong>And [then] I go unto him that sent me</strong>; still confirming his mission from God, expressing his death by going, and as being voluntary, and signifying his glory and happiness after it.</p>
