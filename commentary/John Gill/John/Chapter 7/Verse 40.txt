<p><strong>Many of the people therefore</strong>,.... Of the common people, and it may be chiefly those that came out of the country:</p>
<p><strong>when they heard this saying</strong>; or discourse of Christ, on the last and great day of the feast, relating to the large measure of grace, and the effusion of the Spirit on him, that believed:</p>
<p><strong>said, of a truth this is the prophet</strong>; spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>, which some understood not of the Messiah, but of some extraordinary prophet distinct from him, who should come before him, or about the same time; or they imagined he was one of the old prophets raised from the dead, whom they also expected about the times of the Messiah: or their sense might only be, that he was a prophet, which was true, though not all the truth; they had some knowledge, though but small; and they spake of him, though but as children in understanding.</p>
