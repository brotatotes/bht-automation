<p><strong>Doth our law judge any man</strong>,.... Or condemn any man; or can any man be lawfully condemned:</p>
<p><strong>before it hear him</strong>: what he has to say for himself; is this the usual process in our courts? or is this a legal one to condemn a man unheard?</p>
<p><strong>and know what he doth</strong>? what his crimes are. This he said, having a secret respect for Christ, though he had not courage enough openly to appear for him.</p>
