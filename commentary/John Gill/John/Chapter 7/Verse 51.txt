Doth our law judge any man,.... Or condemn any man; or can any man be lawfully condemned:before it hear him: what he has to say for himself; is this the usual process in our courts? or is this a legal one to condemn a man unheard?and know what he doth? what his crimes are. This he said, having a secret respect for Christ, though he had not courage enough openly to appear for him.
