<p><strong>They answered and said unto him</strong>,.... Being displeased with him, and as reproaching him, though they could not deny, or refute what he said:</p>
<p><strong>art thou also of Galilee</strong>? a follower of Jesus of Galilee, whom, by way of contempt, they called the Galilean, and his followers Galilaeans, as Julian the apostate after them did; for otherwise they knew that Nicodemus was not of the country of Galilee;</p>
<p><strong>search and look</strong>; into the histories of former times, and especially the Scriptures:</p>
<p><strong>for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet</strong>; but this is false, for Jonah the prophet was of Gathhepher, which was in the tribe of Zebulun, which tribe was in Galilee; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+14:25">2 Kings 14:25</span>. And the Jews z themselves say, that Jonah, the son of Amittai, was, מזבולון, of "Zebulun", and that his father was of Zebulun, and his mother was of Asher a; both which tribes were in Galilee: and if no prophet had, as yet, arose from thence, it did not follow that no one should arise: besides, there is a prophecy in which it was foretold, that a prophet, and even the Messiah, the great light, should arise in Galilee; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:1">Isaiah 9:1</span>; and they themselves say, that the Messiah should be revealed in Galilee;</p>
