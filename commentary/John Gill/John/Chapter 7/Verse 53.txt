And every man went unto his own house. The officers not bringing Jesus with them, and the sanhedrim being posed with Nicodemus, broke up without doing any business, and every member of it went home: this we may suppose was about the time of the evening sacrifice: for"the great sanhedrim sat from the time of the morning daily sacrifice, to the time of the evening daily sacrifice b:''and it is said c, that"after the evening daily sacrifice, the sanhedrim went,לביתם, "to their own houses";''as they now did, and not to their booths, the feast of tabernacles being now over.b Maimon. Hilchot Sanhedrin, c. 3. sect. 1. c Piske Tosephot Sanhedrin, art. 35.
