<p><strong>And every man went unto his own house.</strong> The officers not bringing Jesus with them, and the sanhedrim being posed with Nicodemus, broke up without doing any business, and every member of it went home: this we may suppose was about the time of the evening sacrifice: for</p>
<p>"the great sanhedrim sat from the time of the morning daily sacrifice, to the time of the evening daily sacrifice b:''</p>
<p>and it is said c, that</p>
<p>"after the evening daily sacrifice, the sanhedrim went,</p>
<p>לביתם, "to their own houses";''</p>
<p>as they now did, and not to their booths, the feast of tabernacles being now over.</p>
<p>b Maimon. Hilchot Sanhedrin, c. 3. sect. 1. c Piske Tosephot Sanhedrin, art. 35.</p>
