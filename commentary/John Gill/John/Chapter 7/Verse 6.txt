<p><strong>Then Jesus said unto them</strong>,.... In answer to their solicitations and arguments used with him, to go up to the feast:</p>
<p><strong>my time is not yet come</strong>; meaning, not the time of his death, or of his exaltation and glorification, or of the showing of himself forth unto the world; though all this was true; but of his going up to this feast; as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:8">John 7:8</span>;</p>
<p><strong>but your time is always ready</strong>; intimating, they might go at any time; their lives were not in any danger, as his was, and had nothing to consult about the preservation of them; it was all one to them when they went up, whether before the feast, that they might be ready for it, or at the beginning, middle, or end of it, as to any notice that would be taken of them, unless they should be guilty of an omission of their duty; but not on any other account; which was not his case.</p>
