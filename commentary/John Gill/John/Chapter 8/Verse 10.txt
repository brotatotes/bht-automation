When Jesus had lift himself up,.... From the earth, towards which he stooped, and on which he had been writing:and saw none but the woman; that is, none of those that had brought her there, and had accused her to him:he said unto her, woman, where are those thine accusers? the Syriac and Arabic versions read only, "where are these?" these men, that brought thee here, and charged thee with this crime:hath no man condemned thee? has no one offered to do unto thee what I proposed? what, not one that could take up a stone, and cast at thee? was there not one of them free from this sin? could no man take upon him to execute this sentence?
