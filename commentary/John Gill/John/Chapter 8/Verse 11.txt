<p><strong>She saith, no man, Lord</strong>,.... No man said a word to me, or lift up his hand against me, or moved a stone at me:</p>
<p><strong>and Jesus said unto her, neither do I condemn thee</strong>; Christ came not into the world to act the part of a civil magistrate, and therefore refused to arbitrate a case, or be concerned in dividing an inheritance between two brethren, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:13">Luke 12:13</span>. Nor did he come into the world to condemn it, but that the world, through him, might be saved, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:17">John 3:17</span>; nor would he pass any other sentence on this woman, than what he had done; nor would he inflict any punishment on her himself; but suitably and agreeably to his office; as a prophet, he declares against her sin, calls her to repentance, and bids her</p>
<p><strong>go and sin no more</strong>; lest as he said to the man he cured at Bethesda's pool, a worse thing should come unto her. Wherefore the Jew s has no reason to object to this conduct of Christ, as if he acted contrary to the law, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+13:5">Deuteronomy 13:5</span>. "Thou shalt put the evil away from the midst of thee"; and also to the sanctions of all civil laws among men, which order the removal of evil, by putting delinquents to death; and he observes, that those that believe in him, do not follow him in this, but put adulterers and adulteresses to death; and that indeed, should his example and instructions take place, all courts of judicature must cease, and order be subverted among men: but it should be observed, that our Lord manifested a regard, even to the law of Moses, when he bid this woman's accusers that were without sin, to cast the first stone at her; though as for the law in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+13:5">Deuteronomy 13:5</span>, that respects a false prophet, and not an adulterer or an adulteress; nor do the civil laws of all nations require death in the case of adultery; and did they, Christ here, neither by his words nor actions, contradicts and sets aside any such laws of God or man; he left this fact to be inquired into, examined, and judged, and sentence passed by proper persons, whose business it was: as for himself, his office was not that of a civil magistrate, but of a Saviour and Redeemer; and suitably to that he acted in this case; he did not connive at the sin, he reproved for it; nor did he deny that she ought to suffer according to the law of Moses, but rather suggests she ought; but as this was not his province, he did not take upon him to pronounce any sentence of condemnation on her; but called her to repentance, and, as the merciful and compassionate Saviour, gave her reason to hope pardon and eternal life.</p>
