<p><strong>The Pharisees therefore said unto him</strong>,.... On account of his declaring himself the light of the world: these were either the same who went out of the temple, filled with remorse of conscience, and were now returned, and bearing him a grudge, came to take some advantage against him, if they could; or they were others of the same complexion, sent by them, to make their observations on him:</p>
<p><strong>thou bearest record of thyself</strong>. The Ethiopic version renders it, "dost thou thyself?" which does not seem so decent and comely; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+27:2">Proverbs 27:2</span>; though it does not follow, that what a man says of himself is not truth, as these suggest:</p>
<p><strong>thy record is not true</strong>; for John testified of himself, that he was not the Christ, nor Elias, nor that prophet; but the voice of one crying in the wilderness; and this testimony he bore of himself, at the importunity of the Jews themselves, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>; and his testimony was true; so was that which Christ bore of himself; but their sense rather seems to be, that it was not firm and authentic, and would not pass in any court of judicature, since no man can be a witness in his own cause.</p>
