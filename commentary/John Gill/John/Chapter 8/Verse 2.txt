<p><strong>And early in the morning he came again into the temple</strong>,.... Which shows his diligence, constancy, and assiduity, in his ministerial work, as well as his courage and intrepidity; being fearless of his enemies, though careful to give them no advantage against him, before his time:</p>
<p><strong>and all the people came unto him</strong>; which also commends the industry and diligence of his hearers, who were forward to hear him, and were early at the temple for that purpose, and that in great numbers:</p>
<p><strong>and he sat down and taught them</strong>; he sat, as his manner was;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; and taught them as one having authority, and such doctrine, and in such a manner, as never man did; with all plainness, boldness, and freedom.</p>
