<p><strong>These words spake Jesus in the treasury</strong>,.... The place where the thirteen chests stood, into which the people put their voluntary contributions for the sacrifices, and service of the temple: the Ethiopic version renders it, "at the alms chest";</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. The design of this observation of the evangelist, is to suggest to us, that it was in a very public place, in the temple, openiy, that Christ delivered the above words:</p>
<p><strong>as he taught in the temple</strong>; where the Jews resorted, where his ministry was public, and he spake freely, and without reserve; in a very bold manner, with intrepidity, and without fear of man:</p>
<p><strong>and no man laid hands on him</strong>; though they had sought to do it the day before; had sent officers to take him; and they themselves had a good will to it; and yet they were so awed and over ruled by one means, or one account or another, that no man did it; the reason was,</p>
<p><strong>for his hour was not yet come</strong>; the time appointed for his sufferings and death.</p>
