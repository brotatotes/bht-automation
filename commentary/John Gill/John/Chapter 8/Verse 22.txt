<p><strong>Then said the Jews, will he kill himself</strong>?.... Which was not only a wicked, but a foolish consequence, drawn from his words: for it by no means followed, because he was going away, and whither they could not come, that therefore he must destroy himself; this seems to be what they would have been glad he would have done, and suggested the thought that he might do it, in which they imitated Satan, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:6">Matthew 4:6</span>, under whose influence they now apparently were, and hoped that he would, which would at once extricate them out of their difficulties on his account:</p>
<p><strong>because he sayeth, whither I go ye cannot come</strong>: this is no reason at all; for had Christ's meaning been, as they blasphemously intimate, they might have destroyed themselves too, and have gone after him.</p>
