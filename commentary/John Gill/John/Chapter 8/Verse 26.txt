<p><strong>I have many things to say, and to judge of you</strong>,.... Being God omniscient, he knew their persons and actions, their lives and conversations, and all their sins and transgressions, which he could justly have complained of, and charged them with, and proved against them, and judged and condemned them for; but this was not his present business, he came not to judge and condemn, but to save: wherefore he waved these things, and took no notice of them, leaving them to his Father, who would call them to an account, and punish them for them:</p>
<p><strong>but he that sent me is true</strong>; as to his promises concerning the mission of his Son, to be the Saviour of sinners; so to his threatenings, to bring down vengeance on those that disbelieve him, and reject him:</p>
<p><strong>and I speak to the world</strong>, or "in the world",</p>
<p><strong>those things which I have heard of him</strong>; as concerning his love, grace, and mercy to those that should believe in him, so of the destruction of the despisers and rejecters of him; which things he spoke not in secret, in a corner, but publicly and openly, before all the world, to Jews and Gentiles, and to as many as were in the treasury, in the temple at this time; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:20">John 18:20</span>.</p>
