<p><strong>this woman was taken in adultery</strong>; by two persons at least, who could be witnesses of it; otherwise the accusation was not legal; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+19:15">Deuteronomy 19:15</span>; though in the case of a wife suspected of adultery, they admitted a single witness as valid f:</p>
<p><strong>in the very act</strong>; or "in the theft itself", for adultery is a theft; it is an unlawful use of another's property; see this word used in the same sense, in Heliodor, l. 1. sect. 11.</p>
<p>f Maimon. Hilchot Eduth, c. 5. sect. 2.</p>
