<p><strong>Jesus said unto them, if God were your Father</strong>,.... By adoption; and this was discovered by the grace of regeneration; or in other words, if they had been born of God,</p>
<p><strong>ye would love me</strong>; for in regeneration love to Christ is always implanted: it is a fruit of the Spirit, which always comes along with the superabounding grace of God in conversion; whoever are begotten again, according to abundant mercy, love an unseen Jesus; and where there is no love to Christ, there can be no regeneration: such persons are not born again; nor is God their Father, at least manifestatively:</p>
<p><strong>for I proceeded forth; and came from God</strong>; the former of these phrases is observed by many learned men to be used by the Septuagint, of a proper natural birth, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:4">Genesis 15:4</span>; and here designs the eternal generation of Christ, as the Son of God, being the only begotten of the Father, and the Son of the Father in truth and love; and the other is to be understood of his mission from him, as Mediator:</p>
<p><strong>neither came I of myself</strong>; or did not take the office to himself, without being called unto it, and invested with it, by his Father:</p>
<p><strong>but he sent me</strong>; not by force, or against the will of Christ, or by change of place, but by assumption of nature; he sent him at the time agreed upon, in human nature, to obtain eternal redemption for his people: and upon both these accounts Christ is to be loved by all regenerate persons, or who have God for their Father; both on account of his being the Son of God, of the same nature and essence with him, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:1">1 John 5:1</span>; and on account of his mission into this world, as Mediator, since he was sent, and came to be the Saviour of lost sinners.</p>
