<p><strong>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should, be stoned</strong>,.... Not in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+20:10">Leviticus 20:10</span>; for though according to the law there, an adulteress, one that was a married woman, and so an adulterer, that was a married man, were to be put to death; yet the death was not stoning, but strangling; for it is a rule with the Jews g, that where death is simply mentioned (without restraining it to any particular kind) strangling is intended, and which rule they apply to this law: and accordingly in their Misna, or oral law, one that lies with another man's wife, is reckoned among those that are to be strangled h: Kimchi indeed says i, that adulteresses, according to the law, are to be stoned with stones; but then this must be understood of such as are betrothed, but not married; and such a person, Moses has commanded in the law, to be stoned,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+22:23">Deuteronomy 22:23</span>. And with this agree the traditions of the Jews k;</p>
<p>"a daughter of Israel must be stoned, who is ולא נשואה</p>
<p>ארוסה, "betrothed, but not married".''</p>
<p>And such an one we must believe this woman was; she was betrothed to a man, but not married to him, and therefore to be stoned: the Jews l have also a saying, that</p>
<p>"if all adulterers were punished with stoning, according to the law, the stones would be consumed; but they would not be consumed;''</p>
<p>adultery was so common with that people:</p>
<p><strong>but what sayest thou</strong>? dost thou agree with Moses, or not?</p>
