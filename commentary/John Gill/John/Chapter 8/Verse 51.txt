<p><strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you</strong>,.... This is truth, and may be depended upon, as coming from the "Amen", and faithful witness:</p>
<p><strong>if a man keep my saying</strong>; or doctrine, receives the Gospel in the love of it, obeys it from his heart, and cordially embraces and firmly believes it; and retains and holds it fast, having a spiritual and comfortable experience of the doctrines of Christ, and yielding a cheerful and ready obedience to his commands and ordinances, in faith and love:</p>
<p><strong>he shall never see death</strong>; the second death, eternal death, which is an everlasting separation of a man, body and soul, from God: this death shall have no power on such a person, he shall never be hurt by it; and though he dies a corporeal death, that shall not be a curse, a penal evil to him; nor shall he always lie under the power of it, but shall rise again, and live in soul and body, for ever with the Lord: seeing and tasting death, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:52">John 8:52</span>, are Hebraisms expressive of dying.</p>
