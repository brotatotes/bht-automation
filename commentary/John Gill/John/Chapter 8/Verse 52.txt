<p><strong>Then said the Jews unto him</strong>,.... Upon these last words that he spake, giving assurance, that whoever kept his saying, should not die:</p>
<p><strong>now we know that thou hast a devil</strong>; they thought and said so before, but now they were assured, that he must be under diabolical influence, must be possessed with the devil, and mad, and out of his senses; for they thought no man in his senses would ever talk at this rate:</p>
<p><strong>Abraham is dead, and the prophets</strong>; that is, they are dead also, as the Ethiopic version adds; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+1:5">Zechariah 1:5</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and thou sayest, if a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death</strong>: Abraham and the prophets were so far from pretending by their doctrine to communicate life and secure men from death, that they could not keep themselves from dying; and therefore it must be diabolical madness and frenzy to assert anything of this kind.</p>
