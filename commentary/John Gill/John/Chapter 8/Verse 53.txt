<p><strong>Art thou greater than our father Abraham</strong>?.... So the woman of Samaria said, concerning Jacob, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:12">John 4:12</span>. The Jews had a mighty opinion of their ancestors, especially of Abraham; and yet they allow the Messiah to be greater than he, as Jesus truly was: so one of their ancient commentators w on those words of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:13">Isaiah 52:13</span> thus paraphrases them,</p>
<p>""Behold my servant shall deal prudently", this is the King Messiah; "he shall be exalted" above Abraham, as it is written, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:22">Genesis 14:22</span>, "and extolled" above Moses, as it is written, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:12">Numbers 11:12</span>, and he shall be higher than the ministering angels, as it is written, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:26">Ezekiel 1:26</span>, for he shall be גדול מן אבות, "greater than the fathers".''</p>
<p>They add here, of Abraham,</p>
<p><strong>which is dead</strong>; he was a great and good man, and yet dead:</p>
<p><strong>and the prophets are dead</strong>; though they truly kept, and faithfully delivered the word of God:</p>
<p><strong>whom makest thou thyself</strong>? who art a poor carpenter's son, a Galilean, a Nazarene, and yet makest thyself greater than Abraham, or any of the prophets; yea, makest thyself to be God, to promise security from death, and an everlasting continuance of life upon keeping thy word.</p>
