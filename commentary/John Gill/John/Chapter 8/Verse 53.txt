Art thou greater than our father Abraham?.... So the woman of Samaria said, concerning Jacob, John 4:12. The Jews had a mighty opinion of their ancestors, especially of Abraham; and yet they allow the Messiah to be greater than he, as Jesus truly was: so one of their ancient commentators w on those words of Isaiah 52:13 thus paraphrases them,""Behold my servant shall deal prudently", this is the King Messiah; "he shall be exalted" above Abraham, as it is written, Genesis 14:22, "and extolled" above Moses, as it is written, Numbers 11:12, and he shall be higher than the ministering angels, as it is written, Ezekiel 1:26, for he shall be גדול מן אבות, "greater than the fathers".''They add here, of Abraham,which is dead; he was a great and good man, and yet dead:and the prophets are dead; though they truly kept, and faithfully delivered the word of God:whom makest thou thyself? who art a poor carpenter's son, a Galilean, a Nazarene, and yet makest thyself greater than Abraham, or any of the prophets; yea, makest thyself to be God, to promise security from death, and an everlasting continuance of life upon keeping thy word.w Tachuma apud Huls. p. 321.
