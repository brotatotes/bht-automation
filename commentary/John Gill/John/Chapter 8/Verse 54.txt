<p><strong>Jesus answered, if I honour myself, my honour is nothing</strong>,.... It is empty and vain, and will not continue; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:18">2 Corinthians 10:18</span>;</p>
<p><strong>it is my Father that honoureth me</strong>: by a voice from heaven, both at his baptism, and transfiguration, declaring him to be his beloved Son, and by the works and miracles he did by him; as he afterwards also honoured him by raising him from the dead, and setting him at his own right hand, by pouring forth his Spirit on his disciples, and succeeding his Gospel in every place:</p>
<p><strong>of whom ye say that he is your God</strong>; your covenant God and Father, being the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; of this the Jews boasted. The Alexandrian copy, and some others, and all the Oriental versions read, "our God".</p>
