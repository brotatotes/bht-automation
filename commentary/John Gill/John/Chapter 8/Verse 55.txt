<p><strong>Yet ye have not known him</strong>,.... Not as the Father of Christ, nor as in Christ, whom to know is life eternal: they had no spiritual knowledge of him, nor communion with him; nor did they know truly his mind and will, nor how to worship and serve him as they ought:</p>
<p><strong>but I know him</strong>; his nature and perfections, being of the same nature, and having the same perfections with him; and his whole mind and will lying in his bosom: nor did, or does any know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom he is pleased to reveal him:</p>
<p><strong>and if I should say, I know him not, I should be a liar like unto you</strong>. Our Lord still intimates, that they were of their father the devil, and imitated him not only as a murderer, but as a liar: this is quite contrary to the character they give of themselves, for they say x, that an Israelite will not tell a lie.</p>
<p><strong>But I know him, and keep his saying</strong>: do his will, and always the things that please him, observe his law, preach his Gospel, fulfil all righteousness, and work out the salvation of men, which were the will and work of his Father he came to do.</p>
<p>x Maimon. in Misn. Pesachim, c. 8. sect. 6.</p>
