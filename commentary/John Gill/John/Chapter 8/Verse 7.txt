<p><strong>So when they continued asking him</strong>,.... For observing that he put himself in such a posture, they concluded that they had puzzled and perplexed him, and that he knew not what to say; and therefore they were more urgent for a speedy answer, hoping they should get an advantage of him; and that they should be able to expose him, and that his confusion would appear to all the people:</p>
<p><strong>he lift up himself and said unto them</strong>; having raised up himself, he looked wistly at them, and returned them this wise answer to, their confusion:</p>
<p><strong>he that is without sin among you</strong>; meaning, not that was entirely free from sin, in heart, in lip, and life; for there is no such person; the most holy man in life is not, in such sense, free from sin; but that was without any notorious sin, or was not guilty of some scandalous sin, and particularly this of adultery; which was in this age a prevailing sin, and even among their doctors; hence our Lord calls that generation an adulterous one, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:39">Matthew 12:39</span>; and which was literally true of them; with this compare <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:22">Romans 2:22</span>. Adultery increased to such a degree in this age, that they were obliged to leave off the trial of suspected wives, because their husbands were generally guilty this way; and the waters would have no effect, if the husband was criminal also: so the Jews say q,</p>
<p>"when adulterers increased, the bitter waters ceased; and Rabban Jochanan ben Zaccai (who was now living) caused them to cease.''</p>
<p>In vindication of which, he cited the passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ho+4:14">Hosea 4:14</span>; and this agrees with their own account of the times of the Messiah, and the signs thereof, among which stands this r;</p>
<p>"in the age in which the son of David comes, the house of assembly (the gloss interprets it the place where the disciples of the wise men meet to learn the law) shall become, לזונות, "a brothel house".''</p>
<p>And that this sin so greatly prevailed, our Lord well knew; and perhaps none of those Scribes and Pharisees were free from it, in one shape or another; and therefore bids him that was,</p>
<p><strong>let him first cast a stone at her</strong>; alluding to the law in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+17:7">Deuteronomy 17:7</span>, which required the hands of the witnesses to be upon a person first, to put him to death; and as Dr. Lightfoot thinks, referring to their own sense and opinion, in trying a wife suspected of adultery; that if the husband was guilty the same way, the waters would have no effect: by this answer of our Lord, he at once wrought himself out of the dilemma, they thought to distress him with; for though he passed no sentence upon the woman, and so took not upon him the judiciary power, with which they could accuse him to the Roman governor, yet he manifestly appeared to agree with Moses, that such an one deserved to be stoned; wherefore they could not charge him with being contrary to Moses; and by putting him that was without sin, to cast the first stone at her, he showed himself merciful to the woman, and to them, to be the searcher of hearts.</p>
