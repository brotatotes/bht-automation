<p><strong>And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay</strong>,.... Which was reckoned a violation of the sabbath, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:16">John 9:16</span>, and was one reason why they had the man to the Pharisees to be examined, and why they were desirous of knowing where Jesus was:</p>
<p><strong>and opened his eyes</strong>; by putting on the clay, and sending him to wash in the Pool of Siloam: nor did the miracle, nor the good done to the man, excuse with them, what they thought a breach of the sabbath.</p>
