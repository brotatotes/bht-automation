<p><strong>But the Jews did not believe concerning him</strong>,.... Not Jesus, but the blind man;</p>
<p><strong>that he had been blind, and received his sight</strong>; they imagine there was a fraud in the case, that it was collusion between Jesus and this man; that he was a man who had never been blind, but only had given out that he was, and pretended he had now received his sight from Jesus, on purpose to spread his fame, and induce people to believe he was the Messiah; and in this imagination they endeavoured to strengthen themselves and others:</p>
<p><strong>until they called the parents of him that had received his sight</strong>; they sent messengers to them, and summoned them before them, that they might examine them about this matter, hoping, they might get something out of them, which might detect the supposed fraud, and bring Jesus under disgrace.</p>
