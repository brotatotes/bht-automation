<p><strong>The man answered and said unto them</strong>,.... Very appropriately and pertinently,</p>
<p><strong>why herein is a marvellous thing</strong>; strange and unaccountable,</p>
<p><strong>that ye know not from whence he is</strong>; that you learned doctors, men of sagacity and penetration, should not be able to discern that this man is of God, is a prophet sent by him, and that there should be any doubt from whence he comes, or from whom he has his commission:</p>
<p><strong>and [yet] he hath opened mine eyes</strong>; which was so clearly and plainly the work of the Messiah, and to be done by him when he came,</p>
