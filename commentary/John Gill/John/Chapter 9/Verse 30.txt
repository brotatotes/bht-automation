The man answered and said unto them,.... Very appropriately and pertinently,why herein is a marvellous thing; strange and unaccountable,that ye know not from whence he is; that you learned doctors, men of sagacity and penetration, should not be able to discern that this man is of God, is a prophet sent by him, and that there should be any doubt from whence he comes, or from whom he has his commission:and [yet] he hath opened mine eyes; which was so clearly and plainly the work of the Messiah, and to be done by him when he came,Isaiah 35:4.
