<p><strong>Since the world began</strong>,.... εκ του αιωνος, "from eternity", or never: the phrase answers to מעולם, frequently used by the Jews m, for never; and so the Arabic version renders it, "it was never heard", c. since time was:</p>
<p><strong>was it not heard, that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind</strong> as not any physician by any natural means, or art, so not any prophet in a miraculous way, no not Moses himself; among all the miracles he wrought, which the Jews say n were seventy six, and which were two more than were wrought by all the prophets put together, this is not to be found in the list of them, nor in the catalogue of miracles done by others. Elisha indeed prayed to God to restore sight to an army smitten with blindness; but then they were persons who saw before, and were not blind from their birth. Wherefore it must follow, that Jesus, the author of this miracle, must be greater than any of the prophets, even than Moses himself, and has a greater confirmation of his mission from God, than either he or they had: and as this was a miracle in nature, it is no less a miracle in grace, that one born in the blindness and darkness of sin, ignorance, and infidelity, should have the eyes of his understanding opened, to behold divine and spiritual things.</p>
