<p><strong>To execute judgment upon all</strong>,.... Quick and dead, small and great, high and low, rich and poor, good and bad, righteous and wicked, sheep and goats; to pass the definitive sentence on each, that of absolution, life, and happiness, on his own people, and that of condemnation, death, and misery, on the wicked; which will be done in the most strict and righteous manner:</p>
<p><strong>and to convince all that are ungodly among them</strong>; those who are without God, the fear of him love to him, or faith in him; who have lived without the worship of him, or in a false worship; and particularly false teachers are here meant, the same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:4">Judges 1:4</span>; who will then be convicted in their own consciences, by that clear evidence, and full light, in which things will be set:</p>
<p><strong>of all their ungodly deeds</strong>; both against law and Gospel:</p>
<p><strong>which they have ungodly committed</strong>; which they lived in the commission of, and continually practised in a vile manner, publicly, and in defiance of heaven, and with seared consciences:</p>
<p><strong>and of all their hard [speeches], which ungodly sinners have spoken against him</strong>; either "against" God, as the Vulgate Latin version reads, against his being, his perfections, his providence, his purposes, his word, and worship; or rather against Jesus Christ the Lord, who will come to judge them, against his person and offices, his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice; his ministers and people, his truths and ordinances.</p>
