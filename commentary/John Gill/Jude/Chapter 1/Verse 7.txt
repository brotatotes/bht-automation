<p><strong>Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them</strong>,.... Admah and Zeboiim, for Zoar was spared. This is a third instance of God's vengeance on sinners; and which, like that of the Israelites, and of the angels, was after great favours had been enjoyed: these places were delightfully situated, and very fruitful, as the garden of God; they were under a form of government, had kings over them, and had lately had a very great deliverance from the kings that carried them captive, being rescued by Abraham; they had a righteous Lot among them, who was a reprover in the gate, and Abraham made intercession for them with God. But they</p>
<p><strong>in like manner giving themselves over to fornication</strong>; not as the angels, who are not capable of sinning in such a manner; though the Jews make this to be a sin of theirs, and so interpret <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+6:2">Genesis 6:2</span> i, but rather the Israelites, among whom this sin prevailed,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:8">1 Corinthians 10:8</span>; though it seems best of all to refer it to the false teachers that turned the grace of God into lasciviousness, and were very criminal this way; and then the sense is, that in like manner as they, the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, gave themselves over to the sin of fornication; wherefore these men might expect the same judgments that fell upon them, since their sin was alike; which sin is a work of the flesh, contrary to the law of God, is against the body, and attended with many evils; exposes to judgment here and hereafter, and unfits for the communion of the saints, and for the kingdom of heaven:</p>
<p><strong>and going after strange flesh</strong>; or "other flesh"; meaning not other women besides their own wives, but men; and designs that detestable and unnatural sin, which, from these people, is called sodomy to this day; and which is an exceeding great sin, contrary to the light of nature and law of God, dishonourable to human nature, and scandalous to a nation and people, and commonly prevails where idolatry and infidelity do, as among the Papists and Mahometans; and arose from idleness and fulness of bread in Sodom, and was committed in the sight of God, with great impudence: their punishment follows,</p>
<p><strong>are set forth for an example</strong>; being destroyed by fire from heaven, and their cities turned into a sulphurous lake, which continues to this day, as a monument of God's vengeance, and an example to all such who commit the same sins, and who may expect the same equitable punishment; and to all who live ungodly lives, though they may not be guilty of the same crimes; and to all that slight and reject the Gospel revelation, with whom it will be more intolerable than for Sodom and Gomorrah; and to antichrist, who bears the same name, and spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt; and particularly to all false teachers, who besides their strange doctrines, go after strange flesh:</p>
<p><strong>suffering the vengeance of eternal fire</strong>; which may be understood of that fire, with which those cities, and the inhabitants of it, were consumed; which, Philo the k Jew says, burnt till his time, and must be burning when Jude wrote this epistle. The effects of which still continues, the land being now brimstone, salt, and burning; and is an emblem and representation of hell fire, between which there is a great likeness; as in the matter of them, both being fire; in the efficient cause of them, both from the Lord; and in the instruments thereof, the angels, who, as then, will hereafter be employed in the delivery of the righteous, and in the burning of the wicked; and in the circumstance attending both, suddenly, at an unawares, when not thought of, and expected; and in the nature of them, being a destruction total, irreparable, and everlasting: and this agrees with the sentiments of the Jews, who say l, that</p>
<p>"the men of Sodom have no part or portion in the world to come, and shall not see the world to come.''</p>
<p>And says R. Isaac,</p>
<p>"Sodom is judged בדינא דגיהנם, "with the judgment of hell" m.''</p>
