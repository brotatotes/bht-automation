<p><strong>But the angel said unto him, fear not, Zacharias</strong>,.... He calls him by his name; for holy men are known to angels in person, and by name; to whom they are ministering spirits, and for whose good they are concerned; and bid him not be afraid, as the angel also said to the women at Christ's sepulchre, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:5">Matthew 28:5</span> for he saw by his countenance and gestures, that he was greatly surprised and terrified at the sight of him:</p>
<p><strong>for thy prayer is heard</strong>; which he had many years ago put up for a son; for it cannot be thought that he had been now praying for one, being in such an advanced age, and having for years past given up all hopes of one, and was even unbelieving, when he was told by the angel he should have one: prayer is sometimes immediately heard, and answered; and sometimes an answer is deferred a long time, to try the faith and patience of the saints, and to discover the more the wisdom, power, and goodness of God: or this may have regard to his present prayer, one branch of which might concern the coming of the Messiah, which was now expecting, and therefore is told, that his prayer was heard; since the angel that appeared to him, brought him the news of the conception and birth of his forerunner:</p>
<p><strong>and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son;</strong> who had been always barren, and was called so, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:7">Luke 1:7</span></p>
<p><strong>And thou shalt call his name John;</strong> in Hebrew, "Jochanan", and signifies "gracious": a fit name for one that was filled with the gifts and graces of the Spirit; and was the harbinger of the Messiah, who is full of grace and truth; and the ushered in the Messiah's kingdom, which is a dispensation of grace.</p>
