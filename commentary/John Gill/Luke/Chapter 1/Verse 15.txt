<p><strong>For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord</strong>,.... Of Jehovah, the Father; with whom, what is highly esteemed among men, is oftentimes an abomination; and of the Lord Jesus Christ, before whom he was to go, and who pronounced him a prophet, and more than a prophet, and even greater than any born of women, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:9">Matthew 11:9</span> and of the Lord, the Spirit, with whom he was filled from his mother's womb: he was great, not in birth and blood, in worldly riches and grandeur, but in gifts and grace, in his work, office, and usefulness, and in the esteem of God, and even of men too:</p>
<p><strong>and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink</strong>; which were forbidden the Nazarites, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:3">Numbers 6:3</span> where the Jews, by "wine", understand "new wine"; and by "strong drink", old wine: so all the "three Targums", of Onkelos, Jonathan ben Uzziel, and the Jerusalem, paraphrase the words there, "from wine new and old, he shall separate himself"; and they allow strong drink to a Nazarite, that has no wine in it: their canon r runs thus,</p>
<p>"three things are forbidden a Nazarite, defilement, and shaving, and whatever proceeds from the vine, whether fruit, or the refuse of fruit; but strong drink made of dates, or dried figs, and such like, is free for a Nazarite; and the strong drink which is forbidden him in the law, is strong drink made of mixture of wine.''</p>
<p>But the Hebrew word, שכר, and which is here retained by the evangelist, signifies s any sort of liquor, which is inebriating, whether it is made of fruits, or honey, or what not. The Jews had no such strong drink as ours, which we call beer or ale; but they speak of the strong drink of the Medes, which they say was an inebriating liquor, made of barley t:</p>
<p><strong>and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb</strong>; or "whilst in his mother's womb", as the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions render it: like Jeremiah, he was sanctified, set apart, and ordained to be the prophet of the Highest, before he came out of his mother's womb; and was then under such an influence of the Spirit of God, as to leap in it for joy, at the salutation of the mother of Christ to his, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:41">Luke 1:41</span> and very early appeared to have the extraordinary gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost, qualifying him for his work.</p>
