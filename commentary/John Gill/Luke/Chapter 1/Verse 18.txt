<p><strong>And Zacharias said unto the angel, whereby shall I know this</strong>?.... Notwithstanding such an appearance of an angel to him, which in those times was not so usual, and this in the holy place; and the things themselves which were told him, and these as the return of prayer; yet he distrusted, and wanted a sign, whereby he might know the truth of them, as the Jews were generally desirous of, and as the father of them was; who expressed himself in much such language, on a certain occasion, as this his son did; see</p>

<p><strong>For I am an old man</strong>; at least sixty years of age; for with the Jews, sixty years were reckoned, לזקנה, "for old age" w; and a man of these years, was accounted an old man: and the Jewish Rabbins observe x, that the word for old age in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="job+30:2">Job 30:2</span> is by "gematry, sixty"; that is, the letters of the word, numerically make so much. The Mahometan writers, as before observed on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:7">Luke 1:7</span> make him to be ninety nine years of age: he was not discharged from service; the Levites were at fifty, but not the priests; blemishes, as the Jewish writers say y, made them unfit for service, but years did not: and even the law concerning the Levites, they say z, only respected the time they carried the sanctuary from place to place, and not future generations; and that they are disqualified neither by blemishes, nor by years, only by voice, for singing of the song; but then they might be among the porters; so that they were not on that account laid aside from all service:</p>
<p><strong>and my wife well stricken in years</strong>. The Mahometan writers, as before, say, she was "eighty nine"; a like objection Abraham made, though he afterwards got over it, and was strong in faith, giving glory to God, believing in his power and faithfulness; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:17">Genesis 17:17</span>.</p>
