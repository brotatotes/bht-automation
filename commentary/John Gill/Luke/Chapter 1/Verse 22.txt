<p><strong>And when he came out, he could not speak unto them</strong>,.... Or deliver the benediction they were waiting for:</p>
<p><strong>and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple</strong>: which he made them to understand, by the gestures he used: for he beckoned unto them; nodding his head, or by some motions of his hands the Ethiopic version adds, "with his hand": or of his lips; for the signs of a dumb man are distinguished into רמיזה, and קפיצה q; the one is a sign which is expressed by the head and hands; and the other is a sign expressed by the lips: hence that rule, r</p>
<p>"a dumb man beckons, and is beckoned to; and Ben Bethira says, he moves his lips, and lips are moved to him:''</p>
<p>and remained speechless; to the time the angel fixed.</p>
