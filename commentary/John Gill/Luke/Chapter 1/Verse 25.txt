In a very gracious and bountiful manner; in giving her strength to conceive a son in her old age, and such an one that was to be great, and so useful in his day; of which her husband had doubtless informed her by writing, though he could not speak:</p>
<p><strong>in the days wherein he looked on me</strong>; with a favourable eye, with a look of love and mercy:</p>
<p><strong>he took away my reproach</strong> from among men; as barrenness was accounted, especially among the Israelites, the seed of Abraham; to whom was promised a numerous issue, as the stars in the sky, and as the sand on the sea shore, and particularly the Messiah; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+30:23">Genesis 30:23</span>.</p>
