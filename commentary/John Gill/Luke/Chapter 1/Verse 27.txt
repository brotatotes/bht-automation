<p><strong>To a virgin</strong>,.... A pure virgin, that never knew man;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> and yet</p>
<p><strong>espoused to a man whose name was Joseph</strong>; but they were not come together, nor had he taken her for his wife, and home to his house, nor had they cohabited:</p>
<p><strong>of the house of David</strong>; which, according to the grammatical construction of the words, may be connected either with the virgin, or with Joseph, to whom she was espoused; and is true of both; for they both were of the house and lineage of David: and this shows what a low condition David's family was in, that the persons that were the nearest allied to it were a carpenter, and a poor virgin; and both residing in so despicable a place as Nazareth in Galilee:</p>
<p><strong>and the virgin's name was Mary</strong>; a name frequent among the Jews, and the same with Miriam; of which name was the sister of Moses and Aaron.</p>
