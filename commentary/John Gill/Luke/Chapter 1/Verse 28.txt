<p><strong>And the angel came in unto her</strong>,.... Into her house, and into the room where she was:</p>
<p><strong>and said, hail</strong>; all health, happiness, and prosperity attend thee;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:9">Matthew 28:9</span></p>
<p><strong>thou art highly favoured</strong>; or graciously accepted, or hast obtained grace; not referring to electing, redeeming; justifying, pardoning, adopting, and sanctifying grace, which she had in common with other saints; but to that special and particular favour, in being chosen and singled out from all other women, to be the mother of the Messiah:</p>
<p><strong>the Lord is with thee</strong>; so the angel to Gideon, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+6:12">Judges 6:12</span> or "be with thee", an usual form of salutation among the Jews; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ru+2:4">Ruth 2:4</span></p>
<p><strong>thou art blessed among women</strong>; and will be pronounced so by other women, as she was by Elisabeth, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:42">Luke 1:42</span> and by another woman,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:27">Luke 11:27</span>.</p>
