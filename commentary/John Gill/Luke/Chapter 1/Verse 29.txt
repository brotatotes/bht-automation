<p><strong>And when she saw him</strong>,.... The Persic version renders it, "when Mary saw the angel"; which expresses the true sense of the words, The Vulgate Latin reads, "when she heard"; i.e. the salutation:</p>
<p><strong>she was troubled at his saying</strong>; at his speaking to her; she was surprised at the sight of him, and more at what he said to her;</p>
<p><strong>and cast in her mind</strong>, or thought and reasoned within herself,</p>
<p><strong>what manner of salutation this should be;</strong> for it was not usual with the Jews for a man to use any salutation to a woman; with them it was not lawful to be done in any shape or form; not by a messenger, nor even by her own husband u; so that Mary might well be thrown into a concern what should be the meaning of this; and especially, that she should be addressed in such language, and saluted as a peculiar favourite of God, and blessed among women.</p>
