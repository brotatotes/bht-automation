<p><strong>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob</strong>,.... Not over the Jews, the posterity of Jacob, in a literal sense; but over the whole Israel of God, consisting of Jews and Gentiles. For as his father David reigned over the Idumeans, Syrians, and others, as well as over the house of Judah and Israel, so this his son shall reign over both Jews and Gentiles: his kingdom shall be from one end of the earth to the other, even over all the elect of God; who in successive generations call themselves by the name of Jacob, and surname themselves by the name of Israel, of whatsoever nation they be; and this reign of his shall be "for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end"; referring to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:7">Isaiah 9:7</span> see also <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:44">Daniel 2:44</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:14">Daniel 7:14</span> he shall reign in the hearts of his people here unto the end of the world; and with his saints a thousand years in the new heavens and new earth; and with them to all eternity, in the ultimate glory.</p>
