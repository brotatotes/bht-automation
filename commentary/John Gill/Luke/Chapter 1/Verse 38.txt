<p><strong>And Mary said, behold the handmaid of the Lord,</strong>.... In which words she expresses her obedience of faith; she owns herself to be the handmaid of the Lord, and desires to obey him, and be submissive to him as such; and tacitly acknowledges her meanness, and great unworthiness:</p>
<p><strong>be it unto me according to thy word</strong>; she assented to what the angel said should be unto her; she earnestly desired it might be, and firmly believed it would be; she set her "Amen" to the angel's message:</p>
<p><strong>and the angel departed from her</strong>; to the heavenly regions from whence he came; to his great Lord and master, that sent him; having dispatched the business he came about, and which he was accountable to him for.</p>
