<p><strong>And it came to pass that when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary</strong>,.... Which might be before she saw her, and at some little distance from her:</p>
<p><strong>the babe leaped in her womb</strong>: which motion was not natural, but supernatural; being made at hearing the voice of Mary, who had now conceived the Messiah, whose forerunner this babe, John the Baptist, was to be; and who, by this motion, gave the first notice of his conception, which his mother Elisabeth took from hence; as he afterwards pointed him out by his finger, and by his baptism made him manifest to Israel:</p>
<p><strong>and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost</strong> not with the ordinary graces of the Spirit, for these she had been filled with before, but with extraordinary gifts, with a spirit of prophecy; by which she knew that the Messiah was conceived, and that Mary was the mother of her Lord; that many things had been told her; that she had believed them; and there would be a performance of them; and perhaps it was at this time that John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Ghost also; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:15">Luke 1:15</span>.</p>
