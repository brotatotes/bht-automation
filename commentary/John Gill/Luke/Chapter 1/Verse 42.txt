<p><strong>And she spake out with a loud voice</strong>,.... So as that all in the house might hear; she spake with great vehemency of soul, and strength of affection, being under a very powerful impression of the Spirit of God: and said,</p>
<p><strong>blessed art thou among women</strong>; the same words that the angel had said to her before, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:28">Luke 1:28</span></p>
<p><strong>and blessed is the fruit of thy womb</strong>: this is a reason why she is called blessed, because her child was blessed; being in union with a divine person, who is God over all, blessed for ever; and who has all spiritual blessings in him, and is that seed, in which all nations of the earth were to be blessed; and so is both blessed in himself, and the source of all blessedness to others. The Jews say h, that the six measures of barley, Boaz gave to Ruth, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ru+3:15">Ruth 3:15</span> signified, that six righteous men should spring from her, and among, them the Messiah; who should be blessed with six blessings, and they are these; the spirit of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and of might, the spirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord; see</p>
