<p><strong>And Mary abode with her about three months</strong>,.... That is, she continued with Elisabeth, as the Syriac and Persic versions express, about the space of three months; in which time, she had full satisfaction of the truth of the sign the angel had given her; namely, of Elisabeth's conception and pregnancy, for by this time she was ready to give birth; and she must now be fully assured, that she was with child herself: this space of three months is a term of time fixed by the Jewish doctors, to know whether a woman is with child or not, as in case of divorce or death: the rule runs thus k;</p>
<p>"every woman that is divorced, or becomes a widow, lo! she may not marry, nor be betrothed, until she waits, יום</p>
<p>תשעים, ninety days (i.e. three months), exclusive of the day in which she is divorced, or her husband dies, and of the day in which she is betrothed; that so it may be known whether she is with child or not, in order to distinguish between the seed of the former, and the seed of the second husband.''</p>
<p>And so in the case of marrying the wife of a brother, that died without issue l, and of newly married couples mistaking their spouses m:</p>
<p><strong>and returned to her own house</strong>; at Nazareth, in Galilee; and now it was, that Joseph, to whom she was betrothed, perceived she was with child; and suspecting evil, had a mind to put her away privately; but was informed by an angel of God, in a dream, of the whole matter; and was advised and encouraged to take her to wife, which he accordingly did; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:18">Matthew 1:18</span>.</p>
