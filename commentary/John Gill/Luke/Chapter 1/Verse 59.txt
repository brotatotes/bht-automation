<p><strong>And it came to pass that on the eighth day</strong>,.... The precise time fixed in the normal restitution of the ordinance of circumcision, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:12">Genesis 17:12</span> though this was not always attended to, but circumcision was sometimes deferred to another time; yet keeping the exact time was judged most commendable and praiseworthy;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:12- :">Genesis 17:12- :</span></p>
<p><strong>they came to circumcise the child</strong>; that is, the neighbours and cousins of Elisabeth, who were at the time of her delivery; eight days after they came again to be at the circumcision of the child: who was the operator is not known; nor was there any particular person appointed for this service; but any one might do it, whether ecclesiastic or laic, men or women, father or mother, or any other friend; for the rule is n,</p>
<p>"all are fit to circumcise; even an uncircumcised person, and a woman, and a minor, may circumcise in a place where there is no man; but a Gentile may not circumcise at all.''</p>
<p>The circumcision of John seems to be performed in Zacharias's house, and by one of those that came; for Zacharias, being dumb, could not say the blessing which the circumciser was obliged to say: nor indeed could he say that, which, as the father of the child, belonged to him; concerning which, take the following account o:</p>
<p>"the circumciser blesses before he circumcises, "saying", blessed is he that hath sanctified us by his precepts, and hath commanded us concerning circumcision: if he circumcises the son of his friend, or if he circumcises his own son, he blesses him with "this blessing"; and hath commanded us to circumcise a son: and the father of the son blesses with another blessing; blessed art thou, O Lord our God, the King of the world, who hath sanctified us by his precepts, and hath commanded us to enter him into the covenant of Abraham our father.----If his father is not there, they do not say this other blessing.----And if there are any standing there, they say, as he hath brought him into the covenant, so bring him to the law, and to matrimony, and to good works; and after that the father of the child, or the circumciser, or one of those that stand by, bless, "saying", blessed art thou, O Lord our God, the King of the world, who sanctified the beloved (Isaac) from the womb, c.''</p>
<p>How many of Elisabeth's neighbours and relations were present at this ceremony, is not related but the Jews require ten persons as witnesses of it; for they say p, that</p>
<p>"testimonies worthy of belief, in Israel, are ten, the witnesses of the covenant of circumcision are ten, the witnesses of a dead person ten, c.''</p>
<p>and at this time also it was usual to give the child a name, which was not by divine appointment, but was a custom that prevailed among them which took its rise from Abraham, having his name changed at the time when circumcision was enjoined him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:5">Genesis 17:5</span> and from the naming and circumcision of Isaac, mentioned together,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:3">Genesis 21:3</span></p>
<p><strong>and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father</strong>: as the neighbours of Naomi gave a name to the son of Boaz and Ruth, calling him Obed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ru+4:17">Ruth 4:17</span>. This they took upon them to do, because that Zacharias was deaf and dumb; but why they should call him by his name, cannot well be accounted for, it not being usual to call the father, and the son, by the same name; unless they were desirous of continuing the same name in the family, which had been famous in Israel for a prophet, and a priest: to call children by Gentile names was not lawful. In the Targum on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="am+6:1">Amos 6:1</span> it is said,</p>
<p>"woe to them that name their children after the names of the Gentiles.''</p>
