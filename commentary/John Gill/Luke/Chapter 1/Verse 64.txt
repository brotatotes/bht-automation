<p><strong>And his mouth was opened immediately</strong>,.... As soon as ever the child was named, and so all things accomplished which the angel had foretold;</p>
<p><strong>and his tongue loosed</strong>; the impediments of speech were removed, and the use of his tongue and lips was restored unto him:</p>
<p><strong>and he spake and praised God</strong>; for the safe delivery of his wife; for the birth of his son, the forerunner of Christ; for the conception of the Messiah; for God's gracious regards to his church and people, in these instances; and for the restoration of speech and hearing to himself, of which he had been some time deprived for his unbelief.</p>
