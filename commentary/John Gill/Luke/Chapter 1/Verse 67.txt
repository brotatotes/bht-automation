<p><strong>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost</strong>,.... With a spirit of prophecy, as his wife Elisabeth had been before, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:41">Luke 1:41</span></p>
<p><strong>and prophesied</strong> saying; the following things, relating to the Messiah, his incarnation and redemption by him; to the accomplishing of the covenant, oath, promise and mercy of God to his people; and to his son, the forerunner of Christ; and to his work and office, in the various parts and branches of it, which he should perform. Whence it appears, that the following song is of divine inspiration; and that Zacharias spake it as he was moved by the Holy Ghost, as the prophets of old did.</p>
