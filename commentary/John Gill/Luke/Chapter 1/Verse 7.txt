<p><strong>And they had no child</strong>,.... Son or daughter: and which was accounted a great infelicity: but this was not owing to the judgment of God upon them for any sins they had been guilty of, as the above character of them shows: and it had been the case of some righteous pairs before them for a great while, as Abraham and Sarah, Manoah, and his wile, Elkanah and Hannah:</p>
<p><strong>because that Elizabeth was barren</strong>; so that it was peculiarly her case, and not Zacharias's: and though God had promised the people of Israel that there should be no male nor female barren among them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+7:14">Deuteronomy 7:14</span> yet there were instances and exceptions to this general rule, as before mentioned, when it was the pleasure of God to make himself known, and magnify his power in the extraordinary conception and birth of any person; and therefore, though barrenness was reckoned a reproach to a person, there was, in this case, a particular hand of God, to answer a special purpose: the signs of sterility are, according to the Jews b, when a woman had not breasts as other women have, her voice gross, so that it could not be discerned, whether it was a man's or a woman's, c.</p>
