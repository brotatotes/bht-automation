<p><strong>That we should be saved from our enemies</strong>,.... This, and the two following verses, either contain and express the sum and substance of what God spake by the prophets; or point out the end or ends of his raising up an horn of salvation, or a Saviour for his people; namely, that they should be saved by him from their enemies: from sin, which wars against the soul, and threatens the destruction of it; from Satan, the avowed and implacable adversary of mankind; from the world, the seed of the serpent, which has always bore an enmity to the seed of the woman; from the law, the killing letter; and from death, the last enemy that is to be destroyed;</p>
<p><strong>and from the hand of all that hate us</strong>: which is only an illustration of the former sentence, or a repetition of it in other words; and designs the same as before.</p>
