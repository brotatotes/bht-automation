<p><strong>That he would grant unto us</strong>,.... What is said in this and the following verse, is the substance of the promised mercy, covenant, and oath:</p>
<p><strong>that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies</strong>, as before, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:71">Luke 1:71</span></p>
<p><strong>might serve him without fear.</strong> One principal end of deliverance from spiritual enemies by Christ, is the service of God; and nothing lays a greater obligation on men to serve the Lord, and glorify him, than redemption by Christ; nor is there any thing that makes men more zealous of good works: spiritual and evangelical service, in distinction from the legal service, and worship of God, is here meant; since it is said to be "without fear", which the threatenings and curses of the law filled men with; but being delivered from it, they become free from that spirit of bondage unto fear, it genders to; as being delivered also from sin and Satan, they are without fear of hell and damnation; and from the world, they are without fear of men; and from death, they are without fear of that, through which many under the legal dispensation, were all their lifetime subject to bondage. It is a saying of the Jews y, that:</p>
<p>"greater is he that serves from love, than he that serves from fear.''</p>
<p>But such sort of service is not of a man's self, or performed by his own power and strength, but is a "grant" from God, and owing to the influence of his Spirit and grace.</p>
