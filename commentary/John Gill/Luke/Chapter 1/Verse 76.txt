<p><strong>And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Highest</strong>,.... Here Zacharias turns himself to his son John, though an infant, and incapable of knowing what was said to him; and for the sake of those that were present, describes his office and work; and says, that he should be "called", that is, that he should "be", and be accounted a "prophet": for he was not only a preacher of Christ and his Gospel, but he also foretold the coming of the Messiah; and the vengeance that should fall on the Jewish nation, for their unfruitfulness, impenitence, and unbelief: and the Prophet "of the Highest"; that is, of God; as the Persic version renders it, of the most high God; and by whom is meant, the Lord Jesus Christ, whose prophet, harbinger, and forerunner John was; and so is a proof of Christ being the supreme, or most high God:</p>
<p><strong>for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his ways;</strong> as the angel had suggested in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:17">Luke 1:17</span> and as was prophesied of him in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:3">Isaiah 11:3</span>.</p>
