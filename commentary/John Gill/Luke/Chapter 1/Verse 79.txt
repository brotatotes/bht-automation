<p><strong>To give light to them that sit in darkness</strong>,.... God's elect among the Jews, who were not only in a state of unregeneracy, which is a state of darkness, ignorance, and unbelief; but in the darkness of the legal dispensation, and at this time under more than ordinary darkness and ignorance; having lost the knowledge of the righteousness of God, and of the spirituality of his law, the true sense of the Scriptures, and right notions of the Messiah; being led by blind guides, the Scribes and Pharisees;</p>
<p><strong>and</strong>, were as it were also,</p>
<p><strong>in the shadow of death</strong>; in a state seemingly irrecoverable, when Christ, the great light arose, and shone upon them; and communicated spiritual light, life, and heat unto them; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:2">Isaiah 9:2</span> compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:13">Matthew 4:13</span> though Christ is also a light, to lighten his chosen ones among the Gentiles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:32">Luke 2:32</span> but the Jews seem chiefly to be intended here:</p>
<p><strong>to guide our feet into the way of peace</strong>; which we knew not: not that he came to teach us how to make our peace with God, but to make peace for us, by the blood of his cross; and so by his Spirit and word, lead us into the true way of enjoying spiritual peace here, and eternal peace hereafter.</p>
