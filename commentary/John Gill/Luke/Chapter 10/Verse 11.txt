<p><strong>we do wipe against you</strong>: for a testimony against them, that they had been with them, and were rejected by them; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:14- :">Matthew 10:14- :</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:14- :">Matthew 10:14- :</span></p>
<p><strong>notwithstanding be ye sure of this</strong>; they might assure themselves of this, and which will be an aggravation of their guilt, and increase their punishment another day:</p>
