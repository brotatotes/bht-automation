<p><strong>Woe unto thee Chorazin</strong>,....</p>

<p><strong>Woe unto thee Bethsaida</strong>; a city of Galilee, a fishing town, from whence it has its name, and was the native place of those two fishermen, Peter and Andrew: very likely Chorazin was near it, since they are here, and in Matthew, mentioned together; and woe is pronounced upon them both for their impenitence and unbelief, which were attended with aggravating circumstances:</p>
<p><strong>for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you</strong>; meaning both the ministry of the word by Christ, which was with power and authority, and the miracles of Christ, which were the works of almighty power, and showed him to be the mighty God: these were not done in Tyre and Sidon, cities in Phoenicia; for though our Lord was on the borders of those places, yet not in them, they being Gentile cities, to which he was not sent, and in which he did not preach, nor do miracles; but he did both in Bethsaida and Chorazin, and they repented not of their sins; nor did they embrace his doctrine, though confirmed by miracles; whereas, in all likelihood, humanly speaking, had the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon had the like advantages,</p>
<p><strong>they had a great while ago repented</strong>: they would have repented immediately, it would have been soon visible in them, of which they would have given proof, by</p>
<p><strong>sitting in sackcloth and ashes</strong>; which was an outward token of repentance, used by penitent sinners, as by the Ninevites, and others. The same things are said at another time, and on another occasion, as here; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span></p>
