<p><strong>But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment</strong>,.... Or "in the day of judgment", as read the Syriac, Persic, Ethiopic, and Gothic versions; and as it is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:22">Matthew 11:22</span></p>
<p><strong>than for you</strong>; the inhabitants of Chorazin and Bethsaida, who will be more severely punished than these Gentile cities; for by how much greater were their light, privileges, and advantages against which they sinned, by so much will be their severer punishment.</p>
