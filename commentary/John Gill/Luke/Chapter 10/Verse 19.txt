<p><strong>Behold, I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions</strong>,.... Which may be literally understood, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:18">Mark 16:18</span>, or figuratively of the devil, and his principalities and powers, and all his emissaries, who, for their craft and cunning, and for their poisonous and hurtful nature and influence, may be compared to serpents and scorpions:</p>
<p><strong>and over all the power of the enemy</strong>; of mankind in general, and of the seed of the woman, Christ and his people in particular, Christ has a power over all his power, his whole posse of devils, even the power of the air, of which he is prince; and he communicated this power to his disciples, even to the seventy: adding,</p>
<p><strong>and nothing shall by any means, hurt you</strong>; not the most hurtful and poisonous animals, nor the most malicious persecutors on earth, nor all the devils in hell: as the former venomous creatures, when took up in their hands, should not hurt, their bodies; so the other, whatever they might be permitted to do with respect to their lives, and outward estate, should never hurt their souls, and the eternal welfare of them; nor even hinder the work of God prospering in their hands.</p>
