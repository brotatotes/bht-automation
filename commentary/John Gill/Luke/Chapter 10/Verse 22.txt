<p><strong>All things are delivered to me of my Father</strong>,.... In some ancient copies, and in the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, before these words, are read, "and turning to his disciples he said, all things", c.</p>
<p><strong>and no man knoweth who the Son is</strong> what is his name, his nature, his perfections and glory; and how he is the Son of God, his only begotten Son:</p>
<p><strong>but the Father</strong>; who begat him, and whose own, and proper Son he is:</p>
<p><strong>and who the Father is</strong>; what are his perfections, purposes, grace, greatness, mind, and will:</p>
<p><strong>but the Son</strong>; who is of him, and lay in his bosom:</p>
<p><strong>and he to whom the Son will reveal him</strong>: in himself, by his Spirit;</p>
