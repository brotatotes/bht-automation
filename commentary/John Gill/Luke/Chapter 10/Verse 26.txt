Christ, with great propriety, sends him to the law, to see and observe what was written there, what are the terms and conditions of life, as fixed there; partly, because this man, by his office and character, was an interpreter of the law; and partly, because his question was, what shall I do?</p>
<p><strong>how readest thou</strong>? in the law, every day; referring to the "Keriat Shema", the reading of the Shema, i.e. those words in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+6:4">Deuteronomy 6:4</span>, &amp;c, "Hear, O Israel, &amp;c." morning and evening i as appears by his answer</p>
