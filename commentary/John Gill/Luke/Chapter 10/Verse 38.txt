Now it came to pass as they went,.... As Christ and his disciples went from Jerusalem, having been at the feast of tabernacles, John 7:2 or at the feast of dedication, John 10:22 to some other parts of Judea:that he entered into a certain village; called Bethany, which was about fifteen furlongs, or two miles from Jerusalem, John 11:1and a certain woman named Martha. This is a common name with the Jews; hence we read of Samuel bar Martha y, and of Abba bar Martha z, and of Isaac bar Martha a; and of Martha, the daughter of Baithus b, who is said to be a rich widow; and this Martha here, is thought by Grotins to be a widow also, with whom her brother Lazarus, and sister Mary lived: though sometimes, this name was given to men; so we read of Martha, c the uncle of Rab, who had five brethren; and the same writer observes d, that it is not known whether Martha is, a man or a woman, but this is determined here:received him into her house; in a very kind and courteous manner, she being mistress of it; and having known Christ before, or at least had heard much of him, and believed in him, as the true Messiah.y T.
