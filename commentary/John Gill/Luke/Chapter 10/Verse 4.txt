<p><strong>Carry neither purse</strong>,.... The Syriac version reads, "purses, "to put money, gold, silver, and brass in; and the prohibition regards the money in the purse chiefly:</p>
<p><strong>nor scrip</strong>; the Syriac version here also reads in the plural number, "scrips", to put victuals in, provisions or any sort for their journey, which they were not to carry with them, any more than money, to buy food with</p>
<p><strong>Nor shoes</strong>; any more than those they had upon their feet;</p>

So our Lord's intention, by this order was, not to teach them incivility, or to be morose and uncourteous; but that they might dispatch their business with the utmost expedition, and rather forego some common civilities and ceremonies, than to neglect, or, in the least, to hinder a work of so much importance they were sent about: and this was the more necessary, since, according to the Jewish maxim b,</p>
<p>"prevent every man with a salutation;''</p>
<p>they saluted all that they met, which took up time, and hindered business. Some sorts of persons indeed were excused, as those who were mourners c for the dead, and such as kept fasts for rain d: but such were not these disciples; they neither mourned, nor fasted, nor could they, so long as the bridegroom was with them.</p>
