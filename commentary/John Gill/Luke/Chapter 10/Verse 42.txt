<p><strong>But one thing is needful</strong>,.... Meaning not that one dish of meat was sufficient, and there was no need of any more, in opposition to Martha's carefulness in preparing many; for this is too low a sense of the words; which yet some ancient writers have given into: but rather the hearing of the word, the Gospel of Christ, which Mary was engaged in; and which, ordinarily speaking, is necessary to the knowledge of Christ, and salvation by him, and to faith in him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:14">Romans 10:14</span> not that this is the only needful thing; nor does Christ say there is but one thing needful, but that there is one thing needful; for there are other things that are also needful, and useful, as meditation and prayer, and attendance on, and submission to the ordinances of baptism, and the Lord's supper, and all the duties of religion: but Christ's meaning seems plainly to be, that Mary hearing the word from his mouth, and at his feet, was one necessary thing, in opposition to Martha's many unnecessary ones, about which she was cumbered:</p>
<p><strong>and Mary hath chosen that good part</strong>; or "the good part", or "portion"; Christ, the sum and substance of the word she heard, and eternal life and salvation by him. God himself is said to be the portion of his people, and a good one he is, and a portion that lasts for ever; and so is Christ; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+73:26">Psalms 73:26</span> where the Septuagint use the same word as here. The heavenly inheritance also, eternal glory and happiness, is the saints' portion; it is called in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:12">Colossians 1:12</span> the part, or portion of the inheritance with the saints in light. The word answers to the Hebrew word, חלק; as in that saying of the Misnic doctors f,</p>
<p>"all Israel have, חלק, "a part", or "portion" in the world to come.''</p>
<p>All the Oriental versions add, "for herself", and this choice she made, not from the natural power of her own freewill, but as directed, influenced, and assisted by the Spirit and grace of God, and in consequence of God's eternal choice of her unto salvation by Jesus Christ: and the part she chose is, that</p>
<p><strong>which shall not be taken away from her</strong>; by men or devils: faith which comes by hearing of the word, and so every other grace of the Spirit is what can never be lost; nor an interest in God, as a covenant God, or in Christ as a Saviour, nor a right and title to, nor meetness for eternal life, nor that itself, can be taken away, or the believer ever be deprived thereof.</p>
