<p><strong>And into whatsoever house ye enter</strong>,.... When ye come into any city, town, or village,</p>
<p><strong>first say, peace be to this house</strong>: salute the inhabitants in the usual form, saying, peace be to you; wishing them all happiness and prosperity, temporal, spiritual, and eternal. This shows our Lord did not disapprove of civil salutations.</p>
