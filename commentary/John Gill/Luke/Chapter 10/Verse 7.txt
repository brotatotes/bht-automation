And in the same house remain,.... Where the sons of peace are, and the peace rests, and into which you are invited, and kindly received and used:eating and drinking such things as they give; or rather, "such things as are with them", as the Vulgate Latin renders it; or "of that which is theirs", as the Syriac version; all one, and with as much freedom, as if they were your own; the reason follows,for the labourer is worthy of his hire; what you eat and drink is your due; what you ought to have; your diet is a debt, and not a gratuity;  :-go not from house to house; as if fickle and inconstant, as if not satisfied with your lodging and entertainment, and as seeking out for other and better, or as if burdensome where they were; :-. The Jews have a proverb, expressing the inconvenience and expensiveness, and the danger of moving from place to place:"he that goes, מבית לבית, "from house to house", (loses his) shirt, (i.e. comes to distress and poverty,) from place to place (his) life e;''or he is in great danger of losing his life.e Bereshit Rabba, sect. 39. fol. 34. 3.
