<p><strong>And in the same house remain</strong>,.... Where the sons of peace are, and the peace rests, and into which you are invited, and kindly received and used:</p>
<p><strong>eating and drinking such things as they give</strong>; or rather, "such things as are with them", as the Vulgate Latin renders it; or "of that which is theirs", as the Syriac version; all one, and with as much freedom, as if they were your own; the reason follows,</p>
<p><strong>for the labourer is worthy of his hire</strong>; what you eat and drink is your due; what you ought to have; your diet is a debt, and not a gratuity; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span></p>
<p><strong>go not from house to house</strong>; as if fickle and inconstant, as if not satisfied with your lodging and entertainment, and as seeking out for other and better, or as if burdensome where they were;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. The Jews have a proverb, expressing the inconvenience and expensiveness, and the danger of moving from place to place:</p>
<p>"he that goes, מבית לבית, "from house to house", (loses his) shirt, (i.e. comes to distress and poverty,) from place to place (his) life e;''</p>
<p>or he is in great danger of losing his life.</p>
<p>e Bereshit Rabba, sect. 39. fol. 34. 3.</p>
