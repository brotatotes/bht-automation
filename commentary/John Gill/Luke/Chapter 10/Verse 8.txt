<p><strong>And into whatsoever city ye enter</strong>,.... Into whatsoever house in it ye go, and apply to for lodging and entertainment,</p>
<p><strong>and they receive you</strong>, readily and cheerfully,</p>
<p><strong>eat such things as are set before you</strong>; though ever so mean, accept of them, and do not object to them on that account, lest it should be thought you serve your own bellies, and seek to gratify your appetites; nor, on the other hand, do not think anything too good for you, or that you are burdensome and chargeable, but eat as if it were your own; nor ask questions about the cleanness and uncleanness of it, or whether it has been tithed or not; but feed upon it without any scruple.</p>
