<p><strong>For every one that asketh receiveth</strong>,.... Some indeed ask and receive not, because they ask amiss, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:3">James 4:3</span> who either apply to a wrong person, or ask in a wrong manner, or from wrong principles, or with wrong ends in view: but when a man is right in the object of prayer, and in the matter and manner of prayer, and in the end he proposes to himself, let him be what he will, of whatsoever nation, or ever mean a person, he has the petitions which he asks, either immediately, or, at least, he may be assured he shall have them in God's due time:</p>
<p><strong>and he that seeketh findeth</strong>; whoever not only prays, but makes use of means, as attendance on other ordinances, and is diligent in the use of them, sooner or later finds his account herein, and what his soul seeks for:</p>
<p><strong>and to him that knocketh it shall be opened</strong>; not only who prays heartily, and seeks diligently, but who is importunate, and will have no denial; continues knocking; though there may be some time a seeming delay, yet the door will not always be shut to him; after much knocking it will be opened; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:3- :">James 4:3- :</span></p>
