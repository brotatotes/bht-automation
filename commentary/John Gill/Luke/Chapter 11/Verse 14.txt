And he was casting out a devil,.... At a certain time, either the same that is recorded in Matthew 9:32 or in Matthew 12:22 for both of them were attended with the same effect upon the people, and with the same calumny of the Pharisees, mentioned here:and it was dumb. The Ethiopic version reads, "deaf and dumb"; that is, the devil, which possessed the man, made him both deaf and dumb; if the same as in Matthew 12:22 he was blind, as well as dumb:and it came to pass, when the devil was gone out; of the man possessed by him, by the command of Christ:the dumb spake; as other men did, and as he had done before; the cause being removed, the effect ceased:and the people wondered; at the power of Christ, and concluded that he must be the Messiah, the son of David.
