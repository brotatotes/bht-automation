<p><strong>And he was casting out a devil</strong>,.... At a certain time, either the same that is recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:32">Matthew 9:32</span> or in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:22">Matthew 12:22</span> for both of them were attended with the same effect upon the people, and with the same calumny of the Pharisees, mentioned here:</p>
<p><strong>and it was dumb</strong>. The Ethiopic version reads, "deaf and dumb"; that is, the devil, which possessed the man, made him both deaf and dumb; if the same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:22">Matthew 12:22</span> he was blind, as well as dumb:</p>
<p><strong>and it came to pass, when the devil was gone out</strong>; of the man possessed by him, by the command of Christ:</p>
<p><strong>the dumb spake</strong>; as other men did, and as he had done before; the cause being removed, the effect ceased:</p>
<p><strong>and the people wondered</strong>; at the power of Christ, and concluded that he must be the Messiah, the son of David.</p>
