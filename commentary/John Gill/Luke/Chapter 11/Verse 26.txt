<p><strong>Then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirits</strong>,.... Or "demons", as the Ethiopic version, whom he took to him as his consorts and companions, as the same version calls them.</p>
<p><strong>More wicked than himself</strong>; for it seems there are degrees of wickedness among the devils, as well as among men:</p>
<p><strong>and they enter and dwell there</strong>; the unclean spirit, and the other seven: so seven devils were in Mary Magdalene, and a legion in another man; and indeed the evil heart of man is an habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit: here it may chiefly design the place and power which the devil had among the Jews before their destruction:</p>
<p><strong>and the last state of that man is worse than the first</strong>; the Persic version adds, "and more miserable"; as was the case of the Jews, to which this parable refers; as appears by what is subjoined in Matthew, which manifestly applies it to them,</p>
<p><strong>even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation</strong>;</p>
