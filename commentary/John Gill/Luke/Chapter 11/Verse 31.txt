<p><strong>The queen of the south</strong>,.... That is, the queen of Sheba, which was a country of Arabia, which lay south of Judea; of whom it is said, that</p>
<p><strong>she shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them</strong>: the sense is, that at the last day, when all shall rise from the dead, both Jews and Gentiles, this Heathen queen shall rise together with the men of the present generation among the Jews, stand in judgment with them, and against them; and that her conduct would be brought as an evidence against them, and be improved as an aggravation of their condemnation:</p>
<p><strong>for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold a greater than Solomon is here</strong>: the difference between them, and what aggravates the case is, that she was a Gentile that knew not God, they were Jews, his professing people; she came from afar, they were near, upon the spot, where Christ was, he was preaching in their streets, temple, and synagogues; she came to hear only natural or moral wisdom, but they might have heard spiritual and heavenly wisdom, with which eternal happiness is connected; she came to hear only a mere man, but they might have heard him who is the wisdom of God, and the only wise God, and our Saviour; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
