<p><strong>No man when he hath lighted a candle</strong>,.... These words are often repeated by Christ on different occasions,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> and</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> and here seem to design the free, open, and clear ministry of Christ, who excelled Solomon in wisdom, and Jonas in powerful preaching. It being as a candle, which, when lighted, no man</p>
<p><strong>putteth in a secret place</strong>; as under a bed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:21">Mark 4:21</span> where it cannot be seen, and its light be of any use:</p>
<p><strong>neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come may see the light</strong>; intimating, that Christ and his disciples did not preach in corners, or in private houses, and secret places, but in the streets of the city, and in the temples and synagogues, the public places of worship: and therefore the Jews were the more inexcusable, that they did not attend to the ministry of the word; and this would be their condemnation, that light was come among them, and they preferred darkness to it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span>.</p>
