<p><strong>If thy whole body therefore be full of light</strong>,.... That is, if the whole soul, as the Ethiopic version reads, be full of Gospel light, through the illuminating influences of the blessed Spirit accompanying the word:</p>
<p><strong>having no part dark</strong>; every power and faculty of the soul being affected with it, and influenced by it, though, as yet, the light and knowledge of evangelical things is not perfect in any:</p>
<p><strong>the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light</strong>; the whole soul shall be as full of light and joy, which the Gospel always brings with it, as a room is full of light, when a candle is lighted, and shines brightly, and burns clearly in it.</p>
