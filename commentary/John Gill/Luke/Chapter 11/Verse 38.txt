<p><strong>And when the Pharisee saw it</strong>,.... That Christ laid himself down on one of the couches and began to eat:</p>
<p><strong>he marvelled</strong>; that so great a prophet as he was, and a man of so much religion and holiness, should show no regard to a common custom with them, and which was one of the traditions of their elders, and which they put upon a level with the commands of God. The Vulgate Latin version, and so Beza's most ancient copy, and another exemplar, read, "he began to say, thinking" (or judging) "within himself": he was "moved" at it, as the Persic version renders it; he was filled with astonishment and indignation,</p>
<p><strong>that he had not first washed before dinner</strong>; especially since he had been in a crowd of people, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:29">Luke 11:29</span> for the Pharisees not only washed their hands, by immersing them up to the elbow before eating; but when they had been at market, or among any large number of people, or had reason to think they had, or feared they had touched any unclean person or thing, they immersed themselves all over in water: and which is the sense of the word βαπτιζομαι, here used; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:29- :">Luke 11:29- :</span>,</p>
