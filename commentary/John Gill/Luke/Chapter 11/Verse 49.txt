The Persic version reads, "lo, I send to you", as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:34">Matthew 23:34</span>,</p>
<p><strong>and some of them they shall slay and persecute</strong>; some of them they shall put to death, and others they shall persecute from one place to another; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:34- :">Matthew 23:34- :</span>.</p>
