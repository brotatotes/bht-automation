And he said unto them, which of you shall have a friend,.... A neighbour, or acquaintance:and shall go unto him at midnight; which may seem a very unseasonable time, and which nothing but real distress, not knowing what otherwise to do, would put a man upon:and say unto him, friend, lend me three loaves: it was usual of the Jews to borrow bread of one another, and certain rules are laid down, when, and on what condition, this is to be done; as for instance, on a sabbath day k,"a man may ask of his friend vessels of wine, and vessels of oil, only he must not say, lend me: and so a woman,מחבירתה ככרות, "bread of her friend".''Again l,"so said Hillell, let not a woman lend ככר לחברתה "bread to her friend", till she has fixed the price; lest wheat should be dearer, and they should be found coming into the practice of usury.''For what was lent, could not be demanded again under thirty days m.k Misn.
