<p><strong>And he said unto them, which of you shall have a friend</strong>,.... A neighbour, or acquaintance:</p>
<p><strong>and shall go unto him at midnight</strong>; which may seem a very unseasonable time, and which nothing but real distress, not knowing what otherwise to do, would put a man upon:</p>
<p><strong>and say unto him, friend, lend me three loaves</strong>: it was usual of the Jews to borrow bread of one another, and certain rules are laid down, when, and on what condition, this is to be done; as for instance, on a sabbath day k,</p>
<p>"a man may ask of his friend vessels of wine, and vessels of oil, only he must not say, lend me: and so a woman,</p>
<p>מחבירתה ככרות, "bread of her friend".''</p>
<p>Again l,</p>
<p>"so said Hillell, let not a woman lend ככר לחברתה "bread to her friend", till she has fixed the price; lest wheat should be dearer, and they should be found coming into the practice of usury.''</p>
<p>For what was lent, could not be demanded again under thirty days m.</p>
