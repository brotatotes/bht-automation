From the blood of Abel,.... "Righteous Abel", as inMatthew 23:35 and so read the Arabic version here, and two manuscripts in the Bodleian library, and three of Stephens's copies; the Persic version renders it, "innocent Abel": he is mentioned because he was the first man that was slain, and he was slain because of his righteousness.Unto the blood of Zacharias; in the Cambridge copy of Beza's, it is added, "the son of Barachias", as in Matthew 23:35 and so the Arabic version, "the son of Barasciah"; who he was,Matthew 23:35- :which perished between the altar and the temple; or "the house", that is, the holy place: and the Ethiopic version renders it, "the holy house"; here he died, being slain by the Jews; see the note, as before.Verily I say unto you, it shall be required of this generation; as it was at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem.
