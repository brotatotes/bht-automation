<p><strong>And as he said these things unto them</strong>,.... Denounced the above woes upon them, charging them with the above crimes, and threatening them with divine vengeance:</p>
<p><strong>the Scribes and Pharisees began to urge him vehemently</strong>; to fall upon him with their tongues, and express great rage, wrath, and virulence against him:</p>
<p><strong>and to provoke him to speak of many things</strong>; they put questions to him, and urged him to answer them, and did all they could to irritate him to say things that they could improve against him, to draw words out of his mouth, and then wrest and pervert them.</p>
