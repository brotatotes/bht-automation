Laying wait for him,.... To ensnare and entangle him, watching his words, observing what he said, and laying hold thereon:and seeking to catch something out of his mouth; like beasts of prey, or hunters, that were watching for their prey; or lay ambush, diligently looking out, and greedily catching at every thing they thought for their purpose:that they might accuse him; either of heresy or sedition, to the Jewish sanhedrim, or the Roman governor.
