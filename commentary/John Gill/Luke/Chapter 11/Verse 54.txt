<p><strong>Laying wait for him</strong>,.... To ensnare and entangle him, watching his words, observing what he said, and laying hold thereon:</p>
<p><strong>and seeking to catch something out of his mouth</strong>; like beasts of prey, or hunters, that were watching for their prey; or lay ambush, diligently looking out, and greedily catching at every thing they thought for their purpose:</p>
<p><strong>that they might accuse him</strong>; either of heresy or sedition, to the Jewish sanhedrim, or the Roman governor.</p>
