For a friend of mine in his journey,.... Or "out of the way"; having lost his way, being benighted; and has rambled about for some time, and at length,is come to me; for lodging and entertainment:and I have nothing to set before him; to refresh him with, after such a fatigue, before he goes to bed, which was very requisite and proper.
