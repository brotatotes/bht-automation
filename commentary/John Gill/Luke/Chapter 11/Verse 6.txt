<p><strong>For a friend of mine in his journey</strong>,.... Or "out of the way"; having lost his way, being benighted; and has rambled about for some time, and at length,</p>
<p><strong>is come to me</strong>; for lodging and entertainment:</p>
<p><strong>and I have nothing to set before him</strong>; to refresh him with, after such a fatigue, before he goes to bed, which was very requisite and proper.</p>
