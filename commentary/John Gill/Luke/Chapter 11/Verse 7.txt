And he from within shall answer and say,.... The friend within doors, shall reply to him that is without at his door, in the street:trouble me not; by knocking at the door, and importuning to rise and lend loaves; whereby his rest would be disturbed, and trouble given him;the door is now shut; being very late at night, and which could not be opened without noise and inconvenience:and my children are with me in bed: sleeping, as the Persic version adds; there were none, children, or servants up, to let him in:I cannot rise; without disturbing them:and give thee; the loaves desired.
