<p><strong>And he from within shall answer and say</strong>,.... The friend within doors, shall reply to him that is without at his door, in the street:</p>
<p><strong>trouble me not</strong>; by knocking at the door, and importuning to rise and lend loaves; whereby his rest would be disturbed, and trouble given him;</p>
<p><strong>the door is now shut</strong>; being very late at night, and which could not be opened without noise and inconvenience:</p>
<p><strong>and my children are with me in bed</strong>: sleeping, as the Persic version adds; there were none, children, or servants up, to let him in:</p>
<p><strong>I cannot rise</strong>; without disturbing them:</p>
<p><strong>and give thee</strong>; the loaves desired.</p>
