<p><strong>I say unto you</strong>,.... This is the accommodation of the parable; to these words are premised, in the Vulgate Latin version, the following, "if he continue knocking":</p>
<p><strong>though he will not rise and give him, because he is a friend</strong>; though mere friendship will not influence and engage him to rise from his bed, at such an unseasonable time, and fulfil the request of his friend;</p>
<p><strong>yet because of his importunity, he will rise and give him as many as he needeth</strong>: as he asks for, or more, if necessary: the design of this parable, is the same with that of the widow and the unjust judge, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:1">Luke 18:1</span> which is to show the force of importunity, where friendship, as here, and the fear of God, and regard of men, which were wanting there, have no influence; and so to encourage to constancy and perseverance in prayer, with earnestness; taking no denial at the hand of God, but still continuing to make pressing instances.</p>
