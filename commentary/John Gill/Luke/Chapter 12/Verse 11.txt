<p><strong>Take ye no thought how, or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say</strong>; be not anxiously concerned, neither about the manner, nor the matter of your answer, apology, and defence: in the first part of this clause, the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, only read, "how"; and the Arabic version only, "what";</p>
