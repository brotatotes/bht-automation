<p><strong>The life is more than meat</strong>,.... What in Matthew is put by way of question, is here strongly affirmed; and these words contain a reason or argument to dissuade from an anxious, distressing thought and care about the necessaries, conveniencies, and comforts of life: and all the Oriental versions read, "for", or "seeing the life is more than meat"; that is, it is more excellent and valuable in its own nature, being that for the support of which meat is provided; and seeing God is the author and giver of life, it need not be doubted but he will give meat for the maintenance and continuance of it, so long as is his pleasure it should subsist.</p>
<p><strong>And the body is more than raiment</strong>; it is of more worth than the richest clothing that can be had; the finest piece of embroidery is not comparable to the curious workmanship of the body,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+139:15">Psalms 139:15</span> and he that has so curiously wrought that, will not fail to provide suitable and proper clothing for it; and therefore there ought to be no anxiety on this account; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+139:15- :">Psalms 139:15- :</span>.</p>
