<p><strong>If ye then be not able to do that which is least</strong>,.... As to make the smallest addition to a man's stature, or rather to add one moment to his days:</p>
<p><strong>why take ye thought for the rest</strong>? which are much greater, as to preserve the body in its whole bulk, and all its parts, or for the feeding and clothing of it, or rather for the continuation and preservation of life to any length of time; for if it cannot be by all a man's care and solicitude lengthened out one moment longer than is the pleasure of God, how should it be by such anxiety continued for months and years?</p>
