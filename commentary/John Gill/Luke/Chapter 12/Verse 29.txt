<p><strong>neither be ye of doubtful minds</strong>; questioning and distrusting that ye shall have any thing to eat or drink: be not fickle, unstable, and inconstant, and wandering in your thoughts about these things, like the meteors in the air, which are carried about here and there; let not your minds be disturbed and distracted about them; or be anxiously solicitous for them; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
