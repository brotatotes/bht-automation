<p><strong>Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness</strong>,.... In the most private manner, to one another:</p>
<p><strong>shall be heard in the light</strong>; which makes all things manifest, the day shall declare it:</p>
<p><strong>and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets</strong>; whispered to persons in their bedchambers, and places of the most secret retirement;</p>
<p><strong>shall be proclaimed upon the housetops</strong>; declared in the most public manner: in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:27">Matthew 10:27</span> these words are so expressed, as to carry in them such a sense as this; that what was told the disciples by Christ, in the most private place and way, should be published by them, in the most free and open manner; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:27- :">Matthew 10:27- :</span>.</p>
