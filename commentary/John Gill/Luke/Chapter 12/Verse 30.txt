<p><strong>For all these things do the nations of the world seek after</strong>,.... That is, the Gentiles, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:32">Matthew 6:32</span> who are frequently, in the Jewish writings, called, in distinction from the Jews, אומות העולם, "the nations of the world" s. This is an argument used to dissuade from an immediate and anxious concern for food and raiment, because it is Heathenish, and therefore very unbecoming the disciples and followers of Christ: it need not be wondered at in those that know not God, and do not acknowledge his providence, and are strangers to his covenant and promises; but must be very unsuitable to the characters of such who know that godliness has the promise of this life, and of that which is to come:</p>
<p><strong>and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things</strong>; and therefore it is needless to be so anxious about them: the Persic version reads, "all these things", and so some copies; that is, meat, drink, and clothing, all the necessaries of life;</p>
