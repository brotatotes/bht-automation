<p><strong>But rather seek ye the kingdom of God</strong>,.... The Vulgate Latin version adds, "first", as also, "and his righteousness", as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:33">Matthew 6:33</span> and the Ethiopic version reads, "seek his kingdom and righteousness" meaning either the grace of God, which is not meat and drink, but righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span> or the heavenly glory; unless the Gospel, and the dispensation of it, which is the Messiah's kingdom, and which was then just ushering in, should rather be intended.</p>
<p><strong>And all these things shall be added unto you</strong>; food and raiment, which are as much as can be enjoyed; and godliness with these, and contentment with them, is great gain; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17- :">Romans 14:17- :</span>.</p>
