<p><strong>Sell that ye have, and give alms</strong>,.... Since they had a kingdom bequeathed them by their heavenly Father, they should be so far from indulging an anxious care about food and raiment, that when there was a call in providence for it, and rather than the poor should go without a supply, it became them to sell their houses and lands, and whatever possessions they had, and relieve them; and so they did not long after; for some of those who sold their estates, and brought the money to the apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:34">Acts 4:34</span>, might be now present; and the more readily and cheerfully do what they did, remembering these words of Christ:</p>
<p><strong>provide yourselves bags which wax not old</strong>; as do the bags of misers: their bag is, צרור נקוב, "a bag pierced through", or that has a hole in it, which lets the money out as it is put in, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="hag+1:6">Haggai 1:6</span> and which the Targum renders by, למארתא, "for a curse"; as money hoarded up in bags by covetous persons generally is: Christ would have his followers put their money up in other bags; not in such which rot through age, or are worn out, and are full of holes through use; but into the hands and bellies of the poor, the fruit and reward of which will always abide;</p>
<p><strong>a treasure in the heavens that faileth not</strong>: whereas treasure on earth does, being either taken away from the possessors of it by various ways, or they from that:</p>
<p><strong>where no thief approacheth</strong>; can come near to steal it away, which is often the case here on earth:</p>
<p><strong>neither moth corrupteth</strong>; as it does the best of garments, wore by men: but the robes of glory and immortality can never be corrupted:</p>
