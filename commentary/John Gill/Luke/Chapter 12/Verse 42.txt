<p><strong>And the Lord said, who then is that faithful and wise steward</strong>,.... Christ does not directly, and in express words, answer to Peter's question, but suggests, that though he intended it as a caution to all his people, and in it spoke to them all to be upon their watch and guard, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:37">Mark 13:37</span> yet that he had a special regard to them, his apostles, and succeeding ministers of the Gospel, whose characters, office, work, dignity, and honour, are here described. Such are stewards in Christ's family, they are entrusted with the stores and provisions of his house, and "faithfulness" and "wisdom" are requisite in them; the one, that they do not corrupt and adulterate the word of God, and mix it with human doctrines, but that they deliver it out pure and sincere as it is; and the other, that they may rightly divide it, and wisely distribute it:</p>
<p><strong>whom his Lord shall make ruler over his household</strong>: Christ's "household", or family, is his church, over which the ministers of the Gospel are appointed "rulers", to govern the house according to the laws of Christ, and keep every thing in good decorum and order; and particularly their work, and which agrees to their character as stewards is,</p>
<p><strong>to give them their portion of meat in due season</strong>: in doing which they answer the characters of faithful and wise stewards: they are faithful who give out the whole portion allotted, without adulterating it, or keeping back any part of it; and they are wise, who deliver it to them in proper time and season. The word translated "portion of meat", is only used in this place, and is rendered in the Vulgate Latin version, "a measure of wheat"; but it may be applied to any food in general, and an allotment of it; and signifies such a portion as was given to servants for one month, or rather every day; and may signify that portion of the word of God, and the interpretation of it, which is to be given forth every Lord's day to his people, suitable to their condition, cases, and circumstances. The Septuagint translators use the verb in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+47:12">Genesis 47:12</span> who render the text thus, "and Joseph, εσιτομετρει, measured out to his father", and to "his brethren, and to all the house of father, wheat", or bread, "according to their persons", i.e. the number of them: to which passage there may be some reference here; at least it serves to illustrate this; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+47:12- :">Genesis 47:12- :</span>.</p>
