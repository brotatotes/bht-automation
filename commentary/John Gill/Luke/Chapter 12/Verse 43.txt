<p><strong>Blessed is that servant</strong>,.... Who is faithful and wise, rules well, and discharges his trust with integrity, and disposes of the provisions of the house, in his hands, with great discretion and prudence:</p>
<p><strong>whom his Lord, when he cometh</strong>; to take vengeance on the wicked Jews, or by death, or at judgment:</p>
<p><strong>shall find so doing</strong>; behaving as a good ruler, and as a wise and faithful steward.</p>
