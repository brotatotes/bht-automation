Blessed is that servant,.... Who is faithful and wise, rules well, and discharges his trust with integrity, and disposes of the provisions of the house, in his hands, with great discretion and prudence:whom his Lord, when he cometh; to take vengeance on the wicked Jews, or by death, or at judgment:shall find so doing; behaving as a good ruler, and as a wise and faithful steward.
