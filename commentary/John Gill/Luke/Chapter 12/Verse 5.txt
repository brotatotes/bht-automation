But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear, I will be your monitor, and direct you to the proper object of fear and reverence, and whom you should be careful to displease and offend:fear him, which after he hath killed; your body, as the Persic version adds; hath taken away the life of it, by separating soul and body asunder, by sending one disease or another, or death in one shape or another:hath power to cast into hell; your soul, as the above version also adds; yea, to destroy both body and soul in hell, as in :-yea, I say unto you, fear him; and none else, not with a servile, but with a filial fear.
