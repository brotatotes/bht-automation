<p><strong>And he said also to the people</strong>,.... For what Christ had before said, were chiefly, if not solely, directed to his disciples; but now he turned himself to the innumerable multitude that were about him, and particularly addressed himself to the Scribes and Pharisees that were among them:</p>
<p><strong>when ye see a cloud rise out of the west</strong>; the watery vapours being attracted by the heat of the sun, out of the Mediterranean Sea, which lies west of the land of Judea, and formed into a cloud, and drove by the wind:</p>
<p><strong>straightway ye say there comes a shower</strong>; as soon as it is seen, it is presently concluded and affirmed, that a very heavy shower will soon fall, it having been frequently observed so to do, when this has been the case:</p>
<p><strong>and so it is</strong>; for the most part, there commonly follows a large shower on such an appearance, and they were seldom mistaken in their conclusions.</p>
