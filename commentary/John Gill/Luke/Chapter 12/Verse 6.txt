<p><strong>Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings</strong>,.... As two were sold for one farthing, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; so in buying and selling, where more money is laid out, things are bought cheaper; the Persic version reads, "for two barley corns":</p>
<p><strong>and not one of them is forgotten before God</strong>; a single sparrow, a bird of little value and worth, is taken notice and care of by him; it has its life from him, and is provided for with food by him, and is under his protection; nor does he ever forget it, nor can any thing be done to it, without his permission; it cannot be struck, so as to cause it to fall on the ground, or be taken in a snare, or be killed in any shape, without the knowledge of God: his providence reaches to the minutest creatures and things, and much more then to rational creatures, to men; and still more to his dear children, ministers, and apostles.</p>
