<p><strong>Also I say unto you</strong>, c. The same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:32">Matthew 10:32</span></p>
<p><strong>whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of God</strong> only instead of I, he here calls himself "the son of man"; and instead of "before my Father which is in heaven", here it is, "before the angels of God"; who will accompany Christ when he comes to judgment, and will be present, when he shall acknowledge his true followers as the blessed of his Father, the chosen of God, his redeemed and sanctified ones; and reject others before his Father, and the whole universe of rational beings: it is said in the Targum on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="so+1:15">Song of Solomon 1:15</span>.</p>
<p>"when the children of Israel do the will of their king, he by his word (the Logos) praises them in the family of the holy angels.''</p>
<p>This Christ, the eternal word, will do at the great day.</p>
