And he was teaching in one of the synagogues,.... That is Jesus, as the Syriac and Persic versions express it; which was his work, he being a teacher sent from God, and who took all opportunities of instructing men in the truths of the Gospel; this was done either in Galilee, or in Judea, in one of the synagogues of some city there, for in their larger cities there were more synagogues than one. In Jerusalem, we are told o, there were three hundred and ninety four synagogues; and other writers p increase their number, and say, there were four hundred and eighty: and it wason the sabbath; which was now in force, and was religiously observed by Christ.o T.
