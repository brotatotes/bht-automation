<p><strong>And behold there was a woman</strong>,.... In the synagogue, who, as infirm as she is hereafter described, got out to the place of worship; and which may be a rebuke to such, who, upon every trifling indisposition, keep at home, and excuse themselves from an attendance in the house of God:</p>
<p><strong>which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years</strong>; or a weakness that was brought upon her by an evil spirit, by Satan; as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:16">Luke 13:16</span> who, by divine permission, had a power of inflicting diseases on mankind, as is evident from the case of Job; and so the Ethiopic version renders it, "whom a demon had made infirm": and this disorder had been of a long standing; she had laboured under it for the space of eighteen years, so that it was a known case, and had been given up as incurable, which made the following miracle the more illustrious and remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>And was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself</strong>; or lift up her head, look up, or stand upright; it was a thing utterly impossible, which she could by no means do; her body was convulsed, and every part so contracted, that, as the Persic version renders it, "she could not stretch out a hand or foot".</p>
