<p><strong>And when Jesus saw her</strong>,.... In the synagogue among the people, either whilst, or after he had done teaching:</p>
<p><strong>he called her to him</strong>, to come nearer him, and said unto her; of his own accord, without being asked by the woman, or any other for her, out of great compassion to her, seeing her in this miserable condition, and knowing full well the nature, cause, and long continuance of her disorder:</p>
<p><strong>woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity</strong>; which had not only bowed her, but it had bound her, as if she had been bound with cords; but Christ by saying these words, with his hands laid upon her, burst her bonds asunder, dispossessed the evil spirit, and delivered her from her long affliction.</p>
