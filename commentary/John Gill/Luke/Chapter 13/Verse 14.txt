<p><strong>And the ruler of the synagogue</strong>,.... For there never was but one in a synagogue, whatever some writers have observed to the contrary; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> the Ethiopic version reads, "the chief priests", but wrongly; these dwelt at Jerusalem, and in Galilee:</p>
<p><strong>answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day</strong>; his indignation was at Christ, and the miracle he had wrought, being filled with envy at the honour it would bring unto him; though he covered it under pretence of its being a violation of the sabbath, and that it ought not to have been done on such a day, and in such a place, which were appropriated not to servile works, but to religious worship;</p>
<p><strong>and said unto the people</strong>; over whom he had an authority, and who stood in awe of him, because of his office and dignity; and not daring to attack Christ himself, at least not directly, though he struck at him through the people, whose doctrine and miracles were so extraordinary.</p>
<p><strong>There are six days which men ought to work, in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day</strong>; referring to the fourth command: but this observation and reproof were impertinent and needless, for the people did not come to be healed; for ought appears, the cure was unthought of and unexpected; nor was healing, especially as performed by Christ, by a word and a touch, a servile work, and therefore could not be any breach of the law referred to. The Ethiopic version reads, "is there not a sixth day?----come on that day"; the day before the sabbath.</p>
