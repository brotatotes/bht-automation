<p><strong>It is like leaven</strong>,.... Which is small in quantity, but is of a swelling, spreading quality; and fitly expresses the small beginnings of the Gospel ministry, and its increase, also the state and case of Gospel churches, and the nature of the grace of God; unless false doctrine should rather be meant, which privately, secretly, and by little and little, got into the churches of Christ, the kingdom of God, and spread itself all over them, as in the times of the papacy:</p>
<p><strong>which a woman took</strong>; Christ, and his ministers, Wisdom, and her maidens, understanding it of the Gospel; but if the leaven of error is intended, that woman, Jezebel, is meant, who calls herself a prophetess, and teaches, and seduces the servants of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:20">Revelation 2:20</span></p>
<p><strong>and hid in three measures of meal</strong>: among a few of God's people at first, both among Jews and Gentiles,</p>
<p><strong>till the whole was leavened</strong>; until all the elect of God are gathered in, and evangelized by it; even the whole fulness of the Gentiles, and all the people of the Jews, which shall be saved in the latter day; but if the parable is to be understood of the false doctrine and discipline of the Antichristian and apostate church of Rome, it may denote the small beginnings of the mystery of iniquity, which began to work in the apostle's time by the errors and heresies then propagated, and the manner in which the man of sin was privately introduced; whose coming is after the working of Satan, with signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness, first among a few, and then more, until at length the whole world wondered after the beast, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</span>.</p>
