<p><strong>But he shall say</strong>, c] The Persic version adds, "be gone from my sight, and be far from my door" expressing indignation at them, an abhorrence of them, as not being able to bear them in his sight, or near unto him:</p>
<p><strong>I tell you, I know you not whence you are</strong>; this is repeated, and with a strong asseveration, to denote the certainty of the truth expressed, and to cast off all hope in them, of ever succeeding by their entreaties and importunity:</p>
<p><strong>depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity</strong>; or "of a lie", as the Syriac and Persic versions render it: for they were deceitful workers, they professed what they did not from the heart believe; they said they were Christians, but were not, and now are found liars; they only attended on the word and ordinances in an hypocritical way, and trusted in, and depended upon, their outward profession of religion, and subjection to ordinances; and by so doing, instead of working righteousness, wrought iniquity; and so as they did not submit to Christ and his righteousness, they are bid to depart from him, as wicked and unrighteous men, as they were: the word "all" is here used, which is not in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23">Matthew 7:23</span> which agrees with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+6:8">Psalms 6:8</span> to which there seems to be a reference, though it is omitted here, in the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+6:8- :">Psalms 6:8- :</span>.</p>
