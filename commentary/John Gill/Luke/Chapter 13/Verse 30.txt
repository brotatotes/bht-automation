<p><strong>and there are first which shall be last</strong>: the Jews, who were first the visible professing people of God, to whom the oracles of God, and outward privileges and ordinances were given; who had the Messiah first sent to them, and the Gospel first preached among them; these shall be last, be rejected and despised, and shut out of the kingdom of heaven, they thought themselves heirs of, and expected to enjoy; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:30">Matthew 19:30</span>.</p>
