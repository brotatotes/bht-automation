<p><strong>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets</strong>,.... These words, with what follow, as they stand in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:37">Matthew 23:37</span> were delivered by Christ, when he was in the temple at Jerusalem; but here they were spoken by him when in Galilee, in Herod's jurisdiction; so that it appears, that the same words were spoken by Christ at different times, in different places, and to different persons: unless it can be thought, that Luke transcribed them from Matthew, and inserts them here, on occasion of Christ's having mentioned the perishing of a prophet in Jerusalem; where many had been killed and put to death, in one way or another, and particularly in the following:</p>
<p><strong>and stonest them that are sent unto thee</strong>; as Zechariah,</p>

<p><strong>how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not</strong>? and therefore ought not to have been condemned as a false prophet by their sanhedrim, as he suggests he should be, and as he afterwards was; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:20- :">2 Chronicles 24:20- :</span>.</p>
