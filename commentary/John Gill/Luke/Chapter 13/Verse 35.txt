Behold, your house is left unto you desolate,.... That is, would be in a little time, both city and temple; :-and verily I say unto you; affirm in the strongest manner:ye shall not see me; the Arabic version adds, "from henceforth", and so some copies, as in Matthew 23:39 and so the Ethiopic version, "from this time"; that he spoke these words, whether in Galilee, or in the temple:until the time come; or "until he shall come", meaning himself, and his second coming:when ye shall say, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; not they themselves in person, but their posterity, who will be converted in the latter day: and shall acknowledge the Messiah, the blessed of the Lord, who will come in his name, to judge the world in righteousness: or else the meaning is, that when Christ shall come a second time, and every eye shall see him, these Jews, among the rest, shall behold him, whom they have pierced, and mourn; and wish themselves among those, that shall receive him with joyful acclamations; and however, will be obliged to own him as the Messiah, and to confess that he comes in the name, and with the authority of the Lord, and that he is blessed for evermore.
