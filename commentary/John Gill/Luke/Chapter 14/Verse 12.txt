<p><strong>Then said he also to him that bad him</strong>,.... As he had given advice and instructions to the guests, so he likewise thought fit to give some to the master of the house, that had given both him and them an invitation to the present meal; observing, very likely, that his guests consisted of such persons as are hereafter described.</p>
<p><strong>When thou makest a dinner, or a supper</strong>; any entertainment for other persons, at what time of the day soever, whether sooner or later, at noon, or at night, on sabbath days, or others:</p>
<p><strong>call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours</strong>: that is, do not invite thy rich friends, rich brethren, and rich kinsmen, as well as not rich neighbours: not that our Lord's meaning is, that such should not be invited at all; which would be to destroy friendship and sociable conversation among persons in such a relation, and of such rank and fortune: but his sense is, that not these only should be invited, to the neglect of poor friends, poor brethren, poor kinsmen, and poor neighbours; and who, comparatively speaking, should rather be invited than the former, as being what would be more serviceable to them, and of a greater advantage in the issue to the master of the feast himself.</p>
<p><strong>Lest they also bid thee again</strong>; and thee only, and not the poor, to as grand an entertainment, which is commonly done:</p>
<p><strong>and a recompense be made thee</strong>: one feasting bout for another, so that there will be no obligation on either side; and this will be all the advantage that will be gained; the return is made here, and there will be no reward hereafter.</p>
