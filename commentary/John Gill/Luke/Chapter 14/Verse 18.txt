<p><strong>And they all with one consent began to make excuse</strong>,.... Or, "they all together", as the Vulgate Latin version, באחת, "in one", or "at once": in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+10:8">Jeremiah 10:8</span> rendered "altogether"; and so the Ethiopic version, which adds, "with one voice": but their words and language were not the same: their excuses are differently expressed. Some render απο μιας, "from one hour": or the selfsame hour; immediately, directly, as soon as ever they were bidden, they began to frame excuses; they at once agreed, as by common consent, to excuse themselves from coming.</p>
<p><strong>The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, or a field, and I must needs go and see it</strong>: he ought to have seen it before he bought it; and however, it was a very improper time, at evening, at supper time, as this was, to go and see a piece of ground; and at least it might have been put off till next morning; so that it was a mere excuse indeed.</p>
<p><strong>I pray thee have me excused</strong>: coming to the supper: these were the principal men among the Jews, the Pharisees and rulers among the people; who were rich and covetous, worldly men; seeking their own worldly advantage more than their spiritual and eternal welfare, or the interest of God and religion.</p>
