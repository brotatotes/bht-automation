<p><strong>And the servant said</strong>,.... After he had been and brought in a large number of such as are before described, and he was directed to, and succeeded to the gathering of them in:</p>
<p><strong>Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded</strong>; the apostles exactly observed the orders of their Lord and master; they began to preach the Gospel at Jerusalem; and being drove from thence, they went and preached to the Jews of the dispersion, and to the proselytes among the Gentiles:</p>
<p><strong>and yet there is room</strong>; that is, for the Gentiles, after God's elect, among the Jews, for that time were gathered in: there was room provided for them in the heart and love of God from everlasting, and in electing grace; in the suretyship engagements of Christ, in the covenant of his grace; and they had a place in the redeeming grace of Christ, in time; and in the last commission he gave to his disciples; and there was now room for them in the church of God; and will be in the new Jerusalem, and in the heavenly glory.</p>
