<p><strong>And the Lord said unto the servant</strong>,.... A second time; that since the Jews put away the word of eternal life from them, and judged themselves unworthy of it by their contradicting and blaspheming it, he commanded his apostles to turn from them to the Gentiles; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:45">Acts 13:45</span>,</p>
<p><strong>go out into the highways and hedges</strong>: the Persic version adds, "of the vineyards"; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+4:23">1 Chronicles 4:23</span> and may in general design the mean, base, vile, and sinful state of the Gentiles; who might be said to be "in the highways", because they were without the commonwealth and church of the Jews; were not admitted to civil conversation, nor to religious worship with them; and were left to walk on in their own ways, of their own devising and choosing, in which they delighted: they were not in God's highway, which is a way of holiness,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:8">Isaiah 35:8</span> but in their own highways; either following the various sects of the philosophers, which were vain and foolish; or going into different practices of idolatry, and walking in very sinful and vicious courses; and so were in the broad road and highway to destruction: and their being in, and under "the hedges", may denote their state of separation from God; being without him, alienated from the life of him, and afar off from him; being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12">Ephesians 2:12</span> they were not in the gardens and enclosures, but under the hedges:</p>
<p><strong>and compel them to come in</strong>; to the house of God, and church of Christ; to come and hear the word, and quit their former course of living, and attend the word and worship of God; and upon an evidence of the truth of grace upon their souls, to come into a Gospel church state, and partake of all privileges and ordinances in it; to which they are to be compelled, not by outward force, but by forcible words, by powerful arguments, and by the strength of persuasion; which expresses the nature of the Gospel ministry, which is to persuade Japhet to dwell in the tents of Shem; and the power that attends it by the divine Spirit; the case and condition of souls, who are generally bashful and backward, judging themselves unworthy; as also the earnest desire, and great liberality of Christ, the master of the feast, whose end in it is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>that my house may be filled</strong>; with men, like a flock, and these with gifts and grace; with such as shall be saved, as with elect Jews, so with the fulness of the Gentiles.</p>
