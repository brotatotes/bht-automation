<p><strong>Whosoever doth not bear his cross</strong>,.... All reproach, afflictions, persecutions, and death itself, cheerfully and patiently; the Ethiopic version renders it, "of his death the cross"; it signifies whatever is trying and disagreeable to flesh and blood:</p>
<p><strong>and come after me</strong>; bearing his cross; as Christ himself was about to do, and which doubtless he had in view;</p>
<p><strong>cannot be my disciple</strong>; he is not so in reality, nor does he deserve the name.</p>
