<p><strong>So likewise whosoever he be of you</strong>,.... Let him be ever so forward to follow me, to make a profession of me and of my Gospel, and to become a disciple of mine:</p>
<p><strong>that forsaketh not all that he hath</strong>; when called to it, relations, friends, possessions, estates, and what not, which is an explanation of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:26">Luke 14:26</span></p>
<p><strong>he cannot be my disciple</strong>; he is not in fact one, and is not worthy to be called one.</p>
