When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding,.... To a wedding dinner, or to any other; such an one as the present entertainment was, which was not a marriage feast, for they might not marry on the sabbath day;  :- but a common sabbath meal:sit not down in the highest room: in the chief place at table, as soon as come in:lest a more honourable man; for age, office, dignity, wisdom, learning, or riches:than thou be bidden of him: the master of the feast; and who may not yet be come, and for whom the chief place may be designed, and will better suit him.
