<p><strong>When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding</strong>,.... To a wedding dinner, or to any other; such an one as the present entertainment was, which was not a marriage feast, for they might not marry on the sabbath day; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> but a common sabbath meal:</p>
<p><strong>sit not down in the highest room</strong>: in the chief place at table, as soon as come in:</p>
<p><strong>lest a more honourable man</strong>; for age, office, dignity, wisdom, learning, or riches:</p>
<p><strong>than thou be bidden of him</strong>: the master of the feast; and who may not yet be come, and for whom the chief place may be designed, and will better suit him.</p>
