<p><strong>And he that bade thee and him</strong>,.... To the feast, and who is the master of it, and has a right to dispose of, and order his guests at his table, as he thinks fit:</p>
<p><strong>come and say to thee, give this man place</strong>; pray rise up, and give this honourable man this seat, which is more suitable for a person of his rank and figure, and take another:</p>
<p><strong>and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room</strong>; or place, which must unavoidably fill a man with shame and confusion; because hereby his pride and vanity, in affecting the uppermost room, will be publicly exposed; and he who before sat in the chief place, will have the mortification, before all the guests, to be seated in the lowest.</p>
