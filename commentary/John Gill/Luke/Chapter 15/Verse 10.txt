<p><strong>Likewise I say unto you</strong>,.... As before, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:7">Luke 15:7</span></p>
<p><strong>there is joy in the presence of the angels of God</strong>; who are the friends and neighbours of Christ: <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:7- :">Luke 15:7- :</span>,</p>
<p><strong>over one sinner that repenteth</strong>; which they have knowledge of, either by immediate revelation from God, or by observation in the church where they attend: the reason of this joy is, because there is one rescued out of the hands of Satan and his angels, between whom and them, there is an implacable enmity; and because another subject is added to Christ's kingdom, and by which it is enlarged, the prosperity of which they greatly desire; and because another heir is born in that family, to which they belong, and they have another social worshipper with them: and this joy is said to be "in the presence of" them; and so may design the joy of others, as of Father, Son, and Spirit, which is in their sight and knowledge; and also the joy there is among themselves.</p>
