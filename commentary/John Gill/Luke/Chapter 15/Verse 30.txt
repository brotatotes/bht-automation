<p><strong>But as soon as this thy son was come</strong>,.... He will not own him in the relation of a brother, though the father had owned him in that of a son; and the offence he took was, that the fatted calf should be killed, or that a crucified Christ should be preached; that he should be preached at all, and much less that he should be preached to sinners; and still less that he should be preached so soon to them, as soon as ever they became sensible of their sin, as it was the will of his father it should be: for such are not to be sent away to cleanse themselves from sin by any thing they do, and then apply to Christ; or to heal themselves, and then come to him for a cure; or to get peace by doing so, and then come to him for rest; or to do any thing to fit themselves for him, for their case requires present help: now at this the self-righteous man is displeased. The elder brother would have had another method taken with this younger son: he would have had him soundly whipped with the rod of the law, for his former sins; and sent into the fields along with him to work out his salvation; and not to have a rag put upon him, or a shoe on his foot, or a morsel of bread given him, till he had earned them; but instead of this, to be received and entertained in the manner he was, and so soon, highly provoked him: for he thought such a conduct was unbecoming God, and his moral perfections; and what his brother was undeserving of; and opened a door to, licentiousness; and highly reflected on his services, as of no value and regard.</p>
<p><strong>Which hath devoured thy living</strong>: given to his son; that part of his goods he had divided to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:12">Luke 15:12</span></p>
<p><strong>with harlots</strong>; in rioting and drunkenness, in chambering and wantonness, in gluttony and debauchery:</p>
<p><strong>thou hast killed for him the fatted calf</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:12- :">Luke 15:12- :</span></p>
