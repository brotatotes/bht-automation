Both father, son, and servants; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> and this elder brother also, because of the relation he stood in to him: and if he had had the same spiritual affection the apostle had for his brethren and kinsmen, according to the flesh, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</span> and he would have rejoiced at the conversion and return of sinners by repentance:</p>
<p><strong>and be glad</strong>; as his father was, and the angels in heaven be; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:10">Luke 15:10</span></p>
<p><strong>for this thy brother</strong>, though he would not own him as such,</p>
<p><strong>was dead, and is alive again, and was lost, and is found: <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:10- :">Luke 15:10- :</span></strong> and so the parable is concluded, the elder brother being silenced, and having nothing to say against such strong reasoning.</p>
