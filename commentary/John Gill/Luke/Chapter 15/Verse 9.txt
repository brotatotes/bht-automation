And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends,.... :- a parable somewhat like to this, the Jews x have on those words in Proverbs 2:4 "If thou seekest her as silver", c."it is like to a man that has lost a "shekel", (a piece of money,) or beryl rings, within his house he lights up many lamps and many candles, until he lights on them; and lo, these things much more: for if a man for the things of the temporary life of this world, lights many lamps and candles, until he lights upon them and finds them; the words of the law, since they are the life of this world, and the life of the world to come, shouldest thou not search after them as for hidden treasure?''x Shirhashirim Rabba, fol. 1. 4.
