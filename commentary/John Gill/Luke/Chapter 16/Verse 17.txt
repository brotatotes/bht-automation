And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass,.... This is said by Christ, lest it should be thought by his saying, that the law and the prophets were until John, that they were no longer, nor of any more use; but were now abrogated and laid aside; whereas heaven and earth might sooner pass away, and the whole frame of nature be dissolved:than one tittle of the law to fail; which, and the prophets, in all the precepts, promises, types, figures, prophecies, c. thereof, had their full accomplishment in the person, miracles, obedience, sufferings, and death of Christ see Matthew 5:18.
