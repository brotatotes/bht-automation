<p><strong>Whosoever putteth away his wife</strong>,.... For any other cause than for adultery, as the Jews used to do upon every trifling occasion, and for every little disgust: by which instance our Lord shows, how the Jews abused and depraved the law, and as much as in them lay, caused it to fail; and how he, on the other hand, was so far from destroying and making it of none effect, that he maintained the purity and spirituality of it; putting them in mind of what he had formerly said, and of many other things of the like kind along with it; how that if a man divorces his wife, for any thing else but the defiling his bed,</p>
<p><strong>and marrieth another, committeth adultery</strong>: with her that he marries: because his marriage with the former still continues, and cannot be made void by, such a divorce:</p>
<p><strong>and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband</strong>; the phrase "from her husband", is omitted in the Syriac and Persic versions:</p>
<p><strong>committeth adultery</strong>; with her that he marries, because notwithstanding her husband's divorce of her, and his after marriage with her, she still remains his lawful and proper wife;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. The Ethiopic version reads this last clause, quite different from all others, thus, "and whosoever puts away her husband, and joins to another, commits adultery", agreeably to</p>
