<p><strong>And he cried and said, father Abraham</strong>,.... The Jews used to call Abraham their father, and were proud of their descent from him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span> and so persons are after death represented by them, as speaking to, and discoursing with him; as in the passage cited in the note <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9- :">Matthew 3:9- :</span> to which the following may be added c;</p>
<p>"says R. Jonathan, from whence does it appear that the dead discourse with each other? it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+34:4">Deuteronomy 34:4</span> "And the Lord said unto him, this is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying", c. what is the meaning of the word "saying?" the holy blessed God said to Moses, "go say to Abraham", c.''</p>
<p>And here the Jews, in their distress, are represented as applying to him, saying,</p>
<p><strong>have mercy on me, and send Lazarus</strong> which seems to have respect to the mercy promised to Abraham, the covenant made with him, and the oath swore unto him, to send the Messiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:70">Luke 1:70</span> and which now, too late, these wretched Jews plead, the Messiah being sent already:</p>
<p><strong>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water</strong> in allusion to the washings and purifications among the Jews, and the sprinkling of blood by the finger of the high priest; which were typical of cleansing, pardon, comfort, and refreshment, by the grace and blood of Christ:</p>
<p><strong>and cool my tongue</strong>; which had spoken so many scurrilous and blasphemous things of Christ; saying that he was a sinner, a glutton, and a winebibber, a Samaritan, and had a devil; that he cast out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of devils; and that he was a seditious person, and guilty of blasphemy: so the Jews represent persons in hell, desirous of cooling water, and as sometimes favoured with it, and sometimes not: they say d, he that reads "Keriat Shema, (i.e. hear, O Israel", c.) and very accurately examines the letters of it, מצננין, "they cool hell for him", as it is said,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:14">Psalms 68:14</span>. And elsewhere e, they speak of a disciple, or good man, that was seen after death amidst gardens, and orchards, and fountains of water and of a publican, or wicked man, seen standing by the bank of a river, seeking ממטי מיא ולא מטי, "to come to the water, but could not come at it". So Mahomet f has a passage that is somewhat like to this text;</p>
<p>"the inhabitants of hell fire, shall call to the inhabitants of paradise, saying, pour upon us some water, or of those refreshments God hath bestowed on you.''</p>
<p>This man could not so much as get a drop of water to cool his tongue, not the least refreshment, nor mitigation of the anguish of his conscience, for the sins of his tongue:</p>
<p><strong>for I am tormented in this flame</strong>; in the destruction of Jerusalem, and calamities at Bither, and other afflictions; together with the wrath of God poured into the conscience, and the bitter remorses of that for speaking against the Messiah; and which are still greater in hell, where the worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>
