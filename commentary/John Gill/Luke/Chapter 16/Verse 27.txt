<p><strong>Then he said, I pray thee therefore father</strong>,.... The Cambridge, copy of Beza's, and the Ethiopic version read, "father Abraham"; finding he could have no redress of his misery, nor any relief for himself, he applies for others:</p>
<p><strong>that thou wouldst send him to my father's house</strong>; the house of Israel and Jacob, the surviving Jews: and this agrees also with a notion of theirs, that the dead seek for mercy for them l. The Persic and Ethiopic versions read, "that thou wouldst send Lazarus", &amp;c. whom the one calls Gazarus, and the other Eleazar.</p>
<p>l T. Bab. Taanith, fol. 16. 1.</p>
