<p><strong>they have Moses and the prophets</strong>; that is, their writings; which shows this man, and his five brethren, to be Jews; for to them were the oracles of God committed; and these had the writings of Moses and the prophets read to them every sabbath day; and is true, whether the contemporaries and immediate successors of the Pharisees are meant, or the ten tribes: and also shows, that one view of the parable, is to establish the authority of these writings; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:16">Luke 16:16</span> and that it is a peculiar privilege to have them; and that they ought to be attended to and regarded;</p>
<p><strong>let them hear them</strong>; for they testified concerning Christ, and concerning the sins of the Jews, and the calamities, both temporal and eternal, that should come upon them; and which, testimony was sufficient to leave them without excuse: and indeed, the word of God, read, explained, and heard, is the ordinary means of conversion, or of bringing men to faith and repentance.</p>
