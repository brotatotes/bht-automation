<p><strong>And he said unto him</strong>..... That is, Abraham said unto him, as the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions express it:</p>
<p><strong>if they hear not Moses and the prophets</strong>; as they did not, nor regarded what they said of Christ, but disbelieved both him and them:</p>
<p><strong>neither will they be persuaded</strong>: or brought to repent and believe;</p>
<p><strong>though one rose from the dead</strong>; as Christ did; whose resurrection, the truth of it they endeavoured to baffle, stifle, and suppress: this was the sign Christ gave them, of the truth of his Messiahship; and yet they repented not of what they had done to him, that they might believe in him; but remained still in their impenitence and infidelity, and so died. This shows the regard that ought to be had to the written word, as read, or preached; and that it is a sad sign of a desperate condition, when men reject divine revelation. Beza's ancient copy adds, "and should go unto them".</p>
