And he said unto him..... That is, Abraham said unto him, as the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions express it:if they hear not Moses and the prophets; as they did not, nor regarded what they said of Christ, but disbelieved both him and them:neither will they be persuaded: or brought to repent and believe;though one rose from the dead; as Christ did; whose resurrection, the truth of it they endeavoured to baffle, stifle, and suppress: this was the sign Christ gave them, of the truth of his Messiahship; and yet they repented not of what they had done to him, that they might believe in him; but remained still in their impenitence and infidelity, and so died. This shows the regard that ought to be had to the written word, as read, or preached; and that it is a sad sign of a desperate condition, when men reject divine revelation. Beza's ancient copy adds, "and should go unto them".
