I am resolved what to do,.... Or "I know what to do"; I have a scheme in my head, and I am determined to execute it, which will provide for me, and secure me a maintenance:that when I am put out of the stewardship; drove from Jerusalem, and from the temple and the synagogues:they may receive me into their houses; either Jews or Gentiles, after their dispersion.
