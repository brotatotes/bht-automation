<p><strong>I am resolved what to do</strong>,.... Or "I know what to do"; I have a scheme in my head, and I am determined to execute it, which will provide for me, and secure me a maintenance:</p>
<p><strong>that when I am put out of the stewardship</strong>; drove from Jerusalem, and from the temple and the synagogues:</p>
<p><strong>they may receive me into their houses</strong>; either Jews or Gentiles, after their dispersion.</p>
