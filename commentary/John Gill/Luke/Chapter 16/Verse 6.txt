<p><strong>And he said an hundred measures of oil</strong>,.... Or "baths of oil", the same quantity as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ezr+7:22">Ezra 7:22</span> where Aben Ezra i calls them, מדות, "measures", as we do here; and Jarchi k observes, that they were, לבלול מנחות, "to mingle with the meal, or flour offerings"; which illustrates the above observation, that they were for the temple service; and the bath was the measure of oil, as the ephah was of wheat l; and they were both of the same quantity,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+45:11">Ezekiel 45:11</span>. According to Godwin m it held four gallons and a half; so that a hundred of them contained four hundred and fifty gallons; though some make the measure much larger. Some say the "bath" held six gallons, one pottle, and half a pint; and others, seven gallons, two quarts, and half a pint; and others, nine gallons, and three quarts.</p>
<p><strong>Take thy bill</strong>, or "writing"; which showed the bargain made for so many measures; and which acknowledged the receipt of them, and promised payment:</p>
<p><strong>and sit down quickly</strong>; for his case required haste;</p>
<p><strong>and write fifty</strong>; just half; that it might appear he had bought but fifty, and was accountable for no more.</p>
