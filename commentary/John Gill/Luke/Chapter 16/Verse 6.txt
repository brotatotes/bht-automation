And he said an hundred measures of oil,.... Or "baths of oil", the same quantity as in Ezra 7:22 where Aben Ezra i calls them, מדות, "measures", as we do here; and Jarchi k observes, that they were, לבלול מנחות, "to mingle with the meal, or flour offerings"; which illustrates the above observation, that they were for the temple service; and the bath was the measure of oil, as the ephah was of wheat l; and they were both of the same quantity,Ezekiel 45:11. According to Godwin m it held four gallons and a half; so that a hundred of them contained four hundred and fifty gallons; though some make the measure much larger. Some say the "bath" held six gallons, one pottle, and half a pint; and others, seven gallons, two quarts, and half a pint; and others, nine gallons, and three quarts.Take thy bill, or "writing"; which showed the bargain made for so many measures; and which acknowledged the receipt of them, and promised payment:and sit down quickly; for his case required haste;and write fifty; just half; that it might appear he had bought but fifty, and was accountable for no more.i In Ezr. vii. 22. k In ib. l Kimchi in Ezek. xlv. 14. m Moses & Aaron, l. 6. c. 9.
