<p><strong>And it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem</strong>,.... That is, Jesus, as the Persic version expresses it; though the Ethiopic version reads in the plural, "they going to Jerusalem passed", c. that is, the disciples, or Christ with his disciples who was now going thither to eat his last passover, and suffer and die for his people:</p>
<p><strong>that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee</strong>; or "between Samaria and Galilee"; as the Syriac and Arabic versions render it; he steered his course through the borders of both these countries; and as he passed, Samaria was on his right hand, and Galilee on the left.</p>
