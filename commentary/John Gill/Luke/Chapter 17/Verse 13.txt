<p><strong>And they lifted up their voices</strong>,.... Together, and cried aloud, being at a distance, that they might be heard; as well as to express their vehement desire, and great importunity to be cleansed; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+9:7">Judges 9:7</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And said, Jesus, Master</strong>; or "Rabbi, Jesus", thou great Master in Israel; who art a teacher come from God, and who dost surprising miracles, and art able to cure us:</p>
<p><strong>have mercy on us</strong>; and cleanse us from our leprosy; we believe thou art able, if thou wilt; show compassion to us, miserable objects, as they were; their faith was the same with that of the other leper, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:2">Matthew 8:2</span>.</p>
