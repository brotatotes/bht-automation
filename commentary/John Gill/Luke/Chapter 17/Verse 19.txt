<p><strong>And he said unto him, arise</strong>,.... For, as yet, he lay at his feet upon his face, adoring and praising him; nor did he attempt to rise till Jesus bid him: adding,</p>
<p><strong>go thy way</strong>; to thine own country, town, or city, and to thy friends and relations, and about thy business:</p>
<p><strong>thy faith hath made thee whole</strong>: or "saved thee", in soul, as well as body; that is, Christ, the object of faith, had saved him; for his salvation is ascribed to his faith, not as the efficient cause of it, but as that was wrought in him, and drawn forth from him, and exercised by him, in receiving this blessing from Christ, the author of it, even both corporeal and spiritual salvation.</p>
