<p><strong>And they shall say unto you, see here, or see there</strong>,.... That is, there is Christ; and in two of Beza's exemplars, the word Christ is added as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:23">Matthew 24:23</span> from whence it seems to be transcribed: and the sense is, it shall be said by one or another; Christ is in such a place, or he is in such a place, and he will quickly appear, and deliver the people of the Jews out of all their distresses and calamities by the Romans,</p>
<p><strong>Go not after them nor follow [them]</strong>: the last clause, "nor follow them", is left out in the Syriac and Persic versions; the meaning is, give no credit to them; as if Christ was come again in person, and was in such a place, do not go along with them, where they direct, as into the desert, or into the secret chambers; for to follow them will be very dangerous, of bad consequence, as well as vain and fruitless; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:36">Acts 5:36</span>.</p>
