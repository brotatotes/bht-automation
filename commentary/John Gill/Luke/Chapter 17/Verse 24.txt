<p><strong>For as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one [part] under heaven</strong>,.... The Syriac version reads, "out of heaven", and the Arabic version, "in heaven"; which is the seat of lightning, and from whence it arises:</p>
<p><strong>and shineth unto the other part under heaven</strong>; enlightens the earth, which is under the heaven: though the sense of the words, as they lie in the original text, seems to be, that as the lightning lightens at one end of the heavens, and shines to the other; which is done at once, in a moment, in a twinkling of the eye, and to which agrees the Ethiopic version;</p>
<p><strong>so shall also the son of man be in his day</strong>: which is not to be understood of the swift progress of the Gospel, after his resurrection and ascension, and the pouring forth of his Spirit; but of his sudden coming, first to take vengeance on the Jewish nation for their rejection of him, and then at the last day, to judge both quick and dead. By his day, is meant his kingdom and glory, or his appearance with power, and great glory: Thus we read f for Solomon,</p>
<p>בשעתו, "in his hour", that is, in his glory, in the time of his kingdom, when he was in his greatest magnificence.</p>
