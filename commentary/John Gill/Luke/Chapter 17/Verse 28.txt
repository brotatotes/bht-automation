<p><strong>Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot</strong>,.... When he lived in Sodom, and before, and at the time of the destruction of that city with other neighbouring ones:</p>
<p><strong>they did eat, they drank</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, and</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:49">Ezekiel 16:49</span>. This is to be understood of the inhabitants of Sodom, and the other cities that perished with it:</p>
<p><strong>they bought, they sold</strong>: they traded among themselves, and with their neighbours; and, as it appears from the text referred to, they had no regard to the poor and needy; they made no conscience of defrauding and oppressing them:</p>
<p><strong>they planted</strong>; vineyards, and fruit trees; living in a very fruitful soil, like the garden of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+13:10">Genesis 13:10</span></p>
<p><strong>they builded</strong>; houses for themselves and posterity; and thus, as a Jewish writer h observes of them, in agreement with our Lord's design in all this, being filled with the increase of the earth, they lived in security, peace, and tranquillity.</p>
<p>h Pirke Eliezer, c. 25.</p>
