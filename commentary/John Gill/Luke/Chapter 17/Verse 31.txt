<p><strong>In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop</strong>,.... Either for diversion or devotion, when he shall hear that the Roman armies are approaching to Jerusalem, to besiege it:</p>
<p><strong>and his stuff in the house</strong>; or "his vessels", his goods and furniture; or his utensils, and instruments of trade and business:</p>
<p><strong>let him not come down</strong>; the inner way of the house, from the top:</p>
<p><strong>to take it away</strong>; with him in his flight, but let him descend by the steps, or ladder, on the outside of the house, and make his escape directly to Pella, or the mountains:</p>
<p><strong>and he that is in the field</strong>; at work, and has laid down his clothes in some certain part of the field, or at home:</p>
<p><strong>let him likewise not return back</strong>; to fetch them, but make the best of his way as he is; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> and</p>
