<p><strong>shall lose it</strong>: there he will be in the greatest danger:</p>
<p><strong>and whosoever shall lose his life</strong>; or expose it to danger, by fleeing to the mountains, or going to Pella, a small town beyond Jordan, of no strength, and where there might be thought no security;</p>
<p><strong>shall preserve it</strong>; he shall be safe; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
