<p><strong>But which of you having a servant ploughing</strong>,.... In order to keep the disciples humble in the performance of such miraculous works; and that they might not imagine they could have any thing at the hands of God by merit; and to excite them to go on from one duty to another; and never think they have done, or done enough, or more than what is their duty, Christ delivers the following parable.</p>
<p><strong>Which of you having a servant ploughing, or feeding cattle</strong>; or "sheep", as the Syriac and Persic versions render it; or a "ploughman", or a "shepherd", as the Ethiopic version; which are both servile works, and done in the field: not that the disciples had any such servants under them, though the words are directed to them, for they had left all, and followed Christ; nor were they brought up to husbandry, but most of them in the fishing trade; Christ only puts this for instance, and supposes such a case:</p>
<p><strong>will say unto him by and by</strong>; or straightway, immediately, directly,</p>
<p><strong>when he is come from the field</strong>; and has done ploughing, and feeding his cattle, sheep, or cows, or whatever they are; as soon as ever he comes home; or "first", as the Persic version; the first thing he shall say to him, upon his return from thence,</p>
<p><strong>go</strong>; to the other side of the room, and to the table there ready spread, and furnished; or "go up", as the Arabic and Ethiopic versions render it; go up to the upper room where they used to dine or sup; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:12">Luke 22:12</span> or "come in", as the Persic version renders it; and which some learned men observe, is the sense of the Greek word here used; come into the house,</p>
<p><strong>and sit down to meat</strong>? or fall, and lie down on the couch, as was the custom in those countries at eating.</p>
