<p><strong>Doth he thank that servant</strong>,.... As if he had done him a favour, and what he was not obliged to;</p>
<p><strong>because he did the things that were commanded him</strong>? for, as a servant, he ought to do them, and in so doing does but his duty: he may indeed be commended for it, but not thanked:</p>
<p><strong>I trow not</strong>; or "I think not"; it do not seem so to me, as if he would, or, as though it was proper and necessary he should. The Ethiopic version leaves out this last clause.</p>
