<p><strong>And they brought unto him also infants</strong>,.... As well as grown persons, that were sick, to be healed by him:</p>
<p><strong>that he would touch them</strong>; in order, as some learned men think, to cure them of diseases that attended them; for one of the ways by which Christ healed persons, was by touching them; nor do we read of his touching in common for any other purpose, or of persons desiring him to touch them, or theirs, but for this end; in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:13">Matthew 19:13</span> it is read, "that he should put his hands on them"; and so the Arabic and Persic versions here read, in order to pray over them, and bless them: but neither in one place, nor the other, is any mention of their baptism, or of their being brought for such a purpose; nor can it be concluded from hence;</p>
<p><strong>but when [his] disciples saw [it], they rebuked them</strong>; the persons that brought the infants; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:13- :">Matthew 19:13- :</span>.</p>
