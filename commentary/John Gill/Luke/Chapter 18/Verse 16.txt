Not the disciples, as the Ethiopic version reads, nor the persons that brought the children, but the children themselves; for the antecedent to the relative αυτα, "them", can be no other; which shows, that these infants were not new born babes, or children at the breast, but such as were more grown up, since they were capable of being called to, and of coming to Christ:</p>
<p><strong>and said</strong>; that is, to the disciples; so the Persic version expresses it:</p>
<p><strong>suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not</strong>;</p>

<p><strong>for of such is the kingdom of God</strong>; or "of heaven", as the Syriac version reads, and as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:14">Matthew 19:14</span> that is, the kingdom of God belongs to such, "who are as these"; or, "like to these": as the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions render the words; (<span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:14- :">Matthew 19:14- :</span>.)</p>
