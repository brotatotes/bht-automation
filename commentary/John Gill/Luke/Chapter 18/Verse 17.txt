<p><strong>Verily I say unto you</strong>,...., Christ takes an occasion from hence to teach his disciples humility, and guard them against pride and vanity:</p>
<p><strong>whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God</strong>; the King Messiah, the doctrines of the Gospel, and the ordinances of it, even the whole Gospel dispensation;</p>
<p><strong>as a little child</strong>; without prejudice, pride, ambition, and vanity, with meekness, and humility:</p>
<p><strong>shall in no wise enter therein</strong>; a very unfit and improper person to be a professor of the Gospel; or to be admitted to Gospel ordinances: or be a member of a Gospel church; or be reckoned a subject of the Messiah's kingdom, which is of a spiritual nature; and as he has not a meetness for, and a right unto the kingdom of glory, he shall never see it, and enjoy it.</p>
