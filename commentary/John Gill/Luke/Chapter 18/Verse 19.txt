<p><strong>And Jesus said unto him</strong>,.... In answer to his question, beginning with the character he gave him:</p>
<p><strong>why callest thou me good</strong>? it being unusual to address men, even their Rabbins, under such a title:</p>
<p><strong>none is good, save one, [that is], God</strong>: or "but God alone"; as the Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions render it; or, "but the one God", as read the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions;</p>
