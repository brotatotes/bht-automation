<p><strong>Thou knowest the commandments</strong>,.... The ten commandments given to Moses, and delivered to people; and which they were careful to teach their children; though five are only here mentioned, and not in the order in which they stand: suggesting hereby that these must be kept, or the law must he fulfilled, and satisfaction made for the violation of it, or there can be no inheriting eternal life. The five commandments mentioned are, the seventh, sixth, eighth, ninth, and fifth:</p>
<p><strong>do not commit adultery; do not kill; do not steal; do not bear false witness; honour father and thy mother</strong>;</p>
