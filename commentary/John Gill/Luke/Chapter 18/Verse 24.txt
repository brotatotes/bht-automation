<p><strong>And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful</strong>,.... As he might, by his looks and gestures; and perceived that he was determined not to part with his possessions, and follow him:</p>
<p><strong>he said to his disciples, how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God</strong>! embrace the Gospel, and submit to the ordinances of it; deny themselves, part with their worldly substance for the cause of Christ, and interest of religion. Riches, which should be a reason for, are often a bar unto a profession of Christ, and his Gospel. This is delivered as an affirmation, or by way of assertion, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
