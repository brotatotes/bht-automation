<p><strong>Then he took unto him the twelve</strong>,.... His twelve disciples, as the Ethiopic version expresses it; he took them aside from the rest of the company, as they were travelling on the road, and privately delivered to them, what follows; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:17">Matthew 20:17</span></p>
<p><strong>and said unto them, behold, we go up to Jerusalem</strong>; to the feast of the passover, which was drawing near, and the last Christ was to eat with his disciples, the time of his sufferings, and death, being now at hand; and of which he thought fit to give his disciples notice: and therefore he called them aside, and in a private manner, told them,</p>
<p><strong>that all things that are written by the prophets, concerning the son of man, shall be accomplished</strong>; particularly, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:1">Psalms 2:1</span></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:6">Psalms 22:6</span> for to these the following things have respect.</p>
