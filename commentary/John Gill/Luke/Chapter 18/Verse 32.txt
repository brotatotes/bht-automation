<p><strong>For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles</strong>,.... As he was by the chief priests, Scribes, and elders, to Pilate, the Roman governor, and by him to the soldiers:</p>
<p><strong>and shall be mocked</strong>; as he was by the latter, when they crowned him with thorns, arrayed him in a purple robe, and put a reed into his hand, and bowed the knee to him, saying, hail king of the Jews; and likewise by the Jews when he hung upon the cross:</p>
<p><strong>and spitefully entreated</strong>. The Syriac and Persic versions leave out this clause here, and read it the next verse. It may regard the injuries done him, the abuses and affronts he received, both by words and blows:</p>
<p><strong>and spitted on</strong>; as he was both by officers in the high priest's palace, and by the Roman soldiers in Pilate's hall; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:6">Isaiah 50:6</span>.</p>
