<p><strong>And they that went before</strong>,.... In the company that preceded Christ; for he, as yet, was not come right over against the blind man:</p>
<p><strong>rebuked him that he should hold his peace</strong>; being not well pleased that he should call him the son of David, which was acknowledging him to be the Messiah; or that he might not be troublesome to Christ, and retard his journey:</p>
<p><strong>but he cried so much the more, thou son of David, have mercy on me</strong>; he neither dropped the character of Christ, nor his request to him; but called out more loudly, and with greater vehemence, earnestness, and importunity: so persons sensible of their need of Christ, and of his worth, excellency, and ability, are not to be discouraged from an application to him, by whatsoever they meet with from men, or devils.</p>
