<p><strong>For the son of man</strong>,.... Meaning himself, who was truly man, and the Messiah, and which was one of his names in the Old Testament:</p>
<p><strong>is come</strong>: from heaven, into this world, being sent by the Father, and with the full consent and good will of his own:</p>
<p><strong>to seek and save that which was lost</strong>: as all his elect were in Adam, and by their own actual transgressions; and are considered as such, whilst in a state of unregeneracy: and particularly the lost sheep of the house of Israel are meant, one of which Zacchaeus was; and so the words are a reason of Christ's looking him up, and calling him by his grace, and making a discovery of himself, and an application of salvation to him; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:11">Matthew 18:11</span>.</p>
