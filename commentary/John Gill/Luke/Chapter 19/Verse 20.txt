<p><strong>And another came</strong>,.... Who was one of the servants; had a gift, but did not use, and improve it, nor did it turn to any account:</p>
<p><strong>saying, Lord</strong>; owning also the lordship and dominion of Christ, as all will confess at the last day, even those who have no interest in him, and cannot call him their Lord;</p>
<p><strong>behold, [here is] thy pound</strong>; he owns his gifts were the Lord's, and that he had received them from him, and now returns them:</p>
<p><strong>which I have kept</strong>; he had kept that which was committed to him, and that even till his Lord came; he had not lost it, though it was not increased, or was of any advantage to Christ, or the souls of men, it being neglected by him; for it was</p>
<p><strong>laid up in a napkin</strong>: the Greek word, here used for a napkin, is adopted by the Jews into their language, and is used for a veil and for a linen cloth: this puts me in mind of what the Jews call,</p>
<p>קנין סודר "possession by a napkin", or linen cloth: their custom is this; when they buy, or sell any thing, to use a piece of cloth they call "sudar", the word in the text, which the contractors lay hold upon, whereby they ratify and confirm the bargain m: but this man made no use of his "sudar", or napkin, in buying and selling; he traded not at all; he wrapped up his money in it, and both lay useless; his gift lay dormant and unexercised, which was given him to profit withal.</p>
