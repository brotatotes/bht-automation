<p><strong>And he saith unto him</strong>,.... By way of reply to his vile slander, and unrighteous charge;</p>
<p><strong>out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant</strong>; as he might be justly called: he was not only a wicked man, as all men are, even enemies by wicked works, and lie in wickedness; and a wicked professor of religion, as there be some; but a wicked minister, and that not on account of his bad principles, and sinful life and conversation, but for his sloth and negligence, and the wrong thoughts he entertained of, and the false charges he brought against Christ; and Christ turns his own argument upon him, and by his own words condemns him:</p>
<p><strong>thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow</strong>; not allowing this, but supposing it was as he said; then Christ argues as follows, for his conviction.</p>
