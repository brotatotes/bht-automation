For I say unto you,.... And it may be depended on as truth, and what will be found matter of fact:that unto every one that hath, shall be given; greater and larger gifts, fitting him for greater usefulness: he that has gifts, and makes use of them, increases in them; they enlarge with their use, and become brighter, and he more useful. The Vulgate Latin version adds, "and he shall abound, or shall have abundance", as inMatthew 25:29and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him: that is, that which he seemed to have, or thought he had, as in Luke 8:18 for from him that has really nothing, nothing can be taken away: though the sense may be, that he that does not use the talent, or exercise the gift bestowed on him, but lays it up in a napkin, which is all one as if he had it not, even the gift itself shall be taken away from him; and as others receive no benefit by it, he shall receive no honour from it; Luke 8:18- : andLuke 8:18- :.
