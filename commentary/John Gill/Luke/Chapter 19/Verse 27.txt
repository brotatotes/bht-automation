<p><strong>But those mine enemies</strong>,.... Meaning particularly the Jews, who were enemies to the person of Christ, and hated and rejected him, as the King Messiah; and rebelled against him, and would not submit to his government; and were enemies to his people, and were exceeding mad against them, and persecuted them; and to his Gospel, and the distinguishing truths of it, and to his ordinances, which they rejected against themselves:</p>
<p><strong>which would not that I should reign over them</strong>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:14">Luke 19:14</span></p>
<p><strong>bring hither, and slay [them] before me</strong>; which had its accomplishment in the destruction of Jerusalem, when multitudes of them were slain with the sword, both with their own, and with their enemies; and to this the parable has a special respect, and of which Christ more largely discourses in this chapter; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:41">Luke 19:41</span> though it is true of all natural men, that they are enemies to Christ; and so of all negligent and slothful professors, and ministers of the word, who, when Christ shall come a second time, of which his coming to destroy the Jewish nation was an emblem and pledge, will be punished with everlasting destruction by him; and then all other enemies will be slain and destroyed, sin, Satan, the world, and death: of the first of these the Jews say n,</p>
<p>"in the time to come the holy, blessed God, will bring forth the evil imagination (or corruption of nature),</p>
<p>ושוחטו, "and slay it before" the righteous, and the wicked.''</p>
<p>n T. Bab. Succa, fol. 52. 1.</p>
