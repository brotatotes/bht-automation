<p><strong>And he sought to see Jesus who he was</strong>,.... What sort of a person he was for complexion, stature, and age: having heard much of him, he was very desirous of indulging his curiosity with a sight of him; having, as yet, nothing else that induced him to desire to see him: his desire to see Jesus was not of the same kind with the kings and prophets, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:16">Matthew 13:16</span> but rather like that of Herod,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:8">Luke 23:8</span></p>
<p><strong>and could not for the press</strong>; the multitude of people that were flocking to meet Jesus, or who came before him, or were about him; for one part of the multitude went before him, and the other followed after him; so that he was in the crowd, and therefore could not easily be seen;</p>
<p><strong>because he was little of stature</strong>. The Syriac and Persic versions read, "because Zacchaeus was little of stature", lest it should be thought that this is said of Jesus; for the reason why Zacchaeus could not see him for the crowd, was not because Christ was little of stature, and was hid among them, but because Zacchaeus was little of stature, and could not see over their heads.</p>
