Saying, go ye into the village over against [you],.... What village this was, is not said by any of the evangelists; it seems to be either Bethany, or Nob; and rather the latter, since the village of Bethany was fifteen furlongs, or near two miles from Jerusalem, John 11:18 and therefore must have been passed by Christ; whereas the tract called Bethany, at the Mount of Olives where Christ now was, was but a sabbath day's journey, or about a mile, Luke 24:50 compared with Acts 1:12.Acts 1:12- :in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied: inMatthew 21:2 it is said, an ass, and a colt with her; which agrees with the prophecy in Zechariah 9:9 and which, no doubt, was matter of fact: nor does Mark and Luke contradict it, though they do not express it:whereon yet never man sat, loose him, and bring [him] hither; for it seems that Christ stayed at the above place, until the disciples went and fetched it.
