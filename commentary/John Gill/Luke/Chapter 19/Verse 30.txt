<p><strong>Saying, go ye into the village over against [you]</strong>,.... What village this was, is not said by any of the evangelists; it seems to be either Bethany, or Nob; and rather the latter, since the village of Bethany was fifteen furlongs, or near two miles from Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:18">John 11:18</span> and therefore must have been passed by Christ; whereas the tract called Bethany, at the Mount of Olives where Christ now was, was but a sabbath day's journey, or about a mile, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:50">Luke 24:50</span> compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:12">Acts 1:12</span>.</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:12- :">Acts 1:12- :</span></p>
<p><strong>in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied</strong>: in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:2">Matthew 21:2</span> it is said, an ass, and a colt with her; which agrees with the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:9">Zechariah 9:9</span> and which, no doubt, was matter of fact: nor does Mark and Luke contradict it, though they do not express it:</p>
<p><strong>whereon yet never man sat, loose him, and bring [him] hither</strong>; for it seems that Christ stayed at the above place, until the disciples went and fetched it.</p>
