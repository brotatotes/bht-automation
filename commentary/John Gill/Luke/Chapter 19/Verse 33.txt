<p><strong>And as they were loosing the colt</strong>,.... In order to bring it away, as Christ bid them:</p>
<p><strong>the owners thereof said unto them, why loose ye the colt</strong>? Mark takes notice of this, but does not tell us who they were, only that they were persons that stood there; but this evangelist informs us who they were: and it seems by this, that there were more owners of the colt than one, which might have made the taking away of the colt the more difficult; since, though one might agree to it, another might not; but Christ, who is God, and has the hearts of all men in his hands, could, as he did, dispose the minds of these men to let the colt go freely, and quietly, with his disciples;</p>
