And they brought him to Jesus,.... That is, the colt:and they cast their garments upon the colt; that is, the disciples, who brought him to Jesus; the Persic version here, as inMatthew 21:7 renders it very wrongly, "Jesus put his own garment on its back, and sat on it"; it follows,and they set Jesus thereon; in order to ride upon him, as he did to Jerusalem.
