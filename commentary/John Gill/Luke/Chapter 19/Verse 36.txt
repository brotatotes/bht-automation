<p><strong>And as he went</strong>,.... Riding on the colt towards Jerusalem:</p>
<p><strong>they spread their clothes in the way</strong>; not the disciples, for they had put their garments upon the colt; but the multitude, which either came with him from Jericho, and other parts, or that met him from Jerusalem, or both; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:8">Matthew 21:8</span> and so the Persic version here; "men put off their clothes and cast them in the way, that he might pass over then"; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:8- :">Matthew 21:8- :</span>.</p>
