<p><strong>Saying, blessed be the King</strong>,.... The King Messiah, the King of Israel, the son of David, the Christ of God; so the Ethiopic version adds, "blessed be the King of Israel"; they sung their "Hosannas" to him, as the other evangelists say:</p>
<p><strong>that cometh in the name of the Lord</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span></p>
<p><strong>peace in heaven</strong>; all heavenly peace and prosperity attend him; or let peace be made with God in heaven, by the Prince of Peace on earth, for sinful men:</p>
<p><strong>and glory in the highest</strong>; glory be given to God for peace, life, and salvation by his son; and that in the highest heavens, by the angels there, as well as by men on earth, and in the highest notes and strains.</p>
