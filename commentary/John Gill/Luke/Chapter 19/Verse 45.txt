And he went into the temple,.... Being come into the city, he alighted from the colt he rode on, and having committed it to the care of a proper person to return it to the owner, he went up directly to the temple, of which he was the Lord and proprietor, and where he had some work to do the few days he had to live.And began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought; that traded in sheep, and oxen, and doves; see John 2:15. The Ethiopic version adds here, as there, "and overthrew, the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that sold doves".
