<p><strong>And began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought</strong>; that traded in sheep, and oxen, and doves; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:15">John 2:15</span>. The Ethiopic version adds here, as there, "and overthrew, the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that sold doves".</p>
