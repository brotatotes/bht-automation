<p><strong>And he taught daily in the temple</strong>,.... Every day till the passover came, and only in the day; for at night he went out of the city to Bethany, or to the Mount of Olives: some of his discourses in the temple, the parables he delivered, and his disputations with the doctors, are recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:27">Matthew 21:27</span>:</p>
<p><strong>but the chief priests, and the Scribes, and the chief of the people</strong>; or "the elders of the people", as the Syriac version renders it; that is, the whole sanhedrim:</p>
<p><strong>sought to destroy him</strong>; met and consulted together how to get him into their hands, and what charges to bring against him, in order to put him to death.</p>
