And he taught daily in the temple,.... Every day till the passover came, and only in the day; for at night he went out of the city to Bethany, or to the Mount of Olives: some of his discourses in the temple, the parables he delivered, and his disputations with the doctors, are recorded in Matthew 21:27:but the chief priests, and the Scribes, and the chief of the people; or "the elders of the people", as the Syriac version renders it; that is, the whole sanhedrim:sought to destroy him; met and consulted together how to get him into their hands, and what charges to bring against him, in order to put him to death.
