<p><strong>And it came to pass, as the angels</strong>,.... The Persic version reads in the singular number, "the angel: were gone away from them into heaven", from whence they came, and which was the place of their abode and residence; and therefore they are called the angels of heaven, where they always behold the face of God, hearken to the voice of his commandment, and go and come at his orders; and these having finished their embassy, delivered their message to the shepherds, and done all the work they came about,</p>
<p><strong>departed from them</strong>: and, as the Ethiopic version adds, "and ascended up into heaven"; and as soon as they were gone, immediately,</p>
<p><strong>the shepherds said one to another, let us now go even to Bethlehem</strong> the place where the angel said the Saviour was born,</p>
<p><strong>and see this thing which hath come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us</strong>: from whence it appears, that it was not from diffidence of the matter, as questioning the truth of what the angel said, that they moved one another to go to Bethlehem; for they firmly believed the thing was come to pass, which the angel had told them of, and that what he said was from the Lord; nor did they act any criminal part, or indulge a vain curiosity, in going to Bethlehem to see what was done; for it seems to be the will of God that they should go, and for which they had a direction from the angel, and a sign given them by which they might know the new born Saviour from any other infant, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:12">Luke 2:12</span> and which would also be a further confirmation of their faith, and by which they would be qualified not only as ear, but as eyewitnesses of the truth of this fact, to report it with greater certainty.</p>
