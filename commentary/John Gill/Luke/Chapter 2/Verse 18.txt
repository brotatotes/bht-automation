And all they that heard it,.... What the shepherds related of what they had heard from the angel, and from Joseph and Mary, and what they had seen themselves;wondered at those things that were told them by the shepherds: for though they expected the Messiah, and that he would be born at Bethlehem, yet they did not imagine that he would be born of such mean parents, and appear in such mean circumstances, and in so contemptible a place; and that shepherds, and not the princes of Israel, should have the first notice of it; and yet the account which these shepherd, who were plain hearted men, and could never be thought to invent such a story, and spread it, and impose on men, without any interest in it, was very surprising; so that they knew not what to say to it, neither to deny, nor believe it; accordingly, the Persic version renders the whole thus, "and whoever heard, wondering, stuck at it"; hesitated about it, and yet astonished at the particulars of it; just as Christ's hearers were in Luke 4:22 who wondered at his ministry, and the manner of it, and yet objected the meanness of his parentage and education.
