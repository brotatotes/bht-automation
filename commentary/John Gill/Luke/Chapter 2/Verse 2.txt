<p><strong>And this taxing was first made</strong>,.... Or "this was the first enrolment, or taxing" in the Jewish nation; for there was another afterwards, when Judas the Galilean arose, and drew many after him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:38">Acts 5:38</span>.</p>
<p><strong>When Cyrenius was governor of Syria</strong>; or "of Cyrenius" "governor of Syria"; that is, it was the first that he was, concerned in; who not now, but afterwards was governor of Syria; and because he had been so before Luke wrote this history, and this being a title of honour, and what might distinguish him from others of that name, it is given him; for as Tertullian says c, Sentius Saturninus was now governor of Syria, when Cyrenius was sent into Judea, to make this register, or taxing; and which is manifestly distinguished from that, which was made during his being governor of Syria, when Archelaus was banished from Judea, ten or eleven years after Herod's death; which Josephus d gives an account of, and Luke refers to, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:37">Acts 5:37</span>. Moreover, the words will bear to be rendered thus, "and this tax, or enrolment, was made before Cyrenius was governor of Syria"; πρωτη, being used for</p>
<p>προτερα, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span>. This Cyrenius is the same whom the Romans call Quirinius, and Quirinus; a governor of Syria had great power in Judea, to which it was annexed, when Cyrenius was governor there. It is reported of R. Gamaliel, that he went to take a licence,</p>
<p>מהגמון בסוריא, "from a governor of Syria" e; i.e. to intercalate the year: and Syria was in many things like to the land of Judea, particularly as to tithes, and the keeping of the seventh year f.</p>
