<p><strong>And the shepherds returned</strong>,.... From Bethlehem, to the fields, and to their flock there;</p>
<p><strong>glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard;</strong> from Joseph and Mary:</p>
<p><strong>and seen</strong>; as the babe lying in the manger:</p>
<p><strong>as it was told unto them</strong>; by the angel: they glorified God on account of the birth of the Messiah; and praised him, wondering at his grace, and the high honour put upon them, that they should be acquainted with it; and that there was such an exact agreement between the things they had seen, and the angel's account of them.</p>
