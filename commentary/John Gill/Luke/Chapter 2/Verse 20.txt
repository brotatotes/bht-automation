And the shepherds returned,.... From Bethlehem, to the fields, and to their flock there;glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard; from Joseph and Mary:and seen; as the babe lying in the manger:as it was told unto them; by the angel: they glorified God on account of the birth of the Messiah; and praised him, wondering at his grace, and the high honour put upon them, that they should be acquainted with it; and that there was such an exact agreement between the things they had seen, and the angel's account of them.
