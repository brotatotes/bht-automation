<p><strong>And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child</strong>,.... According to the original institution of circumcision, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:12">Genesis 17:12</span> and which was strictly observed by religious persons, as by the parents of our Lord here, and by those of John the Baptist, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:59">Luke 1:59</span> Hence the Apostle Paul reckons this among his privileges, that he could have boasted of as well as other Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:59- :">Luke 1:59- :</span>. But it may be asked, why was Christ circumcised, since he had no impurity of nature, which circumcision supposed; nor needed any circumcision of the heart, which that was a symbol of? To which it may be replied, though he needed it not himself, it was the duty of his parents to do it, since all the male seed of Abraham were obliged it, and that law, or ordinance, was now in force; and besides, it was necessary that he might appear in the likeness of sinful flesh, who was to bear, and atone for the sins of his people; as also, that it might be manifest that he assumed true and real flesh, and was a partaker of the same flesh and blood with us; and that he was a son of Abraham, and of his seed, as it promised he should; and that he was made under the law, and came to fulfil it, and was obliged to it, as every one that is circumcised is; as well as to show a regard to all divine, positive institutions that are in being, and to set an example, that we should tread in his steps; and likewise to cut off all excuse from the Jews, that they might not have this to say, that he was an uncircumcised person, and so not a son of Abraham, nor the Messiah.</p>
<p><strong>His name was called Jesus, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb</strong>, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:31">Luke 1:31</span> It appears from hence, and from the instance of John the Baptist, that at circumcision it was usual to give names to children; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:31- :">Luke 1:31- :</span>. The Jews observe u that</p>
<p>"six persons were called by their names before they were born: and these are Isaac, Ishmael, Moses, Solomon, Josiah, and the King Messiah:''</p>
<p>the latter they prove from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+72:17">Psalms 72:17</span> which they render, "before the sun his name was Yinnon", or the son: that is, the Son of God.</p>
