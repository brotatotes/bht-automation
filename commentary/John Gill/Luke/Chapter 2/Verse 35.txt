<p><strong>Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also</strong>,.... Meaning either the sword, "or spear of scandal", as the Arabic version renders it; so the calumny, and reproach of the tongues of men, is compared to a sharp sword, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+57:4">Psalms 57:4</span> and such the virgin might meet with on account of her conception in art unmarried state, which might greatly wound her soul; or else the sorrows she met with on account of her son: as he was a man of sorrows, so was she a woman of sorrows, from his cradle to his cross; and his sorrows, like so many darts, or javelins, rebounded from him to her, and pierced her soul through; as when Herod sought his life, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:13">Matthew 2:13</span> when she had lost him for a whole day, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:48">Luke 2:48</span> and when he was frequently exposed to danger among the spiteful and malicious Jews; but never more than when she stood at his cross, and saw him, in his agonies, extended on the tree, bleeding, gasping, and dying,</p>
