<p><strong>And when they had performed all things</strong>,.... Relating to the purification of Mary, and the presentation and redemption of her firstborn, and the sacrifices and ceremonies belonging thereunto:</p>
<p><strong>according to the law of the Lord</strong>; which that directed to, and enjoined:</p>
<p><strong>they returned into Galilee</strong>: not that they came from thence to Jerusalem, but from Bethlehem, where Mary gave birth, and her time for purification was now just expired: nor did they go now directly to Galilee; or, if they did, they soon came back again to Bethlehem, since here the wise men found them two years after; when by a divine warning, they went into Egypt, where they remained till Herod's death, and after came into the land of Israel, into the parts of Galilee, and dwelt at Nazareth; for which reason it is here called their own city;</p>
<p><strong>to their own city Nazareth</strong>: Bethlehem was their native city, the place of their birth, at least of their family; and Nazareth was the city of their habitation.</p>
