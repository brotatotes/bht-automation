And Joseph also went up from Galilee,.... Where he now lived, and worked at the trade of a carpenter; having for some reasons, and by one providence or another, removed hither from his native place:out of the city of Nazareth; which was in Galilee, where he and Mary lived; and where he had espoused her, and she had conceived of the Holy Ghost:into Judea; which lay higher than Galilee, and therefore he is said to go up to it:unto the city of David; not what was built by him, but where he was born and lived; see 1 Samuel 17:12.which is called Bethlehem: the place where, according to Micah 5:2 the Messiah was to be born, and was born; and which signifies "the house of bread": a very fit place for Christ, the bread which came down from heaven, and gives life to the world, to appear first in. This place was, as a Jewish chronologer says g, a "parsa" and half, or six miles from Jerusalem; though another of their writers, an historian and traveller h, says, it was two "parsas", or eight miles; but Justin Martyr i says, it was but thirty five furlongs distant from it, which is not five miles; hither Joseph came from Galilee,because he was of the house and lineage of David; he was of his family, and lineally descended from him, though he was so poor and mean; and this is the reason of his coming to Bethlehem, David's city.g Ganz.
