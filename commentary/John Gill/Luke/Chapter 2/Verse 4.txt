<p><strong>And Joseph also went up from Galilee</strong>,.... Where he now lived, and worked at the trade of a carpenter; having for some reasons, and by one providence or another, removed hither from his native place:</p>
<p><strong>out of the city of Nazareth;</strong> which was in Galilee, where he and Mary lived; and where he had espoused her, and she had conceived of the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p><strong>into Judea;</strong> which lay higher than Galilee, and therefore he is said to go up to it:</p>
<p><strong>unto the city of David;</strong> not what was built by him, but where he was born and lived; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+17:12">1 Samuel 17:12</span>.</p>
<p><strong>which is called Bethlehem</strong>: the place where, according to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:2">Micah 5:2</span> the Messiah was to be born, and was born; and which signifies "the house of bread": a very fit place for Christ, the bread which came down from heaven, and gives life to the world, to appear first in. This place was, as a Jewish chronologer says g, a "parsa" and half, or six miles from Jerusalem; though another of their writers, an historian and traveller h, says, it was two "parsas", or eight miles; but Justin Martyr i says, it was but thirty five furlongs distant from it, which is not five miles; hither Joseph came from Galilee,</p>
<p><strong>because he was of the house and lineage of David</strong>; he was of his family, and lineally descended from him, though he was so poor and mean; and this is the reason of his coming to Bethlehem, David's city.</p>
