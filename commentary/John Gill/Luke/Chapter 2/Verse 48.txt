<p><strong>And when they saw him they were amazed</strong>,.... That is, when Joseph and Mary saw him amidst the doctors, they were astonished that he was admitted among them, and had in such esteem by them:</p>
<p><strong>and his mother said unto him</strong>; she being his own, and only parent, and not Joseph; and therefore he said nothing, but left it to her; who upon sight of him, at least as soon as she had a proper opportunity after he had left the doctors, began to chide, or rather to expostulate with him after this manner:</p>
<p><strong>son, why hast thou thus dealt with us</strong>? which was said with great tenderness of affection, and in much mildness; and may be a pattern to parents, who should not provoke their children to anger, but deal gently and tenderly with them:</p>
<p><strong>behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing</strong>; with great grief, anxiety, and solicitude, fearing lest some evil had befallen him. Mary calls Joseph his father, though she knew he was not, in a proper sense; but because he was supposed to be so, and was his father by the law of marriage; and especially, she might call him so because of his paternal care of him in his education, and bringing him up: for it is a maxim with the Jews e, that</p>
<p>"not he that begets, but he that brings up, is the father.''</p>
