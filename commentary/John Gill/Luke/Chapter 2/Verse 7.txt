<p><strong>And she brought forth her firstborn son</strong>,.... At Bethlehem, as was predicted; and the Jews themselves own, that the Messiah is already born, and born at Bethlehem. They have a tradition, that an Arabian should say to a Jew k</p>
<p>"Lo! the king Messiah is born; he said to him, what is his name? Menachem: he asked him, what is his father's name? he replied to him, Hezekiah; he said unto him, from whence is he? he answered, from the palace of the king of Bethlehem.''</p>
<p>Which is elsewhere l reported, with some little variation; the Arabian said to the Jew,</p>
<p>"the Redeemer of the Jews is born; he said unto him, what is his name? he replied, Menachem is his name: and what is his father's name? he answered, Hezekiah: he said unto him, and where do they dwell? he replied, in Birath Arba, in Bethlehem.''</p>
<p>And the Jewish chronologer affirms m, that</p>
<p>"Jesus the Nazarene, was born at Bethlehem Judah, a "parsa" and a half from Jerusalem.''</p>
<p>And even the author of the blasphemous book of the life of Christ owns n, that</p>
<p>"Bethlehem Judah was the place of his nativity.''</p>
<p>Jesus is called Mary's firstborn, because she had none before him; though she might not have any after him; for the first that opened the matrix, was called the firstborn, though none followed after, and was holy to the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:2">Exodus 13:2</span>. Christ, as to his human nature; was Mary's firstborn; and as to his divine nature, God's firstborn:</p>
<p><strong>and wrapped him in swaddling clothes;</strong> which shows, that he was in all things made like unto us, sin only excepted. This is one of the first things done to a new born infant, after that it is washed, and its navel cut; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:4">Ezekiel 16:4</span> and which Mary did herself, having neither midwife nor nurse with her; from whence it has been concluded, that the birth of Jesus was easy, and that she brought him forth without pain, and not in that sorrow women usually do;</p>
<p><strong>and laid him in a manger</strong>. The Persic version serves for a comment; "she put him into the middle of the manger, in the place in which they gave food to beasts; because in the place whither they came, they had no cradle": this shows the meanness of our Lord's birth, and into what a low estate he came; and that now, as afterwards, though Lord of all, yet had not where to lay his head in a proper place; and expresses his amazing grace, in that he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor: and the reason of his being here laid was,</p>
<p><strong>because there was no room for them in the inn.</strong> It seems that Joseph had no house of his own to go into, nor any relation and friend to receive him: and it may be, both his own father and Mary's father were dead, and therefore were obliged to put up at an inn; and in this there was no room for them, because of the multitude that were come thither to be enrolled: and this shows their poverty and meanness, and the little account that was made of them; for had they been rich, and made any considerable figure, they would have been regarded, and room made for them; especially since Mary was in the circumstances she was; and it was brutish in them to turn them into a stable, when such was her case.</p>
