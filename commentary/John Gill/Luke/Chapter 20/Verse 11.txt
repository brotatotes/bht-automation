<p><strong>And again he sent another servant</strong>,.... Or set of prophets in after times, and yet before the Babylonish captivity:</p>
<p><strong>and they beat him also</strong>; as they had done the other; they continued in their malpractices, yea increased in them:</p>
<p><strong>and entreated him shamefully</strong>; putting him to open shame, using him in a very ignominious and shameful manner, which it was a shame to relate, and which was shameful for them to do:</p>
<p><strong>and sent him away empty</strong>; as they had done the other.</p>
