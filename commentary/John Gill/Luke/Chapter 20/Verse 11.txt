And again he sent another servant,.... Or set of prophets in after times, and yet before the Babylonish captivity:and they beat him also; as they had done the other; they continued in their malpractices, yea increased in them:and entreated him shamefully; putting him to open shame, using him in a very ignominious and shameful manner, which it was a shame to relate, and which was shameful for them to do:and sent him away empty; as they had done the other.
