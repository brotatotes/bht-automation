<p><strong>Then said the Lord of the vineyard</strong>,.... Who planted it, and let it out to husbandmen, and expected fruit from it, and sent his servants from time to time for it:</p>
<p><strong>what shall I do</strong>? or what can be done more than has been done? <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+5:4">Isaiah 5:4</span> who else can be sent that is likely to do any good with such an ungrateful and unfruitful people?</p>
<p><strong>I will send my beloved Son</strong>; the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who lay in his bosom, was the darling of his soul, and the delight of his heart; him he determined to send, and him he did send to the lost sheep of the house of Israel:</p>
<p><strong>it may be they will reverence him, when they see him</strong>: it might be thought after the manner of men, that considering the greatness of his person, as the Son of God, the nature of his office, as the Redeemer and Saviour of men, the doctrines which he preached, the miracles which he wrought, and the holiness and harmlessness of his conversation, and the great good he did both to the bodies and souls of men, that he would have been had in great esteem and veneration with the men, to whom he was sent, and among whom he conversed: but, alas! when they saw him, they saw no beauty, comeliness, and excellency in him, and nothing on account of which he should be desired by them.</p>
