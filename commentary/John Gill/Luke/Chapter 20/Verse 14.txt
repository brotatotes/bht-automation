<p><strong>But when the husbandmen saw him</strong>,.... In human nature, heard him preach, and observed the miracles done by him:</p>
<p><strong>they reasoned among themselves</strong>; as the Scribes and Pharisees, and elders of the people often did:</p>
<p><strong>saying, this is the heir</strong>; the heir of God, being his Son; and so the Ethiopic version; "this Son is his heir", or the heir of the vineyard; being, by appointment, heir of all things, and by his descent from David heir to the kingdom of Israel;</p>
<p><strong>come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours</strong>. The Arabic and Persic versions render it, "and his inheritance shall be ours": the nation, city, temple, and all the emoluments and benefits thereof. The word "come" is left out in the Alexandrian copy, and in the Gothic and Vulgate Latin versions.</p>
