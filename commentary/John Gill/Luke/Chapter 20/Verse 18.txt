<p><strong>Whosoever shall fall on that stone, shall be</strong> <strong>broken</strong>,.... Not who shall fall upon Christ by faith, and build upon him as the foundation stone, for such shall be saved; but that stumble at him, and are offended with him, and fall by unbelief and hardness of heart; such do themselves much hurt and mischief and expose themselves to danger and ruin; they bid very fair for destruction:</p>
<p><strong>but on whomsoever it shall fall</strong>; as it did with its full weight upon the Jews at their destruction, and as it will upon all Christless sinners at the last day:</p>
<p><strong>it will grind him to powder</strong>; the ruin of such will be unavoidable, and there will be no recovery;</p>
