<p><strong>And the chief priests, and the Scribes, that same hour</strong>,.... As soon as he had delivered the above parable, together with that of the two sons:</p>
<p><strong>sought to lay hands on him</strong>; they had a good will to it, being exceedingly gravelled with the question he put to them concerning John's baptism, which confounded them, and put them to silence; and with the parables he delivered, in which they were so manifestly pointed at:</p>
<p><strong>and they feared the people</strong>; lest they should rise and stone them, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:6">Luke 20:6</span> or rescue him out of their hands;</p>
<p><strong>for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them</strong>: and that they were the husbandmen that had used the servants of God so ill, and would put to death the son of God, the Messiah; and who would at length be destroyed themselves, and the kingdom of God be taken from them, though they seem to detest and deprecate it, saying in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:16">Luke 20:16</span> God forbid; that we should kill the heir, or that we should be destroyed, and the vineyard given to others: these things grievously nettled them, and exasperated them against him; but they knew not how to help themselves at present.</p>
