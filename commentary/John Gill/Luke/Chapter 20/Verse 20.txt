<p><strong>And they watched him</strong>,.... What he said, and what he did, and where he went, that they might take an advantage against him, or know where he was, to send to him, as they should think fit, and take the best opportunity of so doing. The Syriac and Persic versions leave out this clause:</p>
<p><strong>and sent forth spies which should feign themselves just men</strong>: of virtue and religion, conscientious men, that would do nothing but what was just and right, and were desirous of being exactly informed of the truth of things, that they might act right in every punctilio:</p>
<p><strong>that might take hold of his words</strong>; improve them, and form a charge upon them, of sedition and treason:</p>
<p><strong>that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor</strong>; the Roman governor, and by him be put to death. These men were some of them the disciples of the Pharisees, and others were Herodians; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:16">Matthew 22:16</span>.</p>
