<p><strong>And they asked him, saying, master</strong>,.... Rabbi, or doctor; hoping, by this flattering title, and the flattering words used by them, to work him up to an openness and freedom of conversation with them:</p>
<p><strong>we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly</strong>; rightly dividest the word of God, and deliverest out sound doctrine according to it: and this he certainly did, though they spoke these words hypocritically, not believing what they themselves said; at least, they did not care that others should believe this of him:</p>
<p><strong>neither acceptest thou the person of any</strong>. The Persic version very wrongly renders it, "and lookest not upon the countenance, and heart of any one whomsoever"; for though Christ did not look upon the countenances of men, and judge according to the outward appearance, nor regard men on account of outward circumstances, as riches, honours, learning, c. yet he looked upon the heart, and knew what was in it, and respected sincerity and uprightness wherever he found it, and which were wanting in these men:</p>
<p><strong>but teachest the way of God truly</strong> the way of worshipping God, and of enjoying him, both in this world, and in that to come;</p>
