<p><strong>And they could not take hold of his words before the people</strong>,.... Which was what they wanted; that if he had dropped any seditious and treasonable expressions against the government, they might be witnesses against him; or if he had not vindicated the liberties of the people, and the rights of the Jewish nation, these might be exasperated against him, and leave him:</p>
<p><strong>and they marvelled at his answer</strong>; which was so formed, as to give them no handle against him either way:</p>
<p><strong>and held their peace</strong>; they were silenced, and had nothing to say to him, nor against him, but left him, and went their way.</p>
