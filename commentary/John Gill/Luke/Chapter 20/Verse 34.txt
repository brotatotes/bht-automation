<p><strong>And Jesus answering, said unto them</strong>,.... After he had observed that their error arose from ignorance of the Scriptures, and the power of God:</p>
<p><strong>the children of this world marry, and are given in marriage</strong> that is, such who live in this world, in the present mortal and imperfect state, being mortal men, and die, and leave their estates and possessions: these marry, and have wives given them in marriage; and it is very right, and fit, that so it should be, in order to keep up a succession of men, and that they may have heirs to enjoy their substance when they are gone.</p>
