<p><strong>Now that the dead are raised</strong>,.... Or that there will be a resurrection of the dead, this is a proof of it:</p>
<p><strong>even Moses showed at the bush</strong>: when the Lord appeared to him out of it, and he saw it burning with fire, and not consumed; when the Lord called to him out of it by the following name, as he has recorded it in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:6">Exodus 3:6</span>. Hence it is said,</p>
<p><strong>when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob</strong>; for though the Lord called himself so, yet Moses likewise calls him by these names, when he gives an account of this affair, and when he went from him to the children Israel; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:6- :">Exodus 3:6- :</span>.</p>
