<p><strong>And he said unto them</strong>,.... The Ethiopic version reads, "to the Pharisees"; and so it appears, that it was to them he spoke, from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:41">Matthew 22:41</span></p>
<p><strong>how say they</strong>? The Syriac version reads, "how say the Scribes?" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:35">Mark 12:35</span> and the Persic version, how say the wise men, the doctors in Israel,</p>
<p><strong>that Christ is David's son</strong>? that which nothing was more common among the Jews.</p>
