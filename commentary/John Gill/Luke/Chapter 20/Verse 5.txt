Or "they thought with themselves", as the Syriac version; or "within themselves", as the Vulgate Latin, though they did not express it; or "one with another", as the Arabic version; they took counsel together, and debated the matter among themselves, and reasoned after this manner:</p>
<p><strong>saying, if we shall say from heaven</strong>; which was what, in their own consciences, they believed to be true,</p>
<p><strong>he will say, why then believed ye him not</strong>? in what he said concerning the Messiah; which if they had, as they should, there would have been no reason for such a question they had put;</p>
