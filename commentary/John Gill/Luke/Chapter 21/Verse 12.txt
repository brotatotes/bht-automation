<p><strong>But before all these</strong>,.... Before all these things come to pass:</p>
<p><strong>they shall lay their hands on you</strong>; as the high priest, the priests, and the captain of the temple did upon the apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:1">Acts 4:1</span></p>
<p><strong>and persecute you</strong>; as upon the death of Stephen, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span></p>
<p><strong>delivering you up to the synagogues</strong>; to be scourged there; or to the courts of judicature, the consistories of the Jews, their great sanhedrim; before these the apostles were brought, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:6">Acts 4:6</span></p>
<p><strong>and into prisons</strong>; as were all the apostles together, and Peter at another time separately, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:3">Acts 4:3</span></p>
<p><strong>being brought before kings and rulers, for my name's sake</strong>; for being called by his name, and calling upon it; for professing, and preaching his Gospel; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:3- :">Acts 4:3- :</span>.</p>
