<p><strong>For I will give you a mouth</strong>,.... A faculty of speaking, a freedom of expression, a door of utterance, a good degree of elocution, to speak properly, pertinently and freely to any point:</p>
<p><strong>and wisdom</strong>; to answer with great propriety, and in the most prudent manner, to any difficult and ensnaring question; and to furnish with such knowledge of the Gospel, and with such gifts and abilities to preach and defend it, that they should be able to give a clear and distinct account of it, and prove every point in it, by the most strong and convincing arguments, and vindicate it against all objections:</p>
<p><strong>which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay or resist</strong>. This was remarkably fulfilled in Peter, and John, and in Stephen, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:13">Acts 4:13</span>. The first word, "gainsay", is left out in the Syriac and Persic versions.</p>
