<p><strong>In your patience, possess ye your souls.</strong> By patiently bearing all afflictions, reproaches, indignities, and persecutions, enjoy yourselves; let nothing disturb or distress you; possess that peace and joy in your souls, which the world cannot take away; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:3">Romans 5:3</span>. The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read, "ye shall possess": and the sense may be this; by patient continuance, or by perseverance in the ways of God, and the truths of Christ unto the end, ye shall be saved; shall find your lives, and enjoy your souls, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:22">Matthew 10:22</span>.</p>
