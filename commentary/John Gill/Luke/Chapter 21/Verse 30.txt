When they now shoot forth,.... Their buds, branches, and leaves; the Vulgate Latin adds, "of themselves":ye see and know of your own selves; without any hint, or direction from others, the case is so plain and obvious; the Syriac and Arabic versions read, "of them"; the trees, by their putting forth their buds and leaves; the Persic and Ethiopic versions leave out the clause "of yourselves"; and none of the Oriental versions lead the word see:the summer is now nigh at hand: see Matthew 24:32.
