<p><strong>And take heed to yourselves</strong>,.... To your souls and bodies, to your lives and conversations; be upon your watch and guard:</p>
<p><strong>lest your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness</strong>; with excessive eating and drinking; for these, as they oppress and burden the stomach, and disorder the body, so they stupefy the senses, and make the mind dull and heavy, and unfit for spiritual and religious exercises; such as reading, meditation, and prayer:</p>
<p><strong>and cares of this life</strong>; concealing food and clothing, what you shall eat or drink, or wherewith ye shall be clothed; all such anxious and worldly cares, being that to the soul, as intemperance is to the body; for there is such a thing as being inebriated with the world, as well as with wine:</p>
<p><strong>and so that day come upon you unawares</strong>; the day of Jerusalem's destruction; and this suggests, that such would be the carnality and security of some persons, and so they would be surprised with ruin at once; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:26">Luke 17:26</span>.</p>
