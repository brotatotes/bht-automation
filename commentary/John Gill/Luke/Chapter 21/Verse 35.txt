<p><strong>For as a snare shall it come</strong>,.... In which a bird is suddenly taken, and cannot get out again; the Persic version renders it, "as lightning and the splendour of the sun"; which break out at once, and enlighten the whole earth; so the destruction of the Jewish nation should be sudden and unavoidable, and universal; for it should come</p>
<p><strong>on all them that dwell upon the face of the whole earth</strong>: or land of Judea; and so it was, for not only Jerusalem, but all Judea, and Galilee, suffered in this desolation.</p>
