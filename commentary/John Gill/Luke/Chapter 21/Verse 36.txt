<p><strong>Watch ye therefore, and pray always</strong>,.... Watch against every sin, snare, and temptation; particularly, against the above things, surfeiting, drunkenness, and worldly cares; pray continually, for fresh supplies of grace:</p>
<p><strong>that ye may be counted worthy</strong>; not for watchfulness and prayer, but through the grace and goodness of God:</p>
<p><strong>to escape all these things that shall come to pass</strong>; the dreadful miseries and distress, that shall come upon the Jews:</p>
<p><strong>and to stand before the Son of man</strong>; with intrepidity, confidence, and pleasure; and meet him at his coming in this way, with joy and comfort; and likewise at death, and at judgment; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:28">1 John 2:28</span>.</p>
