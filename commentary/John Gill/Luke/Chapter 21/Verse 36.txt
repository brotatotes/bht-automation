Watch ye therefore, and pray always,.... Watch against every sin, snare, and temptation; particularly, against the above things, surfeiting, drunkenness, and worldly cares; pray continually, for fresh supplies of grace:that ye may be counted worthy; not for watchfulness and prayer, but through the grace and goodness of God:to escape all these things that shall come to pass; the dreadful miseries and distress, that shall come upon the Jews:and to stand before the Son of man; with intrepidity, confidence, and pleasure; and meet him at his coming in this way, with joy and comfort; and likewise at death, and at judgment; see 1 John 2:28.
