And in the day time he was teaching in the temple,.... That is, Jesus, as the Persic version expresses it; his constant method every day, till the feast of passover came, was to go up to the temple, and there openly and freely preach the Gospel to the people, who resorted thither in great numbers, for that purpose:and at night he went out; of the temple, and out of the city:and abode in the mount that is called the Mount of Olives; very likely to pray, both for himself and for his disciples, his time with them being short.
