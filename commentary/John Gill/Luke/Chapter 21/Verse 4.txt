<p><strong>For all these have of their abundance</strong>,.... Which they had remaining; the same Hebrew word יתר signifying to remain, and to abound: they had large possessions, and gave in much, and yet had a great deal left; out of which they</p>
<p><strong>cast in unto the offerings of God</strong>; or "gifts of God": not as gifts unto him; or among the gifts of God; but into the treasury where the gifts, and freewill offerings were put; the same with the "Corban", in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:6">Matthew 27:6</span> and so the Syriac version here renders it, "the house of the offering of God": and it is expressed in the plural; because there were several chests, in which these gifts were put, for various uses; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:6- :">Matthew 27:6- :</span></p>
<p><strong>but she of her penury hath cast in all the living she had</strong>;</p>
