<p><strong>As for these things which ye behold</strong>,.... Some, as the Syriac and Ethiopic versions, read these words by way of interrogation; "are these the things which ye behold?" do ye look upon these with wonder and delight?</p>
<p><strong>the days will come</strong>; and they are hastening on; a little while, a few years more:</p>
<p><strong>in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
