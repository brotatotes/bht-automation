<p><strong>And he said, take heed that ye be not deceived</strong>,.... With false Christs, and false prophets:</p>
<p><strong>for many shall come in my name</strong>; making use of his name, taking it to them; not that they would pretend they were sent by him, but that they were he himself:</p>
<p><strong>saying, I am [Christ]</strong>; so the Syriac and Persic versions supply as we do:</p>
<p><strong>and the time draweth near</strong>; not that such will come, but when come, they will say, that the time of the deliverance of the Jewish nation from the Roman yoke is at hand:</p>
<p><strong>go ye not therefore after them</strong>; do not be their disciples, or follow them where they would lead you; for nothing but destruction will be the consequence of it.</p>
