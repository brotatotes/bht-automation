And he said, take heed that ye be not deceived,.... With false Christs, and false prophets:for many shall come in my name; making use of his name, taking it to them; not that they would pretend they were sent by him, but that they were he himself:saying, I am [Christ]; so the Syriac and Persic versions supply as we do:and the time draweth near; not that such will come, but when come, they will say, that the time of the deliverance of the Jewish nation from the Roman yoke is at hand:go ye not therefore after them; do not be their disciples, or follow them where they would lead you; for nothing but destruction will be the consequence of it.
