<p><strong>But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions</strong>,.... Or seditions and tumults; "wars" may design the wars of the Romans, against the Jews; and the "commotions", or seditions, the internal troubles among themselves:</p>
<p><strong>be not terrified</strong>; as if the destruction of the nation, city, and temple, would be at once:</p>
<p><strong>for these things must first come to pass, but the end is not by and by</strong>; or "immediately". The Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions leave out this last word, and read, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
