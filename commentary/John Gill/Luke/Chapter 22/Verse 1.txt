<p><strong>Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh</strong>,.... Which lasted seven days; during which the Jews eat their bread without leaven, in commemoration of the haste in which they went out of Egypt; being such, that they had not time to leaven their dough, but took it with their kneadingtroughs along with them, as it was; and as figurative of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, with which the Gospel feast is to be kept; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:34">Exodus 12:34</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Which is called the passover</strong>; because the Lord passed over the houses of the Israelites, when he slew all the firstborn in Egypt; now the time of this feast drew near, when the conspiracy was formed against the life of Christ: Matthew and Mark are more precise, and suggest, that it was two days before the passover; see</p>
