<p><strong>And he said unto them, behold</strong>,.... Giving them a sign, whereby they should know the very house, where he would keep the passover:</p>
<p><strong>when ye are entered into the city</strong>; that is, the city of Jerusalem; for Christ and his disciples were now at Bethany, from whence he sent Peter and John thither, where only the passover was to be killed and eaten:</p>
<p><strong>there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water</strong>; the Persic version adds, "upon his back"; for which he had been to some well, or fountain in the city, in order to mix with wine at the passover:</p>
<p><strong>follow him into the house where he entereth in</strong>; so that it seems they were to return, and go after him into the house, where he went with his pitcher of water; this was a trial of the faith and obedience of the disciples, and, as the sequel shows, a proof of the omniscience and deity of Christ.</p>
