And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house,.... The master of it; for the man bearing the pitcher of water seems to be a servant only:the master saith unto thee: by these his two disciples, Peter and John; it looks as if the word "master", as peculiar to Christ, and by way of eminency belonging to him, Matthew 23:10 was well known to those who believed, and were followers of him, as the man of this house might be; see John 11:28. The Syriac and Persic versions read, "our master saith", and leave out the other phrase, to thee:where is the guest chamber; or dining room: the word properly signifies an inn, or place to wait at; so called, from travellers unloosing their burdens there, either from themselves, or their beasts; the Arabic version renders it, "the place of my rest": a place for refreshment and feasting:where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? who were a sufficient number to eat the passover lamb by themselves;John 11:28- :.
