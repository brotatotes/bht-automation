<p><strong>And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house</strong>,.... The master of it; for the man bearing the pitcher of water seems to be a servant only:</p>
<p><strong>the master saith unto thee</strong>: by these his two disciples, Peter and John; it looks as if the word "master", as peculiar to Christ, and by way of eminency belonging to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:10">Matthew 23:10</span> was well known to those who believed, and were followers of him, as the man of this house might be; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:28">John 11:28</span>. The Syriac and Persic versions read, "our master saith", and leave out the other phrase, to thee:</p>
<p><strong>where is the guest chamber</strong>; or dining room: the word properly signifies an inn, or place to wait at; so called, from travellers unloosing their burdens there, either from themselves, or their beasts; the Arabic version renders it, "the place of my rest": a place for refreshment and feasting:</p>
<p><strong>where I shall eat the passover with my disciples</strong>? who were a sufficient number to eat the passover lamb by themselves;</p>
