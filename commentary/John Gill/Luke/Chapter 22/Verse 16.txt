<p><strong>For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof</strong>,.... Of the passover, and which now, with the rest of the ceremonial law, was to be abolished:</p>
<p><strong>until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God</strong>; signifying, not that he should eat of it in the kingdom of God, where it would be fulfilled; seeing the passover was never more to take place, neither in the Gospel dispensation, nor in the heavenly glory; both which may be meant by the kingdom of God; but that he should never eat more of it in this ceremonial way, since it would have its accomplishment in each of those states: and it has been already fulfilled under the Gospel dispensation, which is often meant by the kingdom of God; in himself, who is the passover sacrificed for us, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span> for the passover lamb was a type of Christ, and he is the sum and substance of that shadow, and the fulfilling end of that type; it had its accomplishment in him; of which <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:7- :">1 Corinthians 5:7- :</span> and it will also be fulfilled in the kingdom of heaven, or eternal glory, when there will be a perfect deliverance of the saints from sin, Satan, and the world; which the deliverance of the Israelites out of Egypt was typical of, commemorated in the passover; and therefore then will be sung the song of Moses, and the Lamb; and then will Christ, and his true followers, eat and drink together in his Father's kingdom, and spend an endless eternity in never fading joys and pleasures.</p>
