For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine,.... That is, wine; see the blessing at the passover cup in the notes on the preceding verse:until the kingdom of God shall come; with power, as in Mark 9:1 in the resurrection of Christ from the dead; in his exaltation and session at God's right hand; in the pouring forth of the Spirit on the apostles; in the conversion of great multitudes, both in Judea, and in the Gentile world; in the destruction of the Jews; in the latter day glory; and in the ultimate state of happiness and bliss in the world to come. The Ethiopic version reads, "until I drink it new in the kingdom of God"; as in Mark 14:25.
