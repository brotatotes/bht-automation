<p><strong>And he took bread and gave thanks</strong>,.... Or blessed it, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:26">Matthew 26:26</span>. Here begins the account of the Lord's supper after the passover was eaten;</p>
<p><strong>and brake it, and gave unto them</strong>; the disciples, as is expressed in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:26">Matthew 26:26</span></p>
<p><strong>saying, this is my body</strong>;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:26- :">Matthew 26:26- :</span></p>
<p><strong>which is given for you</strong>; or will be given for you, as an offering for sin in your room and stead; and accordingly it was given into the hands of men, and of justice, and unto death. The phrase denotes the substitution and sacrifice of Christ in the room of his people, and the voluntariness of it; and is only mentioned by Luke in this account: the Apostle Paul writes, which is broken for you, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:24">1 Corinthians 11:24</span> alluding to the breaking of the bread in the ordinance, and as expressing the bruises, wounds, sufferings, and death of Christ: the Ethiopic version here adds, "for the redemption of many".</p>
<p><strong>This do in remembrance of me</strong>; that is, eat this bread in remembrance of my love to you, and in commemoration of my body being offered up for you. Observe this ordinance in the manner I now institute it, in time to come, in memory of what I am about to do for you; for this direction does not only regard the present time and action, but is intended as a rule to be observed by the churches of Christ in all ages, to his second coming: and it is to be observed, that the Lord's supper is not a reiteration, but a commemoration of the sacrifice of Christ. This phrase is only mentioned by Luke here, and by the Apostle Paul, who adds it also at the drinking of the cup,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:24">1 Corinthians 11:24</span>. The Persic version here reads, "do this perpetually in remembrance of me".</p>
