<p><strong>Likewise also the cup after supper</strong>,.... Both after the passover, and the Lord's supper; that is, he took the cup after they had eaten the bread, and gave thanks over it, and gave it to his disciples, bidding them drink of it, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:27">Matthew 26:27</span>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:27- :">Matthew 26:27- :</span>:</p>
<p><strong>saying, this cup is the New Testament in my blood, which is shed for you</strong>. The Ethiopic version reads, "for many"; as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:28">Matthew 26:28</span> where it is added, "for the remission of sins"; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:28- :">Matthew 26:28- :</span>.</p>
