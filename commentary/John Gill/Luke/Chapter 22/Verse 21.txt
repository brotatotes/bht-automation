<p><strong>But behold the hand of him that betrayeth me</strong>,.... By the "hand" is meant, not figuratively the counsel, contrivance, and conspiracy of Judas to betray him, as the word is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+14:19">2 Samuel 14:19</span> but literally the hand of Judas, which was then dipping in the dish with Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:23">Matthew 26:23</span> and it follows here, is</p>
<p><strong>with me on the table</strong>; and is an aggravation of his sin, that one that sat with him at his table, ate bread with him, and dipped his morsel in the same dish, should be the betrayer of him, according to the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+41:9">Psalms 41:9</span> as well as describes and points at the person that should do this action, even one of his disciples; for which disciples, he had just now said, his body is given, and his blood is shed. The phrase, "with me", is left out in the Syriac and Persic versions. From Luke's account it appears most clearly, that Judas was not only at the passover, but at the Lord's supper, since this was said when both were over.</p>
