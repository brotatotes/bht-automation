<p><strong>And truly the son of man goeth</strong>,.... That is, dies, which is going the way of all the earth, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jos+23:14">Joshua 23:14</span></p>
<p><strong>as it was determined</strong>; in the counsels and purposes of God, and agreed to by Christ in the covenant of grace; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span> the death of Christ, the manner of it, and the means by which it was brought about, were all predetermined by God; yet this did not, in the least, excuse the sin of those concerned in it, nor exempt them from punishment:</p>
<p><strong>but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed</strong>; who not only came to an untimely end, and died an infamous death by his own hands, but went to his own place, the place of everlasting torments allotted him: wherefore in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:24">Matthew 26:24</span> it is added, "it had been good for that man if he had not been born"; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:24- :">Matthew 26:24- :</span>.</p>
