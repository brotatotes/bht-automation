<p><strong>For whether is greater</strong>,.... Christ appeals to themselves, and puts a case that is plain and obvious to any one, who is the greater, and more honourable person;</p>
<p><strong>he that sitteth at meat</strong>; that sits, or lies down at table, and another waits on him:</p>
<p><strong>or he that serveth</strong>? that stands behind, observes orders, and ministers to those that sit down:</p>
<p><strong>is not he that sitteth at meat</strong>? you, and every one must own, that he is the greatest, and most honourable person:</p>
<p><strong>but I am among you as he that serveth</strong>; Christ took upon him the form of a servant, and instead of being ministered unto, ministered to others; and had very lately, but two days before, gird himself, and took a basin and a towel, and washed and wiped the feet of his disciples: now our Lord, by his own example throughout the whole of his conduct among them, as well as by such a single action, would dissuade from their ambitious views of superiority over each other, and learn of him who was meek and lowly, and by love serve one another.</p>
