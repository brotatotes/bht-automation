For whether is greater,.... Christ appeals to themselves, and puts a case that is plain and obvious to any one, who is the greater, and more honourable person;he that sitteth at meat; that sits, or lies down at table, and another waits on him:or he that serveth? that stands behind, observes orders, and ministers to those that sit down:is not he that sitteth at meat? you, and every one must own, that he is the greatest, and most honourable person:but I am among you as he that serveth; Christ took upon him the form of a servant, and instead of being ministered unto, ministered to others; and had very lately, but two days before, gird himself, and took a basin and a towel, and washed and wiped the feet of his disciples: now our Lord, by his own example throughout the whole of his conduct among them, as well as by such a single action, would dissuade from their ambitious views of superiority over each other, and learn of him who was meek and lowly, and by love serve one another.
