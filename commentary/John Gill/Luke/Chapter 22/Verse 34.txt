<p><strong>And he said</strong>,.... "To him", as all the Oriental versions add; to Peter, as what is said shows; that is, Jesus said to him, as the Syriac and Persic versions express:</p>
<p><strong>I tell thee</strong>, Peter; who knew him, and his heart, better than he did himself, as well as knew what was to come, and what would befall him; and therefore declares it, as he does with the greatest assurance and certainty, and which might be depended on, and accordingly came to pass:</p>
<p><strong>the cock shall not crow this day</strong>; in this night, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:30">Mark 14:30</span> or this night, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:34">Matthew 26:34</span> for it was now night; a natural day includes both night and day; a like way of speaking, see in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:8">Luke 2:8</span></p>
<p><strong>before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me</strong>; as he did,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:57">Luke 22:57</span>.</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:57- :">Luke 22:57- :</span>.</p>
