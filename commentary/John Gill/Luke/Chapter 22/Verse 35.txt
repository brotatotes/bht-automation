And he said unto them,.... To the disciples, as the Persic version reads; not to Peter only, but to them all:when I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes; without the necessaries of life, without proper accommodations for a journey, without provisions, or money, to buy any with: so ανευ βαλαντιου, "without a purse", is, by the Scholiast on Aristophanes t, interpreted by ανευ αργυριου και δαπανης, "without money and expense": Christ here refers to his mission of them in Matthew 10:5lacked ye any thing? any of the common blessings of life, food to eat, or raiment to wear?and they said, nothing; they lacked nothing at all; wherever they came, they had friendly accommodations; they were provided with every thing necessary for them; they had both food and raiment, and good lodgings in every place; the houses and hearts of men were opened by Christ to receive them, though they were sent out by him so empty and destitute.t In Avibus, p. 548.
