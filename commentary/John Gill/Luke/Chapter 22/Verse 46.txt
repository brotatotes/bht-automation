<p><strong>And said unto them, why sleep ye</strong>?.... The Arabic version prefaces this with these words, "and he awaked them"; and then rebuked them for sleeping, adding,</p>
<p><strong>rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation</strong>; together with words recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:45">Matthew 26:45</span>.</p>
