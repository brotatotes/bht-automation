<p><strong>And while he yet spake</strong>,.... The above words to his disciples,</p>
<p><strong>behold a multitude</strong>. The Persic version adds, "of Jews, with arrows, swords, and spears"; but the multitude consisted partly of Roman soldiers, and partly of the officers of the chief priests:</p>
<p><strong>and he that was called Judas</strong>: and sometimes Iscariot, to distinguish him from another Judas, who also was of the number of the apostles:</p>
<p><strong>one of the twelve</strong>; disciples of Christ, whom he had chosen, called, and ordained:</p>
<p><strong>went before them</strong>; as their guide, to show them where Jesus was, and to point him out unto them; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:16">Acts 1:16</span></p>
<p><strong>and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him</strong>; that being the signal he had given them, by which they should know him. The Syriac version here adds, "for this sign he had given to them, whomsoever I shall kiss, the same is he": and so likewise the Persic and Ethiopic versions, adding also this, "lay hold upon him"; but the whole seems to be transcribed from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:48">Matthew 26:48</span>.</p>
