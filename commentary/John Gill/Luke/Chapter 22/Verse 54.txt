<p><strong>Then took they him, and led him</strong>,.... The band of soldiers, the captain, and the officers of the Jews, laid hold on Jesus, and bound him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:12">John 18:12</span> and led him out of the garden; notwithstanding the miracle he had wrought, and the humanity he had shown in healing the servant's ear; and notwithstanding his moving address to the chiefs of them; and indeed, this was a confirmation of his last words; for by this it appeared, that now was their time, and power was given to them, as the emissaries of Satan, to act against him:</p>
<p><strong>and brought him into the high priest's house</strong>; where the sanhedrim were assembled; but this was not in the temple where they used to sit: it is true, indeed, that the chamber in the temple, called the chamber "Parhedrin", or "Palhedrin", was, בית דירה, "the dwelling house" of the high priest, seven days before the day of atonement k; and this was also called the "chamber of the counsellors" l; so that had the time of year agreed, it might have been thought that this was the place that Jesus was led to; but here the high priest did not usually dwell, and it is manifestly distinguished from his own house: for it is said m,</p>
<p>"seven days before the day of atonement, they separate, or remove the high priest, מביתו, "from his house", to the chamber of "Palhedrin";''</p>
