Looked upon him, and took notice of him, and observed his countenance and gesture: as he sat by the fire; or light; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. And both by the light of the fire, and other lights, which were doubtless in the hall, she discovered something in him, which made her look at him again with some earnestness;</p>
<p><strong>and earnestly looked upon him, and said, this man was also with him</strong>; that fellow, that vile and contemptible wretch, now examining before the high priest; thus in a contemptuous manner, as was the custom and style of that nation, she disdained to mention the name of Jesus; though the Persic version here expresses it; and her sense was, that Peter was one of that clan, a disciple of his, and was only come hither as a spy.</p>
