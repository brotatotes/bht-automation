<p><strong>And after a little while</strong>,.... A quarter, or half an hour after, within an hour at least:</p>
<p><strong>another saw him</strong>; not another maid, but another man, as appears from the answer; though the Syriac and Persic versions leave out the word man, it may be because Matthew and Mark represent the person, on account of whose words Peter denied Christ a second time, to be another maid; but then it is to be observed, that that maid did not speak directly to Peter, as this person did, but to those that were present, or that stood by: and one of these taking the hint from her, looked at him, and said,</p>
<p><strong>thou art also of them</strong>; of the disciples of Jesus of Nazareth; thou belongest to that company; thou art certainly one of his followers;</p>
<p><strong>and Peter said, man, I am not</strong>. This was after he had been out into the porch, and had mused upon it, and was come in again, but had not courage enough to withstand the temptation, and especially now, being attacked by a man; and so a second time denies that Christ was his master, or that he was a disciple of his.</p>
