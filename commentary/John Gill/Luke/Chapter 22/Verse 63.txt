<p><strong>And the men that held Jesus</strong>,.... Whilst he was before the sanhedrim; and were either the Roman soldiers, or the servants of the high priest, who kept hold of him all the while, lest he should get away; though there was no reason for it; his time was come, nor would he escape out of their hands, though he could easily have rescued himself:</p>
<p><strong>mocked him</strong>; insulted him, and gave him very opprobrious language, and used him in a very scurrilous way, and even spit upon him;</p>
<p><strong>and smote him</strong>. This clause is left out in the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions; the word used, signifies plucking off the skin; they pinched him, and tore off his flesh with their nails; they plucked the hairs of his beard, and the skin of his cheeks along with them, and so fulfilled <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:6">Isaiah 50:6</span>.</p>
