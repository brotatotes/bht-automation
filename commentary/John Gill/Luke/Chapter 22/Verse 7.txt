<p><strong>when the passover must be killed</strong>; that is, the passover lamb, as the Persic version renders it; and which, according to the law in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:6">Exodus 12:6</span> was to be done between the two evenings; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:6- :">Exodus 12:6- :</span>.</p>
