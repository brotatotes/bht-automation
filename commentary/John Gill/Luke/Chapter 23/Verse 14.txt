<p><strong>Said unto them, ye have brought this man unto me</strong>,.... Pointing to Jesus, who stood before him;</p>
<p><strong>as one that perverteth the people</strong>; from their religion, and laws, and allegiance to Caesar. The Syriac and Persic versions read, "your people"; of the same nation with them, and that were under their care and jurisdiction; at least in an ecclesiastical way:</p>
<p><strong>and behold, I having examined him before you</strong>; not only privately, and alone, between themselves in the judgment hall, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:33">John 18:33</span> but openly in the presence of them, when he brought forth Jesus to them, and heard their charges, and urged him to answer to them,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:11">Matthew 27:11</span></p>
<p><strong>have found no fault in this man</strong>; cannot perceive any charge proved against him, or any crime he is guilty of, for which punishment should be inflicted on him; or at least, that he should be put to death:</p>
<p><strong>touching</strong>, or with regard to</p>
<p><strong>those things, whereof ye accuse him</strong>. The Syriac and Persic versions read, "all those things"; intimating, that he had carefully looked into, and examined every thing, and had omitted nothing, and that all their accusations, and charges, put together, did not make it appear that he was guilty of a single crime.</p>
