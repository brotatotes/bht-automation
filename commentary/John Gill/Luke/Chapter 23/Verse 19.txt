<p><strong>Who, for a certain sedition made in the city</strong>,.... Of Jerusalem: he had made an insurrection in it, in opposition to the government, in order to have thrown off the yoke, and to have asserted and maintained their liberties, as a free people; or rather to have seized and plundered the properties of other people, since he is represented elsewhere as a robber:</p>
<p><strong>and for murder</strong>; which had either been committed by himself, or his accomplices, in the insurrection; and for these things, sedition, and murder, he</p>
<p><strong>was cast into prison</strong>; where he lay till this feast, in order to be executed.</p>
