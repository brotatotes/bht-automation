<p><strong>requiring him, that he might be crucified</strong>: desiring it in the most importunate manner; signifying, that it must be, that nothing else would content them:</p>
<p><strong>and the voices of them, and the chief priests, prevailed</strong>; upon Pilate to grant their request, contrary to the dictates of his own conscience, the conduct of Herod, and the message of his wife; the people being set on by the chief priests, and the chief priests joining with them, their numbers were so great, and their requests were pressed with so much force, and violence, and importunity, that Pilate could not withstand them.</p>
