And he released unto them, him,.... Barabbas, who is not named, as being a detestable person, and unworthy to be named; and is therefore described by the infamous, though just character of him, as follows:that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, as in Luke 23:19whom they had desired; to be granted to them, and released; see Acts 3:14but he delivered Jesus to their will; to do as they would with him, to mock, and scourge, and crucify him.
