<p><strong>And he released unto them, him</strong>,.... Barabbas, who is not named, as being a detestable person, and unworthy to be named; and is therefore described by the infamous, though just character of him, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>that for sedition and murder was cast into prison</strong>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:19">Luke 23:19</span></p>
<p><strong>whom they had desired</strong>; to be granted to them, and released; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:14">Acts 3:14</span></p>
<p><strong>but he delivered Jesus to their will</strong>; to do as they would with him, to mock, and scourge, and crucify him.</p>
