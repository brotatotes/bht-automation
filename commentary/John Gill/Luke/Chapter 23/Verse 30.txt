<p><strong>Then shall they begin to say</strong>,.... The Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions read, "then shall ye begin to say"; the tribulation being so great, as never was the like since the creation of the world, nor never will be to the end of it; and being so sore pressed with the sword and famine; with the enemy without, and divisions, robberies, and murders within; and their miseries being inexpressible, and intolerable, they will seek to go into the holes of the rocks, and caves of the earth, as is prophesied of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:19">Isaiah 2:19</span> and as Josephus says, many of them did, when the city was taken; and, like those in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ho+10:8">Hosea 10:8</span> will say, "to the mountains fall on us, and to the hills cover us"; will choose rather that the mountains and hills round about Jerusalem, should fall upon them, and they be buried under the ruins of them, than live in such terrible distress, or fall into the hands of their enemies! Compare with this <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:15">Revelation 6:15</span>.</p>
