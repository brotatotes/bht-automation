<p><strong>And there were also two other malefactors</strong>,.... Not that Christ was one, though indeed he was looked upon and treated as one by the Jews; but as the words may be read, there were also two others that were malefactors; really such, two thieves, who had been guilty of theft and robbery, and were condemned to die: and these were led with him; for the greater ignominy and reproach of Christ, that it might be thought he was equally a malefactor, and as deserving of death as they:</p>
<p><strong>to be put to death</strong>; the death of the cross, which was the death the Romans put slaves, thieves, and robbers, and the worst and basest of men to.</p>
