It was usual to crucify on high places, and on mountains, such an one as this was z:</p>
<p><strong>there they crucified him, and the malefactors</strong>; the two thieves;</p>
<p><strong>one on the right hand, and the other on the left</strong>; and so fulfilled the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:12">Isaiah 53:12</span>.</p>
