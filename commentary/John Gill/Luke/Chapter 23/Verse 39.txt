<p><strong>railed on him, saying, if thou be Christ, save thyself, and us</strong>; taking up the words of the rulers, and adding to them, perhaps, with a design to curry favour with them, hoping thereby to get a release; or, however, showing the wickedness and malice of his heart, which his sufferings and punishment, he now endured, could make no alteration in; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:9">Revelation 16:9</span>.</p>
