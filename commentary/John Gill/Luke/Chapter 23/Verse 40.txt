<p><strong>saying, dost not thou fear God</strong>; or "neither dost thou fear God", any more than these priests, people, and soldiers, that are acting such a barbarous and inhuman part to a man in misery: and wilt thou do the same, and show that thou art an impious wretch, now thou art just going out of the world, and neither fears God, nor regards man, and art without compassion to a fellow sufferer, adding sin to sin,</p>
<p><strong>seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</strong> undergoing the same sort of punishment, though not on the same account, which might be the reason why they suffered on the same day: for the Jews say a, they never judge (or condemn) two in one day, but one today, and the other tomorrow; but if they are in one transgression,</p>
<p>"txa htymw, "and one death", as an adulterer with an adulteress, they condemn them both in one day; but if the adulterer lies with a priest's daughter, seeing he is to be strangled, and she to be burnt, they do not execute them both in one day.''</p>
<p>a Maimon. Hilch. Sanhedrin, c. 14. sect. 10.</p>
