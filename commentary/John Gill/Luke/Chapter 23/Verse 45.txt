<p><strong>And the sun was darkened</strong>,.... There was an eclipse of it, which was preternatural, it being now full moon, and lasted three hours, and so total, as to darken the whole earth; and now was the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="am+8:9">Amos 8:9</span> literally fulfilled: and the vail of the temple was rent in the midst. The Persic version renders it, "the gate of the temple"; and so the Syriac version, "the face of the gate of the temple"; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="am+8:9- :">Amos 8:9- :</span>.</p>
