<p><strong>And all the people that came together to that sight</strong>,.... To see the execution of Jesus; and some of them might be his inveterate enemies, and came to insult him, and did insult him; many of these, though not every individual of them:</p>
<p><strong>beholding the things which were done</strong>; the eclipse, earthquake, c.</p>
<p><strong>smote their breasts</strong> as conscious of guilt, and as fearing some dreadful judgment would fall upon them, and their nation, for this sin of crucifying Christ. The Persic version reads, "they went back, and kneeled down, and prostrated themselves to the ground"; as being in the utmost astonishment, confusion, fear, and dread:</p>
<p><strong>and returned</strong>; to the city, and to their own houses, where they might more seriously, and with the greater composure of mind, reflect on these things.</p>
