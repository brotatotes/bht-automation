And they were the more fierce,.... Or urgent to have him put to death; so the Hebrew word חזק is rendered in Exodus 12:33 which answers to that here used. "They cried out", as the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions read; they were more clamorous and noisy; they cried out louder, and exerted themselves with great fury and violence, and added strength to their clamour, and increased their charges:saying, he stirreth up the people; to sedition and rebellion:teaching throughout all Jewry; or "Judea"; not in one, or a few places only, but every where:beginning from Galilee; where indeed our Lord did begin his ministry, and where he chiefly taught; see Matthew 4:12 and which they rather chose to mention, because that the Galilaeans were reckoned a seditious people, and had been drawn into rebellion, and had suffered for it; see Acts 5:37to this place; the city of Jerusalem, the metropolis of the nation; suggesting, that he taught seditious principles not only in Galilee, but all the way from thence throughout Judea, and even in their chief city, and had drawn many disciples after him every where; so that it was a notorious case, as well as of great consequence, and much danger, and ought not to be trifled with.
