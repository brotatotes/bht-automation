And he took it down,.... From the cross, with the help of others, having obtained leave of Pilate so to do;and wrapped it in linen; as was the custom of the Jews in burying their dead;  :-.and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone; cut out of a rock;  :-.wherein never man before was laid; so that it could not be said it was another body, and not that of Christ's, that was raised from the dead. This circumstance, serves to confirm the truth of his resurrection.
