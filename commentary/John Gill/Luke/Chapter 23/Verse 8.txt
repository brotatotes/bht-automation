<p><strong>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad</strong>,.... For though he had been brought up in his country, and had so frequently preached, and wrought miracles there, he had never seen him before; and to have a sight of him, was a great indulgence to his curiosity:</p>
<p><strong>for he was desirous to see him of a long season</strong>; perhaps ever since he had heard of his fame, and had entertained a notion that Christ was John the Baptist risen from the dead, whom he had beheaded; and therefore was desirous of seeing him, that he might know whether he was John or not:</p>
<p><strong>because he had heard many things of him</strong>; concerning his doctrine, and miracles, and especially the latter; how that he cast out devils, and healed all manner of diseases, and even raised the dead to life:</p>
<p><strong>and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him</strong>; which would have still more gratified his curiosity, and have been the subject of further inquiry and conversation.</p>
