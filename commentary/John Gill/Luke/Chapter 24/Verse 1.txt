<p><strong>Now upon the first day of the week</strong>,.... On which day it appears by what follows, Christ rose from the dead, and which was the third day from his death, and so verified the Scriptures, and his own predictions:</p>
<p><strong>very early in the morning</strong>; just as light began to spring, the day to dawn, and break; the first appearance of the morning; when it first began to dawn;</p>
<p><strong>when it was yet dark</strong>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:1">John 20:1</span> and so read the Syriac and Persic versions here; and the Ethiopic version, "while it was yet night": this must be understood of the time when the women set out from the city, or suburbs; for by that time they got to the sepulchre it was at sunrise, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:2">Mark 16:2</span> and shows their great love, zeal, and devotion for Christ, and great courage and fearlessness to go out of the city at such a time, without any man with them, and to a grave:</p>
<p><strong>they came unto the sepulchre</strong>, where Christ was laid; that is, the women who came with Christ from Galilee, and who had observed where, and how his body was interred:</p>
<p><strong>bringing the spices which they had prepared</strong>; on the sabbath eve, to anoint the body, but were prevented by reason of the sabbath; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:56">Luke 23:56</span></p>
<p><strong>and certain others with them</strong>; that is, other women; besides Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Joses, and Salome, and other Galilean women, there were other Jerusalem women, or of Bethany, it may be, Mary, and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus, and of the parts adjacent: this clause is left out in the Vulgate Latin, and Ethiopic versions, and in one ancient copy of Beza's; but is retained in the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions.</p>
