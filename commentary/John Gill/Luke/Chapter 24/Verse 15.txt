<p><strong>And it came to pass, that while they communed together</strong>,.... About the above said things:</p>
<p><strong>and reasoned</strong>; with one another; about the truth and credibility of the late report:</p>
<p><strong>Jesus himself drew near</strong>: the Persic version adds, "suddenly"; he came up at once to them, as if he had been a traveller on the road, and overtook them:</p>
<p><strong>and went with them</strong>; joined himself in company to them, and travelled with them.</p>
