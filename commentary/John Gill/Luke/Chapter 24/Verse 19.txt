<p><strong>And he said unto them, what things</strong>?.... Still appearing as if he was ignorant, and in order to, draw out of them a particular relation:</p>
<p><strong>and they said unto him</strong>; both of them, or rather Cleophas, for himself and his companion:</p>
<p><strong>concerning Jesus of Nazareth</strong>; that is, what had happened to him, who was commonly known by this name, and was called so by way of contempt: but</p>
<p><strong>which was a prophet</strong>; not only a foreteller of things to come, as he foretold his sufferings, death, and resurrection, the troubles that should befall his disciples, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the end of the world; but he was a preacher of the Gospel, an eminent one, a famous and extraordinary one, that prophet which Moses spake of should come; and who was mighty in deed and word: he was anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power, which he showed by the miracles he wrought; such as healing the sick, cleansing lepers, casting out devils, restoring sight to the blind, causing the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, the lame to walk, and raising the dead to life; and in the doctrines he taught, which were with authority, and such as never man spake:</p>
<p><strong>before God and all the people</strong>; he was sent and anointed by God as a prophet, and approved by him; who bore a testimony to him by a voice from heaven, declaring him to be his beloved Son; and the works he wrought, were done publicly before men, who glorified God on that account; and the doctrines he taught, were not taught in secret, but in the synagogues and in the temple, in the audience of all the people, and to their surprise and admiration.</p>
