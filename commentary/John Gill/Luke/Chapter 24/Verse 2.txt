And they found the stone rolled away the sepulchre. Which Joseph had laid there, security of the body, and in the sight of these women; and which gave them a concern, as they went along, seeing they were all women, who should roll away the stone for them,Mark 16:3 but when they came to the sepulchre, to their great surprise, they found it rolled away, which was done by an angel,Matthew 28:2.
