<p><strong>And when they found not his body</strong>,.... In the sepulchre, as they expected, and so could not do what they intended:</p>
<p><strong>they came</strong>; they returned from the sepulchre with great haste, and in a very great fright, and came to the disciples, where they were assembled;</p>
<p><strong>saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels</strong>. The Syriac and Persic versions add, "there"; at the sepulchre, for there were two of them at least, if not three; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:4">Luke 24:4</span>. They not only reported, that they could not find the body of Jesus, but also that they had seen some angels: or the sense may be, that they told them, that though they could not find the dead body of their Lord, yet they had seen him alive, as they did by the way, as they were returning, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:9">Matthew 28:9</span> and also that a vision of angels had appeared to them:</p>
<p><strong>which said that he was alive</strong>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:5">Luke 24:5</span>. So that it was not a deception of their sight, they certainly saw both Christ and the angels; and were assured from their testimony, as well as by their own eyes and ears, that he was certainly risen: now, though this was so clear a point, and so well attested, the disciples knew not how to believe it; they were perplexed about it; they could neither receive it, nor discredit it; they hoped it might be so, but feared it was not.</p>
