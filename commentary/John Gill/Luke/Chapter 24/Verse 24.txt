And certain of them which were with us,.... The apostles and brethren, who were together when the women came, and made the above report; particularly Peter, who is named, Luke 24:12 and John, who also was with him, as appears from John 20:2 thesewent to the sepulchre; of Jesus, to satisfy themselves and their companions, as much as they could, about these things:and found it even so as the women had said; that is, that the body of Jesus was not there, and that the linen clothes were laid by themselves:but him they saw not; the Ethiopic version reads, "and him they found not": the women, as before observed, might report, that though they found not the body in the grave, yet they saw him alive by the way, but so did not the disciples; which made it look very strange, doubtful, and suspicious, that the women should see him, and not his apostles; they could not tell how to account for this, and this made them to be in suspense about the fact.
