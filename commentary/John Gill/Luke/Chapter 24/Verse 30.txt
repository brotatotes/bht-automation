<p><strong>And it came to pass as he sat at meat with them</strong>,.... When they were sat down at table with the provisions before them:</p>
<p><strong>he took bread and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them</strong>; as if he was the master of the house, when he was both a guest, and a stranger, and as he used to do at common meals, when he ate with his disciples; and thus he did, when he fed five thousand at one time, and four at another, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:19">Matthew 14:19</span> see the notes there.</p>

<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:19- :">Matthew 14:19- :</span>. Whether only Christ, and the two disciples, sat down together, or whether others that belonged to the house sat down with them, is not certain: if they were only three, they were a proper company to bless the bread together; that is, one in the name of the rest, they joining with him: if there were but two, they blessed, or said grace for themselves separately; but if three, the rules were these, according to the Jews y:</p>
<p>"three that eat together, they are obliged to call a blessing (or for one) --and how do they call a blessing among three? one says, let us bless: if there are three besides himself, he says, bless ye. --Three that eat together have no power to divide;''</p>
<p>that is, to make a separate blessing, but are obliged to it conjunctly: thus here, being three at least, Christ blessed bread for them all.</p>
