<p><strong>And they rose up the same hour</strong>,.... Though it was now evening, and the day was spent and gone; and notwithstanding what business they might have to do at Emmaus, about which they came, and even might not have made an end of eating, or sufficiently refreshed themselves; and though they had had a walk of sixty furlongs that afternoon, yet being big with this appearance of Christ to them, and in haste to impart the joyful news to their fellow disciples, they immediately rose up from table:</p>
<p><strong>and returned to Jerusalem</strong>; the same night, from whence they had come that day:</p>
<p><strong>and found the eleven gathered together</strong>; at a certain house known to these two, and who met together in the night season, for the sake of privacy, and for fear of the Jews, and who were now up, though it was late: these are called "eleven", because Judas was now gone from them, and dead; and this being their whole number, it is used, though every one might not be present, as particularly Thomas was not; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:19">John 20:19</span></p>
<p><strong>and them that were with them</strong>; the seventy disciples, and other believers, both men and women; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15">Acts 1:15</span>.</p>
