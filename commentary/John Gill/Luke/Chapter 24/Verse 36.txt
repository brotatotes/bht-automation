<p><strong>And as they thus spake</strong>,.... While the two disciples, that came from Emmaus, were giving the above relation; just as they had finished it, and had scarcely done speaking:</p>
<p><strong>Jesus himself stood in the midst of them</strong>; the apostles; who were assembled together in a certain house, the doors being shut for fear of the Jews; and it was on the evening of the same day Christ rose from the dead, and late at night; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:19">John 20:19</span> and without hearing the doors opened, or the sound of the feet of Jesus, and without seeing him come in, and approach unto them, he, in a moment, at once, stood in the middle of them, as if he had immediately rose up out of the earth before them; and so the Persic version renders it, "Jesus rose up out the midst of them": by his power he opened the and secretly let himself in, and shut them again at once; and by the agility of his body moved so swiftly, that he was not discerned until he was among them, where he stood to be seen, and known by them; whereby he made that good in a corporeal sense, which he had promised in a spiritual sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:20">Matthew 18:20</span> and was an emblem of his presence in his churches, and with his ministers, to the end of the world.</p>
<p><strong>And saith unto them, peace be unto you</strong>; which was an usual form of salutation among the Jews; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:20- :">Matthew 18:20- :</span>. The Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions add, "I am he, fear not"; but this clause is not in the Greek copies.</p>
