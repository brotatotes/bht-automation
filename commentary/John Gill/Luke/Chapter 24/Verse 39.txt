<p><strong>Behold my hands, and my feet</strong>,.... The Evangelist John adds, "and side"; that is, the prints of the nails and spear, in his hands, and feet, and side; and the wounds they made there, and the scars they left behind; by which they might be convinced he was not a spirit, and be assured of the truth of his resurrection, and that in the same numerical body in which he suffered; as well as that it might be observed by them how great was his love to them, to endure what he did for them.</p>
<p><strong>Handle me and see</strong>; or know by feeling, as well as by sight; so that if the one was not sufficient, the other might confirm; sight might be deceived, but feeling could not: Apollonius Tyaneus, to them that did not know whether he was alive or dead, and who took him for a spirit, proposed himself to be touched, and handled, that they might be convinced z:</p>
<p><strong>for a spirit hath not flesh and bones</strong>; nothing but appearance, or air at most; no solid substance to be felt and handled:</p>
<p><strong>as ye see me have</strong>; or may perceive, both by sight and feeling.</p>
<p>z Philostratus de Vita Apollon. l. 8, c. 5.</p>
