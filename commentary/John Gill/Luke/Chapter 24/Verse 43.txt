<p><strong>And he took it, and did eat before them.</strong> That is, he took both the fish, and the honeycomb, and ate of them before them, they looking on all the while; and which was a proof of his being truly risen from the dead, and not a spectre, or apparition, and which they failed not afterwards to make use of; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:41">Acts 10:41</span>. The Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions add, "he took the rest, or what remained, and gave it to them".</p>
