<p><strong>And as they were afraid</strong>,.... That is, the women were afraid of these angels; these bright appearances and majestic forms, as it was usual for good men and women to be, as appears from the cases of Zacharias, the Virgin Mary, and others:</p>
<p><strong>and bowed down their faces to the earth</strong>, through great fear and reverence of these heavenly spirits, and as not being able to bear the lustre of their countenances and garments:</p>
<p><strong>they said unto them</strong>, that is, the angels:</p>
<p><strong>why seek ye the living among the dead</strong>? intimating, that Christ, though he had been dead, was now living, and not to be sought for in a sepulchre; a way of speaking, much like this, is used in a parable of R. Levi's, concerning Pharaoh's not finding the name of God among the gods of the nations, upon searching for it. Moses and Aaron said to Pharaoh,</p>
<p>"thou fool, is it usual for the dead to "seek" them among the living? שמא החיים אצל המתים, "or ever the living among the dead?" our God is living, these thou speakest of are dead i.''</p>
<p>Nor is Christ to be found among dead sinners, or lifeless professors, but among living saints, and among the churches of the living God; nor is life to be found among the dead works of the law, or to be obtained by lifeless performances on the dead letter of the law.</p>
<p>i Shemot Rabba, sect. 5. fol. 95. 3.</p>
