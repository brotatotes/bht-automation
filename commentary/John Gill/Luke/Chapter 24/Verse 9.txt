Quickly, immediately, as soon as ever the angel had done speaking to them; they fled from the sepulchre in great haste, as persons frightened and amazed, with fear and reverence, on account of the vision they saw, and with joy at what was told them; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:8">Matthew 28:8</span></p>
<p><strong>and told all these things</strong>; as that the stone was rolled away from the sepulchre: and that they found not the body of Jesus in it; that they had seen a vision of angels, who had told them, that Christ was risen, and had put them in mind of some words of his spoken to the disciples in their hearing in Galilee:</p>
<p><strong>unto the eleven, and to all the rest</strong>; of the disciples: not only to the eleven apostles, but the seventy disciples, and as many others as were assembled together, perhaps the hundred and twenty, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15">Acts 1:15</span>. The Persic version very wrongly reads, "to all the twelve"; for Judas was not now one of them, nor alive; and Matthias was not yet chosen.</p>
