<p><strong>And the people asked him</strong>,.... Not the same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:7">Luke 3:7</span> the Sadducees and Pharisees, for they seemed not to be at all affected with, and wrought upon, by the ministry of John; but rather were displeased with him, and turned their backs on him, and rejected him and his baptism; but the common people, that stood by; who hearing John speak of wrath to come, and of repentance, and fruits worthy of it, were filled with concern about these things, and inquire,</p>
<p><strong>saying, what shall we do?</strong> either to escape the wrath and vengeance coming on the nation, and also eternal ruin and destruction; and Beza says, that in two of his copies, and one of them his most ancient one it is added, "to be saved", and so in two of Stephens's; which confirms the above sense, and makes their inquiry to be the same with the jailor's, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:30">Acts 16:30</span> or else their meaning is, what are the things we are to do, or the fruits we are to bring forth, the duties we are to perform, in order to testify the truth and genuineness of our repentance? which latter seems most agreeable.</p>
