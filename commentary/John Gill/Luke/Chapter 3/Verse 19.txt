<p><strong>But Herod the tetrarch being reproved by him</strong>,.... By John, as the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions add:</p>
<p><strong>for Herodias his brother Philip's wife</strong>; for taking her to wife, whilst his brother Philip was living. The account, which the Jewish chronologer x gives, of this Herod, and of this fact of his, and John's reproving him for it, and the consequence of it, perfectly agrees with this of the evangelist.</p>
<p>"Herod Antipater, and there are some that call him, טיטרקי "the tetrarch", was a son of Herod the first, and brother of Archelaus'; and he was the third king of the family of Herod; and he was very wicked, and a destroying man: many of the wise men of Israel he slew with the sword; and he took the wife of his brother Philip, whilst he was alive, to himself for wife; and John, the high priest, because</p>
<p>הוכיחו, "he reproved him" for this, he slew him with the sword, with many of the wise men of Israel.''</p>
<p>And John reproved him not only for this sin, but others:</p>
<p><strong>and for all the evils which Herod had done</strong>; his revellings, debaucheries, murders, &amp;c. all which John, in great faithfulness, and with much freedom, told him and rebuked him for: for Herod had had a particular respect for him, and often had him with him, and heard him gladly, when John had an opportunity of speaking personally to him.</p>
