<p><strong>And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape</strong>,.... In a corporeal form, in a visible manner, and was seen with bodily eyes, at least by John the administrator; to whom this was a signal of his being the Messiah, and a fresh confirmation of it:</p>
<p><strong>like a dove upon him</strong>; either in the form of a dove, or this corporeal form, whatever it was, descended and hovered on him as a dove does:</p>
<p><strong>and a voice came from heaven</strong>; at the same time the Holy Ghost came down upon him; which said,</p>
<p><strong>thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased</strong>: and was the voice of the Father; and the whole of this was an answer of Christ's prayer;</p>
