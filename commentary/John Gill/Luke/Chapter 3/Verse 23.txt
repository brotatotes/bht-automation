<p><strong>And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age</strong>,.... Or Jesus, when he was baptized and began his public ministry, was about thirty years of age: an age at which the priests, under the law, who were typical of Christ, entered on their work, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+4:23">Numbers 4:23</span> The word, "began", is left out in the Syriac and Persic versions: and is often indeed redundant, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:8">Luke 3:8</span> and frequently in Mark's Gospel. The Arabic version renders it, "Jesus began to enter into the thirtieth year", which carries the sense the same with our translation:</p>
<p><strong>being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph</strong>; who had espoused Mary before she was with child of the Holy Ghost, and afterwards took her to wife, and brought up her son; so that it was not known but that he was the son of Joseph. Whether or no the Jewish notion of the Messiah, the son of Joseph y may not take its rise from hence, may be considered: however, Joseph might very rightly be called, as he was supposed to be, the father of Jesus, by a rule which obtains with the Jews z that he</p>
<p>"that brings up, and not he that begets, is called the father,''</p>
<p>or parent; of which they give various instances a in Joseph, in Michal, and in Pharaoh's daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Which was the son of Eli</strong>; meaning, not that Joseph was the son of Eli; for he was the son of Jacob, according to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:16">Matthew 1:16</span>, but Jesus was the son of Eli; and which must be understood, and carried through the whole genealogy, as thus; Jesus the son of Matthat, Jesus the son of Levi, Jesus the son of Melchi, c. till you come to Jesus the son of Adam, and Jesus the Son of God though it is true indeed that Joseph was the son of Eli, having married his daughter; Mary was the daughter of Eli: and so the Jews speak of one Mary, the daughter of Eli, by whom they seem to design the mother of our Lord: for they tell b us of one,</p>
<p>"that saw, מרים בת עלי, "Mary the daughter of Eli" in the shades, hanging by the fibres of her breasts; and there are that say, the gate, or, as elsewhere c, the bar of the gate of hell is fixed to her ear.''</p>
<p>By the horrible malice, in the words, you may know who is meant: however, this we gain by it, that by their own confession, Mary is the daughter of Eli; which accords with this genealogy of the evangelist, who traces it from Mary, under her husband Joseph; though she is not mentioned, because of a rule with the Jews d, that</p>
<p>"the family of the mother is not called a family.''</p>
