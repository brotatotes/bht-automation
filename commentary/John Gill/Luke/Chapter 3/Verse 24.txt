<p><strong>Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi</strong>,.... These two, Grotius says, are omitted in the ancient exemplars; and he thinks they ought to be left out; and for which he mentions the authorities of Irenaeus, Africanus, Eusebius, Nazianzen, Jerom, and Augustin: but not only the Vulgate Latin, but all the Oriental versions, retain them:</p>
<p><strong>which was the son of Melchi</strong>: and who, he thinks, was the immediate father of Eli:</p>
<p><strong>which was the son of Janna</strong>: frequent mention is made, in the Jewish writings e of ינאי מלכא, "king Jannai", who is said to be the same with king Jochanan, or John, the son of Simeon, the son of Mattithiah, that was called Hyrcanus; and his son Alexander, that reigned after him, was also called Jannai f; but whether either of these is the same with this Janna, is not certain: but this may be observed, that they were both before the times of Herod, and the birth of Jesus, some years. And Jannai is called; in the chronicle of Jedidiah of Alexandria, or Philo the Jew g, Hyrcanus the second, who reigned sixteen years:</p>
<p><strong>which was the son of Joseph</strong>. This Joseph, according to the same chronicle, is called Joseph the second, and surnamed Arsis, and was greatly honoured by Ptolemy, and governed sixty years; and accordingly we shall meet with another Joseph anon.</p>
