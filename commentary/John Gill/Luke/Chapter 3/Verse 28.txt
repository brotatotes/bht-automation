<p>Ver. 28 <strong>Which was the son of Melchi</strong>,.... This, with the following, "Addi, Cosam, Elmodam, Er, Jose, Eliezer, Jorim, Matthat, Levi, Simeon, Juda, Joseph, Jonan, Eliakim, Melea, Menan, and Mattatha", all lived before the captivity, and were of the house of David, in the line of Nathan; for it follows,</p>
<p><strong>which was the son of Nathan</strong>: of which persons no mention is made in the Old Testament, nor even of Mattatha, the son of Nathan: his sons that are mentioned are Azariah, Zabud, and Ahishar, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+4:5">1 Kings 4:5</span> which last is thought to be the same with Mattatha: that Nathan was the son of David, as the order of things here directs,</p>
<p><strong>which was the son of David</strong>, is clear from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+5:14">2 Samuel 5:14</span>.</p>
