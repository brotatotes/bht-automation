<p><strong>Which was the son of Jesse</strong>,.... The order of the persons from Jesse to Abraham, as Obed, Boaz, Salmon, Naasson, Aminadab, Aram, or Ram, Esrom, (for Joram, which the Arabic version here inserts, is to be rejected,) Phares, Judah, Jacob, Isaac, Abraham, perfectly agrees with the genealogy of Matthew, and the accounts of the Old Testament:</p>
<p><strong>which was the son of Thara</strong>; the same with Terah, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:26">Genesis 11:26</span> called by the Septuagint, Tharra:</p>
<p><strong>which was the son of Nachor</strong>;, the same with Nahor, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:24">Genesis 11:24</span> called there, by the Septuagint, as here.</p>
