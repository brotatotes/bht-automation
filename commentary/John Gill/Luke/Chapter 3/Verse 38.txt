<p><strong>Which was the son of Enos</strong>,.... <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+5:9">Genesis 5:9</span></p>
<p><strong>which was the son of Seth</strong>, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+5:6">Genesis 5:6</span></p>
<p><strong>which was the son of Adam</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+5:3">Genesis 5:3</span></p>
<p><strong>which was the son of God</strong>: not begotten, as all the rest were, by their immediate parents, but created by God, in a supernatural manner, out of the dust of the earth, and quickened with the breath of God: so Adam is, by the Jews h called, בן אלהים, "the son of God": though this may be understood of Jesus; the son of Joseph, of Heli, c. and so on to this clause, "the son of God" being so as a divine person, to whom the human nature was united, and on that account so called; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:35">Luke 1:35</span> Thus, as Matthew gives us the regal line of Christ, showing him to be heir to the throne of his father David, Luke gives the natural line of Christ; and as Matthew traces his genealogy down from Abraham, in a descending line, to Joseph, the husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus, Luke traces it upwards, in an ascending line, from Mary by Joseph, even up to Adam; to whom the Messiah was first promised, and who was a type of the second Adam, from whom he descended, though not by ordinary generation; nay, even to God himself: Christ, according to his divine nature, was the only begotten of the Father; and as to his human nature, had a body prepared by him, and in the fulness of time was God manifest in the flesh.</p>
