<p><strong>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance</strong>,.... Or "meet" for it, such as will show it to be true and genuine: "and begin not to say within yourselves": in one of Beza's copies, and in another of Stephens's, it was read, "think not", as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span>. the sense is the same. The Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, leave out the phrase, "within yourselves": what they are forbid to say follows,</p>
<p><strong>we have Abraham to our father, for I say unto you, God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham</strong>; which need not be thought strange, when the creation of Adam out of the earth, and the production of such a numerous offspring, as the Israelites were, from Abraham and Sarah, when past all hope of children, and are signified by the rock and pit in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+51:1">Isaiah 51:1</span> are considered;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+51:1- :">Isaiah 51:1- :</span>.</p>
