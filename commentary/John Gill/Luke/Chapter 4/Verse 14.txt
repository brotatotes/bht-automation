And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit,.... Of which he was full, and by which he was led into the wilderness, and had combated with Satan, and had got the victory over him; and by virtue of which, he entered on his public ministry, wrought miracles, and taught with authority. A like way of speaking is used by the Targumist, on Micah 3:8. I am filled, בתקוף רוח נבואה, "with the power of the spirit of prophecy", from before the Lord. Moreover, this phrase is used, to show that his returninto Galilee, where he had been brought up, and from whence he came to John at Jordan, did not arise from a natural love to his country, and a fond desire of being there again; but was owing to the powerful impulse of the Holy Spirit, which was in him, and moved him to return thither; where he was to begin his ministry, and work his miracles, and so fulfil a prophecy of him, in Isaiah 9:1 see Matthew 4:12.And there went out a fame of him through all the region round about: throughout all Galilee and Syria, Decapolis and Judea; see Matthew 4:23, the report of his doctrines and miracles, was spread far and near; and on account of them, he became the subject of the common talk of people every where, who highly applauded and commended him for them.
