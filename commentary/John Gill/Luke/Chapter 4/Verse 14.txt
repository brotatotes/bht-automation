<p><strong>And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit</strong>,.... Of which he was full, and by which he was led into the wilderness, and had combated with Satan, and had got the victory over him; and by virtue of which, he entered on his public ministry, wrought miracles, and taught with authority. A like way of speaking is used by the Targumist, on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mic+3:8">Micah 3:8</span>. I am filled, בתקוף רוח נבואה, "with the power of the spirit of prophecy", from before the Lord. Moreover, this phrase is used, to show that his return</p>
<p><strong>into Galilee</strong>, where he had been brought up, and from whence he came to John at Jordan, did not arise from a natural love to his country, and a fond desire of being there again; but was owing to the powerful impulse of the Holy Spirit, which was in him, and moved him to return thither; where he was to begin his ministry, and work his miracles, and so fulfil a prophecy of him, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:1">Isaiah 9:1</span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:12">Matthew 4:12</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And there went out a fame of him through all the region round about</strong>: throughout all Galilee and Syria, Decapolis and Judea; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23">Matthew 4:23</span>, the report of his doctrines and miracles, was spread far and near; and on account of them, he became the subject of the common talk of people every where, who highly applauded and commended him for them.</p>
