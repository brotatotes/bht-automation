<p><strong>And he began to say unto them</strong>,.... To preach from those words; the explanation of which he gave, though not here recorded, and applied them to himself, to whom they belonged, saying:</p>
<p><strong>this day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears</strong>; which is as if he should say, I am the person here spoken of; and at this present time the Spirit of God is upon me; I am anointed with the Holy Ghost, and now preach glad tidings to you, and all the good things here mentioned, and for the several ends proposed; and this Scripture has its full accomplishment which has been read unto you, and you have heard this day. So the Syriac version renders it, דבאדניכון, "which is in your ears"; that is, which you have now heard. The Jews themselves acknowledge, that these words are spoken of the Messiah. One of their writers i says,</p>
<p>"these are the words of the prophet with respect to the Messiah; for the Messiah shall say so, "because the Lord hath anointed me", c.''</p>
<p>And so said the true Messiah Jesus. Another of them expresses himself thus k:</p>
<p>"these are the words of the prophet with respect to the Messiah for the Messiah shall say thus, "because the Lord hath anointed me", &amp;c. or they are the words of the prophet concerning himself.''</p>
<p>And elsewhere it is said by them l,</p>
<p>"the holy, blessed God, will send his Messiah to us, and he shall be worthy of this, (i.e. the character of a meek person) as it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span> "he hath sent me to preach glad tidings to the meek."''</p>
