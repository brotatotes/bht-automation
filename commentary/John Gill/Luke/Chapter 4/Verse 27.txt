<p><strong>saving Naaman, the Syrian</strong>: or but Naaman, who was not an Israelite, but a Syrian: he was cleansed and cured of his leprosy, being ordered by Elisha to dip himself seven times in Jordan, which he did, and was healed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:14">2 Kings 5:14</span>.</p>
