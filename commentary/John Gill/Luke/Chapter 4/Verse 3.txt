<p><strong>And the devil said unto him</strong>,.... Who now visibly appeared, and spoke unto him with an articulate voice:</p>
<p><strong>if thou be the Son of God</strong>; as has been just now declared by a voice from heaven; or seeing thou art in such a relation to God, and so equal to him, and possessed of all divine perfections, and among the rest, of almighty power; wherefore, since thou art hungry, and in a wilderness, where no food is to be had,</p>
<p><strong>command this stone that it be made bread</strong>; say but the word, and this stone, which he held out to him, or pointed at, as lying before them, or any one of the stones, which were in sight, for Matthew speaks of them in the plural number, will immediately be converted into bread, if he was what he was said to be: this he suggests might easily be effected by him, and he had no need to continue hungry.</p>
