<p>Ver. 41 <strong>And devils also came out of many</strong>,.... Not willingly, nor of themselves, but at the word and command of Christ, who ordered them to depart,</p>
<p><strong>crying out and saying</strong>; as they left the bodies, of men, and not with any goodwill to Christ:</p>
<p><strong>thou art Christ</strong>; the true Messiah, that was of old promised and prophesied of, and has been long expected to come:</p>
<p><strong>the Son of God;</strong> the only begotten Son of God, possessed of the same perfections with God his Father; and particularly of almighty power, of which they were convinced by his dispossessing them;</p>
<p><strong>and he rebuking them, suffered them not to speak</strong>; for he needed not their testimony, nor did he choose to be made known by them:</p>
<p><strong>for they knew that he was Christ</strong>, or "that they knew that he was Christ"; so the Syriac version: they certainly did know that he was the Messiah, partly by the voice from heaven at his baptism, and partly by his power over them: but Christ would not suffer them to say that he was the Messiah, or that they knew him to be so; either because the time was not come for such a declaration to be made, or they were not the proper persons to make it; and lest such a publication, by them, should be made a handle of by the Scribes and Pharisees, to say that he had society with devils, and by them cast them out.</p>
