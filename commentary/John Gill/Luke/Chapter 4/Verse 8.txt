<p><strong>Jesus answered and said unto him</strong>,.... The following words, with indignation at him, and detestation of his proposals:</p>
<p><strong>get thee behind me, Satan</strong>; which are omitted in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, and in three ancient copies of Beza's, and in his most ancient one; but stand in other copies, and in the Arabic version.</p>
<p><strong>For it is written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve</strong>. This passage stands in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+6:13">Deuteronomy 6:13</span> where the words are, "thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him, and thou shalt swear by his name": the last clause is not cited by Christ at all, swearing being only a species, or part of religious worship; and the other two clauses are somewhat different from the original text, as here cited, and may be accounted for: instead of "fear the Lord", it is "worship the Lord"; and the one well explains the other; the fear of God being often, in Scripture, put for the whole worship of God, both internal and external: and in the next clause, the word "only" is added by Christ, as expressing the true sense of it, and agreeably to other places of Scripture, particularly <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+7:3">1 Samuel 7:3</span>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+7:3- :">1 Samuel 7:3- :</span>.</p>
