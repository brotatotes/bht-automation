<p><strong>And it came to pass on a certain day</strong>,.... When he was at Capernaum, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:1">Mark 2:1</span></p>
<p><strong>As he was teaching</strong>: in the house where such numbers were gathered together, to hear the word of God preached by him, that there was not room for them, neither within the house, nor about the door, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:2">Mark 2:2</span></p>
<p><strong>That there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by</strong>; who were sometimes called Scribes, and sometimes lawyers, and were generally of the sect of the Pharisees:</p>
<p><strong>which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem</strong>: having heard much of his doctrine and miracles, they came from all parts to watch and observe him, and to take all opportunities and advantages against him, that they might expose him to the people:</p>
<p><strong>and the power of the Lord was present to heal them</strong>; not the Pharisees and doctors of the law, who did not come to be healed by him, either in body or mind; but the multitude, some of whom came to hear his doctrine, and others to be healed of their infirmities, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:15">Luke 5:15</span>. The Persic version reads the words thus, "and from all the villages of Galilee, and from Judea, and from Jerusalem, multitudes came, and the power of God was present to heal them."</p>
