<p><strong>And saw two ships standing by the lake</strong>,.... Or two fishing boats; which were, as the Arabic version renders it, "detained by anchors at the shore of the lake"; the one belonging to Peter and Andrew, and the other to Zebedee, and his two sons, James and John:</p>
<p><strong>but the fishermen were gone out of them</strong>; that is, either the above persons, or their servants:</p>
<p><strong>and were washing their nets</strong>; on shore; they having gathered a great deal of soil and filthiness, but had caught no fish; and therefore were cleansing their nets, in order to lay them up, finding it to be in vain to make any further attempts with them at present; and which considered, makes the following miracle the more illustrious.</p>
