<p><strong>But that ye may know, that the son of man</strong>,.... Whom the Scribes and Pharisees took for a mere man, in which they were mistaken; for though he was really a man, and the son of man, yet he was God as well as man; he was God manifest in the flesh:</p>
<p><strong>hath power upon earth to forgive sins</strong>; even in the days of his flesh, whilst he was in his humble form on earth; for he did not cease to be God by becoming man, nor lose any branch of his power, not this of forgiving sin, by appearing in the form of a servant; and, that it might be manifest,</p>
<p><strong>he said unto the sick of the palsy</strong>: these are the words of the evangelist, signifying, that Christ turned himself from the Scribes and Pharisees to the paralytic man, and thus addressed him:</p>
<p><strong>I say unto thee, arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house</strong>.</p>
