<p><strong>And they were all amazed, and they glorified God</strong>,.... Not the Pharisees, and doctors of the law, but the common people:</p>
<p><strong>and were filled with fear</strong>; of the Divine Being, whose presence and power they were sensible must be in this case:</p>
<p><strong>saying, we have seen strange things today</strong>; paradoxes, things wonderful, unthought of, unexpected, and incredible by carnal reason, and what were never seen, nor known before; as that a man, who was so enfeebled by the palsy, that he was obliged to be carried on a bed by four men, yet, on a sudden, by a word speaking, rose up, and carried his bed, on his back, home.</p>
