<p><strong>And he left all</strong>,.... His company, his business, and all the profits of it:</p>
<p><strong>rose up</strong>; directly; such power went along with the words of Christ, that he could not withstand it:</p>
<p><strong>and followed him</strong>; not only in a literal, but in a spiritual sense, and became a disciple of his.</p>
