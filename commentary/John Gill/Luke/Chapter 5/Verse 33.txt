<p><strong>And they say unto him</strong>,.... The Scribes and Pharisees, or the disciples of John; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:14">Matthew 9:14</span></p>
<p><strong>why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers</strong>? set times apart frequently for fasting and prayer. The Ethiopic version reads, "why do the disciples of John baptize frequently, fast, and make prayers?" in which the former clause is added; and as without any authority, so without judgment, since it must suppose that the Pharisees did so likewise, whereas they rejected the baptism of John; for it follows, and "likewise" the disciples of "the Pharisees"; who fasted often, at least twice in the week, and made frequent prayers in the synagogues, and corners of the streets, and in widows' houses.</p>
<p><strong>But thine eat and drink?</strong> instead of fasting and praying;</p>
