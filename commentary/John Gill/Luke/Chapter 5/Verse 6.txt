<p><strong>And when they had done this</strong>,.... Had put the ship out further to sea, and had let down their net:</p>
<p><strong>they enclosed a great multitude of fish</strong>; in their net, which by the secret divine power of Christ, were gathered together just in that place, where by his order they cast the net:</p>
<p><strong>and their net brake</strong>; with the weight and number, of the fishes, yet not so as to let the fish out; the Arabic version reads, "it was within a little that their nets were broke": they were just upon breaking, the draught was so numerous, the struggling so great, and the weight so heavy.</p>
