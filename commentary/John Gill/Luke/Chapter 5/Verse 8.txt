<p><strong>When Simon Peter saw it</strong>,.... The multitude of fish that was taken, and both vessels filled with them, and the danger they were in of sinking,</p>
<p><strong>he fell down at Jesus' knees</strong>. The Arabic and Persic versions read, "at" his "feet": he fell on his knees before him, and threw himself prostrate at his feet, as a worshipper of him, and a supplicant unto him:</p>
<p><strong>saying, depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord</strong>; this he said, not as though the presence of Christ was burdensome, or disagreeable to him; but as one amazed at the greatness of the miracle wrought, and struck with the sense of the power of Christ, put forth therein; and with the greatness of his majesty so near him; and as conscious to himself of his own vileness and unworthiness to be in his presence; and so the Persic version adds, and which may serve as a comment, "and am not worthy that thou shouldst be with me": he had much the same sense of things as the centurion had, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:8">Matthew 8:8</span> and when it is considered how gracious persons have been struck with awe and fear, and a consciousness of sin, weakness, and unworthiness, at the appearance of an angel, as Zacharias, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:12">Luke 1:12</span> and the shepherds, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:9">Luke 2:9</span> yea, at the presence of an holy man of God, as the widow of Sarepta at Elijah, saying much the same as Peter does here, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:18">1 Kings 17:18</span> it need not be wondered at, that Peter should so express himself, in these circumstances.</p>
