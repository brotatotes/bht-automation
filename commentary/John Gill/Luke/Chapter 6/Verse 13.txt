<p><strong>And when it was day</strong>,.... Or morning; having spent the whole night in prayer to God, no doubt for his disciples, whom he was about to send forth as his apostles, to preach his Gospel, and work miracles, and for their success therein:</p>
<p><strong>he called unto him his disciples</strong>; the whole company of them, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:17">Luke 6:17</span> all that were his followers, and professed to believe in him, or as many as he pleased; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:13">Mark 3:13</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And of them he chose twelve</strong>; and ordained them, and sent them out to preach, heal sicknesses, and cast out devils:</p>
<p><strong>whom he also named apostles</strong>; or "messengers", from their being sent by him on such important business; and their names are as follow.</p>
