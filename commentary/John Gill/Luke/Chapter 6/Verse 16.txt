<p><strong>And Judas the brother of James</strong>,.... Of that James, that was the son of Alphaeus; though the Syriac and Arabic versions call him "the son of James", very wrongly: this Judas was also called Thaddaeus and Lebbaeus, and is the writer of the epistle that bears his name:</p>
<p><strong>and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor</strong>; both his surname and his character are mentioned, to distinguish him from the other Judas: it is easy to observe, that these twelve are mentioned by pairs, or couples, and so they were sent out, two by two; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:7">Mark 6:7</span> as were also the seventy disciples afterwards; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:1">Luke 10:1</span> There seems to be an allusion to the pairs and couples of the Jewish fathers and doctors, who in their succession are thus paired: Jose ben Joezer, and Joseph ben Jochauan; Joshua ben Perachia, and Nathan the Arbelite; Simeon ben Shetach, and Judah ben Tabai; Shemain and Abtalion; the two sons of Bethira, whose names were Judah and Joshua; Hillell and Shammai s: all before Christ's time.</p>
