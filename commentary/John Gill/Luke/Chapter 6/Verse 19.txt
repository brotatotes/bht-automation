<p><strong>And the whole multitude sought to touch him</strong>,.... That is, the multitude of those that were sick and possessed; for they were persuaded, and they found it true by experience, that if they could but touch any part of his body, or his garments, they should be cured of their diseases:</p>
<p><strong>for there went virtue out of him</strong>; in great abundance, as water from a fountain; without his speaking a word, or using any gesture, such as laying his hands on them:</p>
<p><strong>and they were healed</strong>; in this secret and private way, of whatsoever disease they were afflicted with.</p>
