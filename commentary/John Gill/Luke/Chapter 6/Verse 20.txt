<p><strong>And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples</strong>,.... Either the whole company of them, or rather the twelve apostles, whom he saw coming to him, and fixing his eyes on them, he sat,</p>
<p><strong>and said</strong>; what follows, with many other things recorded by Matthew:</p>
<p><strong>blessed be ye poor</strong>; not only in the things of this world, having left all for Christ, but poor in Spirit, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3- :">Matthew 5:3- :</span>:</p>
<p><strong>for yours is the kingdom of God</strong>; or heaven, so in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span>.</p>
