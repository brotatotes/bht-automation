<p><strong>Blessed are ye that hunger now</strong>,.... Not only suffer hunger and thirst in a literal sense, in this present life, but who have hunger and thirst in a spiritual sense, after righteousness and eternal life, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:6">Matthew 5:6</span> where it is also said as here:</p>
<p><strong>for ye shall be filled</strong>: with righteousness and life;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:6- :">Matthew 5:6- :</span>.</p>
<p><strong>blessed are ye that weep now</strong>; under afflictions and pressures of life, and mourn for sin, their own, and others:</p>
<p><strong>for ye shall laugh</strong>; be filled with spiritual joy and pleasure, and be comforted with the consolations of the Spirit;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:6- :">Matthew 5:6- :</span>.</p>
