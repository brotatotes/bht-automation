<p><strong>Blessed are ye when men shall hate you</strong>,.... For the sake of Christ, and his Gospel:</p>
<p><strong>and when they shall separate you from their company</strong>; either from civil conversation with them, as if they were Gentiles and uncircumcised persons; or from their religious assemblies, and so may have respect to that sort of excommunication in use, among the Jews, called נדוי or "separation": by which persons were not only excluded from the congregation, but from all civil society and commerce: such a person might not sit nearer to another than four cubits, and this continued for thirty days; and if not discharged then, he continued thirty more t:</p>
<p><strong>and shall reproach you</strong>: as heretics, apostates, and enemies to the law of Moses, as the Jews did reproach the Christians;</p>
<p><strong>and cast out your name as evil</strong>; or "as of evil men": as the Syriac and Arabic versions render it: this may have respect to the greater sorts of excommunication, used among them, called "Shammatha" and "Cherem", by which a person was accursed, and devoted to destruction; so that our Lord's meaning is, that the should be esteemed and treated as the worst of men, and stigmatized in the vilest manner they were capable of:</p>
<p><strong>for the son of man's sake</strong>; not for any immorality committed by them, but only for professing and, preaching that the Messiah was come in the flesh, and that Jesus of Nazareth was he; and that he who was the son of man, according to his human nature, was, the Son of God according to his divine nature.</p>
