<p><strong>Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you</strong>!.... The word "all", is left out in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic; Persic: and Ethiopic versions, and is wanting in many copies, though it is in the Alexandrian copy; and the meaning is, it looks ill in persons, when the men of the world, wicked men, all of them, or the greater part of them, applaud and commend them; for this can never be, if they are truly religious persons, and are faithful to their principles, and upright in their practices; and do not connive at, or comply with the errors and evil ways of wicked men; for it is no bad sign, to have the good word of good men, and therefore these must be excepted, and the passage must be limited to bad men;</p>
<p><strong>for so did their fathers to the false prophets</strong>; they spoke well of them, and heaped favours, riches, and honours upon them, that they might prophesy unto them things; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:6">1 Kings 22:6</span>, smooth things and deceit.</p>
