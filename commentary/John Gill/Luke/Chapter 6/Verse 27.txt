<p><strong>But I say unto you which hear</strong>,.... The Ethiopic version adds "me", and the generality of interpreters understand the passage of the hearers of Christ, as distinct from the disciples, or together with them, and of the better sort of them; and of such as had ears to hear, and who heard with a desire of understanding, and of putting into practice what they heard; but I rather think it regards the hearers of the Scribes and Pharisees, then present, who had heard and received the traditions of the elders, to which the following rules of Christ are opposed; and to each of which, with others in Matthew, these words are prefixed;</p>
<p><strong>ye have heard that it was said by them of old time--but I say unto you</strong>,.... <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:21">Matthew 5:21</span> with which compare this phrase, and the sense will appear to be this; to you that hear day by day, the traditions of the elders urged upon you, and the false glosses the Scribes and Pharisees put upon the word of God; in opposition to them, I say to you what follows:</p>
<p><strong>love your enemies</strong>; whereas you have heard them say, hate your enemies, keep enmity in your hearts to them, and revenge yourselves on them:</p>
<p><strong>do good to them that hate you</strong>; whereas you have heard it said, that you should only do good to your friends, and should keep anger in your bosoms to such who hate you, and do you an injury;</p>
