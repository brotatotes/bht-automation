<p><strong>And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek</strong>,.... The right cheek,</p>
<p><strong>offer also the other</strong>; the left cheek, by turning it to him, that he may smite that likewise, if he thinks fit: by which proverbial expression, Christ teaches patience in bearing injuries and affronts, and not to seek private revenge; but rather, suffer more, than indulge such a temper; and for the same purpose is what follows urged:</p>
<p><strong>and him that taketh away thy cloak, forbid not to take thy coat also</strong>: the phrase is inverted in Matthew;</p>
