And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek,.... The right cheek,offer also the other; the left cheek, by turning it to him, that he may smite that likewise, if he thinks fit: by which proverbial expression, Christ teaches patience in bearing injuries and affronts, and not to seek private revenge; but rather, suffer more, than indulge such a temper; and for the same purpose is what follows urged:and him that taketh away thy cloak, forbid not to take thy coat also: the phrase is inverted in Matthew;Mt 5:40.
