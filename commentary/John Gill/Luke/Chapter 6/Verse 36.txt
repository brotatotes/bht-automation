Be ye therefore merciful,.... Tenderhearted, kind, beneficent to all men, friends and foes:as your Father also is merciful; that is your Father which is in heaven; who is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works: nothing is more common in Zohar y, and the Talmud z than to express the Divine Being by no other name, than "the Merciful"; אמררחמנא, "the Merciful said" so, and so; that is, God: and so the Arabians generally begin their books and chapters with these words, "in the name of God, exceeding merciful", or "the merciful commiserator": a saying much like to this in the text, is the Targum of Jonathan, onLeviticus 22:28."O my people, the children of "Israel, as your father",רחמן, "is merciful" in heaven, so be ye merciful on earth.''y Zohar in Lev. fol. 2. 2. & 9. 4. & 20. 1. & 22. 1. z T. Bab. Moed Katon, fol. 15. 2.
