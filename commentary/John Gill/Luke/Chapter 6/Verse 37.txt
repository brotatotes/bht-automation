<p><strong>Condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned</strong>; censure not men's persons, and judge not their state, or adjudge them to condemnation, for every offence in practice, or because they differ in principle, lest you should be treated in like manner by others; and especially, lest you should fall under the righteous censure, judgment, and condemnation of God:</p>
<p><strong>forgive</strong>; offences and trespasses committed against you, bear with, and pass by injuries and affronts:</p>
<p><strong>and ye shall be forgiven</strong>; of God;</p>
