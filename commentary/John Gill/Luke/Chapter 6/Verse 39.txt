<p><strong>And he spake a parable unto them</strong>,.... The Vulgate Latin reads, "he spake also a parable unto them"; besides what he said; and the Arabic version renders it, "another similitude", parable, or proverb, distinct from the comparisons, allusions, and proverbial expressions in the preceding verses. Though it should be observed, that these words were not spoken at the same time, nor on the mount, as the foregoing were; but this, and what follow, are a collection of various expressions of Christ at different times, some delivered on the mount, and others elsewhere; unless it should be rather thought, that these proverbs and sentences were repeated at different places and times, which is not improbable:</p>
<p><strong>can the blind lead the blind?</strong> they may do so, as the blind Scribes and Pharisees led the blind people of the Jews, which is what our Lord intends; but if they do, as they did,</p>
<p><strong>shall they not both fall into the ditch?</strong> yes, verily, what else can be expected? <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
