<p><strong>And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye</strong>,.... A lesser sin in comparison of others; for all sins are not alike, as the Stoics asserted: and though none are to be countenanced and indulged, yet some are not so severely to be animadverted upon as others, the nature, occasions, circumstances, and aggravations considered; for no man is perfect, or wholly free from sin; nor are the words preceding to be understood of such a perfection; for which reason perhaps these words, with what follow, are mentioned:</p>
<p><strong>but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</strong> meaning a greater sin, such are guilty of, who are inquisitive searchers into the faults of others, and severe animadverters on them; and yet are blind to their own iniquities, and take no notice of them. These proverbial expressions were delivered by Christ on the mount, and are the same with those in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:3">Matthew 7:3</span>.</p>
