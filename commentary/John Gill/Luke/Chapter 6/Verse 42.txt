<p><strong>Either how canst thou say to thy brother</strong>,.... Guilty of the lesser sin;</p>
<p><strong>brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye</strong>; that is, suffer me to reprove thee for thy sin: the word "brother" is omitted in the Cambridge copy of Beza's, and in the Persic version; nor is it in Matthew; but in the Syriac and Ethiopic versions it is read, "my brother"; pretending great affection and sincerity:</p>
<p><strong>when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</strong> that is, takest no notice of, and dost not refrain from a greater iniquity continued in:</p>
<p><strong>thou hypocrite</strong>; as such an one must be, that bears hard upon his brother, and severely censures him for a small crime, when he indulges in himself a far more abominable sin:</p>
<p><strong>cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye</strong>: the sense is, that a man should first reform himself, and then others.</p>
