<p><strong>And why call ye me Lord, Lord</strong>,.... Or, "my Lord, my Lord", as the Syriac version renders it; acknowledging, in words, his government over them; claiming an interest in him, and making use of his name and authority:</p>
<p><strong>and do not the things which I say</strong>; or "command"; and therefore such words in their mouths would be of no use to them, since they neither did his Father's will, which he taught them, nor observed his commands and ordinances which he enjoined them; and therefore should not enter into the kingdom of heaven, nor be owned by him another day, but should be bid to depart from him; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
