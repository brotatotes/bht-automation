<p><strong>But he that heareth, and doth not</strong>,.... Hears Christ's sayings externally, but does not obey his commands:</p>
<p><strong>is like a man that without a foundation built upon the earth</strong>: that is, without digging for a foundation, built his house upon the surface of the earth; "upon the dust of it", as the Syriac version renders it; or, "upon the sand", as Matthew says: "against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great";</p>
