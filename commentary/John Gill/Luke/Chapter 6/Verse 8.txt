But he knew their thoughts,.... Being the omniscient God; though they had said nothing of their intentions, he knew what they designed, should he heal the man with his withered hand, as they expected he would:and said to the man which had the withered hand, rise up, and stand forth in the midst. The Syriac and Persic versions add, "of the synagogue", and which is the true sense;  :-and he arose and stood forth; he rose up from his seat, and stood up in the midst of the synagogue, and of the people, that he might be seen of all.
