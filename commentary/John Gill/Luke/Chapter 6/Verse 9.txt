<p><strong>Then said Jesus unto them</strong>,.... The Scribes and Pharisees, who were watching him, and whose thoughts, and the reasonings of their minds, purposes, and intentions, he full well knew:</p>
<p><strong>I will ask you one thing</strong>; or question, as they had asked him one before; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:10">Matthew 12:10</span></p>
<p><strong>is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it</strong>?</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:10- :">Matthew 12:10- :</span> to which may be added, that to save life on the sabbath day was agreeable to their own canons: there were many things which they allowed might be done on the sabbath day, when life was in danger, which otherwise were not lawful; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:10- :">Matthew 12:10- :</span>.</p>
