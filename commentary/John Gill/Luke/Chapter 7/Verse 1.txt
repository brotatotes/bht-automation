<p><strong>Now when he had ended all his sayings</strong>,.... That is, when Jesus, as the Persic version expresses it, had finished all the above sayings, doctrines, and instructions; not all that he had to say, for he said many things after this:</p>
<p><strong>in the audience of the people</strong>; of the common people, the multitude besides the disciples; and that openly, and publicly, and with a loud and clear voice, that all might hear:</p>
<p><strong>he entered into Capernaum</strong>; Jesus entered, as the Syriac version reads, into his own city, and where he had been before, and wrought miracles.</p>
