Both the elders of the Jews, and the friends of the centurion:returning to the house; of the centurion, where his servant lay, and from whence they came:found the servant whole that had been sick; for he was healed directly, as soon as the centurion had expressed his faith, and Christ had declared that it should be according to it, Matthew 8:13.
