<p><strong>Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city</strong>,.... Of Naim:</p>
<p><strong>behold: there was a dead man carried out</strong>; of the city; for they, used not to bury in cities, but in places without, and at some distance: the burying places of the Jews were not near, their cities r; and they had different ways of carrying them out to be buried, according to their different ages: a child under a month old was carried out in the bosom of a person; if a full month old, in a little coffin, which they carried in their arms; one of a twelve month old was carried in a little coffin on the shoulder; and one of three years old on a bier or bed, s and so upwards; and in this manner was this corpse carried out: who was</p>
<p><strong>the only son of his mother</strong>; hence the sorrow and mourning were the greater; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+12:10">Zechariah 12:10</span></p>
<p><strong>and she was a widow</strong>; and if she had been supported by her son, her loss was very considerable; and having neither husband, nor son, to do for her, her case was very affecting:</p>
<p><strong>and much people of the city was with her</strong>; according to the age of persons was the company that attended them to the grave: if it was an infant, not a month old, it was buried by one woman, and two men, but not by one man, and two women; if a month old, by men and women; and whoever was carried out on a bier or bed, many mourned for him; and whoever was known to many, many accompanied him t; and which was the case this dead man: he seems to have been well known and respected by the company that attended him to his grave; of these some were bearers, and these had their deputies, and these again theirs; for as they carried their dead a great way, they were obliged often to change their bearers; and of the company, some went before the bier, and others went after it u: besides, what served to increase company at a funeral was, that it was looked upon as an act of kindness and mercy to follow a corpse to the grave w; to which may be added, and what must always tend to increase the number at such a time, that, according to the Jewish canons x</p>
<p>"it was forbidden to do any work at the time a dead man was buried, even one of the common people.''</p>
