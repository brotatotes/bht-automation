And this rumour of him,.... Or the report of this surprising miracle in raising a dead man to life, that was carrying to his grave,went forth throughout all Judea, and throughout all the region round about; not only Judea, and the several cities, towns, and villages in it, but all the country round about it, especially Galilee. The Persic version reads, "all countries which are round about Jordan"; see Matthew 3:5.
