To Jesus; "those two men", as the Arabic version reads; "the disciples", as the Persic version; the same that John sent from the castle of Machaerus, where he was now a prisoner, to Christ, who was teaching in some city or town of Galilee:they said, John the Baptist; so well known by his being the administrator of the ordinance of baptism:hath sent us unto thee, saying, art thou he that should come, or look we for another?  :-.
