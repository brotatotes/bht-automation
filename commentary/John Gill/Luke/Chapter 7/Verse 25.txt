<p><strong>But what went you out for to see</strong>?.... If not his air and action, what was it? was it his apparel and dress? was it to see</p>
<p><strong>a man clothed in soft raiment?</strong> If this was the case, their labour was in vain, and they had their walk for nothing; for John was clothed with camels' hair, rough and undressed, and was girt with a leathern girdle; there was nothing in his person, mien, and garb, that was attractive:</p>
<p><strong>they which are gorgeously, apparelled</strong>; or richly clothed, as John was not:</p>
<p><strong>and live delicately</strong>; in the most elegant manner, and on the richest dainties, as John did not, his food being locusts and wild honey:</p>
<p><strong>are in kings' courts</strong>; and not in a wilderness, where John; came preaching.</p>
