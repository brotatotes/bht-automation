<p><strong>And one of the Pharisees</strong>,.... Whose name was Simon, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:40">Luke 7:40</span></p>
<p><strong>Desired that he would eat with him</strong>; take a meal with him, either a dinner or a supper: this he did under a disguise of respect, and show of affection to him; though very likely with a design upon him to ensnare him, or take some advantage against him if he could; for it is certain, that he did not treat him with those civilities and ceremonies commonly used to guests; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:44">Luke 7:44</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat</strong>: he made no hesitation about it, but at once accepted of his invitation, though he knew both the man and his intentions; having nothing to fear from him, and being willing to carry it courteously to all men, and give proof of what he had just now said of himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:34">Luke 7:34</span>.</p>
