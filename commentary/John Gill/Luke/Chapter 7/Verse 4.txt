<p><strong>And when they came to Jesus</strong>,.... To that part of the city where he was; either at Peter's house, where he used to be when in this place; or rather it might be as he was passing along the streets, that they came up to him</p>
<p><strong>they besought him instantly</strong>; or with great vehemence and importunity; very studiously and carefully they urged the case, and pressed him much to it:</p>
<p><strong>saying, he was worthy for whom he should do this</strong>; or, "for whom thou shouldst do this", as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions read, and some copies; and which reading connects the words best. This speech of theirs savours of their "pharisaic" tenet and notion of merit, and is very different from the sense the poor centurion had of himself.</p>
