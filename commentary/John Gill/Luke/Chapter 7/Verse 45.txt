<p><strong>Thou gavest me no kiss</strong>,.... A token of civility among friends, when they met together on any occasion. The Jews have a saying b, that</p>
<p>"all kisses are foolish, excepting three; the kiss of grandeur or dignity, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+10:1">1 Samuel 10:1</span> and the kiss at parting, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ru+1:14">Ruth 1:14</span> and the kiss at meeting, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:27">Exodus 4:27</span> (of which sort this kiss may be thought to be), to which some add the kiss of consanguinity (or that used by relations to one another), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+29:11">Genesis 29:11</span>'</p>
<p><strong>but this woman, since the time I came in</strong>. The Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions read, "since she came in"; and so two of Stephens's copies; which seems to be the more agreeable reading, seeing Christ was in Simon's house before this woman came; for she knowing that he was there, came thither after him:</p>
<p><strong>hath not ceased to kiss my feet</strong>; which shows, that this action was repeated by her times without number, even ever since she came into the house.</p>
<p>b Shemot Rabba, sect. 6. fol. 91. 3, 4.</p>
