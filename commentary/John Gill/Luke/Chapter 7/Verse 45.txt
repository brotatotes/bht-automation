Thou gavest me no kiss,.... A token of civility among friends, when they met together on any occasion. The Jews have a saying b, that"all kisses are foolish, excepting three; the kiss of grandeur or dignity, as in 1 Samuel 10:1 and the kiss at parting, as in Ruth 1:14 and the kiss at meeting, as in Exodus 4:27 (of which sort this kiss may be thought to be), to which some add the kiss of consanguinity (or that used by relations to one another), as in Genesis 29:11'but this woman, since the time I came in. The Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions read, "since she came in"; and so two of Stephens's copies; which seems to be the more agreeable reading, seeing Christ was in Simon's house before this woman came; for she knowing that he was there, came thither after him:hath not ceased to kiss my feet; which shows, that this action was repeated by her times without number, even ever since she came into the house.b Shemot Rabba, sect. 6. fol. 91. 3, 4.
