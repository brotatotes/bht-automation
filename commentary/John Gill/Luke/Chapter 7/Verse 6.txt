<p><strong>Then Jesus went with them</strong>,.... The elders of the Jews, towards the centurion's house, after hearing their request, and their reasons for it; and that without any reluctancy, he at once complied, made no hesitation, or difficulty about it, but went with them very freely:</p>
<p><strong>and when he was now not far from the house</strong>; of the centurion, where his servant lay sick; he having some notice of his coming, and of his being near his house, in his great humility, and being conscious to himself of his unworthiness to have such a person under his roof, sent messengers to prevent him:</p>
<p><strong>the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself</strong>; or do not fatigue thyself by coming to the house, stop, go no further;</p>
<p><strong>for I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof</strong>: he might know full well the law of the Jews, that it was not lawful for a Jew to go into the house of an uncircumcised Gentile; and though he might be a proselyte of righteousness, and so his house was free of entrance; yet considering his own meanness, and the greatness of Christ, who was become so famous for his doctrines and miracles, he thought it too great a stoop for Christ to come into his house, and too high a favour for him to enjoy.</p>
