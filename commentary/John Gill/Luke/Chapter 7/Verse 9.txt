<p><strong>he marvelled at him</strong>; at his great humility and modesty, and the strength of his faith, and his manner of reasoning:</p>
<p><strong>and turned him about</strong>; from him, and his friends:</p>
<p><strong>and said unto the people that followed him</strong>; from the mount to Capernaum, and as he was passing along the streets:</p>
<p><strong>I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel</strong>; or "among the Israelites", as the Syriac; or "among the children of Israel", as the Persic; or "in all Israel", as the Arabic version reads, as he did in this single Gentile; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
