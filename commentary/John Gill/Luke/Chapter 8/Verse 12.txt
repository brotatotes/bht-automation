Those by the wayside are they that hear,.... The word of God, though only by accident, and very carelessly, and without understanding what they hear:then cometh the devil; signified by the fowls of the air:and taketh away the word out of their hearts, or memories; that little of it, which is retained there, and diverts their minds from it by other objects; so that they quite forget what they have heard;lest they should believe, and be saved: this clause is only in Luke; and with it may be compared 2 Corinthians 4:4 for with true faith in Christ the sum and substance of the word salvation is connected; and Satan being an enemy to the salvation of souls, does all he can to hinder their faith in him.
