<p><strong>Those by the wayside are they that hear</strong>,.... The word of God, though only by accident, and very carelessly, and without understanding what they hear:</p>
<p><strong>then cometh the devil</strong>; signified by the fowls of the air:</p>
<p><strong>and taketh away the word out of their hearts</strong>, or memories; that little of it, which is retained there, and diverts their minds from it by other objects; so that they quite forget what they have heard;</p>
<p><strong>lest they should believe, and be saved</strong>: this clause is only in Luke; and with it may be compared <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span> for with true faith in Christ the sum and substance of the word salvation is connected; and Satan being an enemy to the salvation of souls, does all he can to hinder their faith in him.</p>
