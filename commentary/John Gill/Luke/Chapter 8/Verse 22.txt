<p><strong>Now it came to pass on a certain day</strong>,.... The same day at even, as Mark says, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:35">Mark 4:35</span> in which he delivered the parables of the sower, and of the seed cast into the ground, and of the grain of mustard seed:</p>
<p><strong>that he went into a ship with his disciples</strong>; they following him into it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:23">Matthew 8:23</span></p>
<p><strong>and he said unto them, let us go over unto the other side of the lake</strong>; of Gennesaret, or sea of Galilee:</p>
<p><strong>and they launched forth</strong>; into the sea; they set sail, and proceeded: this clause is omitted in the Syriac and Persic versions.</p>
