Now it came to pass on a certain day,.... The same day at even, as Mark says, Mark 4:35 in which he delivered the parables of the sower, and of the seed cast into the ground, and of the grain of mustard seed:that he went into a ship with his disciples; they following him into it, Matthew 8:23and he said unto them, let us go over unto the other side of the lake; of Gennesaret, or sea of Galilee:and they launched forth; into the sea; they set sail, and proceeded: this clause is omitted in the Syriac and Persic versions.
