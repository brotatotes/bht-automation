<p><strong>But as he sailed he fell asleep</strong>,.... On a pillow, in the hinder part of the ship, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:38">Mark 4:38</span></p>
<p><strong>and there came down a storm of wind on the lake</strong>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:38- :">Mark 4:38- :</span>.</p>
<p><strong>and they were filled</strong>; with water: not the disciples, but the ship in which they were; and so the Ethiopic version renders it, "their ship was filled with water". The Syriac and Persic versions render it, "the ship was almost sunk", or immersed:</p>
<p><strong>and were in jeopardy</strong>; of their lives, in the utmost danger, just ready to go to the bottom. This clause is left out in the Syriac and Persic versions.</p>
