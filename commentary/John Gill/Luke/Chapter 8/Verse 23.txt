But as he sailed he fell asleep,.... On a pillow, in the hinder part of the ship, as in Mark 4:38and there came down a storm of wind on the lake,Mark 4:38- :.and they were filled; with water: not the disciples, but the ship in which they were; and so the Ethiopic version renders it, "their ship was filled with water". The Syriac and Persic versions render it, "the ship was almost sunk", or immersed:and were in jeopardy; of their lives, in the utmost danger, just ready to go to the bottom. This clause is left out in the Syriac and Persic versions.
