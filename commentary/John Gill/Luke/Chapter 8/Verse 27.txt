<p><strong>And when he went forth to land</strong>,.... The Persic and Ethiopic versions read,</p>
<p><strong>when they went forth to land</strong>; when Christ and his disciples came out of the ship, and went ashore:</p>
<p><strong>there met him out of the city a certain man</strong>; or rather, there met him a certain man of the city; that is, one that belonged to, and was an inhabitant of Gadera, or some city thereabout; who had been born and brought up, and had lived there; for certain it is, that he did not now come out of the city, but out of the tombs, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:28">Matthew 8:28</span> and to which agrees the account of him that follows here; in the Vulgate Latin version, these words, "out of the city" are omitted; which the interpreter not understanding, might leave out, as carrying in it a seeming contradiction to the accounts of him:</p>
<p><strong>which had devils long time</strong>. The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Persic, and Arabic versions, read in the singular number, which had a devil: and which agrees with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:29">Luke 8:29</span> for though more are after mentioned, yet the many might be under one head, and chief of them; but in all the copies, it is read in the plural number, "devils"; and to this agrees the name of legion, for there were many devils in him, and they had a possession of him a long time which aggravates the miserable condition of this man, and illustrates the power of Christ in freeing him from them:</p>
<p><strong>and wore no clothes</strong>; but went naked, and when any were put upon him, would tear them in pieces:</p>
<p><strong>neither abode in any house</strong>, but in the tombs;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:29- :">Luke 8:29- :</span>.</p>
