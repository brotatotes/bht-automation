<p><strong>For he had commanded the unclean spirit</strong>..... That had the rest of the devils under his authority, and power,</p>
<p><strong>to come out of the man</strong>; this he had done, either before, or just as he came up to him; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p><strong>For oftentimes it had caught him</strong>; possessed him, and wrought so strongly in him, and with so much fury, that there was no governing him:</p>
<p><strong>and he was kept bound with chains and fetters</strong>; attempts were made to bind him, and keep him bound, but in vain: and he brake the bands;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And was driven of the devil into the wilderness</strong>: into some desert and desolate place, where were the tombs and sepulchres of the dead; this was done by the prince of the legion.</p>
