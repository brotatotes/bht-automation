That had the rest of the devils under his authority, and power,to come out of the man; this he had done, either before, or just as he came up to him;  :-.For oftentimes it had caught him; possessed him, and wrought so strongly in him, and with so much fury, that there was no governing him:and he was kept bound with chains and fetters; attempts were made to bind him, and keep him bound, but in vain: and he brake the bands; :-.And was driven of the devil into the wilderness: into some desert and desolate place, where were the tombs and sepulchres of the dead; this was done by the prince of the legion.
