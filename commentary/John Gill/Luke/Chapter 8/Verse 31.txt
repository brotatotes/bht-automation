<p><strong>And they besought him</strong>,.... That is, all the devils, the whole legion of them, entreated Jesus, under whose power, and at whose dispose they were:</p>
<p><strong>that he would not command them to go out into the deep</strong>; meaning, not the deep waters of the sea, for thither they ran the swine at their own request; but the bottomless pit of hell, where others of these spirits lay in chains of darkness; and so the Ethiopic version renders it, "into hell": they desired, that when they went out of this man, they might not be ordered thither, or remanded to their former prison; for they knew that if he gave the word of command, they must obey; but that they might be suffered to continue in that country, and range about on earth, or be any where, rather than in hell.</p>
