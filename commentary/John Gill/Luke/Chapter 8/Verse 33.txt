<p><strong>Then went the devils out of the man</strong>,.... Being obliged by the power of Christ, sore against their wills, having had possession of him a long time:</p>
<p><strong>and entered into the swine</strong>; possessed them:</p>
<p><strong>and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake</strong>; that is of Gennesaret; or the sea, as the Syriac and Persic versions read; that is, the sea of Galilee, the same with the former:</p>
<p><strong>and were choked</strong>; in the waters, and died, as the Ethiopic version adds.</p>
