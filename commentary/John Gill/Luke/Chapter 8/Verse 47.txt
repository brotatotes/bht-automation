<p><strong>And when the woman saw that she was not hid</strong>,.... From Christ, among the crowd, nor the thing that she had done. The Syriac and Arabic versions render it, "that he had not forgot her"; she hoping he would be diverted from taking any notice of her and her action, through the crowd of people about him;</p>
<p><strong>she came trembling</strong>; for fear of the anger and resentment of Christ, and lest the favour would be revoked, and the penalty of the law inflicted; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And falling down before him</strong>; in the most humble manner, "at his feet", as the Arabic version reads; "and worshipped him", as the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions have it; gave him the glory of the cure, and thanks for it:</p>
<p><strong>she declared unto him before all the people</strong>; the whole truth of the matter, what a disease she had laboured under for so long a time, what means she had used to no purpose:</p>
<p><strong>for what cause she had touched him</strong>; namely, in order to have a cure, which she believed she should have in that way:</p>
<p><strong>and how she was healed immediately</strong>; as soon as ever she had touched him.</p>
