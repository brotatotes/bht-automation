<p><strong>from the ruler of the synagogue</strong>; which could not be, since he was still with Christ: hence some versions, as the Vulgate and Arabic, render them, "to the ruler of the synagogue"; and which give a true sense, and a right view of the case; for this messenger both came from his house, and to him:</p>
<p><strong>saying to him, thy daughter is dead, trouble not the master</strong>; to bring him any further, since all hope of help was now gone. The Vulgate Latin version, instead of "master", reads "him"; and the Ethiopic version, "Jesus".</p>
