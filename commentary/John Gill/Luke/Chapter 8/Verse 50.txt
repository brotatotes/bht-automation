<p><strong>But when Jesus heard it</strong>,.... The message that was brought to the ruler, and the hint that was given, that it was needless to give him any further trouble:</p>
<p><strong>he answered him</strong>; not the messenger, but the father of the child, as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions read:</p>
<p><strong>saying, fear not</strong>: do not be dismayed at this message, nor despair of help, notwithstanding such is the case:</p>
<p><strong>believe only, and she shall be made whole</strong>; exercise faith in me, that I am able to raise her from the dead, and I will do it; and she shall be restored to life, and to perfect health and strength again.</p>
