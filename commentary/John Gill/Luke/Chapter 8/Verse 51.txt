<p><strong>And when he came into the house</strong>,.... Of the ruler of the synagogue;</p>
<p><strong>he suffered no man to go in</strong>: to the room, where the dead body lay:</p>
<p><strong>save Peter, James and John</strong>; not one of the multitude that followed him, nor any of the disciples, but these three; who were his favourite ones, and were a sufficient number to be witnesses of the miracle:</p>
<p><strong>and the father and mother of the maiden</strong>; these also were admitted. The Persic version very wrongly joins these last words with the beginning of the next verse, reading them thus, "the father and mother of the maiden, with the domestics, wept and bewailed her".</p>
