<p><strong>And some fell upon a rock</strong>,.... Which the other evangelists call "stony places", and "stony ground"; by which are meant such hearers whose hearts are, hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, and continue so notwithstanding the preaching of the word unto them.</p>
<p><strong>And as soon as it sprung up</strong>; as it did immediately, as the other evangelists say; and that for this reason, which they give, "because it had no depth of earth"; only a small crust, or shell of earth over the rock; and signifies, that these hearers had only a superficial knowledge of the word, and hastily made a profession of it, which soon came to nothing:</p>
<p><strong>it withered away, because it lacked moisture</strong>; the other evangelists say, "when the sun was up, it was scorched"; meaning tribulation and persecution, the grace of God being wanting to support under fiery trials: the reason given in Matthew and Mark why it withered, is,</p>
<p><strong>because it had no root</strong>; and so read the Persic and Ethiopic versions here.</p>
