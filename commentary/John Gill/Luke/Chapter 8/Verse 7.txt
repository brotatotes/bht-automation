<p><strong>And some fell among thorns</strong>,.... On ground which had within it the roots of thorns and briars; and design such hearers who have their hearts filled with worldly cares, and sensual lusts and pleasures:</p>
<p><strong>and the thorns sprang up with it</strong>; and grew faster than that:</p>
<p><strong>and choked it</strong>; as the above things do the word, and make it useless and unprofitable; so that though it took place for a while, and was professed, yet process of time was neglected and dropped; and, as Mark says, "it yielded no fruit"; at least that came to perfection.</p>
