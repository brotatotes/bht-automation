<p><strong>And the people, when they knew it</strong>,.... Having heard of his departure from others, and seeing him go off themselves:</p>
<p><strong>followed him</strong>; not by ship, but on foot, going over the bridge at Chainmath of Gadara, and got thither before Christ and his disciples did:</p>
<p><strong>and he received them</strong>; very kindly, and in a very affectionate manner, and with great respect, though they had prevented the private interview between him and his apostles;</p>
<p><strong>and he spake unto them of the kingdom of God</strong>; of the Gospel dispensation, now setting up, and of the doctrines and ordinances of it, of the governing principle of grace in the hearts of his people, and of the glory of the world to come:</p>
<p><strong>and healed them that had need of healing</strong>; for their bodies; as well as preached the doctrines of grace for the good of their souls; he both taught doctrine and wrought miracles.</p>
