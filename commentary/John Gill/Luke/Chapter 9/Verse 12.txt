<p><strong>When the day began to wear away</strong>,.... Or "to decline", as the Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions; or "to incline", as the Syriac; that is, as the Ethiopic version renders it, "when the sun was declining" towards the "horizon" and was almost set; or "when the evening time was come", as the Persic version:</p>
<p><strong>then came the twelve;</strong> that is, "the disciples", as the Persic version; or "his disciples", as the Syriac: and</p>
<p><strong>said unto him, send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about</strong>; the place where they were, round about the city of Bethsaida, the several adjacent houses in the fields, villages, towns, and cities:</p>
<p><strong>and lodge, and get victuals</strong>; where they might have lodging for that night, it being too far for them to reach their habitations that evening; and also that they might provide themselves with proper and sufficient food, which was not to be had in the place where they were:</p>
<p><strong>for we are here in a desert place</strong>; which afforded no conveniency for lodging, nor any supply of food.</p>
