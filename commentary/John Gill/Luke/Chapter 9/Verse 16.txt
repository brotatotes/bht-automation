Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes,.... Into his hands, being brought him by the disciples from the lad that had them:and looking up to heaven: to his Father there, from whom all the mercies and blessings of life come;he blessed them; either asked, or commanded a blessing on them, that they might multiply and increase, that there might be a sufficiency for all the people, and that, they might be nourishing to them. Beza observes, that in his most ancient copy, it is read, "he blessed upon them"; which perfectly agrees with the Jewish way of speaking, בדך על הפת "he that blesseth upon the bread"; ברך על היין "he that blesseth upon the wine"; and so upon the fruits of trees, and upon the fruits of the earth, and upon other things s;and brake; the loaves, and divided the fishes into parts:and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude; as they sat in ranks, and in their distinct companies.s Misn. Beracot, c. 6. sect. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.
