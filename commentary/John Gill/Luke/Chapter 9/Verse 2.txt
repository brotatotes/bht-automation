<p><strong>And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God</strong>,.... The Gospel, which gives an account of the kingdom of the Messiah; of his kingly office and power; of his church, which is his kingdom, and of the government of it, by the ministration of the word, and the administration of ordinances; of the kingdom of grace in the hearts of Christ's subjects, and the nature of it; and of the kingdom of glory, and what is the saints' meetness for it, and right unto it:</p>
<p><strong>and to heal the sick</strong>; of every disease of body, and thereby confirm their mission and commission from Christ, to preach the Gospel; and recommend it to men.</p>
