<p><strong>Saying, the son of man must suffer many things</strong>,.... In his person and character, in his soul and body, at the hands of God, and of men, and devils:</p>
<p><strong>and be rejected of the elders, and chief priests, and Scribes</strong>; who made up the grand sanhedrim of the nation: by these he was to be, and was rejected as the Messiah; and when put up with another which should be released, that other should be preferred, and he rejected; and which was done at the instigation of these men, who were the builders; of whom it was foretold that they should reject the head stone of the corner, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span></p>
<p><strong>and be slain</strong>; or put to death, with the death of the cross:</p>
<p><strong>and be raised the third day</strong>; according to the types and prophecies of the Old Testament. This he added for the comfort of his disciples.</p>
