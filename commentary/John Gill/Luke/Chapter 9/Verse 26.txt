<p><strong>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me</strong>,.... Of my person and offices, of me, as the Messiah, Saviour, and Redeemer, of my grace, righteousness, blood, and sacrifice:</p>
<p><strong>and of my words</strong>; of the doctrines of the Gospel, one and another of them. In Mark, it is added, "in this adulterous and sinful generation"; having a peculiar respect to the people of the Jews, and the age in which Christ lived; but is true of any other people and age in which men live:</p>
<p><strong>of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory</strong>; in the glory of his human nature, when his glorious body, as now, in heaven, shall be seen by all; and in the glory of his office, as mediator, and the judge of all the earth; and in the glory of his divine nature, which will appear in the resurrection of the dead, in the gathering of all nations before him, in separating one sort from another, and in passing and executing the definitive sentence on them; particularly the glory of his omnipotence and omniscience will be very conspicuous:</p>
<p><strong>and in his Father's</strong>; which is the same with his own, as he is the Son of God, and the brightness of his glory; and which, as mediator, he has from him, and will be the object of the saints' vision to all eternity;</p>
<p><strong>and of the holy angels</strong>; who shall attend him at his second coming, and be employed in various offices under him. The Syriac version renders, these last clauses as they are in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:27">Matthew 16:27</span> in the glory of his Father, with his holy angels; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:27- :">Matthew 16:27- :</span>.</p>
