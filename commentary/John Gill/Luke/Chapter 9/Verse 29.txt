<p><strong>And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered</strong>,.... It became exceeding bright and glorious, it shone like the sun,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:2">Matthew 17:2</span> and hereby his prayer was answered; and thus, as Christ was heard and answered, whilst he was yet speaking, so are his people sometimes; and even their countenance is altered, when they are favoured with communion with God, and instead of a sad and dejected countenance, they have a cheerful one.</p>
<p><strong>And his raiment was white and glistering</strong>; it was as white as the light, as snow, and whiter than any fuller on earth could whiten, as the other evangelists say, and so glistened exceedingly;</p>
