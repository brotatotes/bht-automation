<p><strong>And he said unto them, take nothing for your journey</strong>,.... Throughout the towns and cities of Judea, where they were sent to preach the Gospel:</p>
<p><strong>neither staves</strong>, The Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions, read in the singular number, "neither staff, rod, or club"; and so it was in one of Beza's ancient copies, but in all the rest in the plural, as in Matthew; which last must be the true reading, since one staff was allowed, according as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:8">Mark 6:8</span> though more than one were forbidden:</p>
<p><strong>nor scrip</strong>; or bag to put provision in;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:8- :">Mark 6:8- :</span></p>
<p><strong>Neither bread, neither money</strong>; gold, silver, or brass, to buy bread with; because they were to have it, wherever they came, given them, as their due, and the reward of their labour;</p>
<p><strong>neither have two coats apiece</strong>; the word "apiece" is left out in one copy, nor is it expressed in the Vulgate Latin and the eastern versions, which read as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:10">Matthew 10:10</span> though the word does aptly and clearly express the sense of the prohibition, which was not that they should not have two coats among them, but not two apiece; or each man should not have two, or have change of raiment; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:10- :">Matthew 10:10- :</span></p>
