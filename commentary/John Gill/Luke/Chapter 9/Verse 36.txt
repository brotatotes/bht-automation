<p><strong>And when, the voice was past</strong>,.... The above words were delivered, and it was heard no more: Jesus was found alone; by his disciples; Moses and Elias being gone, and he in the same form in which he was before his transfiguration.</p>
<p><strong>And they kept it close</strong>; as Christ strictly charged them, when coming down from the mount with them; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:9">Matthew 17:9</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen</strong>; no, not any of their fellow disciples, until that Christ was risen from the dead.</p>
