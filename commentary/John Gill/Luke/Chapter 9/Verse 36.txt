And when, the voice was past,.... The above words were delivered, and it was heard no more: Jesus was found alone; by his disciples; Moses and Elias being gone, and he in the same form in which he was before his transfiguration.And they kept it close; as Christ strictly charged them, when coming down from the mount with them; Matthew 17:9.And told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen; no, not any of their fellow disciples, until that Christ was risen from the dead.
