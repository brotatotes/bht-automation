<p><strong>And it came to pass, that on the next day</strong>,.... For Jesus and his disciples staid all night on the mountain:</p>
<p><strong>when they were come down from the hill</strong>; to the bottom of it:</p>
<p><strong>much people met him</strong>. The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Persic versions read, "met them".</p>
