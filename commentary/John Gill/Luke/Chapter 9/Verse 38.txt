And behold, a man of the company,.... One that was in the company, and among the multitude, that met him:cried out; with great vehemence and earnestness:saying, Master; doctor, or "Rabbi":I beseech thee: most humbly, for he was now on his knees:look upon my son: with pity and compassion, and help him:for he is mine only child; wherefore he was dear unto him, and he was greatly concerned for him, and earnestly desirous of his being restored to health; and this he mentions, to move the compassion of Christ.
