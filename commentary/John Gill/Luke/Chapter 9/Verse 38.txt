<p><strong>And behold, a man of the company</strong>,.... One that was in the company, and among the multitude, that met him:</p>
<p><strong>cried out</strong>; with great vehemence and earnestness:</p>
<p><strong>saying, Master</strong>; doctor, or "Rabbi":</p>
<p><strong>I beseech thee</strong>: most humbly, for he was now on his knees:</p>
<p><strong>look upon my son</strong>: with pity and compassion, and help him:</p>
<p><strong>for he is mine only child</strong>; wherefore he was dear unto him, and he was greatly concerned for him, and earnestly desirous of his being restored to health; and this he mentions, to move the compassion of Christ.</p>
