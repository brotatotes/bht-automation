And, lo, a spirit taketh him,.... An evil spirit, the devil, as in Luke 9:42 seizes and possesses him at once,and he suddenly crieth out; in a most terrible manner, giving dreadful shrieks, as soon as he perceives that he is seized by the demon:and it teareth him, that he foameth again; throws him into convulsions, so that he foams at the mouth: and so we read t of a son of a certain Jew, that"a certain spirit passed before him and hurt him, convulsed his mouth, and his eyes, and his hands were convulsed, and he could not speak.''And bruising him; by dashing him against the wall, or throwing him to the ground:hardly departeth from him; is very loath to leave him, even after he has distressed, convulsed, and bruised him in this dreadful manner, such was his cruelty and malice; Luke 9:42- : Luke 9:42- :t Zohar in Lev. fol. 21. 4.
