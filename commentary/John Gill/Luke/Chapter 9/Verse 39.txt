<p><strong>And, lo, a spirit taketh him</strong>,.... An evil spirit, the devil, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:42">Luke 9:42</span> seizes and possesses him at once,</p>
<p><strong>and he suddenly crieth out</strong>; in a most terrible manner, giving dreadful shrieks, as soon as he perceives that he is seized by the demon:</p>
<p><strong>and it teareth him, that he foameth again</strong>; throws him into convulsions, so that he foams at the mouth: and so we read t of a son of a certain Jew, that</p>
<p>"a certain spirit passed before him and hurt him, convulsed his mouth, and his eyes, and his hands were convulsed, and he could not speak.''</p>
<p><strong>And bruising him</strong>; by dashing him against the wall, or throwing him to the ground:</p>
<p><strong>hardly departeth from him</strong>; is very loath to leave him, even after he has distressed, convulsed, and bruised him in this dreadful manner, such was his cruelty and malice; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:42- :">Luke 9:42- :</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:42- :">Luke 9:42- :</span></p>
