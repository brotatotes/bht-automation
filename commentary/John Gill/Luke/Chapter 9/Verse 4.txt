<p><strong>And whatsoever house ye enter into</strong>,.... In any town, or city, they should come to in their journey through Judea, and should enter into for the sake of lodging, during their stay:</p>
<p><strong>there abide</strong>; do not shift quarters, or move from house to house:</p>
<p><strong>and thence depart</strong>; the house you come into first, go out of last, when ye leave the town or city. The Vulgate Latin and Persic versions read, and thence do not depart: and so Beza says it is read in a certain copy, but then the sense is the same, as the Ethiopic version renders it, "do not go out from thence, until ye depart"; that is, do not leave the house, till you depart out of the town or city; agreeably to which is the Arabic version, "remain in it until the time of your going out"; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
