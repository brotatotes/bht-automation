<p><strong>Let these sayings sink down into your ears</strong>,.... The Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read, "in your hearts": Christ's sense is, that they would, diligently attend to them, seriously consider them, and carefully lay them up in their memories; and what he refers to are not the words he had spoken, but what he was about to say; namely, as follow:</p>
<p><strong>for the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men</strong>; by whom he should be killed, though he should rise again the third day;</p>
