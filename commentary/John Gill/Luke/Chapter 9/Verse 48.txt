<p><strong>And said unto them, whosoever shalt receive this child</strong>,.... Or "one such little child", as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:5">Matthew 18:5</span> and so the Syriac version here, "a child like to this"; and the Arabic version, "one like to this child"; not in age, but in meekness and humility; one that is not proud and haughty, ambitious of worldly honour, and envious at the superior state of others: whoever receives such an one into his house and heart, and the Gospel he preaches,</p>
<p><strong>in my name</strong>; because he belongs to me, is sent by me, and represents me, and delivers my message:</p>
<p><strong>receiveth me</strong>; represented by him, and will be so taken:</p>
<p><strong>and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth him that sent me</strong>;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:5- :">Matthew 18:5- :</span></p>
<p><strong>For he that is least among you all</strong>; that is so, in his own opinion, and behaves as such in his conduct, who is lowly and meek, and humble; and so the Ethiopic version, rather interpreting than translating, renders it, "for he that makes himself humble, who is lesser than all"; who considers himself as the least of the apostles, and unworthy to be one, as did the Apostle Paul:</p>
<p><strong>the same shall be great</strong>; shall be highly honoured with gifts, and made greatly useful, as the above mentioned apostle was: a saying like this, the Jews have u;</p>
<p>"every one, המקטין עצמו, "that makes himself little", for the words of the law in this world, נעשה גדול, "shall be made great" in the world to come;''</p>
<p>that is, in the days of the Messiah: and again it is said by w them,</p>
<p>"worthy is he that makes himself little in this world, how great and high shall he be in that world!--whoever is little shall be great, and he that is great shall be little.''</p>
