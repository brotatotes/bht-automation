<p><strong>And it came to pass, when the time was come</strong>,.... Or "days were fulfilled", an usual Hebraism; when the period of time fixed for his being in Galilee was come to an end: when he had fulfilled his ministry, and finished all his sayings, and wrought all the miracles he was to work in those parts; when he was to quit this country, and go into Judea, and up to Jerusalem, signified in the next clause:</p>
<p><strong>that he should be received up</strong>; or as all the Oriental versions rightly render the words, "when the time, or days of his ascension were fulfilled"; not of his ascension to heaven, as interpreters generally understand the passage, because the word is used of that, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:19">Mark 16:19</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:2">Acts 1:2</span> much less as others, of his being taken and lifted up from the earth upon the cross, and so signifies his crucifixion, and sufferings, and death; for of neither of these can it be said, that the time of them was come, or the days fulfilled, in which either of these should be: for if Christ was now going to the feast of tabernacles, as some think, it must be above half a year before his death, and still longer before his ascension to heaven: and if to the feast of dedication, it was above three months to his ascension: hence interpreters that go this way, are obliged to interpret it, that the time drew near, or was drawing on, or the days were almost fulfilled; whereas the expression is full and strong, that the time was come, and the days were fulfilled; and which was true in the sense hinted at, that now the time was up, that Jesus must leave the low lands of Galilee, having finished his work there; and go into the higher country of Judea, and so up to Jerusalem; for of his ascension from Galilee to Jerusalem are the words to be understood;</p>

<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:2- :">Acts 1:2- :</span> And it is observable that after this, he never went into Galilee any more; and this sense is confirmed by what follows:</p>
<p><strong>he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem</strong>; or "strengthened his face", as the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions; set his face like a flint, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:7">Isaiah 1:7</span> denoting not impudence, as hardening of the face is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+21:29">Proverbs 21:29</span> but boldness, courage, constancy and firmness of mind: or "he prepared his face", as the Syriac; or "turned his face", as the Arabic, he looked that way, and set forward; or as the Persic version renders it, "he made a firm purpose", he resolved upon it, and was determined to go to Jerusalem, his time being up in Galilee; and though he knew what he was to meet with and endure; that he should bear the sins of his people, the curse of the law, and wrath of God; that he should have many enemies, men and devils to grapple with, and undergo a painful, shameful, and accursed death; yet none of these things moved him, he was resolutely bent on going thither, and accordingly prepared for his journey; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+21:29- :">Proverbs 21:29- :</span>.</p>
