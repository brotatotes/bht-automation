<p><strong>And when his disciples, James and John, saw this</strong>,.... The Persic version reads thus; when "James and John, and the disciples saw this"; that is, the other disciples besides them, so making all the disciples say what follows; whereas only those two are intended, who having been the messengers, were the more provoked at this indignity to their Lord and master:</p>
<p><strong>they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them</strong>; being enraged at this conduct of the Samaritans towards, Christ, and burning with love to him, and zeal for his honour; being "Boanerges's", sons of thunder, they were for punishing of them in a most terrible manner, even with, fire from heaven; by which Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities of the plain, were destroyed: this they doubted not of doing, knowing what miraculous power was conferred upon them; but did not think proper to attempt to exert it, until they had asked leave of Christ to do it:</p>
<p><strong>even as Elias did</strong>; upon the two captains of fifties, with their fifties, as recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+1:9">2 Kings 1:9</span> This clause was wanting in a certain copy of Beza's, and is not in the Vulgate Latin version; but is in other copies and versions, and by all means to be retained.</p>
