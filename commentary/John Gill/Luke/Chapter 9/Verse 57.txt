From one village of the Samaritans, to the other; though if this is the same history related in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:19">Matthew 8:19</span> it was as Christ went from Capernaum to the sea side, in order to go to the other side of it; and must be inserted here, without regard to the order of time:</p>
<p><strong>a certain man said unto him</strong>; if the same as in Matthew, he is there said to be a "Scribe";</p>
<p><strong>Lord, I will follow thee, wheresoever thou goest</strong>. The Arabic and Ethiopic versions read these words by way of question, "Lord, shall I not follow thee wheresoever thou goest?" <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:19- :">Matthew 8:19- :</span>.</p>
