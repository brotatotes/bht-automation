And they departed,.... That is, the apostles, as the Syriac and Persic versions express it: they went from Christ, and the place where he was, from Capernaum, at least from some place in Galilee:and went through the towns; the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions add, "and cities"; that is, of Judea, as well as Galilee, even the whole land of Israel:preaching the Gospel; which explains what is meant by the kingdom of God, Luke 9:2 and healing everywhere; all sorts of bodily diseases, wherever they came.
