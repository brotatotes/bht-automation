<p><strong>Now Herod the tetrarch</strong>,.... Of Galilee, and who is called a king in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:14">Mark 6:14</span> as he is here in the Ethiopic version:</p>
<p><strong>heard of all that was done by him</strong>; of all the miracles that were wrought by Christ, and his apostles; the fame of which were the more spread through the mission of the apostles, and the journey they took through all the towns and cities of Galilee, which were in Herod's jurisdiction; by which means he, and his court, came to the knowledge of them, the whole country, ringing with the account of the same:</p>
<p><strong>and he was perplexed</strong>; anxious, and distressed, not knowing well what to think of Christ, and the different sentiments of men about him: be was afraid lest he should be John the Baptist risen from the dead, whom he had beheaded: he hesitated about it at first, though he afterwards was fully persuaded, in his own mind, that it was he, as some affirmed; and this gave him great uneasiness, and filled him with distress and horror:</p>
<p><strong>because that it was said of some that John was risen from the dead</strong>; and he began to fear it was true, though willing to disbelieve it, at least to make a question of it, especially in public; though in private, to his own family and servants, he was free to tell his mind.</p>
