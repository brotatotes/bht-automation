<p><strong>And of some, that Elias had appeared</strong>,.... Who had been translated, body and soul, to heaven, and whom the Jews expected a little before the coming of the Messiah:</p>
<p><strong>and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again;</strong> that is, one of the former prophets. It is well known, that the Jews distinguish the prophets into the former and latter; the books of the prophets of the Old Testament are so distinguished; the writings of the former prophets are those of Joshua, Judges, 1 and 2 of Samuel, and the first and second of Kings: the latter prophets are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, which are the greater prophets, and the twelve lesser ones: and in the Talmud q it is asked,</p>
<p>"who are נביאים הראשונים, "the former prophets?" Says R. Huna, they are David, Samuel, and Solomon--and why are they called former prophets? to except (or distinguish) them from Haggai, Zachariah, and Malachi, who are the latter.''</p>
<p>So that by one of the old prophets, may be meant one of those that were before the times of Elias, as Samuel or David.</p>
