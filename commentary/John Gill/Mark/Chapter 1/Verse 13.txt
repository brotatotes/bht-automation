<p><strong>And he was there in the wilderness forty days</strong>,.... The Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions add, "and forty nights": for so long was he there,</p>
<p><strong>tempted of Satan</strong>: the several temptations of Satan, and how they were overcome by Christ, are particularly related by the Evangelist Matthew, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:3">Matthew 4:3</span>, which are here omitted; and what is not mentioned there, is here recorded:</p>
<p><strong>and was with the wild beasts</strong>: which shows, that he was now in an uncultivated and uninhabited part of the desert by men, and where only the most fierce and most savage of creatures dwelt; and yet was as secure and unhurt by them, being the Lord of them, as Adam in Eden's garden, or Daniel in the lions' den. This circumstance is only related by the Evangelist Mark, and is what adds to the uncomfortable situation Christ was in, when tempted by Satan; and his being not hurt by them, may declare, partly his innocence, as man, being as pure and holy as the first man was in his state of integrity, when all creatures were brought before him, to give them names; and partly the power of God, who shut up the mouths of these creatures, that they did him no hurt; and also may signify, the awe they stood in of him, who, as God, is Lord of all. These creatures were more gentle to Christ, and used him better than the wicked Jews, among whom he dwelt, who are compared to lions, dogs, and "bulls" of Bashan, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:12">Psalms 22:12</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And the angels ministered unto him</strong>; after the temptations were over, and Satan had left him, preparing for him, and bringing to him proper food, after so long a fast; and waiting upon him, and serving him as their great Lord and master; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:12- :">Psalms 22:12- :</span>.</p>
