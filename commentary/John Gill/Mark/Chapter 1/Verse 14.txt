<p><strong>Now after that John was put in prison</strong>,.... In the castle of Macherus, by Herod, for reproving him for taking his brother Philip's wife:</p>
<p><strong>Jesus came into Galilee</strong>: again, from whence he came to be baptized of John:</p>
<p><strong>preaching the Gospel of the kingdom of God</strong>: the good news and glad tidings of the kingdom of the Messiah, or Gospel dispensation; which lies not in worldly pomp and splendour, in outward observances, in legal rites and ceremonies, but in righteousness, peace, and joy; in peace and pardon by the blood of Christ, in justification by his righteousness, and in free and full salvation by him.</p>
