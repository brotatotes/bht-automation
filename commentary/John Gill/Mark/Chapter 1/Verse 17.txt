<p><strong>And Jesus said unto them, come ye after me</strong>,.... Leave your worldly employments, and become my disciples,</p>
<p><strong>and I will make you to become fishers of men</strong>: which will be a much more excellent and honourable employment, as men, and the souls of men, are more excellent, and of more worth than fishes;</p>
