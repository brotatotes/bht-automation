<p><strong>And there was in their synagogue</strong>,.... In the synagogue of the Capernaites, at the same time that Jesus was teaching there,</p>
<p><strong>a man with an unclean spirit</strong>: not with an unclean heart, for there were doubtless many such there, but that had a devil; for in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:33">Luke 4:33</span>, it is said, "he had a spirit of an unclean devil": so called, because he is impure in himself, and the cause of uncleanness in men, in which he delights: and such spirits sometimes are where religious persons meet, but with no good design; either to disturb the preacher, or to divert the hearer, that the word may be unfruitful and unprofitable:</p>
<p><strong>and he cried out</strong>: either the man, or rather the unclean spirit in him, who had possessed his body, and made use of the organs of it: he cried out through dread of the majesty of Christ, whose presence he could not bear; and through grief and envy at the success of his ministration, and the influence it had upon the minds of men; and through fear of being dispossessed of the man, in whom he was.</p>
