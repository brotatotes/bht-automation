<p><strong>And they were all amazed</strong>,.... The people that were in the synagogue, who were met together for divine worship, were astonished, not only at his doctrine, as before, but at this miracle and power of his in casting out devils:</p>
<p><strong>insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, what thing is this</strong>? They spake among themselves, as Luke says, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:36">Luke 4:36</span>; they inquired of one another; they conferred together, talked over the point, and disputed among themselves, concerning both the doctrine and power of Christ, what, and how wonderful they were:</p>
<p><strong>what new doctrine is this</strong>? This they said, not as fixing a brand of novelty upon it, as the Athenians did on Paul's doctrine, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:19">Acts 17:19</span>, but as admiring it; being what was rare and unusual, and which they had never heard of from their Rabbins and Scribes, and which was confirmed by miracles;</p>
<p><strong>for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him</strong>: they not only observed the authority with which he delivered his doctrine, but the authority with which he cast out devils, by a word speaking; he not only commanded them to come out, but they immediately came out; their exorcists took authority upon them to command, but could not oblige the devils to obey; but these men took notice, that such was the authority of Christ in commanding, that the unclean spirits were obliged to obey, and did.</p>
