Christ having wrought this miracle, and finished his sermon, and the whole synagogue service being over, when it was usual for every one to repair to their own houses, or their friends, for refreshment; he, and they that were with him, departed from it, and directly, being not far from it,</p>
<p><strong>they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew</strong>; who being brethren, dwelt together in a house at Capernaum, where it seems they were now inhabitants, though their native place was Bethsaida, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:44">John 1:44</span>,</p>
<p><strong>with James and John</strong>; whom they took along with them, being fellow disciples of Christ.</p>
