And at even, when the sun did set,.... At which time the Jews' sabbath was ended;  :-, for this was a sabbath day, Mark 1:21, when according to them, it was not lawful to heal; nor did they offer to bring their sick to him on that day; but the last of the two evening days being come, and the sun set, the sabbath was over; and therefore being under no restraint on account of that,they brought unto him all that were diseased; with any sort of disease whatever, even all that were in their city;and them that were possessed with devils. The Persic version renders it "epileptics", such as were troubled with the falling sickness, as many of those were, whose bodies the devils possessed.
