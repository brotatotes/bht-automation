<p><strong>And at even, when the sun did set</strong>,.... At which time the Jews' sabbath was ended; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, for this was a sabbath day, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:21">Mark 1:21</span>, when according to them, it was not lawful to heal; nor did they offer to bring their sick to him on that day; but the last of the two evening days being come, and the sun set, the sabbath was over; and therefore being under no restraint on account of that,</p>
<p><strong>they brought unto him all that were diseased</strong>; with any sort of disease whatever, even all that were in their city;</p>
<p><strong>and them that were possessed with devils</strong>. The Persic version renders it "epileptics", such as were troubled with the falling sickness, as many of those were, whose bodies the devils possessed.</p>
