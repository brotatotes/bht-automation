<p><strong>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases</strong>,.... Not that there were some, who had some sorts of diseases, whom he did not heal; but he healed all that came, or were brought to him, which were many, of every sort of disease, which were divers, with which they were afflicted:</p>
<p><strong>and cast many devils</strong>; even as many as were brought to him, or were possessed with any:</p>
<p><strong>and he suffered not the devils to speak</strong>; either for him, or against him; which shows his great power over them:</p>
<p><strong>because they knew him</strong>, or "that they knew him": he would not suffer them to say a word about him, because he knew that they knew that he was the Christ, the Son of God, or he would not permit them to say who he was; because he had others to bear witness of him, and better testimonies than theirs, and lest his enemies should reproach him with an agreement and familiarity with them.</p>
