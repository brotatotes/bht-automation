<p><strong>And in the morning, rising up a great white before day</strong>,.... On the morrow after the sabbath, on the first day in the morning, notwithstanding the fatigue of the former day, through preaching and working miracles; yet he rose up very early while it was very much within the night, as the light and day were coming on, and before the day broke; though it might be broad day before he departed out of the house, as Luke suggests, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:42">Luke 4:42</span>,</p>
<p><strong>he went out</strong>; out of the house of Simon and Andrew, and out of the city of Capernaum, leaving his disciples and friends behind him:</p>
<p><strong>and departed into a solitary place, and there he prayed</strong>; as man, to his God and Father; it may be for his disciples he had lately chosen; for himself, as man, that he might be strengthened as such for service; and for success in his ministry, and that his Gospel might run and be glorified; he chose a desert, and solitary place, for the sake of retirement, from the crowd of people that attended at Peter's door; where he could not be alone, and in private, and as most suitable for the exercise of prayer. His early and private devotion may be an example to us.</p>
