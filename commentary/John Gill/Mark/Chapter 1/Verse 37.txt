<p><strong>And when they had found him</strong>,.... In the desert and solitary place, where he had been praying:</p>
<p><strong>they said unto him</strong>; in order to engage him to go with them, and as the reason why they sought him with so much eagerness and diligence,</p>
<p><strong>all men seek for thee</strong>; not all the men in the world, nor, it may be, all the inhabitants of Capernaum, but a large number of them, who were inquiring after him, some for one thing, some for another; some to see him, what manner of man he was, and some to hear him, what sort of doctrine he preached, and others to see his miracles, or to have themselves, or their sick healed; and the disciples were loath that such an opportunity of doing good should be missed, and therefore sought for him, till they found him.</p>
