<p><strong>And he preached in their synagogues</strong>,.... Which were in the next towns, in the village cities, and</p>
<p><strong>throughout all Galilee</strong>: taking every town and city in his circuit, he continued preaching the Gospel of the kingdom in one place and another, until he had gone over the whole country:</p>
<p><strong>and cast out devils</strong>; as out of the souls, so out of the bodies of men, whereby he confirmed the doctrine he preached.</p>
