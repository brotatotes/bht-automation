<p><strong>John did baptize in the wilderness</strong>,.... Of Judea, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:1">Matthew 3:1</span>, where he first appeared as a preacher; and is the same wilderness Isaiah has respect to in the above prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:3">Isaiah 40:3</span>. The words are best rendered in the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions; "John was in the wilderness, baptizing and preaching the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins": according to which, the account of the Baptist begins with his name, John; describes the place where he was where he made his first appearance, and continued in, the wilderness; which was not a wild uninhabited place and without people, but had many cities, towns, and villages in it; and also declares his work and ministry there, which was preaching and baptizing: for though baptizing is here put before preaching, yet certain it is, that he first came preaching in these parts; and there baptized such, to whom his preaching was made useful. Baptism is here called, the</p>
<p><strong>baptism of repentance</strong>: because John required repentance antecedent to it, and administered it upon profession of repentance, and as an open testification of it; and this</p>
<p><strong>for</strong>, or <strong>unto the remission of sins</strong>: not for the obtaining the remission of sins, as if either repentance, or baptism, were the causes of pardon of sin; but the sense is, that John preached that men should repent of their sins, and believe in Christ, who was to come; and upon their repentance and faith, be baptized; in which ordinance, they might be led to a fresh view of the free and full forgiveness of their sins, through Christ; whose blood was to be shed for many, to obtain it: see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span>.</p>
