And it came to pass in those days,.... Whilst John was preaching and baptizing in the wilderness, and had large crowds of people flocking to him, to see his person, hear his doctrine, and to be baptized by him; some for one thing, and some another;Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee; the place where he had been brought up, and lived, and dwelt in from his infancy, to this time:and was baptized of John in Jordan; which was the reason of his coming from Nazareth to him; see Matthew 3:13, where this is observed; and in some verses following, an account is given of what passed between Christ and John, on this occasion.
