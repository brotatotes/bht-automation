<p><strong>And he saith unto them</strong>,.... The same things as in Mt 5:32, 19:9; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>:</p>
<p><strong>whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another</strong>; when there is no uncleanness in the case; when his former wile has not injured him by violating the marriage bed:</p>
<p><strong>committeth adultery against her</strong>; to the injury of his lawful wife; or "upon her", or "with her", with the person he marries. The Syriac and Persic versions leave out the phrase, "against her".</p>
