<p><strong>Verily I say, unto you</strong>,.... A form of speech used when our Lord was about to asseverate a thing, and assert something of moment and importance, and which he would have attended to.</p>
<p><strong>Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God</strong>; the Gospel, and the mysteries of it:</p>
<p><strong>as a little child</strong>; laying aside all pride and prejudice, attending thereunto with humility and meekness:</p>
<p><strong>he shall not enter therein</strong>; he shall attain to no true spiritual knowledge of the Gospel; nor should he be admitted into a Gospel church state, and to the ordinances of it.</p>
