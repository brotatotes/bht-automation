Verily I say, unto you,.... A form of speech used when our Lord was about to asseverate a thing, and assert something of moment and importance, and which he would have attended to.Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God; the Gospel, and the mysteries of it:as a little child; laying aside all pride and prejudice, attending thereunto with humility and meekness:he shall not enter therein; he shall attain to no true spiritual knowledge of the Gospel; nor should he be admitted into a Gospel church state, and to the ordinances of it.
