<p><strong>And when he was gone forth into the way</strong>,.... For when he had blessed the children he departed from the coasts of Judea, on the further side of Jordan, and steered his course towards Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:32">Mark 10:32</span>, and as he was on the road thitherwards,</p>
<p><strong>there came one running</strong>; a young man, a ruler among the Jews, and very rich, a person of great dignity, and large substance; he hearing that Christ was going from those parts, ran in great haste to him, to have some conversation with him, before he was entirely gone;</p>
