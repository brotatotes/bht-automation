<p><strong>And Jesus said unto him</strong>,.... The same as in Mt. 19:17,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Why callest thou me good</strong>? This is said, not as denying that he was good, or as being angry with him for calling him so, but in order to lead this young man to a true knowledge of him, and his goodness, and even of his proper deity:</p>
<p><strong>there is none good, but one, [that is], God</strong>; some render it, "but one God", as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions; and so the words are a proof of the unity of the divine being, and agree with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+6:4">Deuteronomy 6:4</span>, but are not to be understood to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit, who, with the Father, are the one God: nor do these words at all militate against the deity of Christ, or prove that he is not God, as the Jew objects a; seeing this is not to be understood of the person of the Father, in opposition to the Son and Spirit, who are equally good: nor does Christ, in these words, deny himself to be God, but rather tacitly suggests it; since he is good in the same sense in which God is good: in Matthew it is added, "but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:17">Matthew 19:17</span>: this Christ said not as his sense, that the way to eternal life lies in keeping the commandments of the law; but he speaks in the language of the Pharisees, and of this man; and his view is, to bring him to a sense of the impossibility of obtaining eternal life by these things, as the sequel shows: wherefore the above Jew b has no reason to confront the followers of Jesus with this passage, as if it was a concession of his, that it is impossible any should be saved without keeping the commands of the law of Moses.</p>
