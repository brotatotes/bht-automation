<p><strong>And the disciples were astonished at his words</strong>,.... For they expected, in a little while, that the kingdom of the Messiah would be set up in great worldly pomp and grandeur; and that all the rich men of the nation would come into it, become his subjects, and join to support the glory and splendour of it:</p>
<p><strong>but Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, children</strong>: it was common with the Jews to call the disciples, or scholars of the wise men, "children"; hence that saying of theirs f, התלמידים קרוים בנים, "the disciples are called children", which they prove from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+2:3">2 Kings 2:3</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:18">Isaiah 8:18</span>.</p>
<p><strong>How hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God</strong>!
