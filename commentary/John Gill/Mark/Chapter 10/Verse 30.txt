But he shall receive an hundred fold now in this time,.... Not that he should have an hundred houses, brethren, c. but that he should enjoy that even in this present life, which was an hundred times better than any of the things mentioned namely,houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands;  :- it is added here,with persecutions. The Syriac and Ethiopic versions read in the singular, "with persecution"; signifying that this must be expected amidst the greatest happiness, and highest enjoyments of this life; though often even that which the saints enjoy, whilst they are, in the severest manner, persecuted for Christ, is an hundred times better than, yea, infinitely above, all that they part with, or lose for his sake; and so is an ample compensation for all: and yet this is not all they shall have; for it follows,and in the world to come eternal life: so that they will be doubly recompensed; once in this life, and again in the other world: in the Targum on Song of Solomon 8:7 is a passage somewhat like this, where the Lord of the world is represented saying;"if a man will give all the substance of his house to obtain wisdom in the captivity, I will return unto him,כפול לעלמא דאתי, "double in the world to come".''
