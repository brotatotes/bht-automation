<p><strong>And they were in the way</strong>,.... Upon the road, having left the coasts of Judea on the further side of Jordan:</p>
<p><strong>going up to Jerusalem</strong>; to the passover there, which was to be in a short time, and where Christ was to suffer and die; for this was the last journey he took, and the last passover he was to eat there:</p>
<p><strong>and Jesus went before them</strong>; as their forerunner, their guide and leader, with unconcernedness and intrepidity; though he knew what would befall him, and what designs were forming against him: and this he did to inspire his disciples with courage, and to leave them an example that they should tread in his steps:</p>
<p><strong>and they were amazed</strong>; at his readiness to go up to Jerusalem, and the cheerful Spirit he discovered, when he had so many, and such powerful enemies at that place, in going to which he exposed himself to the greatest dangers.</p>
<p><strong>And as they followed</strong>; for they did not choose to leave him, but were determined to continue with him at all events, though</p>
<p><strong>they were afraid</strong>; what would be the consequence of it to themselves, as well as to him; for they being his followers, could not expect any other than ill usage from his enemies.</p>
<p><strong>And he took again the twelve</strong>; the disciples, as he had done before, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:31">Mark 8:31</span>,</p>
<p><strong>and began to tell them what things should happen unto him</strong>; being what were determined by God, agreed unto by himself, and foretold in the Scriptures; for these were not casual and contingent events.</p>
