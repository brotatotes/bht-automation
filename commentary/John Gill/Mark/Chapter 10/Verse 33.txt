[Saying], behold we go up to Jerusalem,.... They were now upon the road thither.And the son of man; meaning himself,shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the Scribes; by the determinate counsel, and foreknowledge of God, and by the means of a treacherous disciple of his, Judas. The Vulgate Latin version adds, "and to the elders"; but this is not in any of the copies, nor in other versions:and they shall condemn him to death; as they did in the palace of the high priest, "nemine contradicente"; see Mark 14:64,and shall deliver him to the Gentiles; the Romans, to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor; either because they had not then power to put him to death themselves, or because they were desirous he should die the death of the cross, a Roman punishment.
