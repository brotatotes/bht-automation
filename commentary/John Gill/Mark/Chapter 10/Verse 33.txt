<p><strong>[Saying], behold we go up to Jerusalem</strong>,.... They were now upon the road thither.</p>
<p><strong>And the son of man</strong>; meaning himself,</p>
<p><strong>shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the Scribes</strong>; by the determinate counsel, and foreknowledge of God, and by the means of a treacherous disciple of his, Judas. The Vulgate Latin version adds, "and to the elders"; but this is not in any of the copies, nor in other versions:</p>
<p><strong>and they shall condemn him to death</strong>; as they did in the palace of the high priest, "nemine contradicente"; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:64">Mark 14:64</span>,</p>
<p><strong>and shall deliver him to the Gentiles</strong>; the Romans, to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor; either because they had not then power to put him to death themselves, or because they were desirous he should die the death of the cross, a Roman punishment.</p>
