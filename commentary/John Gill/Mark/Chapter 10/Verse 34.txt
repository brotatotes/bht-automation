<p><strong>And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him</strong>,.... The Gentiles, as the Roman soldiers did; the one at the connivance, and the other by the order of their governor:</p>
<p><strong>and shall spit upon him</strong>; on his face, as the Syriac and Persic versions render it, and as they did; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:19">Mark 15:19</span>. This clause is placed by the Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, between the two former; though, according to the order in which these things were executed, he was first scourged, then mocked, and then spit upon: all which express both the cruel and indecent usage he was to meet with:</p>
<p><strong>and shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again</strong>. The Persic version between these two clauses read, "and shall put him in a grave"; which is not in any copy of this text, nor in any other version; nor indeed was this done by the Gentiles, but by Joseph of Arimathea.</p>
