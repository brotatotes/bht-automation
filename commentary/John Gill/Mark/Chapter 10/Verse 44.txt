<p><strong>And whosoever of you will be the chiefest</strong>,.... Is desirous of the highest place and the greatest honour</p>
<p><strong>shall be servant of all</strong>: for the ministers of the Gospel are not only the servants of Christ Jesus, but also of the churches for his sake; and in serving them, they serve Christ: not that they are to be the servants of men and to take their instructions from them and act according to rules prescribed by them; or seek to please men for then they would not be the servants of Christ: but they become servants to all that they may win souls to Christ, and increase his churches, and enlarge his interest; and such as are most useful this way are the chiefest in the Gospel church state; they are honoured by Christ and esteemed by his people; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
