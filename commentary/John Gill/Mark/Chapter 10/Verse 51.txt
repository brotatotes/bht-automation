<p><strong>what wilt thou that I should do unto thee</strong>? What means this vehement cry? what is it thou designest by mercy? is it money thou askest for, to relieve thy wants? or is it that thy sight may be restored?</p>
<p><strong>The blind man said unto him, Lord</strong>; "Rabboni", or, as the Syriac version reads it; "Rabbi"; thou, great master in Israel, and Lord, of the whole world, my request to thee, and which thou, art, able to effect; is,</p>
<p><strong>that I might receive my sight</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
