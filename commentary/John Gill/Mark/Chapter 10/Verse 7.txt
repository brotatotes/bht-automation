The Persic version adds, "and brethren and sisters", though without any foundation in the original text, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24">Genesis 2:24</span>, from whence this passage is cited; or in any copy of the evangelist:</p>
<p><strong>and cleave to his wife</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24- :">Genesis 2:24- :</span>.</p>
