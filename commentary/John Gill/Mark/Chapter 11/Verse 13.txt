<p><strong>And seeing a fig tree afar off</strong>,.... By the wayside, at some distance from him:</p>
<p><strong>having leaves</strong>; very large and spreading, which made a great show, as if there might be fruit on it:</p>
<p><strong>he came</strong>; unto it; either he went out of his way to it, or having seen it before him a good way off, at length came up to it</p>
<p><strong>if haply he might find any thing thereon</strong>; that is, any fruit; for he saw at a distance, there were leaves upon it; and which was the more remarkable, since it was the time of the fig tree just putting forth its tender branches, leaves, and fruit:</p>
<p><strong>and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves</strong>; no fruit at all upon it, contrary to his expectation as man, and the promising appearance the tree made:</p>
<p><strong>for the time of figs was not [yet]</strong>; or, "for it was not the time of figs"; for the word "yet", is not in the text: and the words seem rather to be a reason, why Christ should not have expected fruit on it, than that he should: but the sense is, either because the time of gathering figs was not come; and since therefore they were not gathered, he might the rather hope to find some on it; or because it was not a kind season for figs, a good fig year; and this tree appearing in such a flourishing condition, might raise his expectation of finding fruit, yet he found none but leaves only; because it was so bad a season for figs, that even the most promising trees had none upon them: or this, tree being of an uncommon sort, though Christ expected to find no fruit on other trees, because the time of common: figs was not come, yet he might hope to, find some on this. Some critics neglecting the accents, render the words, "where he was, it was the season of figs";</p>
