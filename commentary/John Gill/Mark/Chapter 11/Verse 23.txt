<p><strong>For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain</strong>,.... The Mount of Olives, at, or near which they now were,</p>
<p><strong>be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea</strong>; that is, of Galilee, which was nearest, and yet many miles off:</p>
<p><strong>and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass</strong>; not only as to removing a mountain, and casting it into the sea, but any thing equally difficult;</p>
<p><strong>he shall have whatsoever he saith</strong>: whatever he commands shall be done; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
