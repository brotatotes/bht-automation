For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain,.... The Mount of Olives, at, or near which they now were,be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; that is, of Galilee, which was nearest, and yet many miles off:and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; not only as to removing a mountain, and casting it into the sea, but any thing equally difficult;he shall have whatsoever he saith: whatever he commands shall be done;  :-.
