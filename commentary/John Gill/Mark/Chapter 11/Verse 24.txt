<p><strong>Therefore I say unto you</strong>,.... For encouragement in prayer more particularly, without which nothing should be attempted, and especially which is above the power of nature, and is of a miraculous kind:</p>
<p><strong>whatsoever things ye desire when ye pray</strong>; that is, according to the revealed will of God, is for the confirmation of his Gospel, and for the glory of his name:</p>
<p><strong>believe that ye receive [them], and ye shall have [them]</strong>; the petitions that are desired, and the things asked in them: that is, be as much assured of having them, as if you had already received them, and you shall have them; for the sense can never be, that they should believe they received them before they had them; this would be a contradiction in terms; and Beza's ancient copy, and one of Stephens's copies read it, "believe that ye shall receive", as in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:22">Matthew 21:22</span>, and so the Vulgate Latin version; with which agree the Arabic and Ethiopic versions, which render it, "believe that ye shall enjoy", or "obtain"; and the Syriac version, "believe that ye are about to receive"; and great faith it is so to believe; and this is the prayer of faith; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:14">1 John 5:14</span>.</p>
