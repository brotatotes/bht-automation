<p><strong>And they come again to Jerusalem</strong>,.... The Persic and Ethiopic versions read, "he came", which must be understood with his disciples; for they never parted from him till he was apprehended in the garden. Luke says, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:1">Luke 20:1</span>, that it was "on one of those days"; and the Persic version here reads, "on another day": it was the day after the cursing of the fig tree, and two days after his public entrance into Jerusalem:</p>
<p><strong>and as he was walking in the temple</strong>; not alone, but his disciples with him, and a multitude of people, whom he was teaching and preaching the Gospel to, as he walked to and fro; and whilst he was there employed,</p>
<p><strong>there come to him the chief priests, and the Scribes, and the elders</strong>: the Jewish sanhedrim; for of these that great council of the nation consisted; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:1- :">Luke 20:1- :</span>.</p>
