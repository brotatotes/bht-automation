<p><strong>And Jesus answered and said unto them</strong>,.... Being not in the least intimidated by such a body of men:</p>
<p><strong>I will also ask of you one question</strong>; or "one word", or "one thing";</p>
<p>λογος, here answers to the Hebrew word דבר, which signifies both "word" and "thing":</p>
<p><strong>and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
