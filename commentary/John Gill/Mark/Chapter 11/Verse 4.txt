And they went their way,.... The two disciples went to the village, where Christ sent them, without objecting any difficulties that might present, in the execution of these orders:and found the colt tied by the door without; in the street, fastened to the door of the owner's house, at the town's end:in a place where two ways met; to go into and out of the village; at the corner house, where two ways met; so that the place was very public, and such an affair could not be transacted, without being seen:and they loose him; as soon as ever they came to the place, they immediately began to untie the colt, and were going away with him.
