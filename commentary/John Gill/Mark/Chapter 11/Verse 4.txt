<p><strong>And they went their way</strong>,.... The two disciples went to the village, where Christ sent them, without objecting any difficulties that might present, in the execution of these orders:</p>
<p><strong>and found the colt tied by the door without</strong>; in the street, fastened to the door of the owner's house, at the town's end:</p>
<p><strong>in a place where two ways met</strong>; to go into and out of the village; at the corner house, where two ways met; so that the place was very public, and such an affair could not be transacted, without being seen:</p>
<p><strong>and they loose him</strong>; as soon as ever they came to the place, they immediately began to untie the colt, and were going away with him.</p>
