<p><strong>And certain of them that stood there</strong>,.... The Ethiopic version reads, who walked there; who were either standing hard by, or walking about the place, being inhabitants of it; and either the owners of the colt, or their servants, or both:</p>
<p><strong>said unto them, what do ye loosing the colt</strong>? What do ye mean by it? do you intend to take the colt away? what business have you with it? what right have you to do so? and what is your end in it?</p>
