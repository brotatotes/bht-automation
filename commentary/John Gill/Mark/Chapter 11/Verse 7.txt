<p><strong>And they brought the colt to Jesus</strong>,.... Where he was,</p>
<p><strong>and cast their garments on him</strong>; their clothes to be instead of a saddle, for Christ to sit upon:</p>
<p><strong>and he sat upon him</strong>; or "Jesus rode on him", as the Syriac version renders it. The Ethiopic version reads, "they made him to mount him"; that is, the disciples assisted him in getting upon it, and having mounted it, he sat on it without any trouble, though it had never been backed before, and rode on his way to Jerusalem;</p>
