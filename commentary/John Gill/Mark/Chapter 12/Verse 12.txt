<p><strong>They sought to lay held on him</strong>,.... That is, the chief priests, Scribes, and elders, after they had heard the parables he spake to them, were greatly irritated, and provoked, and had a good will to have seized him, and carried him away, and have had him before their court, and condemn him:</p>
<p><strong>but feared the people</strong>; lest they should rise up in his defence, and fall on them; for many of them liked; and were attached to his ministry; and others had received favours of one kind or another from him through his miracles:</p>
<p><strong>for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them</strong>: and that they were the husbandmen designed, who had not brought the fruit of the vineyard to their lord, but had ill treated his servants, and would his son.</p>
<p><strong>And they left him</strong>; in the temple, not daring to do any thing to him:</p>
<p><strong>and went their way</strong>; to their council chamber, perhaps to consult what measures to take, and how to destroy him.</p>
