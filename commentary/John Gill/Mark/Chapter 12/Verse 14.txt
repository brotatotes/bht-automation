<p><strong>they said unto him, master</strong>; they saluted him in like manner, as they did their doctors and Rabbins, calling him "Rabbi", though they were not his disciples; but one part of them were the disciples of the Pharisees, and the other had Herod for their master;</p>
<p><strong>we know that thou art true</strong>; an honest, sincere, and upright man,</p>
<p><strong>and carest for no man, for thou regardest not the person of men</strong>; no, not Caesar himself;</p>
<p><strong>but teachest the way of God in truth</strong>; instructest men in the word, will, and worship of God, with all integrity and faithfulness; answer therefore this question,</p>
<p><strong>is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not</strong>? The Syriac and Persic versions read, "head money"; and so it is read in Beza's most ancient copy; a tax that was levied on the heads of families; or on every particular head in a family; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,</p>
