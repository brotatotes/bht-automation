<p><strong>And Jesus answering said unto them</strong>,.... Very wisely and pertinently,</p>
<p><strong>render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's</strong>: or "to the king, which are the king's", as the Arabic and Ethiopic versions render it:</p>
<p><strong>and to God the things that are God's</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and they marvelled at him</strong>; at his wisdom and prudence in returning such an answer, which cut off all occasion against him.</p>
