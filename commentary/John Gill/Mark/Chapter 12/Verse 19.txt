Has left in writing for us the following precept to observe; for they acknowledged the writings of Moses, and indeed all the Scriptures of the Old Testament; adhering to the literal sense of them, and rejecting the traditional interpretation of them by the Rabbins:</p>
<p><strong>if a man's brother die, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother</strong>; which is the sense of the law in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+25:5">Deuteronomy 25:5</span>;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+25:5- :">Deuteronomy 25:5- :</span>.</p>
