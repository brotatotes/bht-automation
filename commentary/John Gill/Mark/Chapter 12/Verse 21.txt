<p><strong>The second took her</strong>,.... To wife, married her, as the next eldest brother, by the above law was obliged to: and so the Jewish l canon upon it runs thus;</p>
<p>"the command is, בגדול, "for the eldest" to marry his brother's wife: if he will not, they go to all the brethren; if they will not, they return to the eldest, and say, the command is upon thee, either pluck off the shoe, or marry.''</p>
<p>Maimonides m relates it in this manner;</p>
<p>"if a man dies, and leaves many brethren, the command is upon the eldest to marry, or pull off the shoe; as it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+25:6">Deuteronomy 25:6</span>, "and it shall be the firstborn which she beareth". From tradition, it is learned that it does not speak but of the firstborn among the brethren; and it is all one as if it was said, the eldest of the brethren shall succeed in the name of his brother that is dead; and this is what is said, "which she beareth": the sense is, which the mother has borne, and not which the brother's wife beareth; if the eldest will not marry her, they go round to all the brethren; and if they will not, they return to the eldest, and say, upon thee is the command, either pluck off the shoe, or marry; and they do not compel him to marry, but they compel him to pluck off the shoe;''</p>
<p>i.e. in case he will not marry.</p>
<p><strong>And died, neither left he any, seed, and the third likewise</strong>; married her, and died without issue, as the second did. The Persic version adds, "and the fourth, and fifth"; for so they all did to the seventh.</p>
