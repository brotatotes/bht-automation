<p><strong>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise</strong>,.... This last clause, "when they shall rise", is omitted in two copies of Beza's, and in the Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, because, perhaps, it might be thought superfluous; but this is agreeably to the way of speaking and writing with the Jews: so in the Targum on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:7">Zechariah 3:7</span>: באחיות מיתיא אחינך, "in the quickening of the dead I will quicken thee"; or, in the resurrection of the dead I will raise thee. The question put on supposition of a resurrection, and that these seven brethren, and the wife they all had should rise, then is,</p>
<p><strong>whose wife shall she be of them</strong>? of the seven brethren;</p>
<p><strong>for the seven had her to wife</strong>. She was, according to law, the lawful wife of all seven; what particular and special claim could one have to her above the rest? <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:7- :">Zechariah 3:7- :</span>.</p>
