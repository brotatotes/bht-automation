And as touching the dead, that they rise,.... For the proof of the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead,have ye not read in the book of Moses; that is, in the law of Moses; for though it was divided into five parts, it was but one book; just as the Psalms are called the Book of Psalms, Acts 1:20, and the Prophets, the Book of the Prophets, Acts 7:42. The book of Exodus is particularly intended; for the passage referred to is in Exodus 3:6,how in the bush God spake unto him, or "out of the bush", as the Syriac and Persic versions read;saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
