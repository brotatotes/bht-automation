<p><strong>And the second is like</strong>,.... "Unto it", as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:39">Matthew 22:39</span> and so it is read here in two ancient copies of Beza's, and in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions;</p>
<p><strong>[namely] this, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself</strong>. This commandment stands in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+19:18">Leviticus 19:18</span> and respects not an Israelite only, or one of the same religion with a man's self, or his intimate friend and acquaintance, or one that lives in the same neighbourhood; but any man whatever, to whom affection should be shown, and good should be done to him, and for him, as a man would have done to and for himself; as much as lies in his power, both in things temporal and spiritual; see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:39">Matthew 22:39</span>.</p>
<p><strong>There is none other commandment greater than these</strong>; in the whole law, moral or ceremonial; not the sabbath, nor circumcision, nor the phylacteries, nor the fringes on the borders of the garments, nor any other.</p>
