<p><strong>And he said unto them in his doctrine</strong>,.... As he was preaching, not to the Scribes and Pharisees but to the multitude, and to his disciples particularly; and to them in the audience of the people, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:1">Matthew 23:1</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Beware of the Scribes</strong>; for though he had just spoken favourably of one of them, this was but a single man, and a singular instance; the body of that set of men, were very bad in their principles and practices, and therefore to be avoided, and that for the reasons following:</p>
<p><strong>which love to go in long clothing</strong>; the Persic version renders it, "who affect to walk in coats and garments conspicuous, and in long robes"; such as were very particular, and different from others, and out of the common way of apparel; and so were observable and taken notice of by others: very likely it may have reference to the common length of their fringes on the borders of their outward garment, which they enlarged beyond others; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:1- :">Matthew 23:1- :</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and [love] salutations the market places</strong>; or "streets", as the Syriac and Arabic versions render it, in any public places, where there was a resort of men, and they were taken notice with respect, in a public manner. The Syriac Persic supply the word "love", as we do from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:6">Matthew 23:6</span>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:6- :">Matthew 23:6- :</span>,</p>
