<p><strong>But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up</strong>,.... Lead to councils and courts of judicature, and deliver up to kings and rulers, to the civil magistrate, to be punished by the secular arm:</p>
<p><strong>take no thought before hand</strong>; be not previously anxious, and carefully solicitous, in a distressing way:</p>
<p><strong>what ye shall speak</strong>: to kings and rulers, by way of apology for yourselves, and your own innocence, and in defence of the Gospel:</p>
<p><strong>neither do ye premeditate</strong>; or "meditate", as the generality of copies read: Beza says in one copy it is read, "premeditate": and so in one of Stephens's, as we render it: this clause is omitted in the Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions:</p>
<p><strong>but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour</strong>; whatever shall be immediately suggested to your thoughts, be put into your minds, and laid upon your hearts:</p>
<p><strong>that speak ye</strong>; freely and boldly without the fear of men:</p>
<p><strong>for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost</strong>: not but that they did speak, but they were not the principal authors, either of the matter they spoke, or of the words and language in which they spoke; they were only the instruments of the Holy Ghost; they spoke as they were moved by him: hence their wisdom and eloquence in their self-defence, were amazing, and their arguments strong and unanswerable; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,</p>
