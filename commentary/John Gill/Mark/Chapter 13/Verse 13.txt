<p><strong>And ye shall be hated of all men</strong>,.... Not only of your friends and relations of your countrymen the Jews; but of all men, the generality of men, in, all nations of the world, wherever they came:</p>
<p><strong>for my name's sake</strong>; for the sake of Christ and his Gospel, they professed and preached:</p>
<p><strong>but he that shall endure</strong>; reproaches, afflictions, and persecutions, patiently; or persevere in the faith of Christ, in the profession of his name, and in preaching his Gospel:</p>
<p><strong>to the end</strong>; of such troubles, and of life:</p>
<p><strong>the same shall be saved</strong>; if not with a temporal, yet with an everlasting salvation; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,</p>
