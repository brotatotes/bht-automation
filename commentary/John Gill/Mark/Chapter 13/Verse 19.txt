<p><strong>For in those days shall be affliction</strong>,.... What with the close siege of the Romans; the fury of the zealots, and seditious; the rage of different parties among the Jews themselves; the ravage of the sword, both within and without, together with dreadful plagues and famines:</p>
<p><strong>such as was not from the beginning of the creation, which God created, unto this time, neither shall be</strong>; of which there never was the like in any age, and cannot be paralleled in any history, since the beginning of time, or the world was made, or any thing in it, down to that period; nor ever will the like befall any one particular nation under the heavens, to the end of the world;</p>
