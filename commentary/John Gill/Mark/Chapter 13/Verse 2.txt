<p><strong>And Jesus answering said unto him</strong>,.... The Persic version reads, "unto them"; and so Beza's most ancient copy but as that question is put by one, the reply is made to him:</p>
<p><strong>seest thou these great buildings</strong>? how beautiful and strong they are. The Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, add the word all; and the sense is, dost thou take a survey of all these buildings, and of the whole of this stately edifice? and dost thou not admire the strength and grandeur of them? and dost thou not think they will be of long duration, and that the demolition of them is scarcely possible?</p>
<p><strong>There shall not be left one stone upon another</strong>. The Syriac and Arabic versions add, "here": as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:9">Matthew 24:9</span>, and so it is read in four of Beza's copies, and in others:</p>
<p><strong>that shall not be thrown down</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:9- :">Matthew 24:9- :</span>.</p>
