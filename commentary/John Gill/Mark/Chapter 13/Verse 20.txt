<p><strong>And except that the Lord had shortened those days</strong>,.... Had determined that those days of affliction should be but few, and not last long; that the siege should not be longer continued, and the devastations within and without be prolonged:</p>
<p><strong>no flesh should be saved</strong>; there would not have been a Jew left; that nation and race of men must have been utterly destroyed from off the face of the earth:</p>
<p><strong>but for elect's sake, whom he hath chosen</strong>; in Christ, unto eternal salvation; who were either then upon the spot, called or uncalled, or that were to spring from in succeeding times:</p>
<p><strong>he hath shortened the days</strong>; he hath determined they shall be but few, that a remnant might be saved, and among them his elect; or from whom should descend, such as he had chosen, who should be saved with an everlasting salvation: though the people in general have been given up to blindness and unbelief, yet they are preserved as a distinct people in the world; and in the latter day will be called and converted, and all Israel shall be saved and therefore it was the will of God to shorten those days of affliction, that they might not be entirely cut off, but that a number might be left, as a stock for future ages; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
