<p><strong>And then shall they see the son of man</strong>,.... Not in person, but in the power of his wrath and vengeance; of which the Jews then had a convincing evidence, and full proof; and even of his being come in the flesh, as if they had seen him in person: this shows, that the sign of the son of man, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span> is the same with the son of man:</p>
<p><strong>coming in the clouds with great power and glory</strong>; not to judgment, but having taken vengeance on the Jewish nation, to set up his kingdom and glory in the Gentile world; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30- :">Matthew 24:30- :</span>.</p>
