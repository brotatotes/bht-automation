<p><strong>Now learn a parable of the fig tree</strong>,.... Our Lord was now upon the Mount of Olives, in one part of which fig trees grew in great plenty, and one, or more, might be near, and in view; and it was the time of year, the passover being at hand, for its putting forth:</p>
<p><strong>when her branch is yet tender</strong>; and soft and opening, through the sap now in motion:</p>
<p><strong>and putteth forth leaves</strong>; from the branches:</p>
<p><strong>ye know, that summer is near</strong>; from such an appearance on the fig tree; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
