<p><strong>So ye, in like manner</strong>,.... This is an accommodation of the parable to the present case:</p>
<p><strong>when ye shall see these things come to pass</strong>; the signs preceding the destruction of Jerusalem, and especially the abomination of desolation, or the Roman army surrounding it:</p>
<p><strong>know that it, or he</strong> is nigh, even at at the doors; either that the destruction of Jerusalem is near; or that the son of man is just ready to come to take vengeance on it; or as Luke says, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:31">Luke 21:31</span>, the kingdom of God is nigh at hand; or a more glorious display of the kingly power of Christ, in the destruction of his enemies, and a greater spread of his Gospel in the Gentile world;</p>
