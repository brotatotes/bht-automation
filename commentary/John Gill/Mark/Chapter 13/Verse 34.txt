[For the son of man is] as a man taking a far journey,.... Or this case of the son of man's coming to take vengeance on the Jewish nation, is like a man that takes a journey into a far country. This puts me in mind of a question asked m by the Jews:"what דרך רחוקה, "a far journey" from Modiim, and without.''from Modiim, according to the Gemara n, and commentators o on this passage, was a place fifteen miles from Jerusalem; so that, according to them, fifteen miles were reckoned a far journey p.Who left his house; and his goods in it, to the care and management of others during his absence:and gave authority to his servants; to govern his house, and exercise power one over another, according to their different stations;and to every man his work; which he was to do, while he was gone, and to give him an account of when he returned:and commanded the porter to watch; his house, and take care that it was not broke open by thieves, and plundered of the substance that was in it. So Christ, when he ascended on high, went to heaven, the land afar off; left his house, his church, particularly in Judea, and at Jerusalem, to the care of his apostles, and gave authority to govern it, according to the laws, rules, and directions prescribed by him; and assigned every man his particular work, for which he gave him proper gifts and abilities; and ordered the porter to be on his watch, not Peter only, but all the apostles and ministers, whose business it is to watch over themselves, and the souls of men committed to their care.m Misn.
