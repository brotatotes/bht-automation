<p><strong>And the first day of unleavened bread</strong>,.... Being come, which was the fourteenth of Nisan:</p>
<p><strong>when they killed the passover</strong>; that is, "the Jews", as the Syriac and Persic versions supply; for any Israelite, that not a priest, might slay it: their canon runs thus x,</p>
<p>"an Israelite kills (the passover), and a priest receives (the blood), and gives it to his neighbour, and his neighbour to his neighbour, and he receives (the basin) full, and returns it empty; the priest that is near to the altar sprinkles it, at one sprinkling, over against the bottom of it.''</p>
<p>Upon which the commentators y observe, that the slaying of the passover by strangers; that is, such as are not priests, lawful. And so Philo the Jew, speaking of the passover, says z;</p>
<p>"at which time the common people do not bring their sacrifices to the altar, and the priests slay; but by the command of the law, συμπαν το εθνος, "the whole nation", does the work of a priest; every one particularly bringing the sacrifices for himself, and then slaying them with his own hands.''</p>
<p>But then it was always killed in the court of the temple, and after the middle of the day; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;</p>
<p><strong>his disciples said unto him, where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that thou mayst eat the passover</strong>: for it was now Thursday morning, and the passover was to be slain after the middle of the day, between the two evenings, and eaten in Jerusalem at night; and they were now at Bethany, near two miles from the city; and it was usual for servants to get ready the passover for their masters;</p>
