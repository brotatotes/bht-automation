And he sendeth forth two of his disciples,.... Peter and John, as appears from Luke 22:8;and saith unto them, go ye into the city; the city of Jerusalem; for there only the passover might be eaten, Deuteronomy 26:2;and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; a servant of the master of the house that was sent for water, to mix with the wine, at the passover:follow him; into the house to which he goes.
