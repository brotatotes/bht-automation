<p><strong>And he sendeth forth two of his disciples</strong>,.... Peter and John, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:8">Luke 22:8</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and saith unto them, go ye into the city</strong>; the city of Jerusalem; for there only the passover might be eaten, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+26:2">Deuteronomy 26:2</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water</strong>; a servant of the master of the house that was sent for water, to mix with the wine, at the passover:</p>
<p><strong>follow him</strong>; into the house to which he goes.</p>
