<p><strong>And wheresoever he shall go in</strong>,.... Into whatsoever house he shall enter, go in after him:</p>
<p><strong>and say ye to the good man of the house</strong>; the owner, and master of it, who might be Nicodemus, or Joseph of Arimathea, or some man of note and wealth in Jerusalem, that might have some knowledge of Christ, and faith in him, though he did not openly profess him; since by only saying what follows, he would at once, as he did, direct them to a suitable and convenient room;</p>
<p><strong>the master saith</strong>. The Syriac and Persic versions read, our master saith: he that is yours, and ours, our master Jesus; though that is not expressed, yet it was understood by the master of the family; which confirms the above conjecture, that he was a secret disciple of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Where is the guest chamber</strong>; the chamber provided for guests that might be expected at the passover:</p>
<p><strong>where I shall eat the passover with my disciples</strong>? where it might be done conveniently, and in a proper and comfortable manner;</p>
