<p><strong>And they began to be sorrowful</strong>,.... And were so, all but Judas, at this saying of Christ's:</p>
<p><strong>and to say unto him, one by one</strong>; even till it came to Judas himself,</p>
<p><strong>is it I</strong>? that shall betray thee;</p>
<p><strong>and another said, is it I</strong>? This clause is wanting in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, and in two of Beza's copies; and indeed seems to be redundant, since the disciples are said before to express themselves in this manner, one by one;</p>
