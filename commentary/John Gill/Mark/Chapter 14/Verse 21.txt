<p><strong>The son of man indeed goeth</strong>,.... Out of this world by death,</p>
<p><strong>as it is written</strong>; both in the book of God's decrees, and in the Scriptures of the Old Testament;</p>
<p><strong>but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed</strong>! whose sin will not be excused, nor lessened by fulfilling the decrees of God, and by accomplishing the prophecies of the Bible:</p>
<p><strong>good were it for that man if he had never been born</strong>; so aggravating will be his crime, so dreadful his punishment; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
