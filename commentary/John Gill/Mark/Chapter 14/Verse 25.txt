<p><strong>Verily I say unto you</strong>,.... This seems, to have been said after the eating of the passover, according to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:18">Luke 22:18</span>, but was, in reality, not till after the Lord's supper was ended, and the last cup was drank, which was wont to be drank at the passover:</p>
<p><strong>I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine</strong>; that is, wine,</p>
<p><strong>until that day that I drink it new</strong>; in a figurative and mystical sense; by which are meant the joys of heaven:</p>
<p><strong>in the kingdom of God</strong>; Father, Son, and Spirit, upon the general resurrection of the dead, when the kingdom of the Mediator will be delivered up, and there will be no distinction of government; but God, Father, Son, and Spirit, will be all in all, and shall reign in the saints, and they with them, to all eternity;</p>
