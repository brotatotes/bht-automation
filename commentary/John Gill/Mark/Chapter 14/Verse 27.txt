<p><strong>And Jesus saith unto them</strong>,.... As they were going to the Mount of Olives. The Persic version reads, in this place; meaning the Mount of Olives, having got thither:</p>
<p><strong>all ye shall be offended because of me this night</strong>;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;</p>
<p><strong>for it is written</strong> in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:7">Zechariah 13:7</span>,</p>
<p><strong>I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered</strong>: Christ is meant by the shepherd, and the apostles by the sheep. The Syriac version reads, "his sheep".</p>
