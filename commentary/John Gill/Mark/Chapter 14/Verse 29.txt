<p><strong>But Peter said unto him</strong>,.... Being greatly moved at what Christ had said, that all of them would be offended with him that night, and run away from him, and be scattered from him, and one another:</p>
<p><strong>although all shall be offended, yet will not I</strong>; though all the rest of the disciples, the other ten, should do as Judas had done, should fall off from Christ, and either betray him, or deny him, or, at least, turn their backs on him, yet he would do neither;</p>
