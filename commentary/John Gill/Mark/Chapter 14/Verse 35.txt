<p><strong>And he went forward a little</strong>,.... About a stone's cast,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:41">Luke 22:41</span>,</p>
<p><strong>and fell on the ground, and prayed</strong>; he fell on his face to the ground, which was a praying posture. One of the Jewish canons concerning it, is this a:</p>
<p>"worshipping, how is it done? after a man has lifted up his head; he bows it five times, he sits upon the ground, and "falls upon his face", ארצה, "to the ground", and supplicates with whatsoever supplication he pleases: worshipping, or bowing, is the stretching out of hands and feet, until a man is found cast upon his face to the ground.''</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:41- :">Luke 22:41- :</span>. The supplication Christ made in this posture was,</p>
<p><strong>that, it were possible, the hour might pass from him</strong>; the time fixed and agreed upon for his sufferings and death; that is, that it might pass without his enduring them, if there was any possibility of excusing him, and of his people's being saved without them;</p>
