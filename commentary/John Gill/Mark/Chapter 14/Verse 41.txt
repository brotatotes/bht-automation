<p><strong>And he cometh the third time</strong>,.... After he had prayed a third time, to the same purport as before:</p>
<p><strong>and saith unto them, sleep on now, and take your rest</strong>; which words are spoken ironically:</p>
<p><strong>it is enough</strong>; or "the end is come"; as the Syriac and Arabic versions render it, of watching and praying:</p>
<p><strong>the hour is come, behold the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners</strong>; both Jews and Gentiles, by one of his own disciples;</p>
