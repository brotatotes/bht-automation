<p><strong>take him, and lead him away safely</strong>; with care and caution, lest he should get out of their hands, and make his escape, as he had sometimes done: the word "safely", is omitted in the Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions. The Vulgate Latin renders it "cautiously", and so does the Syriac version, which joins it to the words, "take him"; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
