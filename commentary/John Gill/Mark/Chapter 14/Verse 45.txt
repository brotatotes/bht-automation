<p><strong>And as soon as he was come</strong>,.... To the place where Jesus was:</p>
<p><strong>he goeth straightway to him</strong>; alone; as if he had nothing to do with the company behind, and as if he was his friend, and concerned for his safety:</p>
<p><strong>and saith, Master, Master</strong>; expressing great affection for him, and respect to him, by repeating this word. The Ethiopic version has it but once, and so two exemplars of Beza's; and the Vulgate Latin reads, "hail, Master", as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:49">Matthew 26:49</span>.</p>
<p><strong>and kissed him</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:49- :">Matthew 26:49- :</span>.</p>
