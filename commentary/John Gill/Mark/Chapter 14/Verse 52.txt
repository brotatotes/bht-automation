<p><strong>And he left the linen cloth</strong>,.... "In their hands", so the Persic version renders it; just as Joseph left his garment in the hands of his mistress, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+39:12">Genesis 39:12</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and fled from them naked</strong>; to the house from whence he came. The Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, leave out the words "from them".</p>
