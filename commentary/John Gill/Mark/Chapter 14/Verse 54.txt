<p><strong>And Peter followed him afar off</strong>,.... And did another disciple, perhaps John; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:15">John 18:15</span>, who having somewhat recovered themselves from their fright, turned back, and followed Jesus, and the company that led him away; keeping at some distance, that they might not be observed, and exposed to danger; and proceeded till they came to Jerusalem, and to the place where the sanhedrim were convened; and the other disciple went in along with Jesus; and Peter afterwards, by his means, got in:</p>
<p><strong>even into the palace of the high priest</strong>; being let in by her that kept the door, at the motion of the other disciple</p>
<p><strong>and he sat with the servants</strong>; as if he was one of them, and had no concern with Jesus:</p>
<p><strong>and warmed himself at the fire</strong>; or "light", as the Greek word signifies, and answers to the Hebrew word אור, by which both: light and fire are expressed; of which, take an instance or two, in the room of many g:</p>
<p>"a murderer that strikes, his neighbour with a stone, or with iron, and plunges him into water, or into האור, "fire", so that he cannot get out, and dies, is guilty.''</p>
<p>Again h, a</p>
<p>"book which האור, "fire", takes hold upon on one side, he puts, water on the other; and if it is quenched, it is quenched; if the "fire" takes hold on both sides, he opens it, and reads in it; and if it is quenched, it is quenched: a cloak which "fire" takes hold upon on one side, he puts water on the other side; and if it is quenched, it is quenched; if the "fire" takes hold on it on both sides, he takes, it and wraps himself in it, and if it is quenched, it is quenched.''</p>
<p>So we read i of אור של גיהנם, "the fire of hell"; and Ur of the Chaldees has its name from the fire, that was worshipped there, as a symbol of the sun: and fire was the אור, or "light", created on the first day, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:3">Genesis 1:3</span>;</p>
