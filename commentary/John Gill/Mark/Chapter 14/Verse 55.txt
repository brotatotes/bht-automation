<p><strong>And the chief priests, and all the council</strong>,.... Especially the former, who were of all most busy and active in this matter:</p>
<p><strong>sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death</strong>; on which they were determined, right or wrong; in this they went contrary to one of their own canons, which runs thus k:</p>
<p>"in pecuniary causes, they begin either for absolution, or condemnation; but in capital causes, they begin for absolution, and do not begin for condemnation.''</p>
<p>That is, they begun with such evidences as tended to acquit a man, and not with such as served to condemn him; whereas this court was only seeking for such evidence to begin with, that they might condemn Jesus to death:</p>
<p><strong>and found none</strong>; that would answer their purpose;</p>
