<p><strong>We heard him say</strong>,.... In a discourse of his, recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span>:</p>
<p><strong>I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands</strong>; which was a very false testimony; for Christ did not say be would destroy any temple at all, only put the Jews on doing it; much less did he point at, or design the temple of Jerusalem, but his own body; nor did he use the distinction of a temple, made with and without hands; nor did he affirm that he would build another; only said, he would raise up in three days, that which they should destroy. By this testimony these witnesses would suggest, that Christ had a design upon their temple to demolish it, and that he must be a sorcerer, or a magician, to pretend to build a temple without hands in three days time;</p>
