<p><strong>why trouble ye her</strong>? why do you grieve her, by charging her with imprudence and extravagance, as if she had been guilty of a very great crime? she is so far from it, that</p>
<p><strong>she hath wrought a good work on me</strong>; she has done me an honour; expressed faith in me, and shown love to me, and ought to be commended, and not reproved; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
