<p><strong>And the high priest stood up in the midst</strong>,.... Of the sanhedrim, of which he was now president: he sat at the head of them, and Ab Beth Din, or the father of the council, at his right hand; and the rest of the council sat before him, in a semicircular form, as the half of a round corn floor, so that the president, and the father of the council, could see them n; for they were all before him, he being situated in the middle, right against them; so that when he stood up, he might be said to stand in the midst of them:</p>
<p><strong>and asked Jesus, saying, answerest thou nothing</strong>? For he had made no reply to the several witnesses, that came against him:</p>
<p><strong>what is it which these witness against thee</strong>? Is it true, or false?</p>
