<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:6">Luke 22:6</span>, fulfilling the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:6">Isaiah 50:6</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and to cover his face</strong>; with a veil, or linen cloth, to blindfold: him, as a person unworthy to behold the light: or rather, in order to make sport with him:</p>
<p><strong>and to buffet him</strong>; with their double fists;</p>
<p><strong>and to say unto him, prophesy</strong>. The Arabic version adds, "unto us, O Christ, who it is that hath buffeted thee now?" that gave thee the last blow? and to the same purpose the Ethiopic. The Persic version adds, "and deliver thyself";</p>
<p><strong>and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands</strong>. The Syriac version renders it, "on his cheeks": they gave him slaps on the face. These were the officers of the high priest, that used him in this indecent manner. This clause is omitted in the Ethiopic version.</p>
