But he denied,.... That he was with Jesus, or a disciple of his:saying, I know not; Jesus of Nazareth: neither understand I what thou sayest; about him, and of being with him: the last phrase, "neither understand I", is omitted in the Syriac and Persic versions:and he went out into the porch; adjoining to the palace, to consider what to do, being surprised and confounded at such a challenge:and the cock crew; the first time, being about midnight; and yet he took no notice of it, nor remembered what Christ had but a few hours before said to him: or if he did, he might hope he should not meet with another attack, or he should have more courage and strength than to deny a second time.
