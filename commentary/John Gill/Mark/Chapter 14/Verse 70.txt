<p><strong>And he denied it again</strong>,.... That he was one of the disciples of Jesus:</p>
<p><strong>and a little after</strong>; about an hour after, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:59">Luke 22:59</span>;</p>
<p><strong>they that stood by, said again to Peter, surely thou art one of them</strong>; one confidently affirmed that he was with Jesus, and another challenged him with seeing him in the garden with him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:59">Luke 22:59</span>, and in general they were of opinion, that he must be one of that sect, giving this as a reason,</p>
<p><strong>for thou art a Galilean</strong>: as they supposed Jesus to be; and knowing that in Galilee he had chiefly preached, and wrought his miracles, and had there a large number of followers:</p>
<p><strong>and thy speech agreeth [thereto]</strong>; he used words and phrases peculiar to the Galileans, and pronounced as they did: <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:59- :">Luke 22:59- :</span>. This clause is omitted in the Vulgate Latin, and is wanting in Beza's most ancient copy; but is in the other copies, and in all the eastern versions.</p>
