<p><strong>shall be preached throughout the whole world</strong>, as it shall be,</p>
<p><strong>[this] also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her</strong>; in remembrance of her, and her work, and in commendation of her faith, love, and duty; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
