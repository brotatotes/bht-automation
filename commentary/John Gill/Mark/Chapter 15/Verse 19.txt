<p><strong>And they smote him on the head with a reed</strong>,.... Or cane, a walking stick which they had put into his hands for a sceptre: this they took out again, and struck him on the head with it, which drove the sharp pointed thorns into his temples:</p>
<p><strong>and did spit upon him</strong>; "upon his face", as the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions read:</p>
<p><strong>and bowing their knees</strong>, as to a sovereign prince,</p>
<p><strong>worshipped him</strong>; saying the above words, hail, king of the Jews?</p>
