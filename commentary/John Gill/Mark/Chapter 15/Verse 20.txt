<p><strong>And when they had mocked him</strong>,.... To their satisfaction, and had had enough of this sort of diversion:</p>
<p><strong>they took off the purple from him</strong>; and so, in their way, unkinged him;</p>
<p><strong>and put his own clothes on him</strong>: both that he might be known to be the same person; and that the four soldiers, who had the charge of him, might have the perquisites of his clothes at his execution:</p>
<p><strong>and led him out to crucify him</strong>: they led him out of the "praetorium", or judgment hall, and through the city, without the gates of it, to the usual place of crucifixion; he bearing his own cross, when first led out.</p>
