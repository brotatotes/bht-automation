<p><strong>And when they had crucified him</strong>,.... Had fastened him to the cross, and reared it up, and he was hanging upon it:</p>
<p><strong>they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take</strong>. This last clause, "what every man should take", is left out in the Arabic version. His garments they divided into four parts; and each soldier, as there were four of them, took a part; and upon his vesture, or seamless coat, because they would not rend it, they cast lots who should have it, and so fulfilled a prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:18">Psalms 22:18</span>;</p>
