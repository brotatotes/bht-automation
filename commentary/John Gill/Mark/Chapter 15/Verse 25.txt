<p><strong>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</strong> The time of the daily sacrifice of the morning, at which the priests ought to have been; and the time when the sanhedrim usually began to sit x; for</p>

<p>but this being an extraordinary case, and they in a hurry to put Jesus to death, had been sitting up all night; and early in the morning had procured the sentence of death on him, which they were going to execute by the time they used to sit: this was about nine o'clock in the morning, and takes in the time between that and twelve at noon. The Ethiopic version reads, "and it was the sixth hour", to make it agree with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:14">John 19:14</span>; and for the reconciling of these two places, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:14- :">John 19:14- :</span>.</p>
