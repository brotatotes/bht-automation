And they that passed by,.... In the road, and went by the cross. The Arabic version adds, "before him", Christ, as he hung on the cross:railed on him, wagging their heads; gave him opprobrious language, and used indecent gestures;and saying, ah! thou that destroyest the temple; the Vulgate Latin version adds, "of God":and buildest it in three days; thou poor vain miserable creature, that boasted of thy power, where art thou now? and what dost thou think of thyself?
