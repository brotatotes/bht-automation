<p><strong>And they that passed by</strong>,.... In the road, and went by the cross. The Arabic version adds, "before him", Christ, as he hung on the cross:</p>
<p><strong>railed on him, wagging their heads</strong>; gave him opprobrious language, and used indecent gestures;</p>
<p><strong>and saying, ah! thou that destroyest the temple</strong>; the Vulgate Latin version adds, "of God":</p>
<p><strong>and buildest it in three days</strong>; thou poor vain miserable creature, that boasted of thy power, where art thou now? and what dost thou think of thyself?</p>
