<p><strong>Let Christ the king of Israel</strong>,.... Who sets up for the Messiah, and whose followers call him the king of Israel, whom the nation expected: and if he is so, let him</p>
<p><strong>descend now from the cross, that we may see</strong>; see him come down, and be eyewitnesses of his power:</p>
<p><strong>and believe</strong>; that he is the Messiah that was prophesied of, and has been waiting for:</p>
<p><strong>and they that were crucified with him reviled him</strong>; that is, the thieves, at least one of them; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
