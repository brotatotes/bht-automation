<p><strong>And when the sixth hour was come</strong>,.... Or twelve o'clock at noon, having hung upon the cross from about the third hour, or nine in the morning:</p>
<p><strong>there was darkness over the, whole land until the ninth hour</strong>; or three o'clock in the afternoon. The Ethiopic version renders the whole thus, "and when it was noon, the sun was darkened, and the whole world was darkened until the ninth hour";</p>
