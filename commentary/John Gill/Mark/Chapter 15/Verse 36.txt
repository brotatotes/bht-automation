<p><strong>And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar</strong>,.... Christ at the same time saying, I thirst; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:28">John 19:28</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and put it on a reed</strong>; an hyssop stalk, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:29">John 19:29</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and gave him to drink</strong>; and so fulfilled a prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:21">Psalms 69:21</span>;</p>
<p><strong>saying</strong>, or "they said", as the Syriac version reads it; not he that fetched the sponge, but the others that were with him, and which agrees with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:27">Matthew 27:27</span>;</p>
<p><strong>let alone</strong>; as forbidding him to go near him, and offer him any thing to drink:</p>
<p><strong>let us see whether Elias will come and take him down</strong>; from the cross; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:27- :">Matthew 27:27- :</span>.</p>
