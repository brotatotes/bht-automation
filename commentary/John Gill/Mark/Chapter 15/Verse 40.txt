There were also women looking on afar off,.... At some distance from the cross, observing what was said and done;among whom was Mary Magdalene; who had received great favours from Christ:and Mary the mother of James the less; or "little", so called to distinguish him from James the son of Zebedee, and because he might be little of stature: nor was it unusual with the Jews to distinguish persons after this manner: so we read z of R. Jesa,זעירא, "the little", and of Samuel, הקטון, "the little" a, which some have thought to be the Apostle Paul, so called from the littleness of his stature:and of Joses; or "Joseph", as the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions read;and Salome; the mother of Zebedee's children, James and John; :-. This was a common name among the Jews; Herod had a sister and a daughter of this name; and the daughter of Herodias, who demanded the head of John, the Baptist, was of this name; and it is the same with Shalom: we read b of one Imme Shalom, or mother Shalom, wife of R. Eliezer, and sister to Rabban Gamaliel. Salome, with the Ethiopians c, is said to be Mary's midwife, and to accompany Christ, with Mary, and Joseph, when they fled into Egypt.z Zohar in Exod. fol. 63. 2. & passim. a T. Bab.
