<p><strong>And now when the even was come</strong>,.... "Of the preparation", as the Syriac version reads; or "the night of the sixth day":, as the Persic version renders it, "Friday" night:</p>
<p><strong>because it was the preparation</strong>; of the passover, and of the sabbath, when they prepared their food, and got it ready for the ensuing sabbath, on which it was not lawful to dress any;</p>
<p><strong>that is, the day before the sabbath</strong>; that is, Friday; on which day, it is clear, Christ suffered, died, and was buried.</p>
