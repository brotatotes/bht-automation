A man of a good aspect, well dressed, and that behaved well and honourably in his office, as a counsellor: he seems to have been a priest, and one of the bench of priests that sat in the high priest's chamber, which is called, לשכת בלווטי, "the chamber of the counsellors" d; with whom he advised there, in matters of moment:which also waited for the kingdom of God; for the coming and kingdom of the Messiah, for the Gospel dispensation, the world to come, the Jews were so much in expectation of.Came and went in boldly unto Pilate; not now ashamed of Christ, or afraid openly to appear in his cause, and declare himself a lover of him, a believer in him, and a disciple of his, though he formerly was:and craved the body of Jesus; desired leave to take it down from the cross, and bury it;  :-.d T. Bab. Yoma, fol. 3. 2. & Hieros. Yoma, fol. 38. 3.
