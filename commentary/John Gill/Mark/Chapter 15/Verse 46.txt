<p><strong>And he bought fine linen</strong>,.... That is, Joseph, as is expressed in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Persic versions; which, when he had done, as is highly probable, in the city of Jerusalem, he went to Mount Calvary,</p>
<p><strong>and took him down</strong>; took the body of Christ down from the cross; though, no doubt, with the assistance of others, or by others, and not he himself, at least not alone:</p>
<p><strong>and wrapped him in the linen</strong>; wound him up in it, as was the manner of the Jews; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and laid him in a sepulchre, which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre</strong>;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
