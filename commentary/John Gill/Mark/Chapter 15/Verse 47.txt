Or Joseph, as the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions read:beheld where he was laid: very likely they saw Joseph, and his men, take him down from the cross, and they followed him, and observed where he laid him; or, as the Ethiopic version reads, "where they buried him"; placing themselves, as Matthew suggests, right "over against the sepulchre", Matthew 27:61; so that they were witnesses of his death, and of his burial, as they afterwards were of his resurrection from the dead.
