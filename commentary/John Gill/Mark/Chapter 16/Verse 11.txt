<p><strong>And they, when they had heard that he was alive</strong>,.... That is, the apostles, and those that were with them; when they heard the report of Mary Magdalene, that Christ was raised from the dead, and was certainly alive; or of all the women, for the Syriac version reads, "when they heard them saying that he was alive", not only Mary Magdalene, but Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women; for these all related this to the apostles, and the rest; see</p>

<p><strong>And had been seen of her</strong>; of Mary Magdalene, or "of them"; as the Syriac version reads, and as it is read in one of Beza's copies:</p>
<p><strong>they believed not</strong>; the words of Mary, and the other women, for they seemed as idle tales to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:11">Luke 24:11</span>, imagining they were deceived with the sight of a spectre, or apparition; and fearing the news were too good and great to be true; forgetting the words of their Lord, that he should rise again the third day, and which had been so often repeated to them; and all this through stupidity of mind, occasioned by the trouble and consternation they were in.</p>
