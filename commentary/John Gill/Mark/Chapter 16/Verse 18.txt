<p><strong>They shall take up serpents</strong>,.... The Arabic version adds, "in their own hands"; and in an ancient manuscript of Beza's it is read, "in the hands"; so the Apostle Paul had a viper, which fastened and hung on his hand, which he shook off, without receiving any harm from it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:3">Acts 28:3</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them</strong>; not that they were hereby warranted to drink poison, to show what power they had; but should they accidentally drink it, or rather should they be forced to it by their enemies in order to destroy them, they should find no hurt by it: and Papias x reports of Barsabas, surnamed Justus, who was put up with Matthias for the apostleship, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:23">Acts 1:23</span>, that he drank a poisonous draught, and by the grace of the Lord, received no hurt: and the Jews themselves report y, that</p>
<p>"a son of R. Joshua ben Levi, swallowed something hurtful; and one came and whispered to him in the name of Jesus, the son of Pandira (so they call our Lord), and he did well.''</p>
<p>It follows,</p>
<p><strong>and they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover</strong>; as the Apostle Paul did on the father of Publius, who was thereby healed of a fever, and a bloody flux, and also others, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:8">Acts 28:8</span>; nay, some were healed by the shadow of Peter, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:15">Acts 5:15</span>, and others, by handkerchiefs and aprons taken from the body of Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:12">Acts 19:12</span>. The Persic version adds, without any authority, "whatsoever ye ask in my name, shall be given unto you".</p>
