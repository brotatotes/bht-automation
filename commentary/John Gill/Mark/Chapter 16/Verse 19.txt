<p><strong>So then, after the Lord</strong>,.... The Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions add, "Jesus"; and the Ethiopic version reads, "our Lord, the Lord Jesus"; and both Syriac and Persic read, "our Lord"; which is common in these versions, where the word "Lord" is used:</p>
<p><strong>had spoken unto them</strong>; the disciples, the above words, which commissioned them where to go, what to do, and what to say; and what should follow them, for the confirmation of their mission and doctrine:</p>
<p><strong>he was received up into heaven</strong>; in a cloud, angels attending him, and devils led captive by him, and with a welcome into his Father's presence:</p>
<p><strong>and sat on the right hand of God</strong>; the Ethiopic version adds, "his own Father", and which is an evidence of his having done his work, and that to full satisfaction; and is an honour never conferred on angels, or any mere creature; and is a peculiar dignity conferred on the human nature of Christ, in union with his divine person; and here he will remain, till his second coming.</p>
