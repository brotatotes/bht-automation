<p><strong>And very early in the morning, the first day of the week</strong>,.... <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p><strong>They came to the sepulchre at the rising of the sun</strong>; of the sun of righteousness, as Mr. Mede observes; or rather, of the natural sun: for though it was dark when they set out, and when it dawned towards the first day, yet by that time that they all got to the sepulchre, the sun was rising; the Jews say g, that</p>
<p>"from the ascending of the morning, or break of day, until the sun rises, is an hour and a half.''</p>
<p>And so much time may very well be allowed the women, from their setting out, to their coming to the sepulchre. Moreover, they say h, that</p>
<p>"from the hind of the morning, to the time the east is enlightened, a man may walk four miles, and from the time that the east is enlightened, עד שתנץ החמה, "until the sun rises", four miles.''</p>
<p>But women must not be thought to walk so fast: let it be observed, that Christ, who is called the hind of the morning, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:1">Psalms 22:1</span> (title, "Aijeleth Shahar"), and the morning star, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:16">Revelation 22:16</span>, rose at this time.</p>
