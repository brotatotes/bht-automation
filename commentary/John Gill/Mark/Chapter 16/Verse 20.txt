<p><strong>And they went forth</strong>,.... After this the apostles went forth, from Galilee to Jerusalem; and on the day of pentecost, they appeared publicly, and preached the Gospel in divers languages; and after the death of Stephen, and the persecution raised upon that, they went forth from Jerusalem; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:3">Isaiah 2:3</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And preached every where</strong>; not only in Judea, and in the neighbouring countries, but all over the world, in process of time:</p>
<p><strong>the Lord working with them</strong>; making their ministry useful, for the conviction and conversion of large multitudes, and for the forming and settling abundance of Gospel churches, and for the comfort and edification of the saints; all which was done, by the power and grace of Christ, without whom they could do nothing; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And confirming the word with signs following</strong>; the Arabic version adds "them"; or "which they did", as the Syriac and Persic versions render it; not by their own power, but, as the latter of these versions adds, "by the help of our Lord"; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:4">Hebrews 2:4</span>; to all which, the evangelist puts his</p>
<p><strong>Amen</strong>; so let it be, or so it shall be, and so it was.</p>
