<p><strong>But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter</strong>,.... Peter is particularly mentioned, not as distinct from the apostles, or as if he was not one of them, having sinned in the manner he had done; much less because he was the chief of them; but to comfort him in his great sorrow, on account of his fall; and to encourage him to meet Christ with the rest of his disciples, who might be both afraid and ashamed, because he had so basely denied him: this is a kind intimation, in favour of Peter; none of the other evangelists observe it; but this Gospel being published, as is thought by some, under the direction and examination of Peter himself, he was careful to relate every thing, that either aggravated his own crime, or illustrated the grace of God, and love of Christ towards him. The Persic version puts Peter first, rendering it, "say to Cephas and the rest of the disciples"; all copies, and other versions, put him last:</p>
<p><strong>that he goeth before you into Galilee, there shall ye see him</strong>;</p>

<p><strong>as he said unto you</strong>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:28">Mark 14:28</span>.</p>
