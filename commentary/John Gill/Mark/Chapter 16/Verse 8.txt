<p><strong>And they went out quickly</strong>,.... Out of the sepulchre, into which they had been, to see where Christ lay, as invited by the angel, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:6">Mark 16:6</span>. The word "quickly", is not read in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions: "which when they heard"; that is, when they heard the angel's and instructions, immediately they went out:</p>
<p><strong>and fled from the sepulchre</strong>; as surprised and affrighted:</p>
<p><strong>for they trembled and were amazed</strong>; at what they saw and heard, and yet this dread and fear were mixed with joy at the news of Christ's resurrection, as Matthew relates, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:8">Matthew 28:8</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Neither said they any thing to any man</strong>; they met with by the way, till they came to the disciples; to whom they told all, otherwise they would not have acted according to the angel's orders</p>
<p><strong>for they were afraid</strong>; not only affrighted with what they had seen and heard, but the were afraid to tell any but the disciples of these things, for fear of the Jews; lest they should be thought to have stolen the body of Christ, and so be taken up on that account, and punished.</p>
