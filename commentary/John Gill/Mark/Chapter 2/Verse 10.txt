As there is an emphasis lies on the phrase, "the son of man", suggesting, that his being so was no contradiction to his deity, nor any hindrance to the exertion of his power; so there is another on those words, "upon earth"; intimating, that though he was upon earth, in a very low estate, in a state of humiliation, yet he had the same power to forgive sin as in heaven; his humbling himself in human nature did not strip him of his perfections, power, and prerogative as God: and if he had power on earth to forgive sin, there can be no room to doubt of it now he is in heaven; since as mediator, he is "exalted to be a prince, and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:31">Acts 5:31</span>, And that it might appear he had such a power on earth,</p>
<p><strong>he saith to the sick of the palsy</strong>; turning to, and addressing him in the following words, with great majesty, authority, and power;</p>
