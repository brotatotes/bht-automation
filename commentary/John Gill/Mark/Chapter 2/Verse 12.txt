And immediately he arose,.... Power going along with the words of Christ, he found himself perfectly well; and at once sprung up from off his bed,and took up his bed, upon his shoulders, with all the ease imaginable:and went forth before them all: the Scribes and Pharisees, and the whole multitude of the people, who were eyewitnesses of this wonderful cure: or "against them all"; for being strong and robust, he made his way through the crowd, with his bed on his back;insomuch that they were all amazed; at the power of Christ, and the strength of the man:and glorified God, saying, we never saw it on this fashion; or any thing like this in our days.

We never read of their praising God, and glorifying him for any thing that was done by Christ; but generally went away, after a miracle, hardened, and full of spite and malice, going and consulting together how to take away his life.
