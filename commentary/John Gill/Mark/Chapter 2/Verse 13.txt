<p><strong>And he went forth again by the sea side</strong>,.... The sea of Galilee, where he had met with, and called Peter and Andrew, James and John; and not far from which were the solitary place, and the desert places, where he was before he entered into Capernaum:</p>
<p><strong>and all the multitude resorted unto him</strong>; who had been with him at Peter's house, and about the door, and those who could not get near him:</p>
<p><strong>and he taught them</strong>; the word of God, the Gospel, and the doctrines of it.</p>
