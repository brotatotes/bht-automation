And he went forth again by the sea side,.... The sea of Galilee, where he had met with, and called Peter and Andrew, James and John; and not far from which were the solitary place, and the desert places, where he was before he entered into Capernaum:and all the multitude resorted unto him; who had been with him at Peter's house, and about the door, and those who could not get near him:and he taught them; the word of God, the Gospel, and the doctrines of it.
