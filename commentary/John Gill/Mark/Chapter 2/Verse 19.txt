<p><strong>And Jesus said unto them</strong>,.... Both to John's disciples and the Pharisees,</p>
<p><strong>can the children of the bride chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them</strong>? Suggesting that he was the bridegroom, as John their master had called him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:29">John 3:29</span>, and that his disciples were the children of the bride chamber; and that it was very unsuitable for them, and very unreasonable to desire them to fast at such a time, and under such a character: wherefore the answer returned by Christ himself to the question is,</p>
<p><strong>as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast</strong>: all which the Syriac version expresses by לא, "no": <strong>see Gill "Mt 9:15"</strong>.</p>
