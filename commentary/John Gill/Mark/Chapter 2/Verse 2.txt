<p><strong>And straightway many were gathered together</strong>,.... From all parts of the city,</p>
<p><strong>insomuch that there was no room to receive them</strong>; in the house: by which it should seem to be a large one, though not large enough to hold such a numerous company as were got together:</p>
<p><strong>no, not so much as about the door</strong>; or the places before the door, the porch, the court, or courtyard. The crowd was so great, that neither the house, nor the out places before, could hold them, nor could they come even near the door;</p>
<p><strong>and he preached the word unto them</strong>. The Ethiopic version renders it, "he spake his own word to them that came to him"; he preached the Gospel, the word of grace and truth, of life and salvation, to as many as could come near him, and were within the hearing of him. To me it seems, that our Lord went up into an upper room, and out of the window preached to the people, that were, in great numbers, without doors; and the following narrative seems to confirm this conjecture.</p>
