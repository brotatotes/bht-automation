<p><strong>And he entered again into the synagogue</strong>,.... Perhaps in Capernaum, where he had before cast out the unclean spirit; but not on the same day, nor on that day he had had the debate with the Pharisees, about his disciples plucking the ears of corn on the sabbath day; but on another sabbath, perhaps the next; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:6">Luke 6:6</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And there was a man there which had a withered hand</strong>; who came there either for a cure, knowing Christ to be in the synagogue, or for the sake of worship; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:6- :">Luke 6:6- :</span>.</p>
