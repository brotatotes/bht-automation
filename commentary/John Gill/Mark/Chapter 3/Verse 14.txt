<p><strong>And he ordained twelve</strong>,.... Or made, constituted, and appointed twelve men, out of those he called to him. The Arabic version adds, "and called them apostles"; which seems to be taken out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13">Luke 6:13</span>.</p>
<p><strong>That they should be with him</strong>; constantly, in private and in public; be taken into his family, and reckoned such; be his familiars, and privy to all his affairs; hear all his discourses, and see his miracles; that so they might be trained up and fitted for the great work he designed them for:</p>
<p><strong>and that he might send them forth to preach</strong>; the Gospel in Judea first, and then in all the world: for he did not at this time send them to preach, only chose; called, and appointed them; and after they had been with him some time, and were better qualified for such service, he sent them forth, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:1">Matthew 10:1</span>, for this constitution of them was before that mission, and was in order to it.</p>
