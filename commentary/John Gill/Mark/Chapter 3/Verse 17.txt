<p><strong>And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James</strong>,.... These are mentioned next, as being first called after Peter and Andrew:</p>
<p><strong>and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, the sons of thunder</strong>: either because of their loud and sonorous voice; or their warm zeal for Christ, and fervency in their ministry: or for their courage in opposing the enemies of Christ, and the power that went along with their words; which either put to confusion and silence, or issued in conviction and conversion. The Syriac version reads, "Benai Regesh", and the Persic, "Beni Reg'sch". The Jews, as our learned countryman Mr. Broughton has observed w, sometimes pronounce "Scheva" by on, as Noabyim", for "Nebyim"; so here, "Boanerges" for Benereges", or "Benerges". There is a city which was in the tribe of Dan, mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jos+19:45">Joshua 19:45</span>, which is called "Bene-berak, the sons of lightning"; and is spoken of in the Jewish x writings, as a place where several of the Rabbins met, and conversed together: the reason of this name may be inquired after.</p>
