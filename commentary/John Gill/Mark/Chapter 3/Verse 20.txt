<p><strong>And the multitude coming together again</strong>,.... Either the multitude that were about the door of this house; insomuch that there was no room about, nor any coming near it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:2">Mark 2:2</span>, or the multitude that came from different parts, and had thronged about him at the sea side, before he went up into the mountain: these understanding that he was come down from thence, and was returned to Capernaum, and was at Simon's house, flocked thither, in great numbers, to see his person, hear his doctrines, and observe his miracles;</p>
<p><strong>so that they could not so much as eat bread</strong>; the press was so great, and their importunities so urgent, either to hear him preach, or have their sick healed, that Christ, and his disciples, had neither room nor opportunity to eat some food for the refreshment of nature; though it was very necessary, and high time they had, especially Christ, who had been up all night, which he had spent in prayer; and had been very busy that morning in calling and appointing his apostles, and instructing them what they should do.</p>
