<p><strong>And if Satan rise up against himself</strong>,.... As he must do in such a case as this, if devils are cast out by Beelzebub, the prince of devils:</p>
<p><strong>and be divided</strong>; one devil against another, as the above calumny supposes;</p>
<p><strong>he cannot stand, but hath an end</strong>: his kingdom cannot stand long, but must soon come to an end; his power and authority will soon be destroyed, both over his own species, and among men;</p>
