<p><strong>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost</strong>,.... Against his person, and the works performed by him, by ascribing them to diabolical power and influence, as the Scribes did,</p>
<p><strong>hath never forgiveness</strong>: there is no pardon provided in the covenant of grace, nor obtained by the blood of Christ for such persons, or ever applied to them by the Spirit;</p>
<p><strong>but is in danger of eternal damnation</strong>. The Vulgate Latin reads it, and so it is read in an ancient copy of Beza's, guilty of an eternal sin; a sin which can never be blotted out, and will never be forgiven, but will be punished with everlasting destruction;</p>
