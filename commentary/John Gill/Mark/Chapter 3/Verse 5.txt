<p><strong>And when he had looked round about on them</strong>,.... In the several parts of the synagogue; for there were many of them on every side of him; which he might do, to observe their countenances, which might justly fall, upon such a close question put to them, and what answer they would return to him: and his look upon them was</p>
<p><strong>with anger</strong>, with a stern countenance, which showed indignation at them, though without sin, or any desire of revenge, for the evil they were meditating against him; for at the same time he had pity and compassion for them,</p>
<p><strong>being grieved for the hardness of their hearts</strong>: or "the blindness of their hearts", as the Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions render it; being troubled in his human soul, both at their inhumanity and cruelty to a miserable object, whose cure, in their opinion, would have been a breach of the sabbath; and to himself, having a malicious design against him, should he perform it; and at their stupidity and ignorance of the law of God, the nature and design of the sabbath, and of their duty to God, and their fellow creatures: wherefore as one not to be intimidated by their evil designs against him, or prevented thereby from doing good,</p>
<p><strong>he saith unto the man, stretch forth thine hand</strong>; that is, the lame one; and such power went along with his words, as at once effected a cure:</p>
<p><strong>and he stretched it out, and his hand was restored whole as the other</strong>. This last clause, "whole as the other", is not in the Vulgate Latin, nor in the Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions; and may be added from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:13">Matthew 12:13</span>; see the note there; since it is wanting in the Alexandrian copy, and in Beza's most ancient copy, and in others.</p>
