But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea,.... Knowing their evil designs against him, he departed out of the synagogue, and city of Capernaum; and taking his disciples with him, he went to the shore of the sea of Galilee; not out of fear, but because his time was not yet come, and he had more work to do:and a great multitude from Galilee: from the several parts of it, in which country he now was:and from Judea: that part of the land of Israel, which was particularly so called, and belonged to the tribe of Judah.
