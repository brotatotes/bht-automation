<p><strong>But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea</strong>,.... Knowing their evil designs against him, he departed out of the synagogue, and city of Capernaum; and taking his disciples with him, he went to the shore of the sea of Galilee; not out of fear, but because his time was not yet come, and he had more work to do:</p>
<p><strong>and a great multitude from Galilee</strong>: from the several parts of it, in which country he now was:</p>
<p><strong>and from Judea</strong>: that part of the land of Israel, which was particularly so called, and belonged to the tribe of Judah.</p>
