<p><strong>And he began again to teach by the sea side</strong>,.... He went out of the house where he was at Capernaum, the same day he had the above discourse with the Scribes and Pharisees, and on which his mother and: brethren came to speak with him; and from thence he went where he had been before, and taught the people; namely, to the sea side, the shore of the sea of Galilee, or Tiberias:</p>
<p><strong>and there was gathered unto him a great multitude</strong>; which followed him from the house, and from other parts of the city, and perhaps from the adjacent places:</p>
<p><strong>so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea</strong>; in the ship at sea, at some little distance from the shore; the sea of Tiberias being rather a lake, and within land, had no tide, and so was still and quiet:</p>
<p><strong>and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land</strong>; stood on the land, all along the sea shore; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,</p>
