<p><strong>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown</strong>,.... Such hearers are represented by the way side, in which the seed fell; who, coming where the Gospel is preached, stop awhile and hear it, and so are only casual and accidental hearers of it:</p>
<p><strong>but when they have heard</strong>; and indeed whilst they are hearing, and before they are well got out of the place of hearing,</p>
<p><strong>Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts</strong>. The devil, signified by the fowl, or fowls of the air, immediately takes notice of such hearers, and is very busy with them; filling their minds with other things suitable to their dispositions, and setting before them other objects, whereby their minds are, at once, taken off from what they have been hearing; so that all that they have observed, and laid up in their memories, is lost at once, and never thought of any more.</p>
