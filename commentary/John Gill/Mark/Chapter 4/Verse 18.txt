<p><strong>And these are they that are sown among thorns</strong>,.... Such hearers of the word are designed by the thorny ground, upon which other seed fell, as it was sown, who are of worldly dispositions; who are immoderately careful and anxious about the things of this life, and are bent upon acquiring earthly riches, and gratifying their carnal and sensual appetites:</p>
<p><strong>such as hear the word</strong>; who notwithstanding are prevailed upon through custom, or the dictates of their consciences, to attend upon the ministry of the word.</p>
