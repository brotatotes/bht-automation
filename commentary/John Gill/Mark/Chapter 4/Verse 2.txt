<p><strong>And he taught them many things by parables</strong>,.... As he sat in the ship, and they stood on shore;</p>
<p><strong>and said unto them in his doctrine</strong>; as he was teaching them, and delivering unto them the doctrine he had received from his Father: though the Jews say c, that</p>
<p>"the Israelites will have no need לתלמודו של מלך משיח, "of the doctrine of the king Messiah, in the time to come"; because it is said, "unto him shall the Gentiles seek", and not the Israelites.''</p>
<p>But it appears from hence, and many other places, that the Israelites both stood in need of his doctrine, and sought after it; and very excellent it was; the doctrine of God, and of the grace of God; and was spoken with authority, and in such a manner as never man spake, and which he delivered to his apostles; and which, if ministers bring not with them, should not be bid God speed.</p>
