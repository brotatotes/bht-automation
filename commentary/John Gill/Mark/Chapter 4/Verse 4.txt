<p><strong>And it came to pass, as he sowed</strong>,.... Whilst he was preaching the, Gospel, casting about the precious seed of the word, he was laden with:</p>
<p><strong>some fell by the way side</strong>; the common beaten path: the word was dispensed among some men comparable to it, on whom it lighted, but made no impression; there it lay, though not long, and was not inwardly received, and took no root, and consequently was of no effect:</p>
<p><strong>and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up</strong>; the devils, who have their abode in the air, especially the prince of the posse of them; and the Syriac version reads it in the singular number, "and the fowl came"; that ravenous bird of prey, Satan, who goes about seeking what he may devour; and for this purpose attends where the word is preached, to hinder its usefulness as much as in him lies.</p>
