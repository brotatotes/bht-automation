And they feared exceedingly,.... That is, the men in the ship, the mariners to whom the ship belonged, and who had the management of it:and said to one another, as persons in the greatest amazement,what manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? Surely this person must not be a mere man; he must be more than a man; he must be truly God, that has such power over the wind and sea. This best suits with the mariners, since the disciples must have known before, who and what he was; though they might be more established and confirmed in the truth of Christ's deity, by this wonderful instance of his power.
