<p><strong>And some fell on stony ground</strong>,.... The word was preached to some persons who had hearts of stone, and which remained so:</p>
<p><strong>where it had not much earth</strong>; and so could be received only in a notional and superficial way, but could take no place, so as to produce any good effect:</p>
<p><strong>and immediately it sprung up</strong>; a sudden and hasty profession of the word was made, without a powerful experience of it:</p>
<p><strong>because it had no depth of earth</strong>; if it had, it would have been longer in coming up; more work would have been done by it, which would have required more time, before a profession of it had been made.</p>
