And some fell on stony ground,.... The word was preached to some persons who had hearts of stone, and which remained so:where it had not much earth; and so could be received only in a notional and superficial way, but could take no place, so as to produce any good effect:and immediately it sprung up; a sudden and hasty profession of the word was made, without a powerful experience of it:because it had no depth of earth; if it had, it would have been longer in coming up; more work would have been done by it, which would have required more time, before a profession of it had been made.
