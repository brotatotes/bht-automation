And behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,.... Having heard of his return, and where he was; :-.Jairus by name; in Hebrew יאיר, "Jair": and Jerom says n, it signifies "enlightening", or "enlightened": deriving it fromאור, "to be light": and it is no doubt a Jewish name, since he was a ruler of the synagogue; and besides, it is often mentioned in the Old Testament, and particularly in Esther 2:5, where, in the Septuagint, it is read, Ιαιρος, Jairus. Matthew makes no mention of his name; but both Mark and Luke do, Mark 5:22.And when he saw him, he fell at his feet: as soon as he came into his presence; though he was a person of such authority; yet having heard much of the doctrine and miracles of Christ, and believing him to be a great prophet, and man of God; though he might not know that he was the Messiah, and truly God, threw himself at his feet; and, as Matthew says, "worshipped him", Matthew 9:18; showed great reverence and respect unto him, gave him homage, at least in a civil way, though he might not adore him as God.n De Hebr.
