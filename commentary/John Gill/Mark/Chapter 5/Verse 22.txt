<p><strong>Jairus by name</strong>; in Hebrew יאיר, "Jair": and Jerom says n, it signifies "enlightening", or "enlightened": deriving it from</p>
<p>אור, "to be light": and it is no doubt a Jewish name, since he was a ruler of the synagogue; and besides, it is often mentioned in the Old Testament, and particularly in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="es+2:5">Esther 2:5</span>, where, in the Septuagint, it is read, Ιαιρος, Jairus. Matthew makes no mention of his name; but both Mark and Luke do, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:22">Mark 5:22</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And when he saw him, he fell at his feet</strong>: as soon as he came into his presence; though he was a person of such authority; yet having heard much of the doctrine and miracles of Christ, and believing him to be a great prophet, and man of God; though he might not know that he was the Messiah, and truly God, threw himself at his feet; and, as Matthew says, "worshipped him", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:18">Matthew 9:18</span>; showed great reverence and respect unto him, gave him homage, at least in a civil way, though he might not adore him as God.</p>
