<p><strong>And besought him greatly</strong>,.... Used much importunity with him, and was very urgent in his requests:</p>
<p><strong>saying, my little daughter lieth at the point of death</strong>, or "is in the last extremity"; just breathing out her last; for she was not actually dead when he left her, though she was before he returned, and was at this time, as he might expect, expiring, or really gone;</p>

<p><strong>[I pray thee] come and lay thine hands on her, that she may be healed, and she shall live</strong>; expressing faith in the power of Christ to restore his daughter, though in the utmost extremity; yet seemed to think his presence, and the imposition of his hands were necessary to it.</p>
