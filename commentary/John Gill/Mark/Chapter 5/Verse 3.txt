Who had his dwelling among the tombs,.... Which is one of the characters of a madman among the Jews; who say it is q"the sign of a madman, that he goeth out in the night, הקברותוהלן בבית, "and lodges among the tombs", and rends his garments, and loses what is given to him.''The same they say, in the same place, of an hypochondriac, and melancholy man; and of Kordiacus, which they give out r is a demon that possesses, and has power over some sort of persons:and no man could bind him, no, not with chains; so as to hold him for any length of time: not only cords were insufficient to hold, but even chains of iron; so strong was he through the possession; for this could not be by his own natural strength.q T. Hieros. Gittin, fol. 48. 3. & Trumot, fol. 40. 2. r Jarchi & Bartenora in Misn. Gittin, c. 7. sect. 1.
