<p><strong>Who had his dwelling among the tombs</strong>,.... Which is one of the characters of a madman among the Jews; who say it is q</p>
<p>"the sign of a madman, that he goeth out in the night, הקברות</p>
<p>והלן בבית, "and lodges among the tombs", and rends his garments, and loses what is given to him.''</p>
<p>The same they say, in the same place, of an hypochondriac, and melancholy man; and of Kordiacus, which they give out r is a demon that possesses, and has power over some sort of persons:</p>
<p><strong>and no man could bind him, no, not with chains</strong>; so as to hold him for any length of time: not only cords were insufficient to hold, but even chains of iron; so strong was he through the possession; for this could not be by his own natural strength.</p>
