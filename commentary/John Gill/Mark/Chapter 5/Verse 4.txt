<p><strong>Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains</strong>,.... Trial had been made several times, to no purpose; his arms had been bound with chains, and his feet with fetters, which was very proper to prevent doing hurt to himself, and injury to others:</p>
<p><strong>and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces</strong>; as if they had been twine threads; such was his strength, through the force of madness, and the possession of Satan, and his diabolical influence:</p>
<p><strong>neither could any man tame him</strong>; by any methods whatever; even such who undertook the cure of madness, or to exorcise those that were possessed: this man was so furious and outrageous, that he was not to be managed any way, either by art or force.</p>
