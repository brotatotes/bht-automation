<p><strong>but when he had put them all out</strong>: of the house, or that part of it where he was; that is, ordered them to depart, with the leave and consent of the master of the house:</p>

<p><strong>and entereth in where the damsel was lying</strong>; into an inner room, where the child was laid out on a bed.</p>
