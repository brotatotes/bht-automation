<p><strong>And straightway the damsel arose, and walked</strong>,.... As soon as ever the above words were pronounced by Christ, such divine power went along with them, that the child returned to life; and raised herself up from the bed, got off of it, and walked about the room in perfect health and strength:</p>
<p><strong>for she was of the age of twelve years</strong>; and so, when alive and well, was able to walk; though one of this age was called a little one, as this is by another evangelist; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,</p>
<p><strong>and they were astonished with a great astonishment</strong>; they were exceedingly amazed at such a signal instance of the power of our Lord, even both the parents of the child, and the disciples of Christ.</p>
