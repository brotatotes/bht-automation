<p><strong>And he went out from thence</strong>,.... From Capernaum;</p>
<p><strong>and came into his own country</strong>; or "city", as the Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions read, the city of Nazareth; so called because it was the place where Christ was conceived, and where he was educated; for which he had a regard, and was willing it should partake of the benefit of his doctrine and miracles:</p>
<p><strong>and his disciples follow him</strong>; as they did wherever he went; and which is a true characteristic of a disciple of Jesus.</p>
