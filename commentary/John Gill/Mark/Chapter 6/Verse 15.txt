<p><strong>Others said that it is Elias</strong>,.... This was the opinion, either of many of the Jews, who expected that Elias the Tishbite would come in person, before the coming of the Messiah; and thought by the appearance and wonderful works of Jesus, that he was now come: or of Herod's courtiers, who said this to divert him from his notion of John the Baptist, which they might perceive was very distressing to him; though the former seems rather to be the sense:</p>
<p><strong>others said, that it is a prophet</strong>: or "the prophet", that was to come, whom Moses had spoken of, and the Jews expected; this was the opinion of others of them: or</p>
<p><strong>as one of the prophets</strong>. The word Î·, "or", is left out in some copies; and so it is in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions; and then the sense is, this new prophet lately raised up, is as one of the old prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others; or one of them had risen up.</p>
