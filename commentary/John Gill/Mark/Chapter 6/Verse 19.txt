<p><strong>Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him</strong>,.... Was angry with him, conceived wrath, and laid up hatred against him, and was an adversary to him; which is the sense of the Oriental versions. She bore him an inward grudge, and lay in wait to take the first opportunity of dispatching him:</p>
<p><strong>and would have killed him, but she could not</strong>; being hindered by Herod, who as yet would not suffer it; partly through fear of the people, and partly through the respect he had for John.</p>
