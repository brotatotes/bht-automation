And when the sabbath day was come,.... For it seems that it was on a weekday, or on one of the common days of the week, that he entered into the city, where he remained without making himself known, till the sabbath day came: and thenhe began to teach in the synagogue; that is, at Nazareth; where he expounded the law and the prophets, and preached the Gospel:and many hearing [him] were astonished. The Vulgate Latin adds, "at his doctrine"; and so it is read in Beza's most ancient copy:saying, from whence hath this man these things? This skill of explaining Scripture, this doctrine which he teaches, and these miracles he is said to work? This question they the rather put, because they had known him from the beginning: he had lived long among them, and they knew he had not learnt of men, and therefore wondered how he came by such things as these:and what wisdom is this which is given to him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands? which were but the other day employed in servile work, and mechanical operations.
