To the hall, where Herod and his guests were, after supper was over; or rather, whilst at it: she is called the daughter of Herodias, and not of Herod; she having had her not by him, but by his brother Philip: her name is thought to be Salome; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,</p>
<p><strong>and danced and pleased Herod, and them that were with him</strong>; at supper, his lords, captains, and principal men in his dominions;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The king said unto the damsel, ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee</strong>; which shows how exceedingly pleased he was; and the more, in that she gave such general pleasure to his whole company.</p>
