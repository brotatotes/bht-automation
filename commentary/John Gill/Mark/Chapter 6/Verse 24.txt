<p><strong>And she went forth and said unto her mother</strong>,.... The king having made such a promise to her, and annexed his oath to it, she thought proper before she asked any thing of him, to withdraw from the hall and company, and consider with herself, and consult with her mother, who was not at the entertainment; it being not usual in those eastern countries, for women to sit at table, at any grand festival: to whom she reported the offer the king had made, and desired she would be pleased to direct her, what request to make saying,</p>
<p><strong>what shall I ask</strong>? To which her mother made answer, without taking any further time to think of it, being prepared for it, and determined in her mind, whenever she had an opportunity of asking a favour of the king, what it should be:</p>
<p><strong>and she said, the head of John the Baptist</strong>. So sweet is revenge, that to have her will on that great and good man, was more to her, than to have half the king's dominions.</p>
