<p><strong>And the apostles gathered themselves together</strong>,.... The twelve apostles of Christ, whom he had sent out, two by two, into different parts, having gone through them, and finished the embassy, they were sent about, met together in one place, and came in a body together,</p>
<p><strong>unto Jesus</strong>; their Lord and master, who had sent them, and to whom they were accountable, as all the ministers of the Gospel are:</p>
<p><strong>and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught</strong>; they gave him an exact and full account of what miracles were wrought by them, what diseases they had cured, and what a number of devils they had cast out; and also what doctrines they had preached, and what success in all they had had: so every Gospel minister must give an account of his ministrations to Christ.</p>
