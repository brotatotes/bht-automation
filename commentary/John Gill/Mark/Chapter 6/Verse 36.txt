Send them away,.... Leave off preaching, dismiss the assembly; see Matthew 14:15;that they may go into the country round about; or "into the fields"; that is, to the odd houses; which were here and there in the fields;Matthew 14:15- :;and into the villages; the little country towns that were near at hand:and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat; they brought no provisions with them, and there were none to be had in that desert place; and it was high time they had some refreshment; for the usual time of dining was past, the first evening was come, the day was on the decline, and was far spent.
