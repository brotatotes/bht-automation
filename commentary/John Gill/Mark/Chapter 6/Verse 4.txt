But Jesus said unto them,.... The following proverb;a prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house; the same as in Matthew 13:57;Matthew 13:57- :. Only the phrase, "among his own kin", is here added: very probably some of those that made these reflections, were some distant relations of Joseph, or Mary; for as Jesus was now in his own country and city, and in his own native place, so among his kindred and relations; who envied his gifts and attainments, and objected to him his rise from that branch of their family, which was the most mean and abject.
