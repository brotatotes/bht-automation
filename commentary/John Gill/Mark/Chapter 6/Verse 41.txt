And when he had taken the five loaves and two fishes,.... Out of the hands of those that brought them into his own:he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves: :-,and gave them to his disciples to set before them; the multitude, in order to eat of them:and the two fishes divided he among them all; that every one might have a part. The Syriac and Persic versions read, they divided; that is, the apostles.
