And they that did eat of the loaves,.... And also of the fishes; for they all ate of both;were about five thousand men; the word ωσει, "about", is omitted in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Persic and Ethiopic versions, reading five thousand men certain. The Evangelist Matthew adds, "beside children and women", Matthew 14:21.
