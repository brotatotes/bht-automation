<p><strong>And he went up unto them in the ship</strong>,.... That is, after Peter had desired he might be bid to come to him upon the water, and having got leave, made an essay; but the wind being boisterous, and beginning to sink, he cried out for help; when Christ stretched out his hand, and saved him; and then he, together with Peter, went up into the ship to the rest of the disciples, as is related by Matthew, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:28">Matthew 14:28</span>, though omitted by this evangelist:</p>
<p><strong>and the wind ceased</strong>; from blowing; it was laid at once, as soon as ever Christ entered the ship:</p>
<p><strong>and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered</strong>. The Ethiopic version adds, "at him"; they were astonished, when they found it was Christ, and not a spirit; and they were more amazed at his walking upon the sea; and they marvelled still more abundantly, when they observed that the wind ceased upon his coming into the ship; their amazement was beyond expression, and therefore many words are made use of to signify it by.</p>
