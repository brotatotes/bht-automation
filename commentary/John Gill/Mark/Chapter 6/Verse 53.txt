And when they had passed over,.... The lake of Gennesaret, or sea of "Galilee",they came into the land of Gennesaret;  :-; to Capernaum, as appears from John 6:17 for Capernaum was in the land of Gennesaret; to which agrees what Josephus says, that the land of Gennesaret was watered with a very excellent spring, which the inhabitants of that place called Capernaum h:and drew to the shore: this is omitted in the Syriac and Persic versions: and the Arabic reads, "and they cast anchors".h De Bello Jud. l. 3. c. 35.
