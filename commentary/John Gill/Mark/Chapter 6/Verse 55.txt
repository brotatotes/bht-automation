<p><strong>and began to carry about in beds those that were sick</strong>; or lame, or so disordered that they could not walk, or bear any other way of being carried: these they brought to him,</p>
<p><strong>where they heard he was</strong>: in whatsoever part of the country they could learn he was in; for he went about from place to place doing good.</p>
