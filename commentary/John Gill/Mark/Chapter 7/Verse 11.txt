<p><strong>But ye say</strong>,.... Your elders, doctors, and wise men, in opposition to God and Moses:</p>
<p><strong>if a man shall say to his father or his mother, it is Corban, that is to say, a gift</strong>; in the same manner is this word interpreted by Josephus, who speaking of some that call themselves Corban unto God, says u in the Greek tongue, δωρον δε τουτο σεμαινει, "this signifies a gift": now, according to the traditions of the elders, whoever made use of that word to his father or his mother, signifying thereby, that what they might have expected relief from at his hands, he had devoted it; or it was as if it was devoted to sacred uses; adding,</p>
<p><strong>by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me, [he shall be free]</strong>; and not under any obligation to regard and relieve his parents, let their case and circumstances be what they would. This is the form of a vow, which a man having made on purpose, to free himself from the charge of the maintenance of his parents, when reduced, repeats unto them; or which he makes upon their application to him: various forms of this kind of vows, are produced in the note <strong>"Mt 15:5"</strong>, which see: this was not the form of an oath, or swearing by Corban, or the sacred treasury in the temple, mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:6">Matthew 27:6</span>, of which I do not remember any instance; nor was it a dedication of his substance to holy and religious uses; to the service of God and the temple; but it was a vow he made, that what he had, should be as Corban, as a gift devoted to sacred uses: that as that could not be appropriated to any other use, so his substance, after such a vow, could not be applied to the relief of his parents; though he was not obliged by it to give it for the use of the temple, but might keep it himself, or bestow it upon others. L. Capellus has wrote a very learned dissertation upon this vow, at the end of his Spicilegium on the New Testament; very and our learned countryman, Dr. Pocock, has said many excellent things upon it, in his miscellaneous notes on his Porta Mosis; both which ought to be read and consulted, by those who have learning and leisure.</p>
