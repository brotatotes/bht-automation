<p><strong>Because it entereth not into his heart</strong>,.... Which is the seat and fountain of all moral pollution; and if that is not defiled, no other part can be; and that that is not defiled by eating and drinking, unless in case of intemperance, is clear; because food and drink do not go into it:</p>
<p><strong>but into the belly</strong>; it is taken in at the mouth, goes down the throat, and is received into the stomach, and from thence it passes through the bowels:</p>
<p><strong>and goeth into the draught</strong>; בית הכסא, "the private house", as the Jews call it, without going into the heart at all:</p>
<p><strong>purging all meats</strong>; that which it leaves behind, is pure and nourishing; and whatever is gross and impure, is carried with it into the draught, so that nothing remains in the man that is defiling.</p>
