<p><strong>And from thence he arose</strong>,.... From the land of Gennesaret, or from Capernaum, which was in it:</p>
<p><strong>and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon</strong>; two cities of Phoenicia: not into them, but into the borders of them; into those parts of Galilee, which bordered on Phoenicia; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And entered into an house</strong>; in some one of the towns, or cities, in those parts; which house might be, for the entertainment and lodging of strangers:</p>
<p><strong>and would have no man know it</strong>; took all proper precaution as man, that nobody should know who, and where he was; that the, Gentiles, on whose borders he was, might not flock to him, which would create envy and disgust in the Jews:</p>
<p><strong>but he could not be hid</strong>; he had wrought so many miracles in Galilee, and his fame was so much spread, and he had been seen, and was known by so many persons, that, humanly speaking, it was next to impossible, that he should be long unknown in such a place.</p>
