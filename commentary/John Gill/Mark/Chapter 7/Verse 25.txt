One way and means by which he came to be more openly discovered who he was, was this; a woman in those parts,whose young daughter had an unclean spirit; a devil, with which she was possessed; hearing of some miracles he had wrought in healing the sick, and casting out devils;heard of him, and came; and understanding that he was in such a place made all haste to him;and fell at his feet; and with great respect and reverence to so venerable a person, threw herself at his feet, and earnestly entreated mercy for her child; believing he had power to cast the devil out of her, though at a distance from her.
