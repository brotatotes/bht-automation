<p><strong>For a certain woman</strong>,.... One way and means by which he came to be more openly discovered who he was, was this; a woman in those parts,</p>
<p><strong>whose young daughter had an unclean spirit</strong>; a devil, with which she was possessed; hearing of some miracles he had wrought in healing the sick, and casting out devils;</p>
<p><strong>heard of him, and came</strong>; and understanding that he was in such a place made all haste to him;</p>
<p><strong>and fell at his feet</strong>; and with great respect and reverence to so venerable a person, threw herself at his feet, and earnestly entreated mercy for her child; believing he had power to cast the devil out of her, though at a distance from her.</p>
