<p><strong>The woman was a Greek</strong>,.... Or Gentile, an Heathen woman, which made her faith the more remarkable. So the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions call her; which she might be, and was, though she was a woman of Canaan, as she is said to be in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:22">Matthew 15:22</span>, for though the land of Israel in general, was called the land of Canaan, yet there was a particular part, which was at first inhabited by Canaan himself, which bore this name; and is the same with Phoenicia, of which this woman was an inhabitant, and therefore she is afterwards called a Syrophoenician; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:22- :">Matthew 15:22- :</span>. And this place was now inhabited by Gentiles; hence the Jews often distinguish between an Hebrew and a Canaanitish servant; of which take an z instance or two;</p>
<p>"an Hebrew servant is obtained by money, and by writing, a Canaanitish servant is obtained by money, and by writing, and by possession.''</p>
<p>Again a,</p>
<p>"he that does injury to an Hebrew servant, is bound to all these (i.e. to make compensation for loss, pain, healing, cessation from business, and reproach), excepting cessation from business--but he that hurts a Canaanitish servant, that belongs to others, is bound to them all.''</p>
<p>And by a Canaanitish servant, they understand any one that is not an Israelite; for an Hebrew and a Canaanite, are manifestly opposed to one another. This woman being of Phoenicia, as appears by what follows, which was sometimes called Canaan, might be said to be a woman of Canaan, and also a Gentile.</p>
<p><strong>A Syrophoenician by nation</strong>; or extract. The Syriac and Persic versions say she was "of Phoenicia of Syria"; and the latter, by way of explanation, "of Emisa". The Arabic version adds, "her extraction was of Ghaur"; and the Ethiopic version says, she was "the wife of a Syrophoenician man"; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:22- :">Matthew 15:22- :</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And she besought him, that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter</strong>; which she was persuaded, by what she had heard of him, he was able to do, by a word speaking, though her daughter was not present.</p>
