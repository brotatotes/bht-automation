<p><strong>And he said unto her, for this saying</strong>,.... Or word of faith; in which she expressed such great faith in him: the Persic version reads it, "go thy way; for with the blessing of this word, the devil is gone out of thy daughter": as if this saying referred to the word Christ, and the divine power that went along with it, to the ejection of the devil; when it refers to the saying of the woman, and not to the words of Christ, which follow,</p>
<p><strong>go thy way</strong>; in peace, thy request is granted; it is as thou wouldst have it:</p>
<p><strong>the devil is gone out of thy daughter</strong>. Christ, who as God is every where, and whose divine power reaches to all places, persons, and things had, in a secret and powerful manner, cast the devil out of this woman's daughter; without going to her, or speaking to him, his power had wrought the miracle effectually.</p>
