<p><strong>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews</strong>,.... The far greater part of them; all, excepting the Sadducees; and especially the Pharisees, were very tenacious of this tradition of washing hands before eating: hence Pharisees are described as such, בטהרה</p>
<p>אוכלי חוליהן, "that eat their common food with cleanness" n, i.e. of hands: these,</p>
<p><strong>except they wash their hands oft, eat not</strong>; or except they wash very cautiously, with great care, diligence, and exactness, as the Syriac version suggests; and about which there are various rules given, to be observed with great strictness o. Some render the words, "they wash their hands to the elbow"; and this is a rule with the Jews, which is closely to be abode by, that the washing of hands is to be,</p>
<p>עד פרק, "to the joint", which joins the hand and arm together p: particularly it is observed q, that</p>
<p>"washing of the hands for the eating of the offering, is unto the elbow, and for common food, to the joints of the fingers: he that eats with an ancient man, and does not wash his hands to the elbow, he may not eat with him.''</p>
<p>Well may it be added,</p>
<p><strong>holding the tradition of the elders</strong>; nor do the Jews pretend the authority of the Scriptures as obliging them to such rules; for, they say, the command concerning washing of hands is, מדברי סופרים, "from the words of the Scribes" r; and is מצות חכמים, "a command of the wise men" s. The tradition is this:</p>
<p>"they wash hands for common food, but for the tithe, and for the first offering, and for that which is holy, they dip them, and for the sin offering; for if the hands are defiled; the body is defiled t.''</p>
<p>And this tradition of the elders, the Scribes, and Pharisees, strictly observed.</p>
