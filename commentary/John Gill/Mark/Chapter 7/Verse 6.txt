<p><strong>He answered and said unto them</strong>,.... Matthew postpones the following citation and application of the prophecy of Isaiah, to the account of the command of God being broken by the tradition of Corban; which Mark makes the answer of Christ to begin with:</p>
<p><strong>well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites</strong>; which in Matthew is read, "ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:7">Matthew 15:7</span>; to the same sense as here: for the prophecy of Isaiah not only described the hypocrites of his time, but had respect chiefly to the Jews in succeeding ages, in the times of Christ, and both before and after; when they would, as they did, greatly degenerate, and lost the power and spirituality of religion, and had only the form of it; left the word of God for the traditions of men, and were given up to great stupidity, and to judicial blindness: hence the Apostle Paul refers to a passage in the same chapter, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:10">Isaiah 29:10</span>, and applies it to the Jews in his time, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:8">Romans 11:8</span>;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:8- :">Romans 11:8- :</span>, saying,</p>
<p><strong>as it is written</strong> in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:13">Isaiah 29:13</span>,</p>
<p><strong>this people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me</strong>. In the Prophet Isaiah more is said than is here cited; and so in Matthew more is produced, and the whole is there expressed thus: "this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me",</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:8">Matthew 15:8</span>: they presented their bodies before the Lord in the synagogues, or in the temple, and prayed to him with an air of devotion and fervency, and offered up their praises to him, for their external privileges and blessings; but, alas! this was all lip labour; there was no lifting up their hearts, with their hands, unto God; these were not united to fear his name, but were distracted in his worship, and carried away from him to other objects; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:8- :">Matthew 15:8- :</span>.</p>
