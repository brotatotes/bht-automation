<p><strong>And he said unto them</strong>,.... He continued his discourse, saying,</p>
<p><strong>full well</strong>, or "fairly",</p>
<p><strong>ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition</strong>: these words may be considered, as spoken ironically, thus; as pious and excellently good men, you in a very fair and handsome manner, reject and make void the commandments and laws of God; and it is very fit it should be so, in order to preserve your own traditions, that nothing may be wanting to keep up the honour of them, and a due regard to them. The Arabic version reads the words by way of interrogation, "is it fit that you should omit the commandments of God, and keep your own statutes?" and so the Ethiopic, "do ye rightly make void the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own commandment?" Which makes them come nearer to the passage in Matthew; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
