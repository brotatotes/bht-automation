<p><strong>And straightway he entered into a ship, with his disciples</strong>,.... As soon as ever he had, dismissed the multitude, he took shipping with his disciples; for he was at the sea of Galilee, either at a place near it, or upon the shore of it; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:31">Mark 7:31</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and came into the parts of Dalmanutha</strong>; which Matthew calls, "the coasts of Magdala"; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:31- :">Mark 7:31- :</span>. The Arabic version reads it, "Magdal"; and in two of Beza's copies it is read, "Madegada"; but the Syriac version reads, "Dalmanutha"; and the Persic, "Dalmanuth"; and the Ethiopic, "Dalmathy": it was a city in the coasts of Magdala, and is thought by Dr. Lightfoot to be the same with Tzalmon, or Salmon, a place often mentioned f in the Jewish writings.</p>
