<p><strong>Neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf</strong>; for thirteen passengers of them. The Persic version reads the whole thus: "and they forgot to take bread with them, not indeed one loaf, and there was no bread with them in the ship"; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
