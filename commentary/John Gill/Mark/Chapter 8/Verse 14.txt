At Dalmanutha, or Magdala, or whatever place in those parts they were at, before they took shipping, as was their usual method.Neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf; for thirteen passengers of them. The Persic version reads the whole thus: "and they forgot to take bread with them, not indeed one loaf, and there was no bread with them in the ship";  :-.
