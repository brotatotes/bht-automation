<p><strong>And when Jesus knew it</strong>,.... As he did immediately, by his omniscience; for as he knew the thoughts and reasonings of the Scribes and Pharisees, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:4">Matthew 9:4</span>, so he did those of his own disciples:</p>
<p><strong>he saith unto them, why reason ye because ye have no bread</strong>? or imagine that I have given you this caution on that account; or are distressed because this is your case, as if you should be reduced to great difficulties, by reason of your forgetfulness and negligence:</p>
<p><strong>perceive ye not yet, neither understand</strong>? the meaning of the parabolical expressions, which he had used them to; or his power in providing food for them, and supporting a great number of persons with very little food, of which they had some very late instances:</p>
<p><strong>have ye your heart yet hardened</strong>? as after the first miracle; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:52">Mark 6:52</span>, for it might have been expected, that by a second miracle of the loaves, their understandings would have been more enlightened, and their faith increased, and that they would have relinquished their gross notions, their anxieties, doubts, and unbelief.</p>
