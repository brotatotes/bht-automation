<p><strong>Having eyes, see ye not</strong>?.... Meaning perhaps both the eyes of their bodies, and of their understandings: they had bodily eyes, and with them saw the miracles he wrought, and yet took little notice of them; and the eyes of their understandings were enlightened by Christ, and yet saw things but very darkly:</p>
<p><strong>and having ears, hear ye not</strong>? They had their natural hearing, and yet made but little use of it; and did not so diligently attend to the sound of Christ's words: and though they had spiritual ears given them to hear, yet were very dull of, understanding, and taking in things:</p>
<p><strong>and do ye not remember</strong>? the interpretation of parables formerly given, and the miracles of the loaves lately wrought.</p>
