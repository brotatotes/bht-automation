<p><strong>And he began to teach them</strong>,.... For as yet he had said nothing to them about his sufferings and death, at least in express terms; but now they being firmly established in the faith of him, as the Messiah, he thought it proper to inform them,</p>
<p><strong>that the son of man must suffer many things</strong>; meaning himself, as that he should be betrayed, apprehended, and bound, should be smitten, spit upon, buffeted, and scourged; and which things must be done, and he suffer them, because it was so determined by God, and foretold in the Scriptures:</p>
<p><strong>and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests and Scribes</strong>; which composed the grand sanhedrim of the nation, and are the builders that were prophesied of by whom he should be rejected,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span>,</p>
<p><strong>and be killed</strong>; in a violent manner; his life be taken away by force, without law, or justice:</p>
<p><strong>and after three days rise again</strong>: not after three days were ended, and on the fourth day, but after the third day was come; that is, "on the third day", as the Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions read; and even the Pharisees themselves thus understood Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:63">Matthew 27:63</span>, so the phrase, "after eight days", is used for the eighth day, being come, or that same day a week later; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:28">Luke 9:28</span> compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:1">Matthew 17:1</span>.</p>
