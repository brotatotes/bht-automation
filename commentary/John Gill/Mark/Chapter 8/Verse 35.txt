<p><strong>For whosoever will save his life</strong>,.... Life is a valuable thing, and all that a man has he will give for it; self preservation is a principle in nature; and it becomes every man to take all lawful methods to save his life, when it is threatened, or is in danger: but whoever is willing to save it, when it is called for to be laid down for Christ's sake; and rather than lay it down, will deny Christ, and give up a profession of him, and his Gospel,</p>
<p><strong>shall lose it</strong>: he shall not enjoy it with honour and comfort now, and much less with peace, pleasure, and happiness hereafter, but shall be under the power of the second death:</p>
<p><strong>but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the Gospel's</strong>; that is, shall willingly part with it when he is called to it, rather than deny Christ and his Gospel,</p>
<p><strong>the same shall save it</strong>: though he will lose it now, he will find it again in the resurrection of life; for he will rise to eternal life; when such, who have apostatized from Christ, will rise to shame, and everlasting contempt: this man will have greatly the advantage over such; they will die the second death, or be destroyed soul and body in hell; and he will live for ever with Christ, in endless pleasure and glory; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
