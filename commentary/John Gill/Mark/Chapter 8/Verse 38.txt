<p><strong>Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me</strong>,.... As suffering, crucified, and put to death; things he had been speaking of before: whoever through scandal of the cross, and fear of men, will be ashamed of Christ, and dare not profess faith in him, but shall conceal and keep it to themselves:</p>
<p><strong>and of my words</strong>; the doctrines of the Gospel, of remission of sins by his blood, of justification by his righteousness, and of salvation alone by him, with every other truth relating to him, or connected with these;</p>
<p><strong>in this adulterous and sinful generation</strong>; which was so both in a moral and spiritual sense; for both corporeal and spiritual adultery prevailed among them, And particularly the Scribes and Pharisees adulterated the word of God by their false glosses, in which they acted a very sinful part; and such was their authority, that few durst contradict them, or profess doctrines which were the reverse of them. Wherefore our Lord assures his disciples and followers, that should they be deterred by these men from a free and open profession of him, and his Gospel, by which it would appear that they were ashamed of both,</p>
<p><strong>of him also shall the son of man be ashamed</strong>; will not own such an one for his; he will take no notice of him; he will not confess his name; but, as one that he is ashamed of, he will turn away from him; not so much as look at him, or say one favourable word to him, or for him; but bid him be gone from him, as a worker of iniquity: this he will do,</p>
<p><strong>when he cometh in the glory of his Father</strong>; the same that the Father has; being his Son, of the same nature with him, and equal to him; and as mediator, endued with power and authority from him, to judge the world; and when he will be accompanied</p>
<p><strong>with the holy angels</strong>; who will descend from heaven with him, and be employed on earth by him; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
