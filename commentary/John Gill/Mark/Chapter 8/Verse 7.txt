<p><strong>And they had a few small fishes</strong>,.... Which they also acquainted Christ with, and brought out unto him:</p>
<p><strong>and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before [them]</strong>. It looks, by this account, as if the fishes were blessed, and brake, and distributed separately, alter the blessing, breaking, and distribution of the bread; and so the Syriac version renders it, "upon whom also he blessed"; and the Persic thus, "and he also blessed the fishes"; but, according to Matthew they were both blessed, and brake, and distributed together, as it is highly reasonable to suppose they were both ate together;</p>
