But I say unto you, that Elias is indeed come,.... Meaning John the Baptist, who in prophecy is designed by him.And they have done unto him whatsoever they listed; :-; which words should be read in a parenthesis, as they are in the Vulgate Latin version; for what follows, asit is written of him, respects not what the Scribes and Pharisees, and the people of the Jews did to John at their pleasure; despising his ministry and message, rejecting the counsel of God delivered by him, and remaining impenitent and unbelieving, notwithstanding his powerful and awakening ministry, with many other things, which are no where written of him; but the words regard his coming, and the prophecies concerning him, and particularly, that under the name of Elijah, in Malachi 4:5 and which had had their accomplishment.
