<p><strong>And wheresoever he taketh him</strong>,.... The spirit, or devil, whether it be near fire, or water, whatsoever danger, or dangerous place:</p>
<p><strong>he teareth him</strong>; or throws him into it, or dashes him against it; or inwardly racks, tortures, and convulses him:</p>
<p><strong>and he foameth</strong>; at the mouth, like one that is mad:</p>
<p><strong>and gnasheth with his teeth</strong>; through the excessive pain he is in:</p>
<p><strong>and pineth away</strong>; his flesh is withered, dried up, and consumed away. This was the sad deplorable case this child was in, who was his father's only child, and therefore his health and life were very desirable: now he further observes to Christ, saying,</p>
<p><strong>and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out, and they could not</strong>. Christ being absent, he entreated the disciples, who had power against unclean spirits, to cast them out; that they would make use of it, and dispossess this dumb and evil spirit; and who did make trial to cast him out, but were not able to effect it;</p>
