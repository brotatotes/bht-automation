<p><strong>And after six days</strong>,.... Six days after this discourse with his disciples, in their way to Caesarea Philippi, and after they were come into those parts:</p>
<p><strong>Jesus taketh with him Peter, James, and John</strong>; favourite disciples, and a sufficient number, to be witnesses of his transfiguration:</p>
<p><strong>and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves</strong>; where he and they were alone. This was not Mount Tabor, as is generally said, but either the mountain which Caesarea was at the foot of, or it may be Mount Lebanon; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and he was transfigured before them</strong>; the above three disciples;</p>
