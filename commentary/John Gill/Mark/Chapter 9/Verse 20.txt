<p><strong>And they brought him unto him</strong>,.... The father of the child, and those that were with him, brought the child to Jesus, into his presence, before him:</p>
<p><strong>and when he saw him</strong>, that is, either when Jesus saw the child, or the child saw Jesus; or the evil spirit in him, and by him which were all at once:</p>
<p><strong>straightway the spirit tare him</strong>; threw him into a violent fit, shook him, and convulsed him in a dreadful manner; knowing his time was short, and being filled with indignation and rage, that he should be obliged, as he knew he must, to leave the child very speedily; and was therefore resolved to do all the mischief, and put him to all the pain he could:</p>
<p><strong>and he fell on the ground</strong>; at the feet of Jesus, not being able to stand, through the violent motions and convulsions he threw him into:</p>
<p><strong>and wallowed, foaming</strong>; rolled about from side to side, foaming at the mouth, and in the most exquisite rack and torture.</p>
