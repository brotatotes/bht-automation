<p><strong>And [the spirit] cried, and rent him sore</strong>,.... We rightly supply, "the spirit", as do the Syriac and Persic versions, "the demon"; for it was he, and not the child, that cried, and made an hideous noise, at his ejection; being filled with wrath and rage, that he must be obliged to quit the possession he had so long held; and therefore, in spite and malice, before it left him, shook and tore him, and threw him into dreadful convulsions:</p>
<p><strong>and came out of him</strong>; though sore against his will, being obliged to it, by the superior power of Christ:</p>
<p><strong>and he was as one dead</strong>: that is, the child, when the devil had left him, lay as still as if he had no breath, nor life in him:</p>
<p><strong>insomuch that many said, he is dead</strong>; really dead: that there was no life in him, nor any hopes of his coming to himself again.</p>
