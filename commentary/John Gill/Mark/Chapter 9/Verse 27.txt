<p><strong>But Jesus took him by the hand</strong>,.... "Took hold of the hand of the child", as the Persic version renders it;</p>
<p><strong>and lifted him up</strong>; from the ground, on which he was cast by the spirit;</p>
<p><strong>and he arose</strong>: this is omitted in the Syriac and Arabic versions, though in one edition of the latter, according to De Dieu, it is rendered, "and he stood"; to which is added, "and went into his own house". The Persic version, instead of this clause, reads, "and the child was healed"; and all the expressions show, that he was perfectly well.</p>
