<p><strong>And he came to Capernaum</strong>,.... Where he met with the collectors of the tribute money, and paid it to them, as related by Matthew, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:24">Matthew 17:24</span>, though Mark takes no notice of it. The Vulgate Latin and the Syriac versions, read in the plural number, "they came"; Christ and his twelve apostles; and which is the sense of the words, read in the singular number; for Christ came not alone, but with his disciples:</p>
<p><strong>and being in the house</strong>; of Simon and Andrew, very likely where he used to be when at Capernaum:</p>
<p><strong>he asked them, what was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way</strong>? Whilst in their journey from Caesarea Philippi, to Galilee; or as they travelled through the parts of Galilee to Capernaum. This question Christ put, not as ignorant of what had passed among them, but in order to have the case laid before him; that he might reprove them for their pride and ambition, and have an opportunity of teaching them humility, and of informing them of the nature of his kingdom, and subjects; concerning which, they had entertained very wrong notions. The phrase "among yourselves", is omitted in the Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions, but stands in the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic.</p>
