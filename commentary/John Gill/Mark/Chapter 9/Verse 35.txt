<p><strong>And he sat down</strong>,.... As their master, as one having authority; and in order to examine into this matter, and pass judgment upon it:</p>
<p><strong>and called the twelve</strong>; all the disciples, who though they might not be all engaged in this dispute, nor equally criminal, yet were all, possessed of the same notion; and therefore Christ calls them all unto him, what he had to say, being pertinent unto them all:</p>
<p><strong>and saith unto them, if any man desire to be first</strong>; to have the pre-eminence, and be in the chief place in the kingdom of the Messiah,</p>
<p><strong>the same shall be last of all, and servant of all</strong>: his pride and vanity shall be checked; his ambitious views shall be frustrated; instead of being first, he shall be last; and instead of having superior reverence and respect, he shall be debased, and treated with neglect and contempt; and instead of being the master over others, shall be the servant of all. Some copies read, "let him be"; and so the Persic version, "let him be last, and minister to every one"; and the Ethiopic thus, "let him subject himself to all, and be servant to all"; for the only way to preferment in Christ's kingdom, or in the Gospel dispensation, is humility and meekness, and performing the lowest services to all, with diligence and cheerfulness.</p>
