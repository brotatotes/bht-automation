<p><strong>Whosoever shall receive one of such children</strong>,.... That is, any believer, who is like to such a child for humility, meekness, and lowliness of mind; and so the Syriac version renders it, טליא</p>
<p>איך הנא, "one like to this child": and so the Arabic and Persic versions; for it cannot be thought that Christ's meaning is, that whoever takes up any little child, embraces, and takes notice of it, as he did, does what is after related; but that whoever shows respect, and performs the least office of love and kindness to the meanest believer, comparable to a little child, for the above excellent qualities, and he does this, says Christ,</p>
<p><strong>in my name</strong>; on account that he belongs to Christ, is one of his, bears his image, partakes of his grace, is loved by him, and shall be glorified with, him: such is Christ's great regard to his humble followers, that he takes it all one as if done to himself:</p>
<p><strong>he receiveth me</strong>; this humble believer, being a member of his, and like unto him, and respected by him;</p>
<p><strong>and whosoever shall receive me</strong>; Christ, in any of his members:</p>
<p><strong>receiveth not me</strong>; that is, not him only; for he does receive him, otherwise there would be a contradiction in the words; but his meaning is, that he does not hereby receive him, by receiving one of his, nor him so much, as his Father:</p>
<p><strong>but him that sent me</strong>; for as showing respect to one of Christ's members, is showing respect to him; so showing respect to Christ, is showing respect to his Father, from whence he came, by whom he was sent, in whose name he acted, and whose work and service he was concerned in.</p>
