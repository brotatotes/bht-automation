<p><strong>But Jesus said, forbid him not</strong>,.... Neither him, nor any other they should hereafter meet with, who might be casting out devils in his name, giving this as a reason for it;</p>
<p><strong>for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name</strong>; or "miracles", as the Syriac version, as to cast out devils, or heal any sickness and disease,</p>
<p><strong>that can lightly speak evil of me</strong>: such a man can never reproach and blaspheme that name, which he makes use of in doing, and by which he does wonderful works; no man can call Jesus accursed, who casts out devils in his name; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>, if he has spoken evil of him before, he cannot do it "again", as the Persic version renders it, with any face; or he cannot do it "quickly, immediately", as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions interpret it: there must be some time before such an one apostatizes, if he ever does; he cannot very easily and readily go into a way of blaspheming that name, by which he does his mighty works: his conscience will not admit of it; and besides, it would be contrary to his interest; it must sink his credit, and he lose the esteem and applause of men, he had gained by his miracles; for to dishonour that name, would be to reproach himself.</p>
