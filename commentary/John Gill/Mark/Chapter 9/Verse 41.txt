Not only one that does a miracle in the name of Christ, but he that shows the least respect, or does the least kindness to any one of his; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; is to be reckoned a friend, and is so accounted by Christ; and will be sooner or later taken notice of by him, especially, if what he does, be it ever so little, is done on his account:</p>
<p><strong>in my name, because ye belong to Christ</strong>; or as the Syriac version renders it, "on account that ye are Christ's"; are his disciples, are called by his name, are partakers of his grace, bear his image and likeness, are loved by him, interested in him, given to him, redeemed by him called by his grace, and shall be with him:</p>
<p><strong>verily l say unto you, he shall not lose his reward</strong>;</p>
