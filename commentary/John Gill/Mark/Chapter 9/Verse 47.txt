<p><strong>And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out</strong>,.... Than which, nothing is dearer to man, it being very tender, and exceeding useful: this metaphor the Lord sometimes makes use of, to show how dear his people are unto him, and what a tender concern he has for them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+32:10">Deuteronomy 32:10</span>. And here it may design such, as are most beloved by men, and are their most intimate acquaintance, and bosom friends; and yet these are to be parted with, when they prove snares and stumbling blocks, or give offence, by endeavouring to draw into sin, and from Christ:</p>
<p><strong>it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye</strong>; that kingdom, which God has prepared for his people, from the foundation of the world, and of his rich grace, gives unto them, and in which they will enjoy him to all eternity;</p>
<p><strong>than having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire</strong>. In the two instances before it is added, "that never shall be quenched".</p>
