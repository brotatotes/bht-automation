<p><strong>For he wist not what to say</strong>,.... He did not know what he should say, or what was proper to be said by him, at such a time, in such circumstances, and before such persons;</p>
<p><strong>for they were sore afraid</strong>. The Persic version reads, "he was": and so the Latin translation of the Syriac, though that itself is, "they were"; for all three were filled with consternation at what they saw and heard; so that they were scarcely themselves, and knew not well what they said or did.</p>
