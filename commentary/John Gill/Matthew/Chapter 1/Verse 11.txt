<p><strong>And Josias begat Jechonias</strong>,.... This Jechonias is the same with Jehoiakim, the son of Josias, called so by Pharaohnecho, when he made him king, whose name before was Eliakim, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+23:34">2 Kings 23:34</span> begat of Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+23:36">2 Kings 23:36</span>.</p>
<p><strong>and his brethren</strong>. These were Johanan, Zedekiah, and Shallum. Two of them were kings, one reigned before him, viz.
