<p><strong>And Zorobabel begat Abiud</strong>,.... The children of Zorobabel are said in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+3:19">1 Chronicles 3:19</span>, to be Meshullam, and Hananiah, and Shelomith their sister, but no mention is made of Abiud: he seems to be the same with Meshullam the eldest son, who might have two names; nor is this unlikely, since it was usual, especially about the time of the Babylonish captivity, for men to have more names than one, as may be observed in Daniel and others, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+1:7">Daniel 1:7</span> where they went by one, and in Judea by another.</p>
<p><strong>And Abiud begat Eliakim</strong>, c. From hence to the 16th verse the genealogy is carried down to Joseph, the husband of Mary which account must be taken from the genealogical tables of the Jews, to which recourse might be had, and with which it agrees; or otherwise the Jews would have cavilled at it; but I do not find any objections made by them to it. That there were genealogical books or tables kept by the Jews is certain, from the following instances i;</p>
<p>"Simeon ben Azzai says, I found in Jerusalem, מגלת יוחסין, "a volume of genealogies", and there was written in it, c.''</p>
<p>Again k, says R. Levi,</p>
<p>"they found a "volume of genealogies" in Jerusalem, and there was written in it that Hillell came from David Ben Jarzaph from Asaph; Ben Tzitzith Hacceseth from Abner; Ben Cobesin from Ahab; Ben Calba Shebuah from Caleb; R. Jannai from Eli; R. Chayah Rabba from the children of Shephatiah, the son of Abital; R. Jose be Rabbi Chelphetha from the children of Jonadab, the son of Rechab; and R. Nehemiah from Nehemiah the Tirshathite.''</p>
<p>Once more l, says R. Chana bar Chanma, when the holy blessed God causes his</p>
<p>"Shechinah to dwell, he does not cause it to dwell but upon families, מיוחסות, "which are genealogized" in Israel.''</p>
<p>Now if Matthew's account had not been true, it might easily have been refuted by these records. The author of the old m Nizzachon takes notice of the close of this genealogy, but finds no fault with it; only that it is carried down to Joseph, and not to Mary; which may be accounted for by a rule of their own n, משפחת אם אינה קרויה משפחת "the mother's family is not called a family", whereas the father's is. It is very remarkable that the Jewish Targum o traces the descent of the Messiah from the family of David in the line of Zorobabel, as Matthew does; and reckons the same number of generations, wanting one, from Zorobabel to the Messiah, as the Evangelist does, from Zorobabel to Jesus; according to Matthew, the genealogy stands thus, Zorobabel, Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Sadoc, Achim, Eliud, Eleazar, Matthan, Jacob, Joseph, Jesus; and according to the Targum the order is this,</p>
<p>"Zorobabel, Hananiah, Jesaiah, Rephaiah, Arnon, Obadiah, Shecaniah, Shemnigh, Neariah, Elioenai, Anani; this is the king Messiah, who is to be revealed.''</p>
<p>The difference of names may be accounted for by their having two names, as before observed. This is a full proof, that, according to the Jews own account, and expectation, the Messiah must be come many years and ages ago.</p>
