<p><strong>Then Joseph her husband</strong>,.... To whom she had been betrothed, and who was her husband, and she his wife according to the Jewish law, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+22:23">Deuteronomy 22:23</span> though not yet come together,</p>
<p><strong>being a just man</strong>, observant of the law of God, particularly that which respected adultery, being wholly good and chaste, like the Patriarch of the same name; a character just the reverse of that which the Jews give him, in their scandalous b book of the life of Jesus; where, in the most malicious manner, they represent him as an unchaste and an unrighteous person:</p>
<p><strong>and not willing to make her a public example</strong>, or to deliver her, i.e. to the civil magistrate, according to Munster's Hebrew edition. The Greek word signifies to punish by way of example to others, to deter them from sinning; and with the ancients it c denoted the greatest and severest punishment. Here it means either bringing her before the civil magistrate, in order to her being punished according to the law in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+22:23">Deuteronomy 22:23</span> which requires the person to be brought out to the gate of the city and stoned with stones, which was making a public example indeed; or divorcing her in a very public manner, and thereby expose her to open shame and disgrace. To prevent which, he being tender and compassionate, though strictly just and good,</p>
<p><strong>was minded to put her away privily</strong>: he deliberately consulted and determined within himself to dismiss her, or put her away by giving her a bill of divorce, in a very private manner; which was sometimes done by putting it into the woman's hand or bosom, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+24:1">Deuteronomy 24:1</span>. In Munster's Hebrew Gospel it is rendered, "it was in his heart to forsake her privately."</p>
