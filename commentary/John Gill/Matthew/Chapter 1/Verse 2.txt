<p><strong>Abraham begat Isaac</strong>,.... The descent of Christ from Abraham is in the line of Isaac; Abraham begat Ishmael before Isaac, and others after him, but they are not mentioned; because the Messiah was not to spring from any of them, but from Isaac, of whom it is said, "in Isaac shall thy seed be called", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:12">Genesis 21:12</span> and who, as he was a progenitor, so an eminent type of Christ; being Abraham's only beloved son; and particularly in the binding, sacrifice and deliverance of him.</p>
<p><strong>Isaac begat Jacob</strong>. The genealogy of Christ proceeds from Isaac, in the line of Jacob. Isaac begat Esau, as well as Jacob, and they two were twins, but one was loved, and the other hated; wherefore no mention is made of Esau, he had no concern in the Messiah, nor was he to spring from him, but from Jacob, or Israel, by whose name he is sometimes called, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:3">Isaiah 49:3</span></p>
<p><strong>Jacob begat Judas and his brethren</strong>. The lineage of Christ is carried on from Jacob in the line of Judah; the reason of which is, because it was particularly prophesied that the Messiah, Shiloh, the prince and chief ruler, should be of him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+5:2">1 Chronicles 5:2</span>. And it is evident beyond all contradiction, that our Lord sprung from his tribe, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:14">Hebrews 7:14</span>. The reason why the brethren of Judah, who were eleven in number, are mentioned, when the brethren of Isaac and Jacob are not, is, because though the Messiah did not spring from them, yet the promise of him was made to the twelve tribes, who all expected him, and to whom he was sent, and came. These made but one body of men, and therefore, though the Messiah came from the tribe of Judah, yet he is said to be of them all, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:4">Romans 9:4</span>.</p>
