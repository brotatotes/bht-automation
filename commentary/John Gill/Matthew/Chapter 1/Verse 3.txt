<p><strong>And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar</strong>,.... The genealogical account of Christ goes on from Judah in the line of Phares, with whom Zara is mentioned; not because they were twins, for so were Jacob and Esau, and yet the latter is taken no notice of; but it may be because of what happened at their birth, see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+38:28">Genesis 38:28</span>. But the line of the Messiah was in Phares, and very rightly is he put in the genealogy of Christ, the Jews themselves being witnesses; who expressly say, that "the Messiah comes from him." These two are said to be begotten of Thamar, daughter-in-law to Judah; who, though she was a Canaanitish woman, has the honour to be named in the genealogy of Christ, who came to save Gentiles as well as Jews: nor can the Jews reproach our Evangelist for putting her into the account; since they themselves frequently acknowledge that the Messiah was to spring from her: they say, r</p>
<p>"there are two women from whom come David the king, and Solomon, and the king Messiah; and these two are Thamar and Ruth.''</p>
<p>Jonathan Ben Uzziel on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+38:6">Genesis 38:6</span> says, that Thamar was the daughter of Shem the great.</p>
<p><strong>And Phares begat Esrom</strong>; called Hezron, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ru+4:18">Ruth 4:18</span> where the same phrase is used as here. He had another son called Hamul, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+2:5">1 Chronicles 2:5</span> but the account proceeds from Phares, in the line of Esrom.</p>
<p><strong>And Esrom begat Aram</strong>; called Ram in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ru+4:18">Ruth 4:18</span> where the same way of speaking is used as here. Esrom also besides him begat Jerahmeel, Chelubai, or Caleb, and Segub, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+2:9">1 Chronicles 2:9</span> but these are not in the line. Elihu, who conversed with Job, is said to be of the kindred of Ram, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="job+32:2">Job 32:2</span> whether the same with Ram or Aram, may be inquired.</p>
