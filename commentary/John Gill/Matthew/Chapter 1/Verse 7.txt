<p><strong>And Solomon begat Roboam</strong>,.... Called Rehoboam, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+11:43">1 Kings 11:43</span> of Naamah an Ammonitess, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+14:21">1 Kings 14:21</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And Roboam begat Abia</strong>, sometimes called Abijam, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+14:31">1 Kings 14:31</span>, sometimes Abijah, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+12:16">2 Chronicles 12:16</span> and sometimes, as here, Abia, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+3:10">1 Chronicles 3:10</span>. Him Rehoboam begat of Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+15:2">1 Kings 15:2</span> called Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+13:2">2 Chronicles 13:2</span>. Maachah and Michaiah being the same name; or else she went by two names, as her father did.</p>
<p><strong>And Abia begat Asa</strong>, who was a good king; his mother's name is the same with the name of his father's mother; and perhaps it is not his proper mother, but his grandmother who is meant in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+15:10">1 Kings 15:10</span>. He is wrongly called Asaph in the Persic and Ethiopic versions, and in one copy.</p>
