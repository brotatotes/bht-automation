<p><strong>Nor scrip for your journey</strong>,.... This the Jews call תרמיל, "tarmil": and which their commentators n say, is a large leathern bag, in which shepherds and travellers put their food, and other things, and carried with them, hanging it about their necks; so that the disciples were neither to carry money with them, nor any provisions for their journey:</p>
<p><strong>neither two coats</strong>; one to travel in, and another to put on, when they came to their quarters: they were not allowed change of raiment; either because superfluous, or too magnificent to appear in, or too troublesome to carry:</p>
<p><strong>nor shoes</strong>, only sandals, as Mark says; for there was a difference between shoes and sandals, as appears from the case of the plucking off the shoe, when a man refused his brother's wife o: if the "shoe" was plucked off it was regarded; but if the "sandal", it was not minded: this was the old tradition, though custom went against it. Sandals were made of harder leather than shoes p, and sometimes of wood covered with leather, and stuck with nails, to make them more durable q; though sometimes of bulrushes, and bark of palm trees, and of cork r, which were light to walk with.</p>
<p>"Says R. Bar bar Chanah s, I saw R. Eleazar of Nineveh go out on a fast day of the congregation, בסנדל שעם, "with a sandal of cork".''</p>
<p>Of what sort these were, the disciples were allowed to travel with, is not certain:</p>
<p><strong>nor yet with staves</strong>: that is, with more than one staff, which was sufficient to assist them, and lean upon in journeying: for, according to Mark, one was allowed; as though they might take a travelling staff, yet not staves for defence, or to fight with; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:55">Matthew 26:55</span>. Now these several things were forbidden them, partly because they would be burdensome to them in travelling; and partly because they were not to be out any long time, but were quickly to return again; and chiefly to teach them to live and depend upon divine providence. Now, since they were to take neither money, nor provisions with them, and were also to preach the Gospel freely, they might reasonably ask how they should be provided for, and supported: when our Lord suggests, that they should not be anxiously concerned about that, he would take care that they had a suitable supply; and would so influence and dispose the minds of such, to whom they should minister, as that they should have all necessary provisions made for them, without any care or expense of their's:</p>
<p><strong>for the workman is worthy of his meat</strong>; which seems to be a proverbial expression, and by which Christ intimates, that they were workmen, or labourers in his vineyard, and they, discharging their duty aright, were entitled to food and raiment, and all the necessaries of life: this to have, was their due; and it was but a piece of justice to give it to them, and on which they might depend. So that this whole context is so far from militating against a minister's maintenance by the people, that it most strongly establishes it; for if the apostles were not to take any money or provisions with them, to support themselves with, it clearly follows, that it was the will of Christ, that they should live by the Gospel, upon those to whom they preached, as the following words show: and though they were not to make gain of the Gospel, or preach it for filthy lucre's sake; yet they might expect a comfortable subsistence, at the charge of the people, to whom they ministered, and which was their duty to provide for them.</p>
