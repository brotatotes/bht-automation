And when ye come into an house,.... Or the "house"; that is, the house of an hospitable man, when, upon inquiry, found out:salute it; meaning the inhabitants of it; or, as the Persic version reads, those of the household, especially the master of the family. Some copies add, saying, peace be to this house, as in Luke 10:5 and so read the Vulgate Latin, and Munster's Hebrew Gospel; and is a very just, and proper explanation of saluting: for the usual form of salutation among the Jews was in such words; of whichLuke 10:5- : by which is meant all kind of happiness, and prosperity, temporal, spiritual, and eternal.
