And as ye go,.... Through the cities of Judea, and the streets thereof, from one city to another, from place to place; for these were itinerant preachers, who were not to abide long in any place, but to move about, that the Gospel might be spread all over the land, and the lost sheep in every corner be sought out and found.Preach, saying, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. This was to be the subject matter of their ministry, which they were to proclaim aloud in every place; and which is expressed in the same words with which John the Baptist, and Christ himself, began their ministry,Matthew 3:2 which shows the entire harmony, and strict agreement, there were between them: for the meaning of the phrase;see Gill "Mt 3:2". The Cambridge copy reads, "repent, for the kingdom", &c.
