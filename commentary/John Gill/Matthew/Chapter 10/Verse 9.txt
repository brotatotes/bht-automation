<p><strong>Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass</strong>,.... That is, not any sort of "money", as both Mark and Luke express it: for money was then coined, as now, of these three sorts of metals, and which include all kind of money; so that they were not to provide, get, prepare, or take along with them for their journey, as not gold, nor silver, or any parcel of this sort of money, which might be of considerable importance, and lasting consequence to them; so neither brass money, as, halfpence, and farthings, the least, and most inconsiderable: they were forbidden to carry any of either sort</p>
<p><strong>in your purses</strong>: or, as it may be rendered, "in", or "within your girdles"; in which travellers, among the Jews, used to carry their money; and who, in their travelling dress, might not go into the temple, and are thus described h;</p>
<p>"a man may not go into the mountain of the house with his staff, or with his shoes on, nor בפונדתו, "with his girdle".''</p>
<p>The פונדא "phunda", Maimonides says i, is an inner garment, wore to keep off sweat from other garments, to which were sewed hollow things like purses, in which a man put what he pleased; though other k interpreters say it is אזור חלול שנותנין בו מעות, "a hollow girdle, in which they put their money": and so the Romans l had used to do; and so do the Turks m to this day; to which practice the allusion is here.</p>
