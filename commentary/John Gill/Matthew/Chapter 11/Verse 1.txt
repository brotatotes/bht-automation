<p><strong>And it came to pass</strong>,.... In the course of things, and as before determined and resolved on, that</p>
<p><strong>when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples</strong>; when he had given them a commission to preach the Gospel, had finished all his instructions he thought fit to give them, and orders he enjoined them, relating to that work; as where they should go, what they should say, how they should behave, and what treatment they should meet with; and had given them all proper advice and encouragement,</p>
<p><strong>he departed thence</strong>, from the place where he then was: he did not desist either from the ministry of the word, or from working of miracles, but went out into other parts of the country,</p>
<p><strong>to teach and to preach in their cities</strong>: meaning either in the cities of the Jews, or in the cities of his disciples; and these, either the cities they belonged to, from whence they came, namely, the cities of Galilee; for the disciples were Galilaeans, and in which parts Christ now was; or else the cities where he sent them to preach first, and then came himself, and confirmed their doctrine by his own ministry and miracles.</p>
