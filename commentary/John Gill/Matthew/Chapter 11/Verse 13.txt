For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. These words are to be considered in connection with Matthew 11:11 and are a further proof of John's being greater than any of the prophets; because all the inspired writers and prophets, who were before him, prophesied of the Messiah as to come; and either spoke of him in obscure terms, or represented him under dark shadows and figures: whereas John spake of him as already come, and in plain terms, and directed to his very person; and since his time, there have been no prophecies concerning the Messiah and his kingdom; vision and prophecy are now sealed up; all which are acknowledged by the Jews themselves, who b say, כל הנביאים כולז לא נתנבאו אלא לימות המשיח, "all the prophets did not prophesy but to, or of the days of the Messiah". This was the subject, and these the limits of their prophecies; for they own c, that"from the day that the temple was destroyed, מן הנביאיבטילה נבואה, "prophecy was taken away from the prophets".''Since that time, they confess they have had no prophet d, and that they are not able to observe their signs.b T.
