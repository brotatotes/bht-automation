<p><strong>Jesus answered and said unto them</strong>,.... Not by an express declaration, that he was the Messiah that was to come, and they were not to look for any other; but he bids them</p>
<p><strong>go, and show John again, those things which ye do hear and see</strong>. Christ would have them go back to John in prison, and relate to him the doctrines which they had heard preached by him to the poor; and the miracles which they had seen with their own eyes, then wrought by him; as well as many others, which were attested to them by credible witnesses; for there were at that time about Christ, that had infirmities, plagues, and evil spirits, and that were blind, and he instantly cured them in their presence; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:21">Luke 7:21</span>.</p>
