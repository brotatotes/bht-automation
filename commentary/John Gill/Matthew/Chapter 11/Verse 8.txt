<p><strong>But what went ye out for to see?</strong>.... Since it cannot be thought it was to see the reeds in the wilderness blow to and fro by the wind, or a man like one of them, either in gesture or doctrine; was it to see</p>
<p><strong>a man clothed in soft raiment?</strong> In raiment made of soft materials, as fine wool, cotton, silk, c. such as Mecaenos wore, and who was therefore called Malacinus y: one finely dressed, and richly apparelled, draws the eyes of persons to him but such an one is not to be expected in a wilderness: and if the Jews went to see such a person, they were greatly disappointed; for John's raiment was of camel's hair, undressed, and he had a leathern girdle about his loins; and as for his diet, it was locusts and wild honey: no,</p>
<p><strong>behold they that wear soft clothing</strong>, or, as Luke says, are "gorgeously apparelled"; to which he adds,</p>
<p><strong>and live delicately, are in kings' houses</strong>, or "courts"; not in a desert, where John came preaching, nor in a prison, where he now was: he was no light, inconstant, flattering person, as generally courtiers are; had he, he would not have been in a prison; it was for his uprightness and faithfulness, in reproving Herod the king, that he was in such a place and condition. Thus from his very garb and diet, his character is vindicated from the charge of levity and change.</p>
