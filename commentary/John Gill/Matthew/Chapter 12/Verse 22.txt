<p><strong>Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil</strong>,.... About this time, or some little time after, when he was returned from the sea of Galilee, and was come into a certain house; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:19">Mark 3:19</span> some persons brought him a demoniac, in compassion to the possessed man, and being persuaded of the power of Christ to heal him by the late cures he had performed. A like instance we have in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:32">Matthew 9:32</span>, which had a like effect upon the people, and cavilled at by the Pharisees in much the same way; and which cavils were answered in much the same words; and yet the case is not the same; for that man was only dumb, but this both</p>
<p><strong>blind and dumb</strong>; not by birth, or through the defect of nature, or by any natural distemper that had attended him, but through the malice of Satan, by divine permission; his blindness, and dumbness, were the effects of his being possessed with a devil, who had deprived him of his sight, and speech. The word rendered "dumb", signifies both deaf and dumb, and answers to the Hebrew word חרש, which sometimes m is used of a deaf man only, who can speak, but not hear; and often of one that can neither speak, nor hear; which is the case of such as are born deaf: it seems as if this man could hear, though he could not speak; since no mention is made of his want of hearing, or of Christ's restoring it to him; for it follows,</p>
<p><strong>and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb, both spake and saw</strong>. This he did, not by making use of medicines, but by a word speaking, dispossessing Satan; so that the cause of blindness and dumbness being removed, the effects ceased, and the man was restored to his sight, and speech, as before. He had his sight to behold his Saviour, and a tongue to praise his name: so when men are turned from Satan unto God, and are delivered from his thraldom and bondage, they are brought into marvellous light, and put into a capacity of showing forth the praises of God.</p>
