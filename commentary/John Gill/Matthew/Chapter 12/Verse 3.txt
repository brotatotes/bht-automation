<p><strong>But he said unto them, have ye not read</strong>,.... If they had not read the Scriptures, they were very unfit persons either to be teachers, or censurers of others, and must have been very slothful and negligent; and if they had, they could not but have observed the case of David, which Christ produces in vindication of his disciples:</p>
<p><strong>what David did when he was an hungred</strong>; which was the case of the disciples, and is therefore mentioned; it being also the circumstance which could, and did excuse what was done by David and his men: and the Jews themselves own, that in case of hunger the showbread might be eaten, by those that were not priests; not only that which was removed from the table, but that which was upon it; yea, even when there was none to put in its room l; and that David was in the utmost distress, and therefore desired it, and it was granted him on that account. They represent him as thus saying to the priest m,</p>
<p>"when he found there was none but showbread, give it me, that we may not die with hunger; שספק נפשות דוחה שבת, "for danger of life drives away the sabbath";''</p>
<p>which perfectly agrees with our Lord's argument, and justifies the apostles conduct: and this was not a single fact of David's, but of others also;</p>
<p><strong>and they that were with him</strong>; for though in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+21:1">1 Samuel 21:1</span> he is said to be "alone, and no man with him"; yet this must be understood either comparatively, having but very few with him, and which were as none, considering his dignity; or thus, though none came with him to Ahimelech, pretending to the priest he had a secret affair of the king's to transact; and therefore had left his servants in a certain place, and desires bread for himself and them; concerning whom the priest and he discourses, as may be seen in the place referred to: so that though no man was with him at the priest's house, yet there were some with him, and who partook with him in eating of the showbread.</p>
