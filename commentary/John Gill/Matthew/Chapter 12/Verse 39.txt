<p><strong>But he answered and said unto them</strong>,.... Not to the Pharisees, who were unworthy of an answer from him; having, in such an imperious manner, and with a sole view to tempt him, and after such miracles were wrought by him, required of him a sign from heaven; but to the multitude, the throng of people gathered thick together on this occasion, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:45">Matthew 12:45</span> he turns himself from the Scribes and Pharisees, to the common people, and says to them concerning the former,</p>
<p><strong>an evil and adulterous generation</strong>; not only in a spiritual sense, being degenerated from the faith, religion, and piety of their ancestors; but literally, which appeared not only in their polygamy, and frequent divorces on trivial occasions, but by criminal conversation with other women; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:9">John 8:9</span> and this, with the Jews themselves, is a character of the generation in which the Messiah comes: for they say h,</p>
<p>"that just when the Messiah comes, or in the age the son of David comes, "impudence shall be increased", corn and wine shall be dear, the government shall be heretics, לזנות</p>
<p>בית וועד יהיה, "and the synagogue shall become a brothel house".''</p>
<p>Their meaning is, that the chief magistrates should be Sadducees, and those that pretended to religion and holiness would be adulterers, which was now the case. Their writings i frequently speak of the increase and abounding of adulteries, under the second temple, and about this time; which obliged Jochanan ben Zaccai and the sanhedrim, to leave off the use of the bitter waters.</p>
<p><strong>Seeketh after a sign</strong>; this is perfectly Talmudic language, the language of the Jews k.</p>
<p>"The disciples of R. Jose ben Kismai, asked him, when the Son of David came? He replied, I am afraid, lest ממני אות</p>
<p>תבקשו, "ye should seek of me a sign"; they say unto him, we will not "seek of thee a sign".''</p>
<p>This the Jews sought of Christ, time after time; not content with one, sought another, though such wonderful ones were wrought, which most fully demonstrated him to be the Messiah; and therefore he would not indulge this temper in them; but declared, that</p>
<p><strong>there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas</strong>. Not that no miracles should afterwards be wrought amongst them; for, after this, many wondrous works were done by Christ; but no such signs should be given they desired, not one from heaven; but one particularly should be given them, out of the earth, and should be, not for their conviction, but condemnation; and would seem very much like that which was done to the prophet Jonas, or Jonah; for so is his name in the Hebrew language, the other being the Greek termination of it.</p>
