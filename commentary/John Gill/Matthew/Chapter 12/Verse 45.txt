<p><strong>Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits</strong>,.... This is said in allusion to, and in imitation of the seven spirits before the throne; or may denote a large number of devils, seven being a number of perfection; or else the various corruptions of a man's heart, the swarms of internal lusts which are there stirred up by Satan;</p>
<p><strong>more wicked than himself</strong>, as these are more pernicious to man, than the devil himself:</p>
<p><strong>and they enter in and dwell there</strong>; that is, though they were there before, now they exert and show themselves, and such men appear to be under the power and government of them; when leaving their seeming religion and holiness, they return like the dog to the vomit, and the swine to the wallowing in the mire.</p>
<p><strong>And the last state of that man is worse than the first</strong>: he becomes more wicked than ever he was, before he made pretensions to religion; as such apostates generally are more extravagant in sinning, and are seldom or ever recovered by repentance, and their last end is eternal damnation; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:20">2 Peter 2:20</span></p>
<p><strong>even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation</strong>. This parable fitly suited them, the Scribes and Pharisees, and the men of that generation, from whom in some measure the unclean spirit might be said to depart through the doctrine, and miracles of Christ, to go into the Gentile world; but being followed there with the preaching of the Gospel by the apostles, returns to the Jews, and fills them with more malice, blasphemy, and blindness, than ever, which issued in their utter ruin and destruction; of which this parable may be justly thought to be prophetical.</p>
