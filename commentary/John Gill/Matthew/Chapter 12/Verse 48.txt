<p><strong>But he answered and said unto him that told him</strong>,.... Of his mother and brethren being without doors, desiring, and waiting to speak to him,</p>
<p><strong>Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</strong> These questions are put, not as if he himself was ignorant who were his mother or his brethren; or as suggesting as if he had none; or as denying that these were in such a relation to him; or as casting any slight upon them; or as intending to teach men disrespect to parents and kindred, according to the flesh; but as displeased with the man, or men, for interrupting him in his work; and to let them know, that the business of his heavenly Father was preferred by him to any his natural relations could have with him; and that he might have an opportunity of pointing out who were his relations in a spiritual sense.</p>
