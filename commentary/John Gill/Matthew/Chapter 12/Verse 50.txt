<p><strong>For whosoever shall do the will of my Father</strong>,.... This is not to be understood of a perfect obedience to the will of God, revealed in his righteous law; for since this cannot be performed by any mere man, no one could be in such a spiritual relation to Christ: but of the obedience of faith to the will of God, revealed in the Gospel; which is to believe in Christ, and have everlasting life; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:40">John 6:40</span>. This is the will of Christ's Father,</p>
<p><strong>which is in heaven</strong>, and which is good news from heaven, to sinners on earth; and which Christ came down from heaven to do, and to declare to the children of men: such as "hear the word of God and do it", as Luke says, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:21">Luke 8:21</span> that is, hear the Gospel, understand and believe it, and become obedient to the faith of it; these are in this near manner related to Christ, evidentially and openly, as well as those who were now present:</p>
<p><strong>the same is my brother, and sister, and mother</strong>; as dear to me, as such are to those, to whom they stood thus related in the flesh: and these natural relations serve to convey some ideas of that relation, union, nearness, and communion, there are between Christ and his people; all these relative characters may be observed in the book of Solomon's Song, to which our Lord may be reasonably thought to have respect; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="so+3:11">Song of Solomon 3:11</span>.</p>
