<p><strong>But if ye had known what this meaneth</strong>, c,] The passage of Scripture in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:6">Hosea 6:6</span></p>
<p><strong>I will have mercy, and not sacrifice</strong> of the sense of which,</p>
<p><strong>see Gill "Mt 9:13"</strong></p>
<p><strong>ye would not have condemned the guiltless</strong>. Our Lord taxes the Pharisees both with ignorance of the Scriptures, in which they pretended to be very knowing, and took upon them to be the interpreters of; and with inhumanity, for condemning innocent persons, the apostles, for rubbing a few ears of corn, for the refreshment of nature; which they would never have done, had they understood the word, and will of God; who prefers acts of humanity, compassion, and mercy, to the observance of rites and ceremonies; or had they the common affections of human nature, and those bowels of compassion which one man ought to show to another.</p>
