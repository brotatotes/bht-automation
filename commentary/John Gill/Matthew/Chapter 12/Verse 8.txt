<p><strong>For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.</strong> By "the Son of man" is meant, not any man, as some have thought; for no mere man is lord of any law, moral or ritual, natural or positive; or has a power of disposing of it, and dispensing with it at pleasure; but Christ himself; which is the constant sense of this phrase in the New Testament, and is a character of the Messiah in the old, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span> who, as he was the institutor of the sabbath among the Jews, that being a ritual, and of mere positive institution, could dispense with it, and even abrogate it at his pleasure. The Jews so far agree to this, that he that commanded the law of the sabbath, could dispense with it; they say z, that</p>
<p>"the day on which Jericho was taken was the sabbath day; and that though they slew and burnt on the sabbath day,</p>
<p>מי שצוה על השבת צוה לחלל שבת, "he that commanded the observation of the sabbath, commanded the profanation of it".''</p>
<p>And since Christ is greater than the temple, and has all the perfections of the divine nature in him, is equal to the Father in power and glory; and even as mediator, has all power in heaven and earth given him; so as he is Lord of all other things, he is of the sabbath, and has a power of dispensing with it, and even of abolishing it; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:16">Colossians 2:16</span> and since the Lord of the sabbath had a power of dispensing with it, and made use of it in the cases of David and his men, and of the priests in the temple formerly; the Pharisees ought not to think it strange, that the Son of man, who is equally Lord of the sabbath, dispensed with it in his disciples now.</p>
