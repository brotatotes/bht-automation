<p><strong>The same day Jesus went out of the house</strong>,.... Where he had been preaching, and working miracles: where this house was, is not certain; it seems to have been in one of the cities of Galilee, probably Capernaum, since that was by the sea coast: the reason of his going out of the house was, either to converse with his mother and brethren, as they desired; or to withdraw himself from company, and take some refreshment by the sea side; or because it would not hold the people, and therefore he quitted it for a more convenient place. The time he went out of it, was the same day he had cast the devil out of the man blind and dumb, and had delivered himself so freely concerning the Scribes and Pharisees, who had blasphemously ascribed that miracle to the assistance of Satan; and the same day his mother and brethren came to see him, and speak to him.</p>
<p><strong>And sat by the sea side</strong>; either as weary, and for his refreshment, or in order to preach to the people; for, Mark says, "he began again to teach by the sea side", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:1">Mark 4:1</span>. This was the sea of Galilee, sometimes called the sea of Tiberias.</p>
