<p><strong>He said unto them, an enemy has done this</strong>,.... This is the answer of the householder to the question of his servants. In the Greek text it is, "an enemy man"; and is so rendered in the several versions; meaning, not that the enemy was a man; for he was the devil, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:39">Matthew 13:39</span> but it is an Hebraism; such as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="es+7:6">Esther 7:6</span>, איש צר ואויב, "the man adversary and enemy" is this wicked Haman; and signifies a certain enemy, and one indeed that is an implacable enemy to man.</p>
<p><strong>The servants said unto him, wilt thou then that we go and gather them up</strong>? which words express the concern of the ministers of Christ for the true members of the church, comparable to wheat, lest they should receive any damage by the ill examples, and pernicious principles of evil men among them; also their detestation and abhorrence of men of wicked lives and erroneous principles; they cannot bear them which are evil; likewise, they show great regard to the glory of God, and interest of religion, and their readiness to execute any orders Christ should give them; but not willing to proceed of themselves, ask counsel and advice of him.</p>
