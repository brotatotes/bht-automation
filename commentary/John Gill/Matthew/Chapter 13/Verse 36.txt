<p><strong>Then Jesus sent the multitude away</strong>,.... That his disciples might have the opportunity of conversing with him alone, about the sense of the parables he had delivered; and that he might instruct them by some others hereafter mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>And went into the house</strong>: left the ship in which he had been preaching to the multitude, came on shore, and returned to the house he came out of, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:1">Matthew 13:1</span></p>
<p><strong>and his disciples came to him</strong>; and being alone, make an humble request to him,</p>
<p><strong>saying, declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field</strong>: by which they mean, not a rehearsal of it, but an explication of the sense and meaning of it: they ask nothing about the parables of the mustard seed and leaven, either because they better understood them; or because there were some things very remarkable and striking in this, which made them very desirous to be particularly informed of the several parts of it, and their meaning.</p>
