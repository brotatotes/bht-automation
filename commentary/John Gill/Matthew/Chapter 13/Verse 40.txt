<p><strong>As therefore the tares are gathered</strong>,.... As it is represented in the parable, that in the time of harvest, the tares shall be gathered out from the wheat first; and being bound in bundles, shall be</p>
<p><strong>burnt in the fire</strong>, prepared for that purpose,</p>
<p><strong>so shall it be in the end of this world</strong>; hypocritical and heretical men, and all formal professors, shall be gathered out from among the saints, and the several churches, among whom they have been; and shall be together cast into everlasting burnings, prepared for the devil and his angels, whose children they are.</p>
