<p><strong>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun</strong>,.... The time referred to is, when the tares shall be separated from the wheat: when they that offend and do iniquity, shall be gathered out of Christ's kingdom; when the wicked shall be cast into hell: then the "righteous", not who are so merely in their own apprehensions, and in the judgment of others; nor by their obedience, legal or evangelical; but who are made so, by the righteousness of Christ imputed to them: these, though they have been in this world loaded with reproaches, and attended with many afflictions and persecutions; and have been despised for their poverty and meanness, and want of outward glory, honour, riches, and prosperity; shall now "shine forth" in the robe of Christ's righteousness, in perfect holiness of nature, in all felicity and prosperity of soul; and in the shining dazzling robes of glory, incorruption, and immortality, on their bodies; even</p>
<p><strong>as the sun</strong>, having no spot in them, or upon them, and without any clouds of darkness: they will be as Christ himself, the sun of righteousness, with whom, and in whose glory they shall appear, both in soul and body,</p>
<p><strong>in the kingdom of their father</strong>; meaning either the same with the kingdom of Christ, the Father's and his, being one and the same; or as distinct from Christ's, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:41">Matthew 13:41</span> the church, and the government of it in this world, in all ages of time, and especially in the latter day, and during the thousand years, Christ and his saints shall reign together, may be peculiarly called the kingdom of Christ; when it will be delivered to the Father, and God shall be all in all: so that the ultimate glory may, though not to the exclusion of the Son, be styled the kingdom of the Father; of God, who is the Father of Christ and of his people; and which is observed, to assure the saints of their interest in it, right unto it, and certain enjoyment of it. Some copies read, "the kingdom of heaven". Much the same images, here made use of, to set forth the glory of the saints, both in soul and body, in the world to come, are expressed by the Jews.</p>
<p>"The faces of the "righteous", they say, h in time to come, shall be דומות לחמה, "like to the sun", and moon, to the stars and planets, and lightnings, and lilies, and to the lamp of the sanctuary.''</p>
<p>And elsewhere i they observe, that</p>
<p>"God in time to come, will beautify the body of "the righteous", as the beauty of the first man, when he entered into paradise, according to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+58:11">Isaiah 58:11</span> and that the soul, whilst in its dignity, shall be sustained with the superior light, and be clothed with it; and when it shall enter into the body hereafter, it shall enter with that light; and then shall the body shine, כזהר הרקיע, "as the brightness of the firmament": as is said in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:3">Daniel 12:3</span>'</p>
<p>And a little after k it is said, that when</p>
<p>"the soul goes out, the body is left, which shall be there built again, כנהרא דשמשא, "as the light of the sun", and as the brightness of the firmament.''</p>
<p><strong>Who hath ears to hear, let him hear</strong>; and seriously consider of the several things said in this parable, concerning the wheat and tares, the righteous and the wicked, as being matters of the greatest moment and importance.</p>
