<p><strong>So shall it be at the end of the world</strong>,.... As the fisherman, when he has drawn his net to shore, picks out the good fish, and puts them into proper vessels, and casts the dead, putrid, and useless fish away; so, at the close of time, in the last day,</p>
<p><strong>the angels shall come forth</strong> out of heaven, from the presence of God and Christ, and by his orders, as the judge of all the earth,</p>
<p><strong>and sever the wicked from the just</strong>; with whom they have had not only civil conversation, but have been joined in a Gospel church state; but now these ungodly shall not stand in judgment with them; nor these sinners, these hypocrites, in the congregation of the righteous: the one will be set at Christ's right hand, the other at his left; the one will go into life eternal, and the other into everlasting punishment; and their separation from one another will be for ever.</p>
