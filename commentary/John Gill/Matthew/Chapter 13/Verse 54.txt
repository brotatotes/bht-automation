<p><strong>And when he was come into his own country</strong>,.... Not where he was born, Bethlehem, for it is never observed, that he went thither; but where he was educated, and where his parents and near relations, according to the flesh, lived; who had been some little time ago seeking for him, and desirous of speaking with him, even Nazareth:</p>
<p><strong>he taught them in their synagogue</strong>, it being the sabbath day; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:1">Mark 6:1</span>. The Vulgate Latin, and all the Eastern versions, the Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic, and Munster's Hebrew Gospel read, "in their synagogues"; but as Nazareth was so mean and obscure a place, it is not likely that there should be in it more synagogues than one; and of no more do we read in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:16">Luke 4:16</span> where an account is given of Christ's preaching in this place before this time.</p>
<p><strong>Insomuch that they were astonished</strong>; at the doctrines he taught, which were new and unheard of to them; and were delivered in such a graceful manner, and with so much power and authority; and also at the miracles he wrought, in confirmation of what he delivered; and said,</p>
<p><strong>whence hath this man this wisdom and these mighty works</strong>? They knew his education, how that he had not been put to school, had never learned letters of men, or received any instructions from their learned doctors; and therefore could not imagine, how he came by such sublime and divine knowledge, and by what power he performed such wonderful things; looking upon him to be a mere man, and a very mean, and contemptible one: not knowing that he was the wisdom of God, and the power of God; which had they been acquainted with, there would have been no room, nor reason, for such questions.</p>
