<p><strong>And some fell among thorns</strong>,.... On a spot of ground which was full of the roots of thorns, and briars, which was not cleared of them as it should be. We often read e of שדה שנתקוצה, "a field cleared of thorns"; but such was not this piece of ground, it was overrun with them, not on the surface of the earth, but within it: for it follows,</p>
<p><strong>and the thorns sprung up</strong>: naturally, being neither sown nor planted; either before the seed, or, at least, as soon; and however grew faster, and higher,</p>
<p><strong>and choked them</strong>; so that they came to nothing; hence the advice, "sow not among thorns", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+4:3">Jeremiah 4:3</span> and a lost kindness, or what is bestowed in vain, is expressed in this proverbial manner f, אחיזרי</p>
<p>שקולה טיבותיך ושדיא, "thy beneficence is taken away, and cast among thorns": these point out such hearers who seemed to be contrite, to have the low ground of their hearts broken up, their consciences tender, and to have a true sense of sin, as well as to be outwardly reformed; and yet inwardly were full of the thorns of sinful lusts, particularly of the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, the lusts of other things, and the pleasures of this life, which rendered the word useless and unfruitful; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:22">Matthew 13:22</span> all which are comparable to thorns; it is hardly possible to be in the midst of, and meddle with these, without being scratched by them; they pierce, afflict, and wound, even where they have not their greatest power and influence; and where they do prevail, and get the ascendant, as they are fruitless themselves, they make others so too; they choke the word, and make that, and all ordinances, and opportunities, useless, and unserviceable. Thorns are a part of the earth's curse for the sin of man; and such persons in whom thorny cares and lusts prevail, as they are like unto the earth which beareth thorns, so, as that, they are rejected, and nigh to cursing, whose end is to be burned in everlasting flames of divine wrath and fury, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:8">Hebrews 6:8</span>.</p>
