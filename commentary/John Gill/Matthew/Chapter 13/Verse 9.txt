<p><strong>Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</strong> Not externally only, but internally; he that has ears given him to hear, so as to understand, let him make use of them, and seriously consider of, and diligently attend to the use and importance of this parable. It is a way of speaking used by Christ, when anything of moment was delivered, and not so easy to be understood, on purpose to quicken the attention of his auditors, and stir up in them a desire of understanding what was said; which effect this had upon his disciples; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:10">Mark 4:10</span>.</p>
