<p><strong>And he sent</strong>,.... "An executioner", as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:27">Mark 6:27</span> where the Latin word "speculator", or as it is sometimes written "spiculator", is used; and is the name of an officer concerned in executions, and particularly in beheading of persons; and so is used by Latin writers.</p>
<p>"In a civil war (says x Seneca), a servant hid his master that was proscribed; and when he had fitted his rings for himself, and put on his clothes, he met "speculatoribus", the "speculators"; he told them he desired nothing, but that they would perform their orders, and immediately stretched out his neck.''</p>
<p>And the same writer elsewhere y speaks of a soldier that was condemned by Piso, on suspicion of murdering his fellow soldier;</p>
<p>"Who was had without the camp, and as soon as he stretched out his neck, he, who was thought to be killed, suddenly appeared; upon which the centurion that had the management of the execution, ordered "speculatorem", the "speculator", to put up his sword, and returned the condemned person to Piso.''</p>
<p>The word is also used by the Jewish doctors, and in the same sense: take the following instance among many z.</p>
<p>"R. Ishmael said to R. Simeon ben Gamaliel (when they were both apprehended, in order to be executed), brother, there was a man ready to receive his blow, and they entreated</p>
<p>לאספקלטור, "the speculator": one said, I am a priest, the son of an high priest, slay me first, that I may not see the death of my companion; and the other said to him, I am a prince, the son of a prince, slay me first, that I may not see the death of my companion: he replied unto them, cast lots; and they cast lots, and the lot fell on R. Simeon ben Gamaliel; immediately he took a sword, "and cut off his head".''</p>
<p>And as this word is often used by them a for an executioner, so</p>
<p>ספקולא, "specula" is often made mention of by them b, as a sort of punishment by death: and such an officer was sent by Herod, to inflict this punishment upon John; who accordingly executed it,</p>
<p><strong>and beheaded John in the prison</strong>; that is, of Machoeras, where he lay, without giving him a hearing, or allowing him to speak for himself, or with his friends: and which was done in this private manner, partly for dispatch, and partly on account of the people; who it might have been feared, had the execution been public and known, would have rose and rescued him.</p>
