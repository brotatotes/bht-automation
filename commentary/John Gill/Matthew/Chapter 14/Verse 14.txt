<p><strong>And Jesus went forth</strong>,.... Either from the mountain where he sat with his disciples, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:3">John 6:3</span> or out of the desert, where he had retired for secrecy; or out of the ship, which seems best, the company having got thither before his landing:</p>
<p><strong>and saw a great multitude</strong>; for, there were about five thousand men, beside women and children, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:21">Matthew 14:21</span></p>
<p><strong>and was moved with compassion toward them</strong>: partly on account of their bodily infirmities, which were very many and great; and partly on account of the bad situation they were in, through want of spiritual pastors to feed them with the bread of life; for Mark gives this as the reason, moving his compassion, "because they were as sheep, not having a shepherd": all which shows the truth of Christ's human nature; proves him to be a merciful high priest, and one truly concerned for both the bodies and souls of men:</p>
<p><strong>and he healed their sick</strong>; which they brought along with them, and that without the use of any medicine, by a word speaking: so that as the former phrase gives proof of his humanity, this attests his divinity: but this was not all he did, he not only healed their bodies, but he taught them the doctrines of the Gospel; and spake to them concerning the kingdom of God, for the good of their souls, as the other evangelists relate.</p>
