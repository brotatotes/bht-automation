<p><strong>But Jesus said unto them</strong>,.... the disciples,</p>
<p><strong>they need not depart</strong>; meaning so long as he was with them, who had power enough to provide a sufficient meal for them, as well as by a word speaking, to heal their diseases; however, to try their faith, and make way for the working of the following miracle, he says to them,</p>
<p><strong>give ye them to eat</strong>; such provisions as you have along with you.</p>
