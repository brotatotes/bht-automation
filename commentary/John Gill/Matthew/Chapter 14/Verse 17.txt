In order to excuse themselves, and to show the impossibility of feeding such a large number of people;we have here but five loaves; and these barley ones, coarse bread;and two fishes; small ones, which were dried and salted, and fit for present eating; which they either brought along with them for their own refreshment, or rather, were brought thither by a boy to sell, as is usual where a great concourse of people are got together: these words seem to be spoken by Andrew, Simon Peter's brother; who added, "but what are they among so many?" see John 6:8 not thinking of the power of Christ, who was able to multiply, and make this provision a sufficiency for the whole company.
