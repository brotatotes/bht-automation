<p><strong>And said unto his servants</strong>,.... Those of his household, his courtiers, with whom he more familiarly conversed; to these he expressed his fears, that it might be true what was suggested by the people, and he was ready to believe it himself;</p>
<p><strong>this is John the Baptist</strong>: some copies add, "whom I have beheaded", as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:16">Mark 6:16</span> the guilt of which action rose in his mind, lay heavy on him, and filled him with horror and a thousand fears:</p>
<p><strong>he is risen from the dead</strong>; which if he was a Sadducee, as he is thought to be, by comparing <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:6">Matthew 16:6</span> with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:15">Mark 8:15</span> was directly contrary to his former sentiments, and was extorted from him by his guilty conscience; who now fears, what before he did not believe; and what he fears, he affirms; concluding that John was raised from the dead, to give proof of his innocence, and to revenge his death on him:</p>
<p><strong>and therefore mighty works do show themselves in him</strong>, or "are wrought by him"; for though he wrought no miracles in his lifetime, yet, according to a vulgar notion, that after death men are endued with a greater power, Herod thought this to be the case; or that he was possessed of greater power, on purpose to punish him for the murder of him; and that these miracles which were wrought by him, were convincing proofs of the truth of his resurrection, and of what he was able to do to him, and what he might righteously expect from him.</p>
