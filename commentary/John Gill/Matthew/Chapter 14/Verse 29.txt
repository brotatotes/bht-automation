<p><strong>And he said, come</strong>,.... This he said, partly to assure them who he was; for had he denied him, he and the rest might have concluded, it was none of Jesus; and partly to commend his love, and confirm his faith, by giving a further instance of his power, in enabling him to walk upon the water, as he did:</p>
<p><strong>and when Peter was come down out of the ship</strong>; as he immediately did, having orders from Christ; and being by this second speech fully convinced it was he</p>
<p><strong>he walked on the water</strong>; a little way, being supported and enabled by the power of Christ; for this was an extraordinary and miraculous action: for if it was so in Christ, it was much more so in Peter: Christ walked upon the water by his own power, as God; Peter walked upon the water, being held up by the power of Christ. The Jews w indeed, call swimming השיטה על פני המים, "walking upon the face of the waters": hence we read of a swimmer's vessel, which is explained to be what men make to learn in it, how על פני המים</p>
<p>לשוט, "to go or walk upon the face of the waters" x; but then this is not going upon them upright, but prone, or lying along upon the surface of the waters, which was not Peter's case; he did not, as at another time, cast himself into the sea, and swim to Christ; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:7">John 21:7</span> but as soon as he came down from the ship, standing upright, he walked upon the waters,</p>
<p><strong>to go to Jesus</strong>; not merely for walking sake, but for the sake of Christ, he dearly loved; that he might be with him, and be still more confirmed of the truth of its being he, and not a spirit.</p>
