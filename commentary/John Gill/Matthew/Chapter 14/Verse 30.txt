<p><strong>But when he saw the wind boisterous</strong>,.... Or "strong", blowing hard against him, and raising up the waves, which beat with great violence upon him,</p>
<p><strong>he was afraid</strong>; though Christ was so nigh him, and he had had such an instance of his power in bearing him up, causing him to walk upon the waters thus far; which shows, that his faith was imperfect:</p>
<p><strong>and beginning to sink</strong>; through fear, and the violence of the wind and waves, just ready to be immersed, and go down to the bottom of the sea,</p>
<p><strong>he cried</strong>; being in a great fright and much danger, and with great importunity and eagerness,</p>
<p><strong>saying, Lord, save me</strong>: I am just going, I shall certainly perish else; still having so much faith in Christ, that he was able to save him in the last extremity.</p>
