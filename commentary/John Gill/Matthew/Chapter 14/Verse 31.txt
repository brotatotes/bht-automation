<p><strong>And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand</strong>,.... The Syriac reads it, וברשעתה, "and in that very moment"; for his case requires immediate assistance, and Christ readily gave it; he reached out his hand at once, being just by him,</p>
<p><strong>and caught him</strong>; as he was sinking to the bottom, and lifted him up, and set him on his feet upon the water, and enabled him to walk with him to the ship; but not without reproving him for the weakness of his faith,</p>
<p><strong>and said unto him, O thou of little faith</strong>: he does not say, O thou unbeliever! or, O thou who hast no faith! for some faith he had, though but small; of this phrase, See Gill "Mt 6:30".</p>
<p><strong>Wherefore didst thou doubt</strong>? waver, fluctuate, or wast divided between faith and fear. He was worthy of reproof, since he had had the order of Christ to come to him upon the water; and an experience of his power in supporting him thus far; and was now so near unto him, that he had no room to doubt, whether it was he or not, nor of his power to preserve him.</p>
