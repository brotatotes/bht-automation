<p><strong>And when they were gone over</strong>,.... That is, "the sea", as Munster's Hebrew Gospel adds, the sea of Tiberias, or Galilee;</p>
<p><strong>they came into the land of Gennesaret</strong>; the same with Cinnereth, or Chinnereth, or Cinnerot, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+34:11">Numbers 34:11</span> in all which places, the Chaldee paraphrase renders it by גינוסר, "Ginusar", the same word that is used in Munster's Hebrew Gospel here: it was a country in Galilee, in the tribe of Naphtali y, bordering upon a lake, called the lake of Gennesaret; taking its name from the country, or the country from the lake: it was exceeding fruitful, full of gardens and orchards; hence we often read in the Talmud z, of פירות גנוסר, "the fruits of Genusar", or Gennesaret, which are said to be exceeding sweet: and it is said to a be a country in the land of Israel, in which were many gardens; and by others b, a place in the land of Galilee (as it was) whose fruits were large and good; and was, as Josephus says c, thirty furlongs long and twenty broad. And thus the saints, after a long and troublesome passage over the sea of this world, arrive, at last, safe at their desired haven, and enter upon a most delightful country, a paradise, a garden of pleasure; where all delicious fruits and desirable things are enjoyed, even pleasures for evermore; where they shall be led to fountains of living waters, into fulness of joy; where all troubles will cease, and tears will be wiped away; and when they will have leisure and capacity to reflect upon all they have met with in their dangerous, and difficult voyage; and will admire the wonderful grace of God, which has been with them; and his divine power, which has appeared for them, and supported them, and brought them safe to eternal glory; and they ascribe greatness to Christ, as the Son of God, and for ever worship him as the eternal Jehovah, who has done such great things for them, as none but God can do.</p>
