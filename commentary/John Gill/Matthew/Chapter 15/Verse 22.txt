<p><strong>And behold a woman of Canaan</strong>,.... That is, of Phoenicia, which was called Canaan; so Shaul, the son of a Canaanitish woman, is, by the Septuagint in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+6:15">Exodus 6:15</span> called the son of a Phoenician; and the kings of Canaan are, by the same interpreters in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jos+5:1">Joshua 5:1</span> called kings of Phoenicia: hence this woman is by Mark said to be a Greek, that is, a Gentile, as the Jews used to call all of another nation, and a Syrophenician, being a native of Phoenicia, called Syrophenician; because it bordered upon Syria, and had been formerly a part of it, by conquest: so Cadmus, who is reported to have first brought letters from Phoenicia to Greece, is called i a Syrophenician merchant.</p>
<p><strong>Came out of the same coasts</strong>; being an inhabitant, it is very likely, either of Tyre or Sidon: this shows that Christ did not go into these places, but only to the borders of them, since she is said to come out of them to him; who, having heard of him, and the miraculous cures wrought by him, and being informed that he was near, at such a place, as the Persic version says, "suddenly came forth out of a corner"; and the Ethiopic reads it, "out of the mountains thereof"; and made to the house where he was privately retired, and would have hid himself, as Mark suggests,</p>
<p><strong>and cried unto him</strong>; with a loud voice, with much vehemency, being in great distress,</p>
<p><strong>saying, have mercy on me</strong>; meaning, by curing her daughter, with whose case she was so much affected, that she made it, as it were, her own:</p>
<p><strong>O Lord, thou son of David</strong>. The first of these characters expresses her faith in his power, dominion, and government, that all persons and things, and so all diseases were at his command, and control; and that being Lord of all, he could remove them at his pleasure: the other shows her knowledge and belief of him, as the Messiah, that being a name by which he was usually known by the Jews;</p>
<p>See Gill "Mt 1:1" and which she, though a Gentile, might come at the knowledge of, either through being a proselyte to the Jewish religion, or through a general report which might reach, especially the neighbouring nations, that the Jews expected a wonderful deliverer to arise among them, under this character of the son of David; and from what she had heard of him, she concluded he must be the person.</p>
<p><strong>My daughter is grievously vexed with a devil</strong>, which had took possession of her, and most grievously afflicted her: and her request to him was, that he would cast him out of her: believing he had power so to do, without seeing or touching her, only by a word speaking: her faith was like that of the centurion's.</p>
