<p><strong>And Jesus saith unto them</strong>,.... In a very mild and gentle manner, taking no notice of their stupidity, nor upbraiding them with their forgetfulness of the late miracle, and willing to exercise their patience, and try their faith, asks,</p>
<p><strong>how many loaves have ye?</strong> meaning in the common stock, and which they brought along with them, for their own supply:</p>
<p><strong>and they said seven, and a few little fishes</strong>; which they mention as so small a provision, that it was as nothing for such multitudes; their loaves of bread were but seven, and their fishes, which were ready dressed, dried, or boiled, &amp;c. were few in number, and small, as to quantity and size.</p>
