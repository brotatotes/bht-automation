<p><strong>How is it that ye do not understand</strong>,.... That you should be so senseless and void of thought, after such instances, as to imagine, that I concerned myself about what bread you brought with you; one would think you could not but know,</p>
<p><strong>that I spake it not to you concerning bread</strong>, taken in a literal sense; but must be thought to speak figuratively and mystically, and to have an higher sense and meaning, when I said to you,</p>
<p><strong>that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the Sadducees</strong>; how could you think that I had any regard to the leaven taken in a literal sense, the Pharisees and Sadducees approve or disapprove of?</p>
