<p><strong>And Jesus rebuked the devil</strong>,.... The words may indeed be rendered, "and Jesus rebuked him, and the devil departed out of him"; so the Vulgate Latin, and the Oriental versions; but the sense our version gives is certainly right; for it was not the father of the child Christ rebuked for his unbelief; this he had done already; nor the lunatic himself, as some have thought, either for his unbelief, or because he was possessed by the devil, for some sins of his own; which is not likely, since he was so from a child, and perhaps not now in his right mind, and capable of any rebuke: besides, the Evangelists Mark, and Luke expressly say, that he "rebuked the foul", or "unclean spirit": for though it was a natural disease which attended this child, yet he was afflicted with it in a preternatural way, by the means of Satan; who, by divine permission; had a power of inflicting bodily diseases: and that this disease was effected by him, is clear from the manner of curing, by the dispossession of him; for when</p>
<p><strong>he departed out of him</strong>; at the command of Christ, whose power he could not withstand, but was obliged, whether he would or not, to obey;</p>
<p><strong>the child was cured from that very hour</strong>; directly, immediately, and continued well, and in good health. Hence the word rendered lunatic, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:15">Matthew 17:15</span> is in several Oriental versions, translated in the sense of "demoniac", or one possessed with a devil. The Arabic version renders it, "he is with a demon": the Persic thus, "on whom a demon hath power"; and the Ethiopic after this manner, "an evil demon takes hold on him". And it is usual with the Jews, to ascribe diseases to evil spirits; and perhaps this uncommon dispensation in the times of Christ, may give rise to such a notion; particularly, they ascribe this very same disease of the "epileptic", or "falling sickness", to the same cause, which they call x "Kordicus", or "Cardiacus", the "Cardiac" passion, which one of their commentators y explains thus.</p>
<p>"It is a disease which proceeds from the repletion of the vessels of the brain, whereby the understanding is confounded; wherefore it is one of the sorts חולי הנופל, "of the falling sickness".''</p>
<p>Says another z of them,</p>
<p>"It is שם שידה, "the name of a demon", that rules over such, that drink much wine out of the vat.''</p>
<p>To which others agree, saying a, that one attended with this disorder, is one,</p>
<p>"whose understanding is confounded, מחמת שד, "by means of a demon", who rules over such, that drink new wine; and lo! the spirit's name is "Kardiacus".''</p>
<p>From whence it is clear, that with them, the disease and the demon go by the same name; and that the former is from the latter.</p>
