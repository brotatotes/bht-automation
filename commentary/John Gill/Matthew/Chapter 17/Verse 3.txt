<p><strong>And behold there appeared unto them</strong>,.... The disciples:</p>
<p><strong>Moses and Elias</strong>; Moses the giver of the law, and Elias one of the chief of the prophets: one of them had been dead near a thousand and five hundred years, and the other had been caught up to heaven, about nine hundred years before this. The Jews sometimes speak of these two as together. They say c,</p>
<p>"that the Shekinah never descends below, but משה ואליהו, "Moses and Elias" ascend above.''</p>
<p>Yea, they expect that these two will come together in future time; for so they represent d a God saying to Moses;</p>
<p>"Moses, as thou hast given thy life for them (the Israelites) in this world, so in time to come (the days of the Messiah) when I shall bring Elias the prophet, כאחת</p>
<p>שניכם באין, "you two shall come together".''</p>
<p>Now they came. Luke says, they appeared "in glory": in glorious bodies, in a glory upon their bodies; like, though inferior, to the glorious body of Christ, now transfigured: that they appeared in their own real bodies, no doubt need be made; about the body of Elijah, or Elias, there is no difficulty; since he was carried soul and body to heaven, he died not, but was changed; and has ever since remained in a glorious body, in which he doubtless now appeared: and why this should not be the case of Moses, or why he should appear in another body, and not his own, I see not; for though he died, yet he was buried by the Lord, and no man ever knew the place of his sepulchre; and there was a dispute about his body, between Michael and the devil, all which are uncommon circumstances: so that it might be, that his body was, quickly after his death, raised and restored to him; or at this time, as a pledge of the resurrection of the dead, as Christ's transfiguration was of his glory. The Jews have a notion that Moses is not dead, but is ascended, and stands and ministers to God, in the highest heavens e: the appearance of these two with Christ, was to show, that Christ is the end of the law and prophets; that there is an entire agreement between him and them, and that they have their full accomplishment in him; and also shows, that he was neither Elias, nor any of the prophets, as some took him to be; since he was distinct from them, and the chief and more glorious than any of them. If it should be asked; how came the disciples to know these two to be Moses and Elias, since they never saw them before, nor could have any statues or pictures of them, these being not allowed among the Jews; nor do the accounts of them in Scripture seem to be sufficient to direct them to such a thought; especially, since by their glorification, they must be greatly altered: it may be replied, they knew them, either by immediate divine revelation, or by the discourse that passed between them and Christ; for it follows,</p>
<p><strong>talking with him</strong>. The Jews often speak of the appearance of Elias to their doctors, and of his conversing with them, and teaching them. Whether this is done with design to lessen the glory of this appearance, I will not say; however, they cannot reasonably object to the probability of this account, since they make it to be so frequent among themselves; though they look upon it as an high favour, and that such are holy good men, that are indulged with it, take an instance or two: thus they say f of a certain person,</p>
<p>"Lo! the pious man, whom Elias used משתעי בהדיה, "to converse with".''</p>
<p>And elsewhere it is said g,</p>
<p>"R. Phineas and R. Mari, the sons of R. Chasda, were godly men, ואליהו מדבר עמהם, "and Elias was talking with them", and they were priests.''</p>
<p>What Moses and Elias were talking with our Lord about, is expressed by Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
