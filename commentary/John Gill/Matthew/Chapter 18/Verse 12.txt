<p><strong>How think ye</strong>,.... Or, as the Arabic, "what do you think?" what is your opinion of this matter? what is your sense of it? how does it appear to you? It is a Talmudic way of speaking, the same with מה אתם סבורין "what do you think?" what is your judgment? So the Rabbins, after they have discussed a point among themselves, ask k, מאי סבירא לן, "what is our opinion?" or what do we think upon the whole? Christ here appeals to his disciples, makes them judges themselves in this matter, and illustrates it by a familiar instance of a man's seeking and finding his lost sheep, and rejoicing at it.</p>
<p><strong>If a man have an hundred sheep</strong>; who is the proprietor of them; not the hireling, who has them under his care, and whose the sheep are not; but the owner of them, to whom they belong, and who must be thought to be most concerned for anyone of them that should go astray: a hundred sheep seem to be the number of a flock; at least flocks of sheep used to be divided into hundreds. In a Maronite's will, a field is thus bequeathed l;</p>
<p>"the north part of it to such an one, and with it מאה צאן, "a hundred sheep", and a hundred vessels; and the south part of it to such an one, and with it מאה צאן, "a hundred sheep", and a hundred vessels; and he died, and the wise men confirmed his words, or his will.''</p>
<p>Such a supposition, or putting such a case as this, is very proper and pertinent.</p>
<p><strong>And one of them be gone astray</strong>; which sheep are very prone to; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+119:176">Psalms 119:176</span>;</p>
<p><strong>doth he not leave the ninety and nine</strong>, which are not gone astray, in the place where they are; it is usual so to do:</p>
<p><strong>and goeth into the mountains</strong>; alluding to the mountains of Israel, where were pastures for sheep, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:13">Ezekiel 34:13</span> and whither sheep are apt to wander, and go from mountain to mountain, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+50:6">Jeremiah 50:6</span>, and therefore these were proper places to go after them, and seek for them in: but the Vulgate Latin version joins the words "in" or "on the mountains", to the preceding clause, and reads,</p>
<p><strong>doth he not leave the ninety and nine in the mountains</strong>; and so read all the Oriental versions, Syriac, Arabic, Ethiopic, and Persic; and in the same manner Theophylact;</p>
<p><strong>and seeketh that which is gone astray</strong>? This is usual with men: no man that has a flock of sheep, and though but one strays from it, but takes this method. This parable now may be considered, either as an illustration of the Son of man's coming into this world, to seek, and to save his lost sheep, mentioned in the preceding verse; even the lost sheep of the house of Israel, the little ones that believed in him, who were despised by the Jews. And then by the "ninety and nine", we are not to understand the angels; who never went astray, never sinned, but kept their first estate, whom Christ left in the highest heavens, on the holy mountains of eternity, when he became incarnate, and came down on earth to redeem mankind: for these never go by the name of sheep; nor are they of the same nature and kind with the one that strays, and is sought out; nor is their number, with respect to men, as ninety nine to one; at least it cannot be ascertained; nor were they left by Christ, when he came on earth; for a multitude descended at his birth, and sung glory to God. Nor are the saints in heaven intended, whose state is safe; since it cannot be said of them, as in the following verse, that they went not astray; for they went astray like lost sheep, as others, and were looked up, sought out, and saved by Christ as others; but rather, by them, are meant the body of the Jewish nation, the far greater part of them, the Scribes and Pharisees, who rejected the Messiah, and despised those that believed in him: these were in sheep's clothing, of the flock of the house of Israel, of the Jewish fold; and with respect to the remnant among them, according to the election of grace, were as ninety nine to one: these were left by Christ, and taken no notice of by him, in comparison of the little ones, the lost sheep of the house of Israel he came to save: these he left on the mountains, on the barren pastures of Mount Sinai, feeding on their own works and services; or rather, he went into the mountains, or came leaping and skipping over them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="so+2:8">Song of Solomon 2:8</span>, encountering with, and surmounting all difficulties that lay in the way of the salvation of his people; such as appearing in the likeness of sinful flesh, bearing, and carrying the griefs and sorrows of his people, obeying the law, satisfying justice, bearing their sins, and undergoing an accursed death, in order to obtain the salvation of his chosen ones, designed by the one sheep "that was gone astray"; who strayed from God, from his law, the rule of their walk, out of his way, into the ways of sin, which are of their own choosing and approving: or, the intention of this parable is, to set forth the great regard God has to persons ever so mean, that believe in Christ, whom he would not have stumbled and offended, and takes special care of them, that they shall not perish; even as the proprietor of a flock of sheep is more concerned for one straying one, than for the other ninety nine that remain.</p>
