<p><strong>Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee</strong>,.... Which is as if he had said, observe what I am about to say, I do not agree to what thou sayest to fix the number, "until seven times only", but</p>
<p><strong>until seventy times seven</strong>; a certain number for an uncertain, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:24">Genesis 4:24</span>. Christ's meaning is, that a man should be all the days, and every day of his life, forgiving those that sin against him, as often as they repent and acknowledge their fault; and that no time is to be set for the exercise of the grace of forgiveness; but as often as there are objects and occasions, though ever so many and frequent, it should be used; and which he illustrates by the following parable.</p>
