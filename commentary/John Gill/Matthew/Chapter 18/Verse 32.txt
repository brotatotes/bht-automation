<p><strong>Then his Lord, after that he had called him</strong>,.... Or ordered him to be called, and brought before him,</p>
<p><strong>said unto him, O thou wicked servant</strong>! Munster's Hebrew Gospel reads, "thou servant of Belial"; thou cruel and hard hearted man to thy fellow servant, and ungrateful creature to me, on whom my goodness to thee has not made any impression, nor taken any effect:</p>
<p><strong>I forgave thee all that debt</strong>: all that vast debt of ten thousand talents, and that freely:</p>
<p><strong>because thou desiredst me</strong>: not to forgive the debt, but to have patience, and give time, and therefore unasked forgave the whole sum, every farthing of it; which was such an instance of pure goodness, as was enough to have wrought upon an heart of stone, and engaged the most tender concern and pity for a fellow creature, as well as filled with thankfulness to the kind benefactor. The favour so lately bestowed on him is justly observed as an aggravation of his wickedness.</p>
