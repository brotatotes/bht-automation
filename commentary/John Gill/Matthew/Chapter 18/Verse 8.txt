<p>Ver. 8, 9. <strong>Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot</strong>,.... The same words are repeated here on occasion of offences, as are spoken by Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29">Matthew 5:29</span> on account of unchaste looks, desires and lusts: giving offence to Christ's disciples, or endeavouring, by any means whatever, to cause them to stumble and fall, is equally gratifying the flesh, and no more to be indulged, than the other, on pain of eternal damnation. See Gill "Mt 5:29" See Gill "Mt 5:30"</p>
