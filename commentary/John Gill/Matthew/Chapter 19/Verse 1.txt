<p><strong>And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings</strong>,.... Concerning humility, avoiding offences, the methods to be taken in reproving offenders, and the forgiveness that is to be exercised towards them:</p>
<p><strong>he departed from Galilee</strong>; where he had chiefly preached and wrought his miracles, no more to return thither till after his resurrection:</p>
<p><strong>and came into the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan</strong>; that is, to that country which was called "beyond Jordan", and bordered on Judea; coming still nearer and nearer to Jerusalem, where he had told his disciples, a little while ago, he must come, and suffer, and die. Rather, it should be rendered, "on this side Jordan", as also in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:28">John 1:28</span> for the coasts of Judea were on this side; so</p>
<p>עבר הירדן, is rendered in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+4:49">Deuteronomy 4:49</span></p>
