<p><strong>But he said unto them</strong>,.... With respect to the inference or conclusion, the disciples formed from what he had asserted:</p>
<p><strong>all men cannot receive this saying</strong>; of their's, that it is not good to marry, but it is more proper and expedient to live a single life! every man, as the Syriac version renders it, is not ספק לה, "sufficient", or "fit", for this thing; everyone has not the gift of continency, and indeed very few; and therefore it is expedient for such to marry; for what the disciples said, though it might be true in part, yet not in the whole; and though the saying might be proper and pertinent enough to some persons, yet not to all, and indeed to none,</p>
<p><strong>save they to whom it is given</strong>; to receive such a saying, to live unmarried with content, having the gift of chastity; for this is not of nature, but of grace: it is the gift of God.</p>
