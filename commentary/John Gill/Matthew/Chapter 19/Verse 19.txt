<p><strong>Honour thy father and thy mother</strong>:.... This, as it is the first commandment with promise, so the first of the second table, and yet is here mentioned last; which inversion of order is of no consequence: so the "seventh" command is put before the "sixth", and the "fifth" omitted, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:9">Romans 13:9</span> and with the Jews it is a common c saying, אין מוקדם ומאוחר בתורה, "there is neither first nor last in the law": that is, it is of no consequence which commandment is recited first, or which last. Moreover, it looks as if it was usual to recite these commands in this order, since they are placed exactly in the same method, by a very noted Jewish d writer.</p>
<p><strong>And thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself</strong>; which is not a particular distinct command from the rest, or an explication of the tenth and last, not mentioned; but a recapitulation, or compendium, and abridgment of the whole, and is said to be a complement and fulfilling of the law; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:9">Romans 13:9</span>.</p>
