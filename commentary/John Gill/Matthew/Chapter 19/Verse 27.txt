<p><strong>Then answered Peter and said unto him</strong>,.... Peter observing what Christ said to the young man, bidding him sell all that he had, and give to the poor, and he should have treasure in heaven, and come and follow him, lays hold on it, and addresses him in the following manner,</p>
<p><strong>behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee</strong>. Though their worldly substance was not so large as the young man's, they had not such estates to sell, nor that to give to the poor, he had; yet all that they had they left for Christ's sake, their parents, wives, children, houses, and worldly employments, by which they supported themselves and families; and became the disciples and followers of Christ, embraced his doctrines, submitted to his commands, imitated him in the exercise of grace, and discharge of duty, denying themselves, and suffering many hardships on his account: wherefore it is asked,</p>
<p><strong>what shall we have therefore</strong>? what reward for all this? what part in the Messiah's kingdom? or what treasure in heaven?</p>
