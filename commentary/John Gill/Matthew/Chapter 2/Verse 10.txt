<p><strong>When they saw the star</strong>,.... Which by its appearance, size, brightness, c. they knew to be the same with that which they had seen, when in their own country</p>
<p><strong>they rejoiced with exceeding great joy</strong>; a "pleonasm" or a redundancy of expression frequently used by the Hebrews, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:6">John 4:6</span> and the Septuagint there; setting forth the rapture, the excess of joy they were in upon the sight of the star. Very probably before this, their hearts were sad, their countenances dejected, and they greatly discouraged, having taken so great a journey, and as yet to so little purpose. They had been at Jerusalem, where they expected to have found him that was born king of the Jews; they had been at court, and conversed with men of the greatest figure and intelligence, and could get no tidings of him; people of all ranks and degrees seemed to be troubled at the account they brought; no body cared to go along with them to Bethlehem: all these circumstances no doubt were discouraging to them; but as soon as they saw the star their spirits revived, joy filled their hearts, cheerfulness appeared in their countenances; and they pursued their journey with inexpressible delight, till they came to the place where the illustrious person was they were seeking after.</p>
