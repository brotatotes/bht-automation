<p><strong>And when they were come into the house</strong>,.... Which they entered without making any inquiry, being fully assured by the star's standing right over it, that this was the house, and here was the king of the Jews, whom they were come to worship; and having entered in "they saw" some copies read ευρον,</p>
<p><strong>they found the young child, with Mary his mother</strong>; in her lap, or arms, or in the house with her, for by this time he might go alone. Joseph perhaps was not at home, but about his business; and which might be so ordered by the providence of God, that so these men might only see the mother of Christ, who had no real father as man; who had they seen Joseph, might have took him to be his proper father. Upon the sight of the young child,</p>
<p><strong>they fell down</strong> on their knees or faces to the ground, agreeably to the custom of their country,</p>
<p><strong>and worshipped him</strong> as a king; giving him the same civil honour and respect, as they were wont to do to their own kings and princes; which custom began with Cyrus: for so Xenophon c says, that</p>
<p>"when the people saw him, παντες προσεκυνησαν, they all worshipped him; either because some were ordered to begin this custom; or else being amazed at the apparatus; or because he seemed to appear so great and beautiful; for before that time none of the Persians worshipped Cyrus.''</p>
<p><strong>And when they had opened their treasures</strong>, that is, their purses, bags or boxes, in which they put those things they brought with them necessary for their journey;</p>
<p><strong>they presented</strong>, or offered to him <strong>gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh</strong>: such things as they had; it being usual, not only with the Persians, but other eastern nations, to make presents to kings and great persons, when they made any addresses to them; which generally, among other things, consisted of gold, spices, myrrh, and the like, see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+43:11">Genesis 43:11</span>. Which last passage referred to, being a prophecy of the Messiah, has been thought by some now to have had its accomplishment, together with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:6">Isaiah 60:6</span> where frankincense as well as gold is mentioned, "they shall bring gold and incense" or frankincense; upon which a noted Jewish writer d observes, that gold and frankincense shall be brought privately as a present to the king Messiah. According to the Ethiopians, these wise men were three, whose names they give us; the name of him that offered the gold, was Annoson; he that offered the frankincense, was Allytar; and he that offered the myrrh, Kyssad e. The Papists call them the three kings of Colen, and say they lie buried in that place.</p>
