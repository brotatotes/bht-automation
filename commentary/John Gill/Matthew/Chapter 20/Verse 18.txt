<p><strong>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem</strong>,.... This is the last time of our going thither; observe, and take notice of what I am about to say; some extraordinary things will come to pass, and, as Luke relates that he said,</p>
<p><strong>all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man, shall be accomplished</strong>; everything that is recorded in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:1">Psalms 22:1</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:1">Isaiah 53:1</span>, or in any other prophecies of the Old Testament, relating to the ill treatment the Messiah should meet with, to his sufferings and death, and all the circumstances attending them, shall be exactly fulfilled in every point: and that they might not be at a loss about what he meant, he gives an account of various particular things, which should befall him;</p>
<p><strong>and the Son of man shall be betrayed</strong>: he does not say by whom, though he knew from the beginning who should betray him, that it would be one of his disciples, and that it would be Judas; but the proper time was not yet come to make this discovery: the persons into whose hands he was to be betrayed, are mentioned;</p>
<p><strong>unto the chief priests, and unto the Scribes</strong>; who were his most inveterate and implacable enemies; and who were the persons that had already taken counsel to put him to death, and were seeking all advantages and opportunities to execute their design:</p>
<p><strong>and they shall condemn him to death</strong>; which is to be understood not of their declaring it as their opinion, that he was guilty of death, and ought to die by a law of their's, which declaration they made before Pilate; nor of their procuring the sentence of death to be pronounced by him, upon him; but of their adjudging him to death among themselves, in the palace of the high priest; which was done by them, as the sanhedrim and great council of the nation; though either they could not, or did not, choose to execute it themselves, and therefore delivered him up to the Romans; for this act of condemning him to death, was to be, and was, before the delivery of him up to the Gentiles, as is clear from what follows.</p>
