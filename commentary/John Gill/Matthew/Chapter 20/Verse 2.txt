<p><strong>And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day,</strong>.... These labourers were of that sort that were called שכיר יום, "hired for a day"; concerning whom is the following rule q:</p>
<p>"he that is hired for a day, may demand it all the night; and he that is hired for a night may demand it all the day: he that is hired for hours, may demand it all the night, and all the day; he that is hired for a week, he that is hired for a month, he that is hired for a year, he that is hired for seven, if he goes out in the day, may demand all the day; and if he goes out in the night, he may demand it all the night, and all the day.''</p>
<p>And the wages of a day were usually דינר "a penny"; which, if understood of a Roman penny, was seven pence halfpenny of our money. One of their canons runs thus r:</p>
<p>"he that hires a labourer in the winter, to work with him in the summer, בכל יום, "for a penny every day", and he gives him his hire; and, lo! his hire is alike to that in the winter, a "sela" every day, this is forbidden; because it looks as if he chose that time to lessen his wages; but if he says to him, work with me from this day, to such a time, "for a penny every day", though his hire is the same, a "sela" every day, this is lawful.''</p>
<p>By the penny a day agreed for with the labourers, may be meant external privileges; or the free promise made, whether to ministers, or private believers, of a sufficient supply of grace daily, that as their day is, their strength shall be; together with that of eternal life and happiness at last.</p>
<p><strong>He sent them into his vineyard;</strong> to labour there: for none have any business there, but such who are called and sent by the owner of it; and where sons are sent, and work, as well as servants; see</p>
