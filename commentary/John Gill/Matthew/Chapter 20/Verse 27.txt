And whosoever will be chief among you,.... Or first, or have the pre-eminence, the first place in the kingdom of the Messiah,let him be your servant; or, as in Mark, shall be servant of all: not only a minister, but a servant; not a servant of some only, but of all. This was verified in the Apostle Paul, who became a servant to all men, though he was free, that he might gain some to Christ; and by so doing was the chief, though he reckoned himself the least of the apostles, yea, less than the least of all saints. The Jews have a saying somewhat like this, that h"everyone that makes himself כעבד, as a servant, for the words of the law in this world, shall be made free in the world to come.''h T. Bab. Bava Metzia, fol. 35. 2.
