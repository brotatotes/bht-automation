<p><strong>And whosoever will be chief among you</strong>,.... Or first, or have the pre-eminence, the first place in the kingdom of the Messiah,</p>
<p><strong>let him be your servant;</strong> or, as in Mark, <strong>shall be servant of all</strong>: not only a minister, but a servant; not a servant of some only, but of all. This was verified in the Apostle Paul, who became a servant to all men, though he was free, that he might gain some to Christ; and by so doing was the chief, though he reckoned himself the least of the apostles, yea, less than the least of all saints. The Jews have a saying somewhat like this, that h</p>
<p>"everyone that makes himself כעבד, as a servant, for the words of the law in this world, shall be made free in the world to come.''</p>
<p>h T. Bab. Bava Metzia, fol. 35. 2.</p>
