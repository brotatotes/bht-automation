<p><strong>And the blind and the lame came to him</strong>,.... The Syriac and Ethiopic versions read, "they brought unto him the blind and the lame". The blind could not come to him unless they were led, nor the lame, unless they were carried: the sense therefore is, they came, being brought to him:</p>
<p><strong>in the temple</strong>; that part of it, the court of the Gentiles, and mountain of the house, out of which he had cast the buyers and sellers, c. and in the room of them, were brought in these objects of his pity:</p>
<p><strong>and he healed them</strong> to the blind he restored sight, and caused the lame to walk; which miracles he wrought in confirmation of the doctrine he preached: for all the other evangelists relate, that he taught in the temple.</p>
