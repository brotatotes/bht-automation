<p><strong>Saying unto them, go into the village over against you</strong>,.... Munster's Hebrew Gospel reads, "before you"; not Jerusalem, as some have thought, for that would never be called a village; though the Ethiopic version reads it, "the city"; but rather Bethany, which was near to Bethphage, and is mentioned with it; though the Jews say u, the name of the village was Nob, and was near to Jerusalem, and own, that Christ had an ass from hence, on which he rode to Jerusalem, and applied to himself the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:9">Zechariah 9:9</span>. And it is very likely this was the village; for Nob was very near to Jerusalem; it was over against it, within sight of it, and from thence might be taken a view of the whole city, according to the Jews; who say w, that Sennacherib stood in Nob, a city of the priests, over against the walls of Jerusalem, and saw the whole city, and it was little in his eyes; and he said; is not this the city of Jerusalem, c.</p>
<p><strong>and straightway</strong>, or, as in Mark, "as soon as ye be entered into it" and in Luke, "at your entering", at the town's end, at one of the first houses in it, at the door thereof,</p>
<p><strong>ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her</strong>. The other evangelists only make mention of the colt, or young ass; but, no doubt, both were spoken of by Christ, and both were found by the disciples, the ass, and the colt by her, and both were brought away by them; and on both of them, very probably, Christ rode; first on one, and then on the other, as the prophecy hereby fulfilled seems to require, and as the sequel of the account shows. The ancient allegorical sense of the ass and colt is not to be despised: that the ass may signify the Jews, who had been used to bear the burdensome rites and ceremonies of the law; and the colt, the wild and untamed Gentiles, and the coming of Christ, first to the one, and then to the other:</p>
<p><strong>loose them, and bring them unto me</strong>, both ass and colt. So the Arabic version reads it, "loose both, and bring them, both to me".</p>
