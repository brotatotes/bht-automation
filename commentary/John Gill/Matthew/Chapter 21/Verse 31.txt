<p><strong>Whether of them twain did the will of his father</strong>?.... This is the question put by Christ, upon the preceding parable to the chief priests, elders, and Scribes;</p>
<p><strong>they say unto him, the first</strong>: an answer which natural reason, and common sense, directed them to; and therefore they give it out at once, directly, without staying upon it, and demurring about it; though they seemed not to be aware of the application of it to themselves, which follows:</p>
<p><strong>Jesus saith unto them, verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots</strong>; that is, such who had been so;</p>

<p><strong>go into the kingdom of God before you</strong>. They are signified by the first son, who repenting went, and did the will of his father: these repented under John's ministry, were called, and brought to repentance by the preaching of Christ, and his apostles: these justified God, their Father, by being baptized with John's baptism: these embraced the Messiah, believed in him, and were the first in his kingdom, and set an example to the chief among the Jews to follow: and it is easy to observe, that a poor profane sinner may, by the grace of God, be brought to repentance, that before was obstinate, rebellious, and disobedient, and be made willing to go and work in the Lord's vineyard here, and be at last glorified; when a self righteous person, notwithstanding all his fair promises and resolutions to do good, his professions of, and pretensions to religion, neither repents of his sins, nor believes in Christ; has no share in the kingdom of grace here, nor will he enter into the kingdom of glory.</p>
