<p><strong>For John came unto you in a way of righteousness</strong>,.... He had a commission from God; he was no impostor; the doctrine he taught was true, and which he faithfully delivered; his life and conversation were unblamable; there was nothing in his credentials, ministry, and conduct, that could justly be found fault with:</p>
<p><strong>and ye believed him not</strong>; to be the forerunner of the Messiah, or the Elias that was to come; nor attended to the doctrine of repentance preached by him, nor were subject to the ordinance of baptism he administered; nor gave any assent, or credit, to the Messiah he so manifestly pointed out:</p>
<p><strong>but the publicans and harlots believed him</strong>; what he said concerning the wrath to come, and the miserable state and danger they were in; and they repented of their sins, and confessed them, and were baptized of him in Jordan; believing the testimony he gave of Jesus of Nazareth being the Messiah, and Son of God:</p>
<p><strong>and ye, when ye had seen it</strong>; the repentance and faith of these persons, and what a wonderful reformation was wrought in them,</p>
<p><strong>repented not afterwards</strong>; of their disobedience, impenitence, and unbelief, after they had seen the effects of John's ministry on these very profligate sinners, and after, the death of John; who, by his constancy, zeal, and faithfulness, had shown himself to be a true, and upright minister of the word; and afterwards under the ministry of Christ, and his apostles, by, whom the same doctrines were preached, and the same ordinances administered,</p>
<p><strong>that ye might believe him</strong>; the testimony he has left behind him concerning the Messiah.</p>
