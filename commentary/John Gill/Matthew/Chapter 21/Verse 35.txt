<p><strong>And the husbandmen took his servants</strong>,.... They seized and laid hold of them in a rude and violent manner: so far were they from treating these servants with respect, as they ought to have done; considering whose they were, from whom they came, and upon what account; and also so far from delivering to them the fruit due to their master, or excusing their inability to make a suitable return, as might be expected, they use them very roughly:</p>
<p><strong>and beat one</strong>; either with the fist, as Jeremiah was struck by Pashur, the son of Immer, the priest, one of these husbandmen,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+20:1">Jeremiah 20:1</span> and as Micaiah was smitten on the cheek by Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, the false prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+18:23">2 Chronicles 18:23</span> or with a scourge, and may refer to the punishment of beating with forty stripes, save one, by which the skin was flayed off; as the word here signifies; for some of these servants had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:36">Hebrews 11:36</span>. And killed another; that is, with the sword. There were four kinds of death in the power of the sanhedrim, of which this is one, and what follows is another; and were these, stoning, burning, killing (i.e. beheading with the sword), and strangling: the manner of executing this punishment here expressed, was this:</p>
<p>"They cut off the person's head בסייף, "with a sword", in the manner the government orders it. R. Judah says, this is indecent (i.e. to cut off his head standing, they do not do so), but they put his head upon a block, and cut it off with an axe; they reply to him, there is no death more abominable than this x.''</p>
<p>So the prophets, in the time of Elijah, were killed with the sword,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:14">1 Kings 19:14</span> see also <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:33">Daniel 11:33</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And stoned another</strong>; as they did Zechariah, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:21">2 Chronicles 24:21</span> and doubtless many others; since Jerusalem had the character of killing the prophets, and stoning them that were sent unto her, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:37">Matthew 23:37</span> these seemed such that were stoned, but not killed; but as Mark says, were wounded in the head with the stones thrown at them, and shamefully handled, and sadly abused.</p>
