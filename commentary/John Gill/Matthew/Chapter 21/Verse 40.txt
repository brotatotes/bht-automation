<p><strong>When the Lord therefore of the vineyard cometh</strong>,.... In a way of providence, to call these husbandmen to an account; not only for the fruit they were to bring to him; but for their barbarity to his servants, the prophets, time after time; and especially, for the inhuman usage and murder of his own son;</p>
<p><strong>what will he do unto those husbandmen</strong>? This question is put to the chief priests, elders, and Scribes: and they themselves, who are designed hereby, are made judges in this case, just as the inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah are, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+5:4">Isaiah 5:4</span> which passage of Scripture our Lord had greatly in view when he spake this parable.</p>
