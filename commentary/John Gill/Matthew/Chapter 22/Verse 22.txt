<p><strong>they left him</strong>: being silenced, confounded, and disappointed:</p>
<p><strong>and went their way</strong>: not being able to get any advantage against him, neither to bring him into contempt with the people, and alienate their affections from him; nor to charge him with sedition or treason to the Roman governor; and so had but a very indifferent account of their success, to report to them that sent them.</p>
