Moreover, whereas these words were spoken by God to Moses, there is some little difficulty occasioned, by Luke's representing them to be the words of Moses; for he says, "Moses showed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord, the God of Abraham", c. which may be removed by observing, that the sense is, that when Moses showed to the children of Israel, what he heard and saw at the bush on Mount Sinai, he called the Lord by these names, in which he spoke of himself to him he recited to them what the Lord said to him; and indeed he was bid to say to them these words; See <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:14">Exodus 3:14</span></p>
