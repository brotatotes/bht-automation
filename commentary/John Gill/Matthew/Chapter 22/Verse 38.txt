<p><strong>This is the first and great commandment.</strong> Whether the object of it is considered, who is the first and chief good; or the manner in which it is to be observed, which requires and engrosses the whole heart, soul, and mind, and all the strength and power of man; or its being the principle from whence all the duties, and actions of men should flow, and the end to which all are to be referred; and is not only a compendium of the duties of the first table of the decalogue, but of all others that can be thought to, and do, belong to God. This is the first command in order of nature, time, dignity, and causality; God being the first cause of all things, infinitely above all creatures, and love to him being the source, spring and cause of love to the neighbour; and it is the greatest in its object, nature, manner, and end. That this command, and these words our Lord cites, are so full and comprehensive, the Jews themselves cannot deny. A noted writer of their's x says,</p>
<p>"the root of "all the commandments" is, when a man loves God with all his soul, and cleaves unto him.''</p>
<p>And, says y another,</p>
<p>"in this verse only, "thou shalt love the Lord thy God", &amp;c.</p>
<p>כלולים עשרת הדברות, "the ten words, or decalogue, are comprehended".''</p>
