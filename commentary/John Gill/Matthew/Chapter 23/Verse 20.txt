<p><strong>Whosoever therefore shall swear by the altar,</strong>.... Not that Christ allowed of swearing by the altar, or by the temple, or by heaven, or by any creature, animate or inanimate; for such swearing is elsewhere disapproved of by him, and forbid, but if a man did swear by the altar, he ought to know, and consider that he not only</p>
<p><strong>sweareth by it</strong>, but by all the gifts, and offerings that are brought, and laid upon it,</p>
<p><strong>and by all things thereon</strong>; whatever gifts and sacrifices are offered upon it; which, by being put there, become holy, as the altar itself: so that he that swears by the altar, swears also by the gifts of the altar; and consequently, according to their own traditions, such oaths must be binding.</p>
