<p><strong>And he that shall swear by heaven</strong>,.... As the Jews were wont to do in common, but did not look upon such an oath as obligatory on them; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, though such an one</p>
<p><strong>sweareth by the throne of God</strong>; for heaven is God's throne, where he sits, and, in an eminent manner, displays the glory of his majesty:</p>
<p><strong>and by him that sitteth thereon</strong>, by God himself. Thus swearing by anything that has any relation to God, is implicitly swearing by him; and therefore ought to be considered as binding, as if he was expressed in it; since an appeal cannot be made to things inanimate, nor indeed to any creature, but to God, the searcher of hearts.</p>
