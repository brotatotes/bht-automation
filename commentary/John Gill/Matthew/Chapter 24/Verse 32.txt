Now learn a parable of the fig tree,.... Take a similitude, or comparison from the fig tree, which was a tree well known in Judea; and the putting forth of its branches, leaves, and fruit, fell under the observation of everyone:when its branch is yet tender; through the influence of the sun, and the motion of the sap, which was bound up, and congealed in the winter season:and putteth forth leaves; from the tender branches, which swell, and open, and put forth buds, leaves, and fruit:ye know the summer is nigh; spring being already come: the fig tree putting forth her green figs, is a sign that the winter is past, the spring is come, and summer is at hand; see Song of Solomon 2:11.
