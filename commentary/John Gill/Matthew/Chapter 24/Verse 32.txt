<p><strong>Now learn a parable of the fig tree</strong>,.... Take a similitude, or comparison from the fig tree, which was a tree well known in Judea; and the putting forth of its branches, leaves, and fruit, fell under the observation of everyone:</p>
<p><strong>when its branch is yet tender</strong>; through the influence of the sun, and the motion of the sap, which was bound up, and congealed in the winter season:</p>
<p><strong>and putteth forth leaves</strong>; from the tender branches, which swell, and open, and put forth buds, leaves, and fruit:</p>
<p><strong>ye know the summer is nigh</strong>; spring being already come: the fig tree putting forth her green figs, is a sign that the winter is past, the spring is come, and summer is at hand; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="so+2:11">Song of Solomon 2:11</span>.</p>
