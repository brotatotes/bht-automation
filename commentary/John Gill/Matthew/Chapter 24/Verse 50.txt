<p><strong>The lord of that servant</strong>,.... Not by redemption and grace, but by creation and profession;</p>
<p><strong>shall come in a day when he looked not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of</strong>: suddenly and unexpectedly: such was his coming in wrath and vengeance on the Jewish nation; and such is his coming oftentimes by death; and such will be his coming at the day of judgment.</p>
