<p><strong>For unto everyone that hath shall be given</strong>,.... This seems to be a frequent saying of Christ's, or a common maxim of his, which he made use of on different occasions; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, and accords with some usual sayings, and proverbial expressions of the Jews; who say a, that "the blessed God does not give wisdom, but to him that has wisdom"; and of a man, in other respects, they use this is a common proverb b,</p>
<p>"if he adds or increases, they add unto him, and if he lessens, they lessen to him:''</p>
<p>and so here; he that has gifts; and talents, shall have an addition to them.</p>
<p><strong>And he shall have abundance</strong> of spiritual gifts and knowledge;</p>
<p><strong>but from him that hath not, shall be taken away, even that which he hath</strong>. The Vulgate Latin reads, "that which he seemed to have", and so reads Munster's Hebrew Gospel, and so it is read in some Greek copies; though it seems to be taken out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:18">Luke 8:18</span>.</p>
