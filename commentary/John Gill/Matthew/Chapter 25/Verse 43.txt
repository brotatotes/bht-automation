<p><strong>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in</strong>,.... Did not take the poor members of Christ into their houses, and take care of them in their families, when they were obliged to flee from their places of abode, or wandered about preaching the Gospel; and who must have perished in the streets, if others, that bore the Christian name; had not been more compassionate than they:</p>
<p><strong>naked, and ye clothed me not: sick and in prison, and ye visited me not</strong>: their conduct, behaviour, and character, are just the reverse of the righteous, and therefore it is no wonder that their sentence is different.</p>
