<p><strong>For ye have the poor always with you</strong>,.... This is said in answer to the objection of the disciples, that the ointment might have been sold, and the money given to the poor. Christ seems to have respect to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+15:11">Deuteronomy 15:11</span>, and which, agreeably to the sense of the Jews, refers to the times of the Messiah: for they say h,</p>
<p>"there is no difference between this world (this present time) and the times of the Messiah, but the subduing of kingdoms only; as it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+15:11">Deuteronomy 15:11</span>, "for the poor shall never cease out of the land": the gloss on it is, from hence it may be concluded, that therefore, יש עניות</p>
<p>לעולם, "for ever there will be poverty, and riches".''</p>
<p>Our Lord's words also show, that there will be always poor persons in the world; that there will be always such with his people, and in his churches; for God has chosen, and he calls such by his grace; so that men may always have opportunities of showing kindness and respect to such objects: in Mark it is added, "and whensoever ye will ye may do them good", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:7">Mark 14:7</span>; by relieving their wants, and distributing to their necessities:</p>
<p><strong>but me ye have not always</strong>; referring not to his divine and spiritual presence, which he has promised to his people, churches, and ministers, to the end of the world, but to his corporeal presence; for he was to be but a little while with them, and then go to the Father; be taken up to heaven, where he now is, and will be until the restitution of all things; so that the time was very short in which any outward respect could be shown to him in person, as man.</p>
