<p><strong>The son of man goeth</strong>,.... Meaning himself, not to the Mount of Olives, or Gethsemane, or the garden, whither he went a little after this, but out of the world, to his Father: the phrase is expressive of his death, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jos+23:14">Joshua 23:14</span>, and denotes the voluntariness of it, and which is no ways inconsistent with the divine determinations about it: nor the violence that was offered to him by his enemies.</p>
<p><strong>As it is written</strong>; in the book of God's eternal purposes and decrees; for Luke says, "as it was determined" <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:22">Luke 22:22</span>: or as it was recorded in the books of the Old Testament; in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:1">Psalms 22:1</span>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:1">Isaiah 53:1</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+9:1">Daniel 9:1</span> for Christ died for the sins of his people, in perfect agreement with these Scriptures, which were written of him:</p>
<p><strong>but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed</strong>; for God's decrees concerning this matter, and the predictions in the Bible founded on them, did not in the least excuse, or extenuate the blackness of his crime; who did what he did, of his own free will, and wicked heart, voluntarily, and to satisfy his own lusts:</p>
<p><strong>it had been good for that man if he had not been born</strong>. This is a Rabbinical phrase, frequently, used in one form or another; sometimes thus; as it is said f of such that speak false and lying words, and regard not the glory of their Creator, דלא ייתון לעלמא</p>
<p>טב לון, it would have been better for them they had never come into the world; and so of any other, notorious sinner, it is at other times said g, טב ליה דלא אברי, or h, נוח לו שלא נברא, "it would have been better for him if he had not been created"; signifying, that it is better to have no being at all, than to be punished with everlasting destruction; and which was the dreadful case of Judas, who fell by his transgression, and went to his own place.</p>
