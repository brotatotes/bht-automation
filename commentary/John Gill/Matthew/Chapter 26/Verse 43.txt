<p><strong>And he came and found them asleep again</strong>,.... For they were aroused and awaked, in some measure, by what he had said to them; but no sooner was he gone but they fell asleep again, and thus he found them a second time; or, "he came again and found them asleep"; so read the Vulgate Latin, the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, and Munster's Hebrew Gospel:</p>
<p><strong>for their eyes were heavy</strong>; with sleep through fatigue, sorrow, c. Mark adds, "neither wist they what to answer him", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:40">Mark 14:40</span> they were so very sleepy, they knew not how to speak; or they were so confounded, that he should take them asleep a second time, after they had had such a reproof, and exhortation from him, that they knew not what answer to make him; who probably rebuked them again, or gave them a fresh exhortation.</p>
