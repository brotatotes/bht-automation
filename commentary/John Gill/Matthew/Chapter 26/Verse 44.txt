And he left them, and went away again,.... At some little distance from them; they being so overpowered with sleep, that he could have no conversation with them:and prayed the third time; as the Apostle Paul did, when under temptation, he prayed thrice that it might depart from him,2 Corinthians 12:8,saying the same words: the Arabic version renders it, "in the words which he before expressed"; and Munster's Hebrew Gospel reads, "he said the same prayer"; not in the selfsame words, or in the express form he had before delivered it; for it is certain, that his second prayer is not expressed in the same form of words as the first: but the sense is, that he prayed to the same purpose; the matter and substance of his prayer was the same, namely, that he might be exempted from suffering; but if that could not be admitted of, he was desirous to be resigned to the will of his heavenly Father, and was determined to submit unto it.
