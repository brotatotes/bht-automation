<p><strong>But found none</strong>,.... That were fit for their purpose;</p>
<p><strong>yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none</strong>; whose testimonies were sufficient to put him to death, which was what they were resolved upon, or whose witness were not alike and agreed; for according to their law, a man must not die by the mouth of one witness only, but by the mouth of two or three witnesses agreed in a point; and though they might be willing enough to dispense with the law in this case, yet might have some regard to their own character and reputation; and especially as they meant to deliver him to the Roman governor, in order to be condemned by him; they knew they must have a charge, and this supported with a proper evidence, or they could not hope to succeed; for which reason, they could not put up, as they otherwise willingly would, with any sort of witnesses:</p>
<p><strong>at the last came two false witnesses</strong>; who were agreed in a point, and whose testimonies were alike; at least, had a greater appearance of truth and agreement than the rest; though Mark says, "neither so did their witnesses agree together", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:59">Mark 14:59</span>, as to prove the point, for which it was given.</p>
