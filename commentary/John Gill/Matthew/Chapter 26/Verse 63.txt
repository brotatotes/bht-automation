<p><strong>But Jesus held his peace</strong>,.... Knowing it would signify nothing, whatever he should say, they being set upon his death, the time of which was now come; and therefore he quietly submits, and says nothing in his own defence to prevent it. To be silent in a court of judicature, Apollonius Tyanaeus c says, is the fourth virtue; this Christ had, and all others:</p>
<p><strong>and the high priest answered and said unto him</strong>; though Christ had said nothing, a way of speaking very frequent among the Jews, and in the sacred writings:</p>
<p><strong>I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God</strong>; the Christ; the anointed, that David speaks of in the second Psalm, and who is there said to be the Son of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:2">Psalms 2:2</span>, to which the high priest seems to have respect; since there is no other passage, in which both these characters meet; and which was understood by the ancient Jews of the Messiah, as is owned by modern ones d. Jesus was given out to be the Messiah, and his disciples believed him to be the Son of God, and he had affirmed himself to be so; wherefore the high priest, exerting his priestly power and authority, puts him upon his oath; or at least with an oath made by the living God, charges him to tell the truth, and which when ever any heard the voice of swearing, he was obliged to do, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+5:1">Leviticus 5:1</span>.</p>
