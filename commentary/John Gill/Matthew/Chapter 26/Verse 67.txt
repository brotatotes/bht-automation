<p><strong>Then did they spit in his face</strong>,.... Not the judges, the members of the sanhedrim, but the servants of the high priest, and the officers that had Jesus in hold, and were the guard upon him; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:63">Luke 22:63</span>, who seeing him condemned as guilty of death, thought they might insult him at pleasure, and use him in the most indecent and barbarous manner; and therefore, in a way of contempt, spit in his face; than which nothing was more reproachful and disgraceful: the Jews x say, that he that spits before, or in the presence of his master, is guilty of death, so nauseous and filthy was it accounted; and how much more must it be so, to spit in the face of anyone? hereby a prophecy was fulfilled, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:6">Isaiah 50:6</span>, "I hid not my face from shame and spitting": and hereby, together with his sweat and blood, his visage was more marred than any man's, and his form than the sons of men:</p>
<p><strong>and buffeted him</strong>; cuffed, or boxed him with their double fists:</p>
<p><strong>and others smote him, with the palms of their hands</strong>; gave him many a slap on the face with their open hands, or struck him on the face with rods, as the word will bear to be rendered: they rapped him with the wands they had in their hands, and struck him on the head with the rods or staves they had with them; whereby was accomplished the prophecy, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:1">Micah 5:1</span>, "they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek". This was very injurious treatment, the Jews themselves being witnesses; who have in their canons enjoined y, that</p>
<p>"if a man strikes his neighbour with his double fist, he must give him a shekel; R. Judah says, on account of R. Jose the Galilean, a pound: if he gives him a slap of the face, he must pay him two hundred zuzims, or pence; and if with the back of his hand (which was accounted z the more ignominious) four hundred zuzims: if he plucked him by his ear, or plucked off his hair, or spit, so as that the spittle came upon him, or took away his cloak--he must pay four hundred zuzims, and all according to his honour or dignity.''</p>
<p>All these indignities were done to Christ; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:6">Isaiah 50:6</span>.</p>
