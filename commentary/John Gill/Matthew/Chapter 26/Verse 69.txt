<p><strong>Now Peter sat without in the palace</strong>,.... Peter's denial of his Lord, the account of which follows, is related among the sufferings of Christ; and indeed, the ill usage he met with from his enemies, their spitting in his face, buffeting him with their fists, smiting him on the cheeks with their hands, and rods, did not give him so much pain and grief, as to be denied by his own disciple: we are before told, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:58">Matthew 26:58</span>, that Peter followed Christ afar off, and went into the high priest's palace, and sat with the servants there, to see what would be the end and issue of these things: and here now he was in the apartment, where the council sat, and were examining and trying Jesus; though, as Mark says, "beneath in the palace", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:66">Mark 14:66</span>; in the lower part of the room, in the great hall, in the midst of which the servants had made a fire: the Arabic version reads it, "in the area of the court": here Peter had placed himself, and here he sat making his observations:</p>
<p><strong>and a damsel came unto him</strong>; one of the maids of the high priest, as Mark says, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:66">Mark 14:66</span>; and according to the Evangelist John, was she that kept the door, and had let him in, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:16">John 18:16</span>,</p>
<p><strong>saying, thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee</strong>. The Arabic and Persic versions read, Jesus the Nazarene, or of Nazareth, as below. So she called him, not so much to distinguish him from any other of that name, as by way of reproach; suggesting, that he could not be the Messiah, or that prophet; since Christ comes not out of Galilee, nor does any prophet arise from thence: and when she charges him with being "with" him, her meaning is not, that he was with him in the garden, when he was taken; where it cannot be thought she was to see him; nor with him in the temple, or in any part of Jerusalem, where she possibly might have seen him; but that he was a disciple of his, one that believed in him, embraced him as the Messiah, had imbibed his principles and doctrines, and was of his party; and was only come thither as a spy, to see what would be done to him.</p>
