<p><strong>Pilate saith unto them</strong>,.... As one astonished at their choice: he could not have thought they would have asked the life of so vile a wretch, that had been guilty of such capital crimes, crimes to be abhorred by all men:</p>
<p><strong>what shall I do then with Jesus, which is called Christ</strong>? Surely you would not have me put him to death, and that for no other reason but this, because he is called either by himself or others, Christ, or the Messiah, or the king of the Jews!</p>
<p><strong>they all say unto him, let him be crucified</strong>; which was a Roman punishment, inflicted on the meanest and worst of men; as wicked servants, thieves, robbers, and cut-throats o; and so was not only a torturing and painful death, but a very shameful and ignominious one; yea, an accursed one: in this they all agreed, being instigated to it by the chief priests and elders.</p>
<p>o Lipsius de Cruce, l. 1. c. 12, 13.</p>
