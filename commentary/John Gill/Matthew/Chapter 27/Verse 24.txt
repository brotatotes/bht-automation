<p><strong>When Pilate saw he could prevail nothing</strong>,.... That it was to no purpose to talk to them, and in favour of Jesus; he saw they were determined upon his crucifixion, and that nothing else would satisfy them:</p>
<p><strong>but that rather a tumult was made</strong>; there was an uproar among the people, and he might fear the consequences of it, should he not grant their request; otherwise, as Philo the p Jew says of him, he was, την φυσιν ακαμπης και μετα του ανθαδους αμειλικτος, "naturally inflexible, rigid, and self-willed": but he knew the temper of these people, and had had experience of their resoluteness, when they were determined on any thing; as in the case of his introducing the golden shields into the holy city, of which the same author speaks: and was then obliged, though sore against his will, as now, to yield unto them:</p>
<p><strong>He took water, and washed his hands before the multitude</strong>; either in conformity to a custom among the Jews, whereby they testified their innocence as to the commission of murder; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+21:6">Deuteronomy 21:6</span>, or to a Gentile one, used when murder was committed, for the lustration or expiation of it q:</p>
<p><strong>saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person</strong>; though this did not clear him from all guilt in this matter: he ought to have acted the part of an upright judge, and not have yielded to the unrighteous requests of the people; he ought not to have scourged an innocent man, and much less have condemned and delivered him to be crucified, as he did; though in this he bore a testimony to the innocence of Christ, and which is somewhat remarkable in him; who was, as Philo says r, notoriously guilty of receiving bribes, of injuries, rapine, and frequent murders of persons uncondemned:</p>
<p><strong>see ye [to it]</strong>; you must be answerable for this action, and all the consequences of it. The Syriac version renders it, "you have known"; and the Persic version, "you know": and the Arabic version, "you know better"; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+21:6- :">Deuteronomy 21:6- :</span>.</p>
