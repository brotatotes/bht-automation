<p><strong>And they spit upon him</strong>,.... The Syriac and Persic versions add, "upon his face", which he did not hide from spitting; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:6">Isaiah 1:6</span>, and so what with sweat, by being hurried from place to place, and with blood trickling down from his temples, scratched with thorns, and with the spittle of these filthy soldiers, his visage was more marred than any man's, and his form than the sons of men,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:14">Isaiah 52:14</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And took the reed</strong>, or "cane", which was put into his right hand,</p>
<p><strong>and smote him on the head</strong>; whereby they drove the sharp points of the thorns into it, which must give him inexpressible pain and torture.</p>
