And they that passed by,.... In the road to or from Jerusalem; for, it seems, the crosses were placed by the wayside; or they who passed by the cross, the populace that came from Jerusalem, on purpose to see the sight,reviled him, or "blasphemed him": they spoke all manner of evil of him, they could think of, to which he answered not a word; and which may teach us patience under the revilings of men: this was foretold of him, Psalms 89:51, "they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed", or "Messiah"; and which Jarchi explains by סופי, "the ends of the king Messiah"; his last times, towards the close of his days; and cites that passage in the Misna z,"in the heels, or, as Buxtorf renders it, in the end of the days of the Messiah impudence shall be multiplied,''as it now was exceedingly:wagging their heads; in derision of him, and as exulting in his misery; see Isaiah 37:22. This also was prophesied of him inPsalms 22:7.z Sota, c. 9. sect. 15.
