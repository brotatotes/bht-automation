<p><strong>And they that passed by</strong>,.... In the road to or from Jerusalem; for, it seems, the crosses were placed by the wayside; or they who passed by the cross, the populace that came from Jerusalem, on purpose to see the sight,</p>
<p><strong>reviled him</strong>, or "blasphemed him": they spoke all manner of evil of him, they could think of, to which he answered not a word; and which may teach us patience under the revilings of men: this was foretold of him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:51">Psalms 89:51</span>, "they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed", or "Messiah"; and which Jarchi explains by סופי, "the ends of the king Messiah"; his last times, towards the close of his days; and cites that passage in the Misna z,</p>
<p>"in the heels, or, as Buxtorf renders it, in the end of the days of the Messiah impudence shall be multiplied,''</p>
<p>as it now was exceedingly:</p>
<p><strong>wagging their heads</strong>; in derision of him, and as exulting in his misery; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+37:22">Isaiah 37:22</span>. This also was prophesied of him in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:7">Psalms 22:7</span>.</p>
<p>z Sota, c. 9. sect. 15.</p>
