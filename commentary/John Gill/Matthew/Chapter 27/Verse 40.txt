<p><strong>And saying, thou that destroyest the temple</strong>,.... The Vulgate Latin, and Munster's Hebrew Gospel, read, "the temple of God"; and add "ah!" here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:29">Mark 15:29</span>, and so Beza says it is read in a certain copy. They refer to the charge of the false witnesses against him, who misrepresenting his words in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span>, declared that he gave out that he was able to destroy the temple of Jerusalem, and rebuild it in three days time; wherefore it is added,</p>
<p><strong>and buildest it in three days, save thyself</strong>. They reproach him with it, and suggest, that these were vain and empty boasts of his; for if he was able to do any thing of that kind, he need not hang upon the tree, but could easily save himself:</p>
<p><strong>if thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross</strong>. The Jews themselves say a that the following words were said to Jesus on the cross,</p>
<p>"if thou be the Son of God, why dost thou not deliver thyself out of our hands?''</p>
<p>As Satan before them, they put an "if" upon the sonship of Christ: and seeing his followers believed in him as the Son of God, and he had owned himself to be so before the sanhedrim, they require a sign of it by his power, and to do that which they believed no mere man in his situation could do; which shows, that they had no other notion of the Son of God, but that he was a divine person: but his sonship was not to be declared by his coming down from the cross, which he could have easily effected, but by a much greater instance of power, even by his resurrection from the dead; and no other but that sign was to be given to that wicked and perverse generation.</p>
