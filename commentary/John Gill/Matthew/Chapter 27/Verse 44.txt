<p><strong>The thieves also</strong>,.... One or other of them, not both; an Hebrew way of speaking, as Drusius b observed: so it is said of Jonah, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jon+1:5">Jonah 1:5</span>, that he was "gone down into the sides of the ship"; not into both sides, but into one or other of them: so here the thieves, one or other of them, not naming which, railed at Jesus, for it was but one of them; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:39">Luke 23:39</span>, unless it can be thought, as it is by some, that they both at first reviled him; but one being quickly convinced of his evil, ceased, and rebuked his fellow sufferer, confessed his, sin, bore a testimony to the innocence of Christ, and desired to be remembered by him in his kingdom. This was an aggravation of the sufferings of Christ, that he should be vilified by those,</p>
<p><strong>which were crucified with him</strong>; who ought to have been, considering the condemnation they were in, and the future state they were just entering into, lamenting and confessing the sins they had been guilty of, instead of adding sin to sin, and so aggravating their condemnation. These, at least one of them,</p>
<p><strong>cast the same into his teeth</strong>; as the populace, the chief priests, Scribes, elders, and Pharisees had done; twitted him with his pretensions of being the Son of God, the Messiah, and king of Israel; and urged, that if he was, why did not he save himself, and them also?</p>
