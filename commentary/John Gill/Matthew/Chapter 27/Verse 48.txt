<p><strong>And straightway one of them ran and took a sponge</strong>,.... Which was not far from the cross, where a vessel full of vinegar was set, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:29">John 19:29</span>,</p>
<p><strong>and filled it with vinegar</strong>; dipping it into it, it sucked it up. Some of these sponges had leathern handles to them. r</p>
<p><strong>And put it on a reed</strong>; a stalk of hyssop; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:29- :">John 19:29- :</span>,</p>
<p><strong>and gave him to drink</strong>; not to revive his spirits, or hasten his death, as some have thought, but in contempt of him, and to mock him, he having signified that he was athirst.</p>
<p>r Misn. Sabbat, c. 21. sect. 3.</p>
