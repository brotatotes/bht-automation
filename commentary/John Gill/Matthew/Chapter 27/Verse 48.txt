And straightway one of them ran and took a sponge,.... Which was not far from the cross, where a vessel full of vinegar was set, John 19:29,and filled it with vinegar; dipping it into it, it sucked it up. Some of these sponges had leathern handles to them. rAnd put it on a reed; a stalk of hyssop; John 19:29- :,and gave him to drink; not to revive his spirits, or hasten his death, as some have thought, but in contempt of him, and to mock him, he having signified that he was athirst.r Misn. Sabbat, c. 21. sect. 3.
