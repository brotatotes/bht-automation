<p><strong>Jesus, when he had cried again</strong>,.... "A second time", as the Persic version; for he had cried once before, and expressed the words he did, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:46">Matthew 27:46</span>, what he now delivered were, "Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:46">Luke 23:46</span>, and "it is finished", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:30">John 19:30</span>, which he said</p>
<p><strong>with a loud voice</strong>; which showed the vehemency of his affection, his strong confidence in God, and his being fearless of death; as also he thus spoke, that he might be heard, and his words attended to, since they contained things of the greatest importance and consequence: moreover, being able to express himself in such a manner, this declared him to be more than a mere man; for after such agonies in the garden, and so much fatigue in being hurried from place to place, and such loss of blood by being buffeted, scourged, crowned with thorns, and nailed to the accursed tree, where, being stretched, he had hung for some hours; to speak with so loud a voice was more than human, and was a conviction to the centurion, that he was a divine person: for when he saw that he so cried out, and "gave up the ghost", he said, "truly this man was the Son of God",</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:39">Mark 15:39</span>, and likewise it shows, that he died freely and voluntarily, and not through force and necessity: it was not all that men had done, or could do to him, that could have forced his life from him: he died willingly, and when nature was in its full strength; and which is signified in the next phrase,</p>
<p><strong>yielded up the ghost</strong>, or "dismissed the Spirit", as the Syriac version truly renders it; he sent it away. It was not taken from him, he laid down his life of himself, as the Lord of it, and gave himself freely to be an offering and sacrifice in the room of his people; which is a proof of his great love, and amazing grace unto them.</p>
