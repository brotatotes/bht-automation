<p><strong>Now, when the centurion</strong>,.... That was over the band of soldiers, that mocked Christ in Pilate's hall, and who was particularly over the guard of soldiers, set about the cross of Christ:</p>
<p><strong>and they that were with him, watching Jesus</strong>: the soldiers that were with him, who were set to watch the cross of Christ, lest he should come down, or any should take him down from thence;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Saw the earthquake, and those things that were done</strong>; as besides that, the darkening of the sun, the rending of the rocks, and particularly heard with what a loud voice Christ spoke, and then at once expired:</p>
<p><strong>they feared greatly</strong>; not with a true godly fear, but with a fear of punishment; lest divine vengeance should light on them, for their concern in this matter:</p>
<p><strong>saying, truly this was the Son of God</strong>; which they concluded, not from any mediatorial performances, which they were utter strangers to, but from effects of divine power; and which to them showed him to be a divine person, what he said he was, and the Jews charged him with blasphemy, on account of, and condemned him for, as these soldiers might have seen and heard.</p>
