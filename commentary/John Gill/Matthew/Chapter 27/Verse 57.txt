<p><strong>When the even was come</strong>,.... The second evening, when it was just at sunset; at which time the Jewish sabbath began, and when the bodies of those that were crucified, must be taken down; and if not dead, their bones must be broken, and they dispatched, in order to be interred in the common burying place of malefactors:</p>
<p><strong>there came a rich man Arimathea</strong>: not from thence now, for he lived at Jerusalem; but this was the place of his nativity, or former abode, and from whence he originally came; and is the same with Ramathaim Zophim, and Ramah, and was the birthplace of Samuel the prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+1:1">1 Samuel 1:1</span>, and is by the Septuagint called Armathaim, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+1:1">1 Samuel 1:1</span>. His character, as a rich man, is particularly mentioned, not merely to show that such men may be, and sometimes are, instances of the grace of God; much less in a way of boasting, that such a man was attached to Jesus; but rather to point out the reason, how he came to have such easy access to Pilate, and to succeed in his business with him; as well as to observe the accomplishment of a prophecy, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:9">Isaiah 53:9</span>,</p>
<p><strong>named Joseph</strong>; the same name with one of the patriarchs, the sons of Jacob; between whom there was a resemblance, not only as good men, but in their observance of funeral rites and obsequies; the one in those of his father, the other in those of his dear Lord and Master. Some think k he is the same with Joseph ben Gorion, the brother of Nicodemus ben Gorion, often spoken of as a priest, and one of the richest of them in Jerusalem:</p>
<p><strong>who also himself was Jesus' disciple</strong>; though he was only a secret one, as Nicodemus was: he had not as yet, or till now publicly professed him, for fear of the Jews, who had made a law, that whoever did, should be cast out of the synagogue; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:38">John 19:38</span>.</p>
