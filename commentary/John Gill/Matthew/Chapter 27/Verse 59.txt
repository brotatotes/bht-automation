<p><strong>And when Joseph had taken the body</strong>,.... Down from the cross, with the assistance of others, or from the hands of those who had orders to deliver it to him:</p>
<p><strong>he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth</strong>: that is, he wound up the body in it round and round, as was the custom of the Jews; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:6">Acts 5:6</span></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:44">John 11:44</span>. Nor was it usual to bury in any thing but linen: so it is said m,</p>
<p>"let the wrappings, or grave clothes, be של פשתן לבנים, "of white linen"; and let not the price of them be dear, for it is forbidden to bury in wrappings of silk, or broidered garments, even to a prince of Israel: for this is pride and destruction, and the work of the Gentiles.''</p>
<p>This clean linen cloth, in which the dead body of Christ was wrapped, may be an emblem of his purity and innocence, who did no sin; nor did he die for any of his own, but for the sins of others; and also of his pure and spotless righteousness, which is compared to fine linen, clean and white, and which he now had wrought out, and brought in; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:8">Revelation 19:8</span>.</p>
