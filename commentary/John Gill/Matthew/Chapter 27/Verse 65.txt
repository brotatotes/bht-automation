<p><strong>Pilate said unto them, ye have a watch</strong>,.... Meaning either the watch of the temple, said to be placed in the tower of Antonia, for the service of it: hence mention is made of the captain of the temple, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:1">Acts 4:1</span>, but it is not likely they would remove the temple guards, to watch a sepulchre night and day: or rather, therefore, the soldiers that had had the care of the crucifixion of Christ, and watched him on the cross, are designed: the words may be read imperatively, "have yea watch", or "take a watch", as the Ethiopic version renders it, and which seems best; for if they had a watch already, what occasion had they to have applied to Pilate for one? but having none, he gives them leave to take one, or such a number of soldiers as were sufficient:</p>
<p><strong>go your way</strong>; as fast as you can, take the watch as soon as you please, make no stay, but satisfy yourselves in this point:</p>
<p><strong>make [it] as sure as you can</strong>; or, as you know how to do it, and what will be proper and necessary.</p>
