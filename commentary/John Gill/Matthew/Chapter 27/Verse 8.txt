Wherefore that field was called,.... Not by the priests and elders, but by the common people, who knew by what money it was purchased,the field of blood; or "Aceldama", which so signifies, as in Acts 1:19, not called the field of the priests, the purchasers; nor the field of the strangers, for whom it was bought; but the field of blood, being purchased with that money, for which innocent blood was betrayed; and this name it boreunto this day; in which Matthew wrote his Gospel, about eight years after, as is thought. Jerom x says, that in his time this field was shown on the south side of Mount Sion.x De locis Hebraicis.
