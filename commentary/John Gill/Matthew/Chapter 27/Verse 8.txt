<p><strong>Wherefore that field was called</strong>,.... Not by the priests and elders, but by the common people, who knew by what money it was purchased,</p>
<p><strong>the field of blood</strong>; or "Aceldama", which so signifies, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:19">Acts 1:19</span>, not called the field of the priests, the purchasers; nor the field of the strangers, for whom it was bought; but the field of blood, being purchased with that money, for which innocent blood was betrayed; and this name it bore</p>
<p><strong>unto this day</strong>; in which Matthew wrote his Gospel, about eight years after, as is thought. Jerom x says, that in his time this field was shown on the south side of Mount Sion.</p>
