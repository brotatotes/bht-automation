<p><strong>And if this come to the governor's ears</strong>,.... Not the governor of the watch, but Pontius Pilate the governor of Judea: if this should be told him, and should be heard by him; or this matter should come before him, and be under his examination, and there should be any danger of punishment; for to sleep on the watch was severely punished by the Romans:</p>
<p><strong>we will, persuade him</strong>; that this is the true state of the case, and intercede with him, and make use of all our interest, not to punish for it: or will persuade him, that though this is a false account, yet it will be much better that it should go in this way, for his own peace, and the peace of the nation, and the security of the Roman government; since, should it spread among the people, that this person was really raised from the dead, they would, one and all, believe he was the true Messiah, and would set him up as a king, and seize upon the government in favour of him:</p>
<p><strong>and will secure you</strong>; indemnify you, bear you harmless, keep you from punishment; so that you need not be under any care, or concern on this account.</p>
