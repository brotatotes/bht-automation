Then the eleven disciples,.... For Judas was not only gone from them, but was dead; so that there were now but eleven of them: wentaway into Galilee: not directly, as soon as the women had delivered their message; for Christ appeared to them the same day at Jerusalem; and so he did at the same place that week; seeJohn 20:19, but some time, after this they went together into Galilee, according to Christ's direction both before and after his resurrection, Matthew 26:32,into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them; either before his death, or since he was risen; and very likely at one of the above interviews he had with them. This is generally thought to be Mount Tabor; but of this there is no proof, nor certainty: it might be the mountain near Capernaum, on which he taught, Matthew 5:1, or that, if not the same with the other, near the sea of Galilee, where Christ fed four thousand with seven loaves, and a few fishes, Matthew 15:29. A mountain was appointed for this meeting, both for solitariness and for sight; for here it was he was seen by above five hundred brethren at once, 1 Corinthians 15:6.
