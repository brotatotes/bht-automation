<p><strong>Then the eleven disciples</strong>,.... For Judas was not only gone from them, but was dead; so that there were now but eleven of them: went</p>
<p><strong>away into Galilee</strong>: not directly, as soon as the women had delivered their message; for Christ appeared to them the same day at Jerusalem; and so he did at the same place that week; see</p>

<p><strong>into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them</strong>; either before his death, or since he was risen; and very likely at one of the above interviews he had with them. This is generally thought to be Mount Tabor; but of this there is no proof, nor certainty: it might be the mountain near Capernaum, on which he taught, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span>, or that, if not the same with the other, near the sea of Galilee, where Christ fed four thousand with seven loaves, and a few fishes, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:29">Matthew 15:29</span>. A mountain was appointed for this meeting, both for solitariness and for sight; for here it was he was seen by above five hundred brethren at once, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:6">1 Corinthians 15:6</span>.</p>
