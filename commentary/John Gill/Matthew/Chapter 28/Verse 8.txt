<p><strong>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre</strong>,.... Or "they went out from it", as it may be rendered, and as it is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:8">Mark 16:8</span>, which shows, that they went into the sepulchre upon the invitation of the angel, and saw the place where the Lord lay; and here it was the angel gave them their instructions, and errand to the disciples; which as soon as they received, they quitted the sepulchre in all haste, partly in obedience to the angel's orders, and partly through surprise and fear; for Mark says, "they fled from the sepulchre",</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:8">Mark 16:8</span>, as persons terrified and affrighted: and it is added here,</p>
<p><strong>with fear and great joy</strong>: a mixture of both these; with fear and dread, because of the vision they had seen, and with joy at the news of Christ's resurrection; and yet in this their faith might not be so confirmed, as to have no doubt about it: they might fear the body was taken away, and removed to some other place, and that this they had seen might be a deception and a delusion. However, between both joy and fear, they set out,</p>
<p><strong>and did run to bring his disciples word</strong>; as Mary Magdalene ran to Peter, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:2">John 20:2</span>, nor is running unusual for women, or unbecoming them on certain occasions; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+24:20">Genesis 24:20</span>. Their fright, as well as their joy, and their regard to the angel's order, might cause them to run, and make the quicker dispatch.</p>
