<p><strong>Bring forth therefore fruits</strong>,.... That is, if you are truly penitent, if you have a proper sense of sin, and true repentance for it, do such works as are suitable to it, and will show the genuineness of it; for</p>
<p><strong>fruits meet for repentance</strong> are the same as "works meet for repentance", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:20">Acts 26:20</span> and as a tree is known by its fruit, so repentance is known by good works; these are the fruits and effects of repentance, and which are proofs with men of the sincerity of it. Those which follow upon evangelical repentance are such as are mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:11">2 Corinthians 7:11</span>. Now let it be observed, that John insisted upon repentance, and a good conversation, attesting the truth of it as necessary prerequisites to the ordinance of baptism; and so Peter first urged repentance; and then proposed baptism, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span> from whence one should think it may be rationally and strongly concluded, that none but truly repenting sinners, and such who have given proofs that they are so, are to be admitted to this ordinance.</p>
