<p><strong>Then saith Jesus to him, get thee hence, Satan</strong>..... In <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:8">Luke 4:8</span> it is "get thee behind me": and so some copies read here, and is expressive of indignation and abhorrence; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:23">Matthew 16:23</span> rebuking his impudence, and detesting his impiety: he had borne his insults and temptations with great patience; he had answered him with mildness and gentleness; but now his behaviour to him was intolerable, which obliged him to show his resentment, exert his power and authority, and rid himself at once of so vile a creature; giving this reason for it;</p>
<p><strong>for it is written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve</strong>. The place referred to is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+6:13">Deuteronomy 6:13</span></p>
<p><strong>thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him</strong>: to fear the Lord, and to worship him, is the same thing. Worship includes both an internal and external reverence of God: the word "only" is not in the original text, but is added by our Lord; and that very justly; partly to express the emphasis which is on the word "him"; and in perfect agreement with the context, which requires it; since it follows,</p>
<p><strong>ye shall not go after other Gods</strong>. Moreover, not to take notice of the Septuagint version, in which the word "only" is also added, Josephus q, the Jewish historian, referring to this law, says, because God is one, και δει τουτον σεβεσθαι μονον, "therefore he only is to be worshipped". And Aben Ezra r, a Jewish writer, explaining the last clause in the verse,</p>
<p><strong>and thou shalt swear by his name</strong>, uses the word "only"; and which indeed, of right, belongs to every clause in it. The meaning of our Lord in citing it is; that since the Lord God is the alone object of worship, it was horrid blasphemy in Satan to desire it might be given to him, and which could not be done without the greatest impiety.</p>
