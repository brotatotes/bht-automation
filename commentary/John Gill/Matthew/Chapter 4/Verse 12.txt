<p><strong>Now, when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison</strong>,.... John was cast into prison by Herod; the reason of it may be seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:3">Matthew 14:3</span>. The prison into which he was cast, according to Josephus s, was the castle of Machaeras: here he continued some time before he was put to death; for from hence he sent two disciples to Jesus, to know if he was the Messiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:2">Matthew 11:2</span>. Now when Jesus heard of this his imprisonment,</p>
<p><strong>he departed into Galilee</strong>; not so much on account of safety, or for fear of Herod, but to call his disciples, who lived in that country.</p>
<p>s Antiq. l. 18. c. 7.</p>
