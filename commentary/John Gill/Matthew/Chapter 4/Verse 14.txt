Ver. 14, 15. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken,.... Christ's dwelling in Capernaum accomplished a prophecy of the prophet Isaiah 9:1 and he went and dwelt there, that it might be fulfilled which he had spoken: the meaning of which prophecy is x, that as those parts of the land of Israel, there mentioned, had suffered much by Tiglathpileser, who had carried them captive,2 Kings 15:29 and is "the vexation" referred to; so they should be honoured, and made very glorious, by the presence and conversation of the Messiah among them, and which now had its literal fulfilment: for Christ now came and dwelt in Capernaum, which lay between the lands and upon the borders both of Zabulon and Nephthalim; was situated by the sea of Tiberias, beyond Jordan, and in, "Galilee of the nations"; the upper Galilee, which had in it people of other nations besides Jews. The ancient Jews expected the Messiah to make his first appearance in Galilee; which expectation must be grounded on this prophecy; for so they say y expressly,"the king Messiah shall be revealed בארעא דגליל, "in the land of Galilee."''And in another place z explaining Isaiah 2:19 they paraphrase it thus,""for fear of the Lord"; this is the indignation of the whole world: and for the "glory of his majesty"; this is the Messiah; when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth, when he shall arise and be revealed בארעא דגליל, "in the land of Galilee": because that this is the first place to be destroyed in the holy land; therefore he shall be revealed there the first of all places.''Here Jesus, the true Messiah, made his first appearance publicly; here he called his disciples, and began his ministry.x See my treatise upon the "Prophecies of the Messiah", &c. p. 147, &c. y Zohar in Gen. fol. 74. 3. z Ib. in Exod. fol. 3. 3. & 88. 3.
