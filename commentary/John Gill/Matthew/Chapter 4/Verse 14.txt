<p>Ver. 14, 15. <strong>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken</strong>,.... Christ's dwelling in Capernaum accomplished a prophecy of the prophet <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:1">Isaiah 9:1</span> and he went and dwelt there, that it might be fulfilled which he had spoken: the meaning of which prophecy is x, that as those parts of the land of Israel, there mentioned, had suffered much by Tiglathpileser, who had carried them captive,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+15:29">2 Kings 15:29</span> and is "the vexation" referred to; so they should be honoured, and made very glorious, by the presence and conversation of the Messiah among them, and which now had its literal fulfilment: for Christ now came and dwelt in Capernaum, which lay between the lands and upon the borders both of Zabulon and Nephthalim; was situated by the sea of Tiberias, beyond Jordan, and in, "Galilee of the nations"; the upper Galilee, which had in it people of other nations besides Jews. The ancient Jews expected the Messiah to make his first appearance in Galilee; which expectation must be grounded on this prophecy; for so they say y expressly,</p>
<p>"the king Messiah shall be revealed בארעא דגליל, "in the land of Galilee."''</p>
<p>And in another place z explaining <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:19">Isaiah 2:19</span> they paraphrase it thus,</p>
<p>""for fear of the Lord"; this is the indignation of the whole world: and for the "glory of his majesty"; this is the Messiah; when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth, when he shall arise and be revealed בארעא דגליל, "in the land of Galilee": because that this is the first place to be destroyed in the holy land; therefore he shall be revealed there the first of all places.''</p>
<p>Here Jesus, the true Messiah, made his first appearance publicly; here he called his disciples, and began his ministry.</p>
