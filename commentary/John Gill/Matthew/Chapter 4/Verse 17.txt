<p><strong>From that time Jesus began to preach and to say</strong>,.... Not from the time he dwelt in Capernaum; for he had preached in Nazareth before he came there, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:16">Luke 4:16</span> nor from the time of John's being cast into prison; for he had preached, and made disciples, who were baptized by his orders, before John's imprisonment, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:22">John 3:22</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:1">John 4:1</span> but from the time that Satan left tempting him; as soon as that combat was over, immediately he went into Galilee, began to preach, and called his disciples. The words with which he began his ministry are the same with which John begun his; which shows the entire agreement between them, in that they not only preached the same doctrine, but in the same words; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:1- :">John 4:1- :</span></p>
