<p><strong>And he saith unto them, follow me</strong>,.... These two brethren had been the disciples of John, as Theophylact thinks, and which seems agreeable to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:35">John 1:35</span> and though through John's pointing out Christ unto them, they had some knowledge of him, and conversation with him, yet they abode with him but for that day, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:37">John 1:37</span> and afterwards returned to their master; and upon his imprisonment, betook themselves to their former employment: from whence Christ now calls them to be his disciples, saying "follow me", or "come after me": that is, be a disciple of mine; see</p>

And to encourage them to it, makes use of this argument; "and", or "for", I "will make you fishers of men": you shall be fishers still, but in a higher sense; and in a far more noble employment, and to much better purpose.

<p>דייגי תורה, "fishers of the law", to use the words of Maimonides g, but fishers of the Gospel. The sea into which they were to cast the net was first Judea, and then the whole world; the fish they were to catch were the souls of men, both among Jews and Gentiles; of whose conversion and faith they were to be the happy instruments: now none could make them fishers in this sense, or fit them for such service, and succeed them in it, but Christ; and who here promises it unto them.</p>
