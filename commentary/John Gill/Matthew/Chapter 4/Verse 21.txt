<p><strong>And going on from thence, he saw other two</strong>,.... When he had gone but a little way further, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:19">Mark 1:19</span> he spied two other persons he was looking for, and had designed to call to the office of apostleship; and these are also described as "brethren", and by name,</p>
<p><strong>James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother</strong>. The Jews make mention in their writings h, of one ר יעקב בר זבדי, "R. James, the son of Zebedee": which Capellus i conjectures is the very same person here mentioned: but the James they speak of as a disciple of Jesus, they call יעקב מינאה, "James the heretic" k; who, they say, was of the village of Secaniah, and sometimes of the village of Sama. His brother's name was John, who was the Evangelist, as well as Apostle: these were</p>
<p><strong>in a ship with Zebedee their father</strong>. Men of this name, and sons of men of this name, were very common among the Jewish Rabbins; but neither this man, nor his sons, were masters or doctors in Israel; for such Christ chose not for his apostles. It seems to be the same name with Zebadiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+27:7">1 Chronicles 27:7</span> these, with him, were "mending their nets", which were broken, and needed repairing; and perhaps being poor, could not afford to buy new ones: this shows their industry and diligence, and may be a pattern and example to persons, closely to attend the business of their calling, whilst the providence of God continues them in it.</p>
<p><strong>And he called them</strong>: from their employment, to follow him, and become his disciples; and no doubt gave them the same promise and encouragement he had given the two former.</p>
