More is expressed here than before, for they not only left their nets, but their ship too; which was of much more value; nay, even "their father" also, "with the hired servants", Mark 1:20 and so complied with the call of Christ to his people, Psalms 45:10 and thereby proved, that they were sincerely his followers, Luke 14:26 and might expect the gracious promise of Christ to be made good unto them,Matthew 19:28.
