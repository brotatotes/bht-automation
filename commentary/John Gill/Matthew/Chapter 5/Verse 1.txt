<p><strong>And seeing the multitudes</strong>,.... The great concourse of people that followed him from the places before mentioned,</p>
<p><strong>he went up into a mountain</strong>; either to pray alone, which was sometimes his custom to do, or to shun the multitude; or rather, because it was a commodious place for teaching the people:</p>
<p><strong>and when he was set</strong>: not for rest, but in order to teach; for sitting was the posture of masters, or teachers, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:2">Matthew 13:2</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:20">Luke 4:20</span>. The form in which the master and his disciples sat is thus described by Maimonides z.</p>
<p>"The master sits at the head, or in the chief place, and the disciples before him in a circuit, like a crown; so that they all see the master, and hear his words; and the master may not sit upon a seat, and the scholars upon the ground; but either all upon the earth, or upon seats: indeed from the beginning, or formerly, היה הרב יושב "the master used to sit", and the disciples stand; but before the destruction of the second temple, all used to teach their disciples as they were sitting.''</p>
<p>With respect to this latter custom, the Talmudists say a, that</p>
<p>"from the days of Moses, to Rabban Gamaliel (the master of the Apostle Paul), they did not learn the law, unless standing; after Rabban Gamaliel died, sickness came into the world, and they learnt the law sitting: hence it is a tradition, that after Rabban Gamaliel died, the glory of the law ceased.''</p>
<p><strong>His disciples came unto him</strong>; not only the twelve, but the company, or multitude, of his disciples, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:17">Luke 6:17</span> which he made in the several places, where he had been preaching; for the number of his disciples was larger than John's.</p>
