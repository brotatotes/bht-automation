<p><strong>Again, ye have heard that it hath been said</strong>,.... Besides what has been observed, in ver. 21 and 27 you know it has also been said,</p>
<p><strong>by, or to them of old time</strong>, what is written in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+19:12">Leviticus 19:12</span>. "And ye shall not swear by my name falsely"; which seems to be referred to, when it is said, "thou shalt not forswear thyself": and is the law forbidding perjury, or false swearing; and was what the Jews were chiefly, if not only concerned about; little regarding the vanity, only the truth of an oath: for they took swearing vainly, to be the same as swearing falsely; wherefore so long as what they swore was truth, they were not careful whether it was of any importance or not: moreover, these men sinned, in that they swore by the creatures, which they thought they might do, and not sin; and when they had so done, were not under obligation to perform; because they made no use of the name of God, to whom only vows and oaths were to be performed, "but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+30:2">Numbers 30:2</span> which they understood of vows only made to the Lord, and not to others; and of oaths, when in his name, and not by others; which they did do, and yet thought themselves not obliged by them.</p>
