<p><strong>But I say unto you, swear not at all</strong>,.... Which must not be understood in the strictest sense, as though it was not lawful to take an oath upon any occasion, in an affair of moment, in a solemn serious manner, and in the name of God; which may be safely done: but of rash swearing, about trivial matters, and by the creatures; as appears by what follows,</p>
<p><strong>neither by heaven</strong>; which is directly contrary to the Jewish canons m, which say,</p>
<p>"they that swear בשמים, "by heaven", and by earth, are free.''</p>
<p>Upon the words in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="so+2:7">Song of Solomon 2:7</span>, "I adjure you", c. it is asked n,</p>
<p>"by what does she adjure them? R. Eliezer says, by the heavens, and by the earth by the hosts, the host above, and the host below.''</p>
<p>So Philo the Jew says o that the most high and ancient cause need not to be immediately mentioned in swearing; but the "earth", the sun, the stars, ουρανον, "heaven", and the whole world. So R. Aben Ezra, and R. David Kimchi, explain <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="am+4:2">Amos 4:2</span>. "The Lord God hath sworn by his holiness"; that is, say they, בשמים, "by heaven": which may be thought to justify them, in this form of swearing; though they did not look upon it as a binding oath, and therefore if broken they were not criminal p.</p>
<p>"He that swears בשמים by heaven, and by the earth, and by the sun, and the like; though his intention is nothing less than to him that created them, this is no oath.''</p>
<p>The reason why it is forbidden by Christ to swear by heaven, is,</p>
<p><strong>for it is God's throne</strong>; referring to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:1">Isaiah 66:1</span> where he sits, the glory of his majesty shines forth, and is itself glorious and excellent, and not to be mentioned in a vain way; and especially, for the reason Christ elsewhere gives, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:22">Matthew 23:22</span> that "he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon"; so that they doubly sinned, first, by openly swearing by that which is God's creature; and then, by tacitly bringing God into their rash and vain oaths.</p>
