<p><strong>Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool</strong>,.... That the Jews were wont to swear by the earth, is clear from the above mentioned instances; and is condemned by Christ for this reason, because the earth is God's "footstool", referring, as before, to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:1">Isaiah 66:1</span> on which he treads; and where he also manifests forth his glory, and is a considerable part of the work of his hands.</p>
<p><strong>Neither by Jerusalem</strong>, which the Jews used to swear by: such forms of vows as these are to be met with in their writings q;</p>
<p>"as the altar, as the temple, כירושלם, "as Jerusalem";''</p>
<p>that is, by Jerusalem, I vow I will do this, or the other thing.</p>
<p>"R. Judah says, he that says Jerusalem (i.e. as Bartenora observes r, without the note of comparison, as) says nothing.''</p>
<p>In the Gemara s it is,</p>
<p>"he that says as Jerusalem, does not say anything, till he has made his vow concerning a thing, which is offered up in Jerusalem.''</p>
<p>Dr. Lightfoot t has produced forms of vowing and swearing, which have not occurred to me.</p>
<p>"Jerusalem; לירושלם, "for", or "unto Jerusalem", which exactly answers to εις Ιεροσολυμα, here; and "by Jerusalem";''</p>
<p>The reason given for prohibiting this kind of oath, is;</p>
<p><strong>for it is the city of the great king</strong>: not of David, but of the King of kings, the Lord of hosts; who had his residence, and his worship, here; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+48:2">Psalms 48:2</span>.</p>
