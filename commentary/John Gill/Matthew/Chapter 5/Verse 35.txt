Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool,.... That the Jews were wont to swear by the earth, is clear from the above mentioned instances; and is condemned by Christ for this reason, because the earth is God's "footstool", referring, as before, to Isaiah 66:1 on which he treads; and where he also manifests forth his glory, and is a considerable part of the work of his hands.Neither by Jerusalem, which the Jews used to swear by: such forms of vows as these are to be met with in their writings q;"as the altar, as the temple, כירושלם, "as Jerusalem";''that is, by Jerusalem, I vow I will do this, or the other thing."R. Judah says, he that says Jerusalem (i.e. as Bartenora observes r, without the note of comparison, as) says nothing.''In the Gemara s it is,"he that says as Jerusalem, does not say anything, till he has made his vow concerning a thing, which is offered up in Jerusalem.''Dr. Lightfoot t has produced forms of vowing and swearing, which have not occurred to me."Jerusalem; לירושלם, "for", or "unto Jerusalem", which exactly answers to εις Ιεροσολυμα, here; and "by Jerusalem";''The reason given for prohibiting this kind of oath, is;for it is the city of the great king: not of David, but of the King of kings, the Lord of hosts; who had his residence, and his worship, here; see Psalms 48:2.q Misn.
