<p><strong>And if any man will sue thee at the law</strong>,.... Or "will contend with thee", or as the Syriac renders it, דנדון עמך, "will strive", or "litigate with thee"; not contest the matter, or try the cause in an open court of judicature, a sense our version inclines to; but will wrangle and quarrel in a private way, in order to</p>
<p><strong>take away thy coat</strong>, by force and violence,</p>
<p><strong>let him have thy cloak also</strong>; do not forbid, or hinder him from taking it; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:29">Luke 6:29</span>. The "coat", is the same with טלית, "the upper garment": and what we render a "cloak", answers to חלוק, "the inward garment"; by which words Sangari expresses the passage in the place before cited: and the sense is, if a wrangling, quarrelsome man, insists upon having thy coat, or upper garment, let him take the next; and rather suffer thyself to be stripped naked than engage in a litigious broil with him. This also is contrary to the above canon of the Jews i, which says;</p>
<p>"If a man should pull another by his ear, or pluck off his hair, or spit, and his spittle should come to him,</p>
<p>העביר טליתו ממנו or "should take his coat from him", or uncover a woman's head in the street, he shall pay four hundred "zuzim", and all this is according to his dignity; says R. Akiba; even the poor in Israel, they consider them as if they were noblemen, who are fallen from their estates, for they are the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.''</p>
