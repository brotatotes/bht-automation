<p><strong>For if ye forgive men their trespasses</strong>,.... Christ here refers to the petition in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:12">Matthew 6:12</span> which is enforced with this reason and argument, "as", or "for", so <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:4">Luke 11:4</span> "we forgive our debtors"; which he repeats and explains: and the reason why he singles out this particularly is, because he knew the Jews were a people very subject to revenge; and were very hardly brought to forgive any injuries done them: wherefore Christ presses it upon them closely to "forgive men their trespasses"; all sorts of injuries done them, or offences given them, whether by word or deed; and that fully, freely, from the heart; forgetting, as well as forgiving; not upbraiding them with former offences; and even without asking pardon, and though there might be no appearance of repentance. Now to this he encourages by saying,</p>
<p><strong>your heavenly Father will also forgive you</strong>; will hear your prayers, and manifest his forgiving love to you: not that the forgiveness of others is the procuring cause of forgiveness with God, which is the blood of Christ; or of the manifestation and application of it, that is, the advocacy of Christ; nor the moving cause of it, that is, the free grace of God: but this enters into the character, and is descriptive of the persons, to whom God is pleased to make a comfortable discovery, and give a delightful sense of his pardoning grace; such persons, so disposed and assisted by his grace, may expect it of him.</p>
