<p><strong>But thou, when thou fastest</strong>,.... Christ allows of fasting, but what is of a quite different kind from that of the Jews; which lay not in an outward abstinence from food, and other conveniences of life, and refreshments of nature; but in an abstinence from sin, in acknowledgment and confession of it; and in the exercise of faith and hope in God, as a God pardoning iniquity, transgression and sin; wherefore cheerfulness, and a free use of the creatures, without an abuse of them, best became such persons.</p>
<p><strong>Anoint thine head, and wash thy face</strong>; directly contrary to the Jewish canons, which forbid these things, with others, on fast days:</p>
<p>"On the day of atonement, (say i they,) a man is forbidden eating and drinking, וברחיצהובסיכה "and washing and anointing", and putting on of shoes, and the use of the bed.''</p>
<p>And the same were forbidden on other fasts: in anointings, the head was anointed first, and this rule and reason are given for it:</p>
<p>"he that would anoint his whole body, סך ראשו תחילה, "let him anoint his head first", because it is king over all its members k.''</p>
<p>Anointing and washing were signs of cheerfulness and joy; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ru+3:3">Ruth 3:3</span>.</p>
