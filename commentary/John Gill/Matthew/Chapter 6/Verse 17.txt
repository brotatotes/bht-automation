But thou, when thou fastest,.... Christ allows of fasting, but what is of a quite different kind from that of the Jews; which lay not in an outward abstinence from food, and other conveniences of life, and refreshments of nature; but in an abstinence from sin, in acknowledgment and confession of it; and in the exercise of faith and hope in God, as a God pardoning iniquity, transgression and sin; wherefore cheerfulness, and a free use of the creatures, without an abuse of them, best became such persons.Anoint thine head, and wash thy face; directly contrary to the Jewish canons, which forbid these things, with others, on fast days:"On the day of atonement, (say i they,) a man is forbidden eating and drinking, וברחיצהובסיכה "and washing and anointing", and putting on of shoes, and the use of the bed.''And the same were forbidden on other fasts: in anointings, the head was anointed first, and this rule and reason are given for it:"he that would anoint his whole body, סך ראשו תחילה, "let him anoint his head first", because it is king over all its members k.''Anointing and washing were signs of cheerfulness and joy; see Ruth 3:3.i Misn.
