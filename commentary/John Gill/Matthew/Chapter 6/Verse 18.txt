<p><strong>That thou appear not unto men to fast</strong>,.... Which is just the reverse of the hypocrites, the Scribes and Pharisees; and quite contrary to the customs of the Jews, who when they fasted, particularly on their noted fasts l,</p>
<p>"brought out the ark into the street of the city, and put burnt ashes upon it, and upon the head of the prince, and upon the head of the president of the sanhedrim, and every man upon his own head.''</p>
<p>All which was done, to be seen of men to fast; but Christ directs to such sorts of fasting, and which is to be done in such a manner, as only to be seen by God:</p>
<p><strong>but unto thy Father which is in secret</strong>; who is invisible, and who sees what is done in secret, and takes notice of the internal exercise of grace; which he approves of, and prefers to outward fastings; and</p>
<p><strong>thy Father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly</strong>: and to have honour from God, is infinitely more than to have the applause of men; for as God delights in, so he will reward his own grace with glory.</p>
<p>l Misn. Taanith, c. 2. sect. 1.</p>
