<p><strong>But when thou dost alms</strong>,.... Do it so privately, and with so much secrecy, that, if it was possible, thou mightest not know it thyself, much less make it known to others:</p>
<p><strong>let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth</strong>; acquaint not thy nearest and dearest friend with it; let not one that sits at thy left hand know what thou art doing with thy right hand; it is a proverbial and hyperbolical phrase, expressing the secrecy of the action. It is a Jewish canon p, that</p>
<p>"he that gives a gift to his friend out of love, may make it known, אבל לא בצדקה, "but not if it be by way of alms".''</p>
<p>p Piske Tosephot in Sabbat. c. 1. art. 134.</p>
