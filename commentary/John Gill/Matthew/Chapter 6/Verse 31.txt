<p><strong>Therefore take no thought</strong>,.... That is, for the morrow, as it is explained, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:34">Luke 6:34</span> for it is lawful to take proper care and thought for present food, drink, and raiment; but not to be anxiously concerned for futurity;</p>
<p><strong>saying, what shall we eat? or what shall we drink? or wherewithal shall we be clothed?</strong> These are a repetition of the several things instanced in, and are the very language and expressions of men of little faith; as in the above citation, מה אוכל למחר, "what shall I eat tomorrow?"</p>
