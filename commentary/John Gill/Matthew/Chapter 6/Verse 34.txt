<p><strong>Take therefore no thought for the morrow</strong>,.... Reference is had to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+27:1">Proverbs 27:1</span>. "Boast not of thyself tomorrow": a man cannot promise or assure himself, that he shall have a morrow, and therefore it is great weakness and folly to be anxiously thoughtful about it. This is expressed in the Talmud s, nearer the sense of Christ's words, after this manner:</p>
<p>"rxm tru rut la, "do not distress thyself with tomorrow's affliction, for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth"; perhaps tomorrow may not be, and thou wilt be found distressing thyself, for the time which is nothing to thee.''</p>
<p>And should it come, it is unnecessary to be thoughtful of it in a distressing manner before hand;</p>
<p><strong>for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself</strong>. The morrow is here introduced by a "prosopopeia", as if it was a person sufficiently thoughtful and careful for the necessaries of it: every day brings along with it fresh care and thought, being attended with fresh wants and troubles; and therefore, it is very unadvisable, to bring the cares and troubles of two days upon one; as he does, who is anxiously concerned today, for the things of tomorrow;</p>
<p><strong>sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof</strong>. This proverb is thus expressed in the Talmud t, דיה לצרה בשעתה, "sufficient for distress", or "vexation, is the present time"; which the gloss explains thus,</p>
<p>"sufficient for the vexation it is, that men should grieve for it, at the time that it comes upon them.''</p>
<p>It is very wrong to anticipate trouble, or meet it before hand; if it was for no other reason but this, that every day's trouble is enough, and should not be needlessly added to, by an over concern what shall be done for tomorrow; or how shall the necessities of it be answered, or the trials of it be endured.</p>
