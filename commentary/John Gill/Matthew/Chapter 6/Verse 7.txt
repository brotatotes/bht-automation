<p><strong>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions</strong>,.... Saying the same things over and over again,</p>
<p><strong>as the Heathens do</strong>, as the worshippers of Baal, from morning till noon, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:26">1 Kings 18:26</span>. This our Lord observes, to dissuade from such practices, because the Gentiles, who were odious to the Jews, used them, and the Jews were guilty of the same; had they not, there would not have been any need of such advice:</p>
<p><strong>for they think they shall be heard for their much speaking</strong>; as did the Jews, who, under pretence of "long prayers", devoured widows' houses; and with whom it is an axiom, that "everyone בתפילה נענה</p>
<p>המרבה, that multiplies prayer is heard" h; and whoever prolongs his prayer, his prayer does not return empty; and he that is long in prayer, his days are prolonged i: and, according to their canons, every day a man ought to pray eighteen prayers. Moreover, their prayer books abound in tautologies, and in expressing the same things in different words, and by a multiplicity of them.</p>
