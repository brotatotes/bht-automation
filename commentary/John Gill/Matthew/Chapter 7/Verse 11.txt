<p><strong>If ye then being evil,</strong>.... As all mankind in general are, both by nature and practice: they are conceived in sin, shapen in iniquity; are evil from their youth, and transgressors from the womb; are corrupt, and do abominable things; and such these Jews were Christ speaks unto; and who, very likely, has respect chiefly to the evil of covetousness they were addicted to. The argument is taken from the lesser to the greater, and runs thus; that if ye, who are but men, men on earth, yea evil men, not over liberal and beneficent, nay covetous and niggardly,</p>
<p><strong>know how to give good gifts unto your children</strong>; can find in your hearts, having it in the power of your hands, to give suitable provisions for the support and sustenance of your children;</p>
<p><strong>how much more shall your Father, which is in heaven</strong>; who is omniscient and omnipotent; who knows the persons and wants of his children, and what is proper for them, and is able to relieve them, being Lord of heaven and earth,</p>
<p><strong>give good things to them that ask him</strong>? Not only temporal good things, as meat, drink, and clothing; but all spiritual good things; every supply of grace; all things pertaining to life and godliness. In <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:13">Luke 11:13</span> "the Holy Spirit" is mentioned, and so seems to design his gifts and graces, everything that is necessary for the spiritual and eternal good of his people: but for these things he must be inquired of, and sought after; and it is the least saints can do to ask for them; and they have encouragement enough to ask; for it is but ask and have.</p>
