<p><strong>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit</strong>,.... Every preacher and teacher that does not bring the Gospel of Christ with him, and plainly and faithfully preach it to the people, sooner or later,</p>
<p><strong>is hewn down</strong>: however he may have appeared as a tall lofty cedar, and have carried it with a high hand against Christ and his Gospel, spoke "great swelling words of vanity", and behaved with much "loftiness" and "haughtiness"; yet the time comes on, when all this is bowed and made low, "and the Lord alone is exalted": such preachers are either cut off from the churches of Christ, or hewn down by death,</p>
<p><strong>and cast into the fire</strong>; into the fire of hell; into the lake of fire and brimstone, "where the beast and false prophet shall be".</p>
