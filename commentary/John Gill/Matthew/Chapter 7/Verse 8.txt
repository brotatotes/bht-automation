<p><strong>For everyone that asketh receiveth</strong>,.... For God is no respecter of persons; whoever makes application, be he a Jew, or a Gentile, rich or poor, bond or free, a man of great gifts, or mean parts, provided he asks aright, from right principles, and with right views, shall not lose his labour; but shall receive all such good things at the hand of God, as are suitable and convenient for him.</p>
<p><strong>And he that seeketh findeth</strong>; he that seeks for God in Christ, the grace and mercy of God, the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; that seeks after the true riches, both of grace and glory, shall be sure to find them; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+21:21">Proverbs 21:21</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And to him that knocketh it shall be opened</strong>: that is, to him that is constant at the throne of grace, who continues knocking at the door of mercy, and will have no denial, it shall be opened to him; and he shall have entrance into the holiest of all by the blood of Jesus.</p>
