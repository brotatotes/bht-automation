<p><strong>And Jesus said unto the centurion</strong>,.... Christ having finished the digression, returns an answer to the centurion, agreeably to his desire, saying to him,</p>
<p><strong>go thy way</strong>; not as displeased with him, but as granting his request: for it follows,</p>
<p><strong>and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee</strong>. As he had faith to believe, that Christ could cure his servant by a word speaking, it was done accordingly. Christ by his almighty "fiat" said, let him be healed, and he was healed: just as God in the creation said, "let there be light, and there was light". He does not say according to thy prayer, or according to thy righteousness, and goodness, but according to thy faith: and it is further to be observed, that this cure was wrought, not so much for the sake of the servant, as his master; and therefore Christ says, "be it done unto thee"; let him be healed for thy sake, and restored unto thee, to thy use, profit, and advantage.</p>
<p><strong>And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour</strong>, at the very exact time, even in that moment. Some copies add, "and when the centurion returned to his house, in the selfsame hour he found his servant healed"; which the Ethiopic version has, and it agrees with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:10">Luke 7:10</span>.</p>
