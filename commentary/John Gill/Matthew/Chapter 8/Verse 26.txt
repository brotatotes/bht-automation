<p><strong>And he saith unto them, why are ye fearful</strong>?.... Though they had some faith in him, yet there was a great deal of fear and unbelief, for which Christ blames them, saying,</p>
<p><strong>O ye of little faith</strong>: <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. In Luke, the phrase is, "where is your faith?" what is become of it? You professed but just now to believe in me, is your faith gone already? In Mark it is, "how is it that ye have no faith?" That is, in exercise, their faith was very small, it could hardly be discerned: some faith they had, as appears by their application to him, but it was very little. They had no faith in him, as sleeping, that he could deliver them; but had some little faith in him that he might, could he be awaked out of sleep; and for this Christ blames them; for he, as the eternal God, was as able to save them sleeping as waking.</p>
<p><strong>Then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm</strong>: being awaked by his disciples, he raises his head from his pillow, stands up, and with a majestic voice, in an authoritative manner, showing some kind of resentment at the wind and sea, as if they had exceeded their commission; and the one had blown, and the other raged too much and too long; he rebukes them in such language as this, "peace, be still"; σιωπα πεφιμωσο, as it is in Mark, be silent, hold your peace, stop your mouth, put a bridle on it, as the words used signify; and go on no longer to threaten with shipwreck and loss of lives; upon which the wind ceased, the sea became calm, and the ship moved quietly on.</p>
