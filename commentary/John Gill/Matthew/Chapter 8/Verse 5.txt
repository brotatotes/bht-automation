<p><strong>And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum</strong>,.... Was returned from his journey through Galilee, to the place where he before dwelt, and is called his own city, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:1">Matthew 9:1</span></p>
<p><strong>there came unto him a centurion</strong>, a Roman officer, שר מאה, "a commander of an hundred men", as the Hebrew Gospel by Munster reads it: though the number of men under a "centurion" was more, according to some accounts.</p>
<p>"A band (it is said g) made two centuries, each of which consisted of an hundred and twenty eight soldiers; for a doubled century made a band, whose governor was called an ordinary "centurion".''</p>
<p>Such an one was Cornelius, a centurion of a band, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1">Acts 10:1</span>. The other person that was healed was a Jew. The next instance of Christ's power and goodness is the servant of a Gentile; he came to do good both to Jews and Gentiles;</p>
<p><strong>beseeching him</strong>, not in person, but by his messengers; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:3">Luke 7:3</span> and the Jews h say, ששלוחו של אדם כמותו, "that a man's messenger is as himself".</p>
