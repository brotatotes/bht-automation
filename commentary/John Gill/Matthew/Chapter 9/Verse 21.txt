<p><strong>For she said within herself</strong>,.... That is, she thought within herself, she reasoned the matter in her mind, she concluded upon it, and firmly believed it; being strongly impressed and influenced by the Spirit of God, and encouraged by instances of cures she had heard were performed by persons only touching him; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:19">Luke 6:19</span></p>
<p><strong>if I may but touch his garment</strong>. The Arabic version reads it, "the hem of his garment", as before; but is not supported by any copy, nor by any other version: her faith was, that if she might be allowed, or if she could by any means come at him, to touch any part of his garment, she should have a cure:</p>
<p><strong>I shall be whole</strong>, or "I shall be saved"; that is, from her disease, from which she could have no deliverance, by the advice and prescriptions of all her former physicians, and by all the means she had made use of.</p>
