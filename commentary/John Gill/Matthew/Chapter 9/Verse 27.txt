<p><strong>And when Jesus departed thence</strong>,.... From the house of Jairus, to another in the same city;</p>
<p><strong>two blind men followed him</strong>: very closely, by the direction of others, having heard of the miracle just now performed by him; and from thence concluded he was able to restore them to their sight;</p>
<p><strong>crying and saying</strong>, with great faith and fervour, with much importunity, and frequently repeating the following words,</p>
<p><strong>thou son of David, have mercy on us</strong>. Whence it appears, that they firmly believed, and were fully persuaded, that he was the true Messiah; for "the son of David" was a known character of the Messiah among the Jews: nothing was more common than to call him by this title, without any other additional epithet, <strong>see Gill "Mt 1:1"</strong>, and since it had been prophesied of the Messiah, that he should "open the eyes of the blind", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:5">Isaiah 35:5</span> they might be greatly encouraged to hope and believe they should obtain mercy from him in this respect.</p>
