<p><strong>Whom I have sent again</strong>,.... From Rome to Colosse, or to Philemon, wherever he was, along with this epistle:</p>
<p><strong>thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels</strong>; meaning his son, who, in a spiritual sense, came out of his bowels, to whom he stood in the relation of a spiritual father; so the Syriac version renders it, as my son, so receive him; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:4">Genesis 15:4</span> and for whom he had a most strong affection, and tender regard; his bowels yearned for him, and he suggests by this expression, that should he reject him, it would give him the utmost pain and uneasiness; and he should be obliged to cry out as the Prophet Jeremy did, "my bowels, my bowels, I am pained at the very heart"; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+4:19">Jeremiah 4:19</span> wherefore he entreats him to receive him again into his house and family, into his service, and into his heart and affections, where the apostle had received him.</p>
