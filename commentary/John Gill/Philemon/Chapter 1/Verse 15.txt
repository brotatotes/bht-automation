<p><strong>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season</strong>,.... The apostle in this clause seems to soften this business of Onesimus in running away from his master; he calls it not a running away, but a departure, an absence from him, and that but for a little while; and suggests that the hand of God might be in it; that there was an overruling providence that attended it, such as was in Joseph's going down into Egypt; and that this separation of Onesimus from his master, for a short time, was in order that they should come together again, and never part more, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>that thou shouldest receive him for ever</strong>; or during life, referring to the law in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:6">Exodus 21:6</span> or to all eternity, since they were in the same spiritual relation, partakers of the same grace, and had a right to the same heavenly inheritance, and should be together with Christ for evermore.</p>
