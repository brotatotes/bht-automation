<p><strong>Not now as a servant</strong>,.... That is, not only as a servant, for a servant he was, and was to be received as such; his call by grace had not dissolved the civil relation that was between him and his master, though it had added to it something that was above it, and greater than it:</p>
<p><strong>but above a servant</strong>; in a higher condition, as the Arabic version renders it, than a servant; not barely considered in that relation, but as being in one much preferable to it:</p>
<p><strong>a brother beloved, specially to me</strong>; a brother in Christ, and to be beloved on that account, as he was especially by the apostle, who had been the instrument of his conversion; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:9">Colossians 4:9</span>.</p>
<p><strong>But how much more unto thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord?</strong> both in a natural and civil sense, as being of the same nation and country, and as being part of his family, his servant, and now become an useful and profitable one; and, in a spiritual sense, being in the Lord, belonging to the Lord Jesus, to that family which is named of him, being a fellow citizen with the saints, and of the household of God, and therefore must be doubly dear to him.</p>
