<p><strong>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</strong> Not with his spirit only, but with the spirit of Apphia and Archippus, to whom also the epistle was sent; and therefore the word is in the plural number; and the Syriac version adds pertinently enough, "my brethren": the salutation is the same as in all the epistles; the form of it agrees with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:18">Galatians 6:18</span> the subscription of the epistle is,</p>
<p><strong>written from Rome, to Philemon, by Onesimus, a servant</strong>; that is, it was written by the Apostle Paul when at Rome, and sent to Philemon by the hands of Onesimus, who was his servant, and upon whose account the letter was written.</p>
