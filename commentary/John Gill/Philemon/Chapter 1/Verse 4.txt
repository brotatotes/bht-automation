<p><strong>I thank my God</strong>,.... Meaning on account, of Philemon, for the grace bestowed upon him, thereafter mentioned; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> making other saints, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:9">Romans 1:9</span>, the apostle was a man much in prayer, frequent at the throne of grace; and he prayed not for himself only, but for all the saints, for all the churches and ministers of the Gospel; whom he not only bore upon his mind and heart, but made mention of them, it may be by name; however, he remembered them, and put up petitions, with thanksgivings, for them; and so he did for Philemon; and which he takes notice of with the same view as before: the word, "always", is so placed in the original text, as to be put either to his thanks to God, or his prayers, and may be true of both; the Syriac and Arabic versions join it to the former; and the Vulgate Latin and the Ethiopic versions place it to the latter.</p>
