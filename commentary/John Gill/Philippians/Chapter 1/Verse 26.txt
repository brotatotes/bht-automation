<p><strong>That your rejoicing may be more abundant</strong>,.... They had rejoiced greatly on his account already, blessing God that ever they had seen his face, or heard his voice; as they had great reason to do, he being the happy instrument of first bringing the Gospel to them, and of their conversion; and now he hoped he should be delivered out of prison, and see them again, that their joy might be increased and abound yet more and more, upon his deliverance, they had so earnestly prayed and so much longed for, and at the sight of him they so dearly loved: and yet to show that this their joy was not looked upon by him as a carnal one, or as arising from a natural affection, he observes that it was</p>
<p><strong>in Jesus Christ</strong>; though they rejoiced in him as an instrument, and therefore he adds,</p>
<p><strong>for me</strong>; yet it was on account of Jesus Christ, the subject of his ministry; their joy did not centre in the apostle, but had Christ for its object, whose person, righteousness, and salvation were held forth by him to their view and comfort; and though they would still more and more rejoice should he return to them once more,</p>
<p><strong>by my coming to you again</strong>; yet still it would he in Christ, and because of the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ, in which he should come to them.</p>
