<p><strong>I sent him therefore the more carefully</strong>,.... Or in greater haste, and as soon as possible:</p>
<p><strong>that when ye see him again ye may rejoice</strong>; for this must greatly increase their joy, to see him again after he had been so long from them, and under such a disorder, which had made them to fear they should never see him more. The Syriac version renders it, "that when ye see him ye may rejoice again"; as they had done heretofore in his conversation and ministry, when among them:</p>
<p><strong>and that I may be the less sorrowful</strong>; when he should hear of his safe arrival among them, and of their joyful reception of him to their mutual satisfaction, which would be an alleviation of the apostle's sorrow in his present circumstances; for he did not expect to be wholly without sorrow while in this life.</p>
