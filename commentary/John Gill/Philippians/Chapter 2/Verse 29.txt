<p><strong>Receive him therefore</strong>,.... Not only into their houses, where such as bring the doctrine of Christ should be admitted, and not others; but into their bosoms, into their hearts and affections, as he had reason to believe they would, and into their fellowship and communion, and to the exercise of his office among them, as their minister: and that</p>
<p><strong>in the Lord</strong>; or "for the Lord", as the Arabic version renders it; for his sake, because he was one that was put into the ministry by him, was called unto it, and qualified for it, and sent forth to minister in it by him; or in the name of the Lord, as an ambassador of his, as representing him, and as if he himself was present; for he that receives a minister of Christ, receives Christ himself; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:16">Luke 10:16</span>;</p>
<p><strong>with all gladness</strong>; with sincere affection, undissembled joy, perfect pleasure, and with all demonstrations of respect unto him, and delight in him at his return to them.</p>
<p><strong>And hold such in reputation</strong>: account such as he precious and valuable; highly esteem of them for their works' sake; reckon them worthy of double honour, and give it to them.</p>
