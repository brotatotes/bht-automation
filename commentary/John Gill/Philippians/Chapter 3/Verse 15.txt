<p><strong>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect</strong>,.... Not absolutely, but comparatively, with respect to other believers, in a lower class of knowledge and experience; and not with respect to degrees, but parts; and regards such who were not children, but of riper age in divine things, unless the words are spoken ironically:</p>
<p><strong>be thus minded</strong>; as the apostle was, to count what were gain to him, loss for Christ; to reckon all things but loss and dung, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ; to be willing to suffer the loss of all things, to win him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:8">Philippians 3:8</span>; to desire to be found in him, and in his righteousness, and not a man's own, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:9">Philippians 3:9</span>; to know more of him in his person, righteousness, sufferings, death, and resurrection from the dead, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:10">Philippians 3:10</span>; and to attain to such a state, and yet to disclaim all perfection, and acknowledge their imperfection, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:11">Philippians 3:11</span>; and to forget things behind, and reach to those before, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:13">Philippians 3:13</span>; and press towards the mark, Christ, for the prize of eternal glory, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:14">Philippians 3:14</span>:</p>
<p><strong>and if in anything ye be otherwise minded</strong>; as to seek for justification by the works of the law, or partly by Christ and partly by the law, and to imagine and expect perfection in this life:</p>
<p><strong>God shall reveal even this unto you</strong>; such errors will be made manifest sooner or later; the day will declare them, and such wood, hay, and stubble, will be burnt up by the fire, which will reveal every man's work, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:12">1 Corinthians 3:12</span>.</p>
