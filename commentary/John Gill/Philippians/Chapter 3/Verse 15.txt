Let us therefore, as many as be perfect,.... Not absolutely, but comparatively, with respect to other believers, in a lower class of knowledge and experience; and not with respect to degrees, but parts; and regards such who were not children, but of riper age in divine things, unless the words are spoken ironically:be thus minded; as the apostle was, to count what were gain to him, loss for Christ; to reckon all things but loss and dung, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ; to be willing to suffer the loss of all things, to win him, Philippians 3:8; to desire to be found in him, and in his righteousness, and not a man's own, Philippians 3:9; to know more of him in his person, righteousness, sufferings, death, and resurrection from the dead, Philippians 3:10; and to attain to such a state, and yet to disclaim all perfection, and acknowledge their imperfection, Philippians 3:11; and to forget things behind, and reach to those before, Philippians 3:13; and press towards the mark, Christ, for the prize of eternal glory, Philippians 3:14:and if in anything ye be otherwise minded; as to seek for justification by the works of the law, or partly by Christ and partly by the law, and to imagine and expect perfection in this life:God shall reveal even this unto you; such errors will be made manifest sooner or later; the day will declare them, and such wood, hay, and stubble, will be burnt up by the fire, which will reveal every man's work, 1 Corinthians 3:12.
