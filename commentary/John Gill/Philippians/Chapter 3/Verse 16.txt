Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained,.... Whatever degree of knowledge of Christ, and the truths of his Gospel, is attained to, let it be retained, and not departed from:let us walk by the same rule; either the doctrine of justification by Christ's righteousness in particular, which is a rule of judgment concerning other things; for so far as they agree or disagree with this, they are to be received or rejected; or the Scriptures of truth, which are the rule of faith and practice, and the standard and test, to which all are to be brought and tried:let us mind the same thing; be of one heart and affection to each other, Romans 12:10, and of the same judgment in the doctrines of the Gospel, 1 Corinthians 1:10, and pursue the same measures; particularly press towards the same mark, and for the same prize the apostle did, Philippians 3:14, and be followers of him, as is exhorted to in Philippians 3:17.
