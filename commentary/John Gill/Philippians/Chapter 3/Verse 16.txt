<p><strong>Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained</strong>,.... Whatever degree of knowledge of Christ, and the truths of his Gospel, is attained to, let it be retained, and not departed from:</p>
<p><strong>let us walk by the same rule</strong>; either the doctrine of justification by Christ's righteousness in particular, which is a rule of judgment concerning other things; for so far as they agree or disagree with this, they are to be received or rejected; or the Scriptures of truth, which are the rule of faith and practice, and the standard and test, to which all are to be brought and tried:</p>
<p><strong>let us mind the same thing</strong>; be of one heart and affection to each other, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:10">Romans 12:10</span>, and of the same judgment in the doctrines of the Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:10">1 Corinthians 1:10</span>, and pursue the same measures; particularly press towards the same mark, and for the same prize the apostle did, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:14">Philippians 3:14</span>, and be followers of him, as is exhorted to in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:17">Philippians 3:17</span>.</p>
