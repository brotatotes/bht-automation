<p><strong>Concerning zeal, persecuting the church</strong>,.... The Vulgate Latin version adds, "of God", as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:13">Galatians 1:13</span>. The apostle was very zealous of the traditions of the elders, and for the law of God, and towards God also; though his zeal was not according to knowledge, but blind, ignorant, and furious; which pushed him on to persecute the followers of Christ, and the church of Christ at Jerusalem more especially, in a very violent and outrageous manner; he held the clothes of those that stoned Stephen, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:58">Acts 7:58</span>; he consented unto his death, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span>; he made havoc of the church at Jerusalem, haling men and women to prison, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span>; he continued breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:1">Acts 9:1</span>; gave his voice against them when put to death, punished them frequently in the synagogues by scourging them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span>, and compelled them to blaspheme the name of Christ; was exceeding mad against them, pursued them to strange cities, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:11">Acts 26:11</span>, and persecuted the church of God exceedingly, more than anyone single person besides.</p>
<p><strong>Touching the righteousness which is in, the law, blameless</strong>. This he mentions last, as including the whole of his righteousness, civil, ceremonial, and moral; and which he fancied was so perfect, that whatever righteousness was in the law, or required by it, he had it, and to such a degree, that he was blameless before God and men; that he was justified by it in the sight of God, and could not justly be found fault with by any, or be charged with any defect in his obedience, either to the moral or ceremonial law; which must arise from great ignorance of the righteousness of God, and the strictness of his justice, and of the law of God, and the purity, spirituality, and extent of it, which reaches to the thoughts of the heart, and the first motions of sin; and of himself, the plague of his own heart, of the sin of lust, and of the exceeding sinfulness of sin, in every instance of it.</p>
