<p><strong>But I have all things, and abound</strong>,.... Or "I have received all things", as the Syriac version renders it; all that they had sent by Epaphroditus; and for which he now gives a receipt; and by virtue of which he now abounded; and which abundance of his was not so much owing to the largeness of their presents, as to the peace of his mind; looking upon this gift of theirs, though it might be but small in itself, a fulness to him; for he adds,</p>
<p><strong>I am full</strong>; as much as he desired, he wanted no more, he had enough:</p>
<p><strong>having received of Epaphroditus the things [which were sent] from you</strong>: and which he acknowledged, that the character of this good man might stand clear, who had been intrusted with this affair:</p>
<p><strong>an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God</strong>, this is said in allusion to the sacrifices under the former dispensation, in which God smelled a sweet savour, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+8:21">Genesis 8:21</span>, in reference to which, as the sacrifice of Christ is said to be of a sweet smelling savour, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:2">Ephesians 5:2</span>, and as the spiritual sacrifices of the saints, as praises and prayers, are called odours, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:8">Revelation 5:8</span>, and are said to be acceptable unto God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>; so acts of beneficence are called sacrifices, with which he is well pleased, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:16">Hebrews 13:16</span>.</p>
