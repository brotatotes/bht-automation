<p><strong>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus</strong>,.... Meaning at Philippi, whether rich or poor, lesser or greater believers, common saints, as well as the officers of the church, bishops and deacons; who were in Christ by electing grace, and as their covenant head, and representative from everlasting, and which was manifested and made known by their conversion and the effectual calling:</p>
<p><strong>the brethren which are with me greet you</strong>; such as Timothy; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:19">Philippians 2:19</span>; and Epaphras, Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Lucas; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:23">Philemon 1:23</span>; he makes no mention of Peter anywhere, when he writes from Rome or to it, which shows he was not there then, or a bishop of that place, as the Papists say.</p>
