<p><strong>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all</strong>,.... The Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions read, "with your spirit", as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:18">Galatians 6:18</span>; and so the Alexandrian copy and some others read. This is the apostle's token in all his epistles of the genuineness of them, and which he wrote with his own hand, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17- :">2 Thessalonians 3:17- :</span>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17- :">2 Thessalonians 3:17- :</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Amen</strong>: with which all the epistles are concluded;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17- :">2 Thessalonians 3:17- :</span>.</p>
<p>The subscription is,</p>
<p><strong>[it was] written [to] the Philippians from Rome, by Epaphroditus</strong>; that this epistle was written to the Philippians by the Apostle Paul, when he was a prisoner at Rome, and sent to them by Epaphroditus their minister, when he returned from him to them.</p>
