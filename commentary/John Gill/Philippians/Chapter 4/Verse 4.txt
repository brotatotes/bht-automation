<p><strong>Rejoice in the Lord alway</strong>,.... This is a repetition of the exhortation in the preceding chapter; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; with this addition "alway"; for there is always cause and matter for rejoicing in Christ, even in times of affliction, distress, and persecution; since he is always the same; his grace is always sufficient; his blood has a continual virtue in it, and always speaks for peace and pardon; his righteousness is an everlasting one, and so is his salvation, and such is his love; though some join this word with what follows,</p>
<p><strong>[and] again, I say, rejoice</strong>; this is what was continually inculcated by him, as being of great importance and use for the comfort of believers, and the honour of Christ.</p>
