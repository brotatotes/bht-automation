<p><strong>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true</strong>,.... To close all with respect to the duties of Christianity incumbent on the professors of it, the apostle exhorts to a regard to everything that is true; that is agreeable to the Scriptures of truth, to the Gospel the word of truth, or to the law and light of nature; and whatever was really so, even among the very Heathens, in opposition to falsehood, lying, and hypocrisy</p>
<p><strong>whatsoever things [are] honest</strong>; in the sight of men; or grave, or "venerable" in speech, in action or attire, in opposition to levity, frothiness, or foppery:</p>
<p><strong>whatsoever things [are] just</strong>; between man and man, or with respect both to God and men; giving to God what belongs to him, and to man what is his due; studying to exercise a conscience void of offence to both, in opposition to all impiety, injustice, violence, and oppression:</p>
<p><strong>whatsoever things [are] pure</strong>; or "chaste", in words and deeds, in opposition to all filthiness and foolish talking, to obscene words and actions. The Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions render it, "whatsoever things are holy"; which are agreeable to the holy nature, law, and will of God, and which tend to promote holiness of heart and life:</p>
<p><strong>whatsoever [are] lovely</strong>; which are amiable in themselves, and to be found even among mere moral men, as in the young man whom Christ as man is said to love, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:21">Mark 10:21</span>; and which serve to cultivate and increase love, friendship, and amity among men; and which things also are grateful to God and lovely in his sight, in opposition to all contention, strife, wrath, and hatred:</p>
<p><strong>whatsoever things [are] of good report</strong>; are well spoken of, and tend to get and establish a good name, which is better than precious ointment, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ec+7:1">Ecclesiastes 7:1</span>; for though a good name, credit, and reputation among men, are to be sacrificed for the sake of Christ when called for; yet care is to be taken to preserve them by doing things which may secure them, and cause professors of religion to be well reported of; and which beautiful in all, and absolutely necessary in some:</p>
<p><strong>if [there be] any virtue</strong>; anywhere, among any persons whatever, in opposition to vice:</p>
<p><strong>and if [there be] any praise</strong>; that is praiseworthy among men, and deserves commendation, even though in an unjust steward, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:8">Luke 16:8</span>, it should be regarded. The Vulgate Latin adds, "of discipline", without any authority from any copy. The Claromontane manuscript reads, "if any praise of knowledge":</p>
<p><strong>think on these things</strong>: meditate upon them, revolve them in your minds, seriously consider them, and reason with yourselves about them, in order to put them into practice.</p>
