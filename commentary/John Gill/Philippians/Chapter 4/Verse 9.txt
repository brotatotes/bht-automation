<p><strong>These things which ye have both learned</strong>,.... Meaning from himself, in a doctrinal way:</p>
<p><strong>and received</strong>; not only into their heads but hearts, had embraced cordially, with great affection, in the love thereof, as well as given a full assent to:</p>
<p><strong>and heard</strong>; either publicly or privately, from the pulpit, or in conversation; or had heard of him when absent, or from him when present:</p>
<p><strong>and seen in me</strong>: in his life and conversation, which were well known, and were a pattern to them that believe; and therefore he adds,</p>
<p><strong>do</strong>; practise the same things which they had learned from him as their duty, and had heard him urge as such, and had seen exemplified in himself:</p>
<p><strong>and the God of peace shall be with you</strong>; to give that peace which is beyond the conception of a natural man, and the expression of a spiritual one, and is the great preservative through Christ; and to enable to do and to continue to do the above things, and to keep them from all harm, and every enemy of their souls; to favour them with his gracious presence here, and with endless peace hereafter.</p>
