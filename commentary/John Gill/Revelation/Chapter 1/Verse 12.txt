<p><strong>And I turned to see the voice that spake with me</strong>,.... The Complutensian edition reads, "and there I turned": and so the Arabic version; that is, to see who it was that spoke, from whom the voice came, and by whom it was uttered; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:18">Exodus 20:18</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks</strong>; which represented the seven churches, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>; in allusion to the seven lamps in the candlestick of the sanctuary, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:37">Exodus 25:37</span>; compared to "candlesticks", for the use of them, which is to hold forth light; these have none of themselves, but what is put into them, and being put into them, they hold it forth; so the churches of Christ have no light of themselves, but what is put into them; and the light which is put into them, is not the mere light of nature, nor the law of Moses, but the Gospel of Christ; which dispels darkness, and is the means of enlightening sinners, and gives light to saints, by which they walk and work; and this light is put into the churches by Christ, whose the Gospel is, and who is himself come a light into the world; and being put here by him, it is held forth by them, especially by the ministers of it, who are the lights of the world, both by their ministry, and in their lives and conversations: and they are compared to "golden" candlesticks, because of their excellency, preciousness, and value, in the esteem of Christ; and for their brightness and purity in doctrine, discipline, and life; and for their splendour, glory, and beauty; and for their stability and duration; and though they are liable to corruption and taint, yet may be melted, refined, and purified as gold.</p>
