<p><strong>And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace</strong>,.... By which is meant, not his human nature in a suffering state; or his people, the meaner and lower parts of his mystical body, in a like state; or his apostles and ministers, who are supporters of his church, and run to and fro with spiritual knowledge, for which, though they suffer much, are permanent and glorious; but either the power of Christ in bearing up and supporting his people, in the care and government and defence of them; or his ways, works, and walks in his churches, and all his providential administrations towards them, which are holy, just, and righteous, and will be manifest; or his wrath and vengeance in treading down and trampling upon his enemies:</p>
<p><strong>and his voice as the sound of many waters</strong>; meaning his Gospel, as preached by his apostles and ministers, which was heard far and near; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:18">Romans 10:18</span>; and which made a great noise in the world; or his voice of vengeance on his enemies, which will be very terrible and irresistible.</p>
