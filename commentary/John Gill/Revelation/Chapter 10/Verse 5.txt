<p><strong>And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth</strong>,.... His right foot being on the one, and his left foot upon the other, as described in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:2">Revelation 10:2</span>;</p>
<p><strong>lifted up his hand to heaven</strong>; the Oriental versions read, "his right hand"; and so some copies, and the Complutensian edition: the man clothed in linen, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:6">Daniel 12:6</span>, who is the same with the angel here, held up both his hands; the lifting up of the hand was a gesture used in swearing: see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:22">Genesis 14:22</span>; so the Jews say o, "the right hand", or by the right hand, זו יבועה, "this is an oath", according to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:7">Daniel 12:7</span>; or whether the right hand or the left, is an oath, according to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+62:8">Isaiah 62:8</span>.</p>
<p>o T. Bab. Nazir, fol. 3. 2. Yalkut Simeoni, par. 2. fol. 58. 1.</p>
