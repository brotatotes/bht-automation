<p><strong>But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound</strong>,.... This is an exception to what the angel had said and swore to, that time should be no longer; "but", or "unless", or "except the time of the voice of the seventh angel", as the Ethiopic version renders it; when a new period and sort of time should begin, very different from the former, which then should be no more; for now will be the time of Christ's kingdom on earth, which shall last a thousand years; this time will not be like the former, a time of darkness and ignorance, as was in some periods, partly through the errors and heresies which were propagated in early times, and through that barbarity and ignorance which the Goths, Huns, and Vandals, spread over the empire, when they broke into it, and chiefly through the smoke of the bottomless pit, the false doctrine and worship of the Papists and Mahometans; but in the time of the seventh angel, all this gross darkness will be removed, and it will be a time of unspeakable and everlasting light, so that there will be no need of the sun and moon, of Gospel ministrations and ordinances: nor will it be a time of affliction and persecution; time in that sense will be no more, as it has been under the ten Pagan emperors, and under the Arian emperors, and under the Papal hierarchy; for in this period there will be no more death, sorrow, crying, pain, and tears; though there will be time, it will be another sort of time, quite different from the former, which will be no more when the seventh angel once begins; and as soon as he begins to sound, this will put an end to antichristian time; and at the end of his sounding will begin the time of Christ, or the thousand years' reign: and then</p>
<p><strong>the mystery of God should be finished</strong>; that is, the angel not only swears that time shall be no longer, but that also then shall be finished the mystery of God; by which is meant, not the resurrection of the dead, and the change of the living, which is called a mystery, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:51">1 Corinthians 15:51</span>; for though when this angel sounds, and has done sounding, and Christ comes, the first resurrection, or the resurrection of the dead in Christ, will be finished, yet not the whole resurrection; for the rest of the dead will not live again till the end of the thousand years: but rather the Gospel is designed, which is often called the mystery, and the mystery of the Gospel, and contains many mysteries in it, which are styled the mysteries of God; which respect him, his being, persons, operations, and grace; and are revealed and made known by him; and the finishing of this may respect the preaching of the Gospel to all nations, which will be before the end of the world, and whereby the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, and multitudes of souls converted; wherefore it may be best of all to understand this of the church of God, the general assembly and church of the firstborn, even all the elect of God, whose number will now be finished and completed in the conversion of the Jews, and in the bringing in the fulness of the Gentiles, both which are called "mysteries", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:25">Romans 11:25</span>; and now as the antichristian church is called "mystery", "Babylon", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:5">Revelation 17:5</span>; and "the mystery of iniquity", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</span>; so the true Christian church, the new Jerusalem, coming down from heaven, and prepared as a bride adorned for her husband, may bear the name of the mystery of God; and this may also take in the mystery of all God's providences and promises, and prophecies, respecting the state of his church and people on earth:</p>
<p><strong>as he hath declared to his servants and prophets</strong>; as to Isaiah in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:3">Isaiah 60:3</span>, c. and <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:8">Isaiah 66:8</span> and to Daniel, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:44">Daniel 2:44</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:25">Daniel 7:25</span>; and to Zechariah, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:9">Zechariah 14:9</span>, and others; and which was a Gospel declaration, as the word signifies; it was good news and glad tidings; glorious things were declared to them, and spoken by them, concerning the city and church of God, its happy state on earth, and Christ's reign in it.</p>
