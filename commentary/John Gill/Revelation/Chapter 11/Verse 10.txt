<p><strong>And they that dwell upon the earth</strong>,.... Out of which the beast arose, and over which he reigns, even the inhabitants of the Roman empire, often in this book called the earth, the followers of antichrist, men that mind nothing but earth, and earthly things:</p>
<p><strong>shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another</strong>; as is usual with persons, and was with the Jews, to do in times of public rejoicing; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="es+9:18">Esther 9:18</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth</strong>; not because they were tormented by them, but because they were now freed from their tormenting ministry; they had tormented them by the preaching of the Gospel, which is foolishness, and the savour of death to natural men, and gives them pain, and fills them with vexation and wrath; by their testimony which they had bore for Christ, and against antichrist; by their sharp reproof of them for their false doctrine and will worship, and their impure lives and conversations; by their own holy lives, which would sometimes flash light into their consciences, and make them uneasy; and by their foretelling the calamities and ruin, temporal and eternal, that would come upon them; but now they are silenced, and they hear and see no more of these things at which they rejoice.</p>
