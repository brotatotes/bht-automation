<p><strong>And the four and twenty elders</strong>,.... The same with those in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:4">Revelation 4:4</span>;</p>
<p><strong>which sat before God on their seats</strong>; as they are also there described; and which may be expressive of their enjoyment of the divine Presence; and also of their quiet and undisturbed situation, being restored to their former places, which they now possess without molestation and interruption; for as these are the representatives of Gospel churches in all ages, they were with the church in the wilderness during the 1260 days, or years: hence we hear nothing of them from the time of the sealing of the hundred and forty and four thousand, and during the sounding of the trumpets; but now they are restored to their former seats, and upon this wonderful change of things in the world, they</p>
<p><strong>fell upon their faces and worshipped God</strong>; in a very humble and reverential posture, and in a way of praise and thanksgiving.</p>
