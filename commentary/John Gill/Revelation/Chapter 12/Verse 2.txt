<p><strong>And she being big with child</strong>,.... Which may be expressive of the fruitfulness of the church in bearing and bringing forth many souls to Christ, and which were very numerous in this period of time, when it was said of Zion that this and that man was born in her; and particularly of her pregnancy with the kingdom of Christ, to be brought forth, and set up in the Roman empire, under the influence of a Roman emperor: and this being her case, she</p>
<p><strong>cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered</strong>; which are metaphors taken from a woman in travail; and may either denote the earnest cries and fervent prayers of the members of the church, and the laborious and painful ministrations of the preachers of the Gospel for the conversion of souls, and especially for the setting up of the kingdom of Christ in the empire of Rome; or else the sore and grievous persecutions which attended the apostles of Christ, and succeeding ministers of the word, throughout the times of the ten Roman emperors, and especially under Dioclesian; when the church was big, and laboured in great pain, and the time was drawing on apace that a Christian emperor should be brought forth, who should be a means of spreading the Gospel, and the kingdom of Christ, all over the empire; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+30:6">Jeremiah 30:6</span>; so the Targumist frequently explains the pains of a woman in travail in the prophets by עקא, "tribulation"; see the Targum on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:8">Isaiah 13:8</span>.</p>
