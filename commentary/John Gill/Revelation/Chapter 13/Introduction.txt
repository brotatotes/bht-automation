<p>INTRODUCTION TO REVELATION 13</p>
<p>This chapter contains a description of the Romish antichrist, under the figure of two beasts, the one representing him in his civil power, the other in his ecclesiastical power. The first beast is described by its origin, the sea, and by the monstrous shape its several parts; its heads seven, in which were the name of blasphemy; its horns ten, on which were crowns; its skin like a leopard, its feet as a bear, and its mouth as a lion; and by its state and condition, having power, a throne, and great authority; and having one of its heads wounded, and healed; and by the great regard had unto him, being wondered at, and worshipped by all the world, and declared to be more powerful than any, and none to be like them,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>. Next an account is given of what he was suffered to have, a blaspheming mouth, and power to continue forty two months,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:5">Revelation 13:5</span>; and of what he said or uttered, his blasphemy against God, his name, tabernacle, and the inhabitants of heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:6">Revelation 13:6</span>; and of what he did by permission, made war with the saints, overcame them, and had power over all people, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:7">Revelation 13:7</span>; and of the worship given him by the reprobate part of the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:8">Revelation 13:8</span>; and the whole is concluded with an exhortation exciting attention to what had been said, with a threatening to the beast, and a word of comfort to the saints, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:9">Revelation 13:9</span>. And then follows the description of the second beast, by its original the earth; by its likeness to a lamb, and a dragon; to the former for its two horns, and to the latter for its speech, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:11">Revelation 13:11</span>; and by the actions ascribed to it, which are many; as exercising all the power of the first beast; causing all the inhabitants of the earth to worship that; doing miracles, of which one is mentioned, thereby deceiving the men of the world; ordering them to make an image to the wounded beast; giving life to it, so that it could speak; putting to death all that refused to worship it; obliging men of all ranks and degrees to have a mark in their right hands or foreheads, and forbidding such that had not to buy or sell, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:12">Revelation 13:12</span>. And the chapter is concluded with an epiphonema, exciting men of understanding to search out, and count the number of the beast's name, since it is possible to be done, being the number of a man, and easy to be done, consisting of three Greek letters, χ ξ ς, which are numerically 666, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:18">Revelation 13:18</span>. </p>
