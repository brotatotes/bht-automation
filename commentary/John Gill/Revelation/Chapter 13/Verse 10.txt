<p><strong>He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity</strong>,.... As the devil, by whom men are led captive at his will, and the Romish antichrist, who leads multitudes of souls to hell; these shall be taken and cast into the lake which burns with fire and brimstone. The Jews g have a saying, that</p>
<p>"captivity comes into the world for idolatry, uncleanness, and murder;''</p>
<p>which three things are notorious in the Romish antichrist: and in the same treatise they say h, that the sword, the next judgment mentioned, comes into the world for delay of justice, and the perversion of it.</p>
<p><strong>He that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword</strong>; the design of the phrase is to show, that there will be a just retaliation made to the antichristian beast, for all his cruelty to the saints, and the murders of them; and that because he has shed much blood of the saints, blood shall be given him to drink, and he shall be used in like manner he has used others; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:6">Genesis 9:6</span></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:52">Matthew 26:52</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Here is the patience and the faith of the saints</strong>; meaning either that hereby, through the cruelties and barbarities of the Romish antichrist, the patience and faith of the saints are tried; and that they have great need of them, and of the exercise of them, under such usages; and that these being tried, and continue, will receive much commendation, honour, and praise; or else the sense is, that it requires both faith and patience in the saints, to believe that antichrist will be thus destroyed, and to wait quietly till the time comes. The Arabic version reads, "here is the patience and prayers of the saints": who cry, how long will it be ere our blood is avenged? and have need of patience to rest a while, till their prayers are answered.</p>
