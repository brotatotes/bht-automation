<p><strong>And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him</strong>,.... Sitting in the same seat, having the same power and authority from the dragon, making war with the saints by preaching and writing against them, by anathemas, excommunications, and bulls, and so overcame and silenced them, or delivered them over to the secular arm to be put to death, ruling over the consciences of men in a tyrannical way, in all nations, kindreds, and tongues, in the empire; and all this before, in the presence, and under the influence of the secular power, of the Papacy, signified by the first beast, and with his good liking, and for his credit and support:</p>
<p><strong>and causeth the earth, and them that dwell therein</strong>; the Roman empire, and the inhabitants of it, especially the carnal and earthly part of them:</p>
<p><strong>to worship the first beast</strong>; to be subject to the temporal power of the Papacy, or to submit to the pope as a temporal lord, to give homage and tribute to him, and the like, in order to support his worldly power and grandeur; and this was caused or brought about by his emissaries, his spiritual vassals, his legates, cardinals, priests, c. by their exhortations, persuasions, and commands, delivered both in writing and preaching:</p>
<p><strong>whose deadly wound was healed</strong> which deadly wound was given the Roman empire under its sixth head, the emperors, when they ceased, and was healed by the pope, the seventh head, being set as a temporal monarch over the ten kingdoms in it.</p>
