<p><strong>And they worshipped the dragon</strong>,.... The devil, in the idols, images, angels, and saints departed, to whom they give adoration, as did the Gentiles, whose successors they are, and whose name they bear; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:20">1 Corinthians 10:20</span>;</p>
<p><strong>which gave power unto the beast</strong>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:2">Revelation 13:2</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and they worshipped the beast</strong>; not only in a civil way, being subject to him as their temporal lord, to whom they give homage; obedience, and tribute, but in a religious way; for antichrist sits in the temple to be worshipped as God, showing himself that he is God, and receives adorations from his creatures, the cardinals, and others; but woe to them that worship this beast; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:9">Revelation 14:9</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Saying, who [is] like unto the beast</strong>? using such expressions as are used of God himself, implying that there is none like him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:11">Exodus 15:11</span>, yea, they ascribe deity to him, calling him our Lord God the pope, God, and a God on earth; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:11- :">Exodus 15:11- :</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Who is able to make war with him</strong>? And indeed, such was his power and strength once, that he was more than a match for emperors and kings; and those were badly off that engaged in a war with him, when his power was such, that he could depose one, and set up other, kick the crowns of kings, tread upon the necks of emperors, oblige them to hold his stirrup, while mounted his horse, and keep them barefoot at his gate for days together, waiting for admittance; of all which there are instances.</p>
