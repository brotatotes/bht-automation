<p><strong>And it was given unto him to make war with the saints</strong>,.... The remnant of the woman's seed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:17">Revelation 12:17</span>, whom God has set apart for himself, Christ has cleansed from sin by his blood, and the Holy Spirit has sanctified by his grace; and who under the influence of it live holy lives and conversations; against such Satan always bore an enmity; and it is an aggravation of the wickedness of the Romish antichrist, that he makes war with such, which he is stirred up to by Satan, with a malicious intent, and is permitted by God for the trial of the faith and patience of his people: this war of antichrist, with the saints, may be understood not merely spiritually, of his anathemas, excommunications, bulls, and the like, but literally, of his drawing the temporal sword against them; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:10">Revelation 13:10</span>; and bringing of armies against them, and fighting pitched battles; and it is thought there may be a special regard had to his war with the Waldenses and Albigenses, in which war it is said that a million were slain; and may take in all his ways and methods of destroying the saints, by the bloody Inquisition, murders, massacres, and punishments of all sorts; and also his last war with the two witnesses, in which they will be slain, which is yet to come,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:7">Revelation 11:7</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and to overcome them</strong>: not so as to submit to him, and to forsake the doctrines and ordinances of Christ, but by killing them; and who, by dying in the faith and cause of Christ, overcome Satan, get the victory over the world, and antichrist, and are more than conquerors through him that has loved them.</p>
<p><strong>And power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations</strong>; in the Roman empire, which wondered after him, and worshipped him, and over whom he has reigned, and has exercised both a temporal and spiritual jurisdiction; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:15">Revelation 17:15</span>.</p>
