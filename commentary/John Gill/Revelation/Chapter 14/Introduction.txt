<p>INTRODUCTION TO REVALATION 14</p>
<p>This chapter contains three visions; one of the Lamb on Mount Zion, another of the three angels preaching against Babylon, and the third of the harvest and vintage. The vision of the Lamb is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>, which is no other than Christ, described by his similitude, as a Lamb; by the place where he was, Mount Zion; by his position there, standing, and by the company that were with him, whose number were 144,000, and their character, his Father's name written on their foreheads; at the same time a voice was heard from heaven, comparable to the sound of many waters, of thunders, and of harps: and a song sung which none learn but the above number with the Lamb,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:2">Revelation 14:2</span>, who are described by their purity, chastity, and strict adherence to Christ; by their redemption through him; by their being the firstfruits of God and of the Lamb, and by their integrity and unblemished character, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:4">Revelation 14:4</span>; next follows the account of the three angels; the first comes with the everlasting Gospel, to preach it to all men, loudly calling upon all to fear and worship God, and give glory to him, since he is the Creator of all, and the hour of his judgment is come, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6">Revelation 14:6</span>; the second proclaims the fall of Babylon, with the reason of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>; and the third denounces the wrath of God upon the worshippers of the beast in the most public manner, and that for ever, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:9">Revelation 14:9</span>; and this vision is closed with some expressions, showing that, till this was done, the patience of the saints would be tried, and the true worshippers of the Lamb be discovered, and comforting them with an assurance of that rest that remains after death for the faithful followers of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:12">Revelation 14:12</span>; after this is the vision of the harvest and vintage of the earth. The reaper is described by his form, like the son of man; by his seat, a white cloud; by a golden crown on his head, and by a sharp sickle in his hand, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14">Revelation 14:14</span>; who is called upon by an angel out of the temple to make use of his sickle, and reap, because the time of reaping was come, the harvest being ripe,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:15">Revelation 14:15</span>, upon which he thrusts in his sickle, and reaps the earth,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:16">Revelation 14:16</span>; after this, another angel appears out of the temple, with a sharp sickle, to whom another angel from the altar, that had power over fire, calls to make use of his sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine, since the grapes were fully ripe, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:17">Revelation 14:17</span>; upon which he thrusts in his sickle, and gathers them, and casts them into the winepress of divine wrath, which being trodden, blood comes out of it to the horses' bridles for the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:19">Revelation 14:19</span>. </p>
