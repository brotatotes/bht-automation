<p><strong>And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever</strong>,.... That is, the smoke of that fire which torments them will for ever arise; or, in other words, there will be no end of their torment; hence their misery is called everlasting fire, everlasting punishment, and everlasting destruction, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:41">Matthew 25:41</span> and smoke being very troublesome and distressing, is mentioned to set forth the very uncomfortable state of the wicked; and so it is used by Jewish writers: hence we read of תנן גהנם, "the smoke of hell" r, with which the eyes of the wicked will be filled in the world to come:</p>
<p><strong>and they have no rest, day nor night</strong>; the fire of divine wrath which tortures them is never quenched, and the worm of conscience which gnaws them never dies: this is directly contrary to a notion of the Jews, that the wicked in hell have rest sometimes; they talk of angels blowing away the smoke from them, so that they have rest an hour and a half; and which they say they have three times a day, and whenever Israel says Amen, let his great name be blessed s; and particularly that hell fire never burns on the sabbath day, nor does the smoke of it ascend then, and that the wicked have always rest on that days t; though sometimes they contradict themselves, and say they never have any rest u, which is the truth:</p>
<p><strong>who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name</strong>; that is, whoever are the followers of antichrist, or the professors of the Popish religion; so far is salvation from being in the church of Rome, and only there, that there is none in it; and whoever live and die in the profession of Popery, shall surely be damned as this passage is true.</p>
