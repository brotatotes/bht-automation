<p><strong>And I looked, and behold a white cloud</strong>,.... In this verse is a description of the person principally concerned in the harvest of the earth, hereafter mentioned; by whom is designed not some great potentate or prince, an encourager of the Reformation among his subjects; nor an angel in an human shape; nor Martin Luther, as others; but the Lord Jesus Christ himself, who is described by his form, and by his seat, and by what he had on his head, and in his hand:</p>
<p><strong>and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of man</strong>; so Christ is said to be, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:13">Revelation 1:13</span> and in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span> where there is a like vision of him as here, and which refers to the same time; it is a name by which the Messiah is often called, and is expressive of the truth of his human nature, who was found in fashion as a man, and was really one; for his being like to the son of man designs reality and truth, and not mere appearance; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:5">Matthew 14:5</span> and besides, as this was in vision, it is very properly expressed, for Christ appeared to John in vision like to that human nature in which he is at the right hand of God: and here he is seen "sitting" upon the "white cloud"; which shows that he was come to judgment in the clouds of heaven, and was set on one of them, as on a throne; and a white cloud represents the purity, uprightness, and justness of his proceedings in judgment; for which reason he is said to be on a white throne,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:11">Revelation 20:11</span></p>
<p><strong>having on his head a golden crown</strong>; as an ensign of royal majesty, showing that his kingdom was now come, the time for him to reign personally with his saints on earth a thousand years; and that it was a very glorious one; and that he should now reign before his ancients gloriously; and that it was pure, solid, and durable; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+21:4">Psalms 21:4</span></p>
<p><strong>and in his hand a sharp sickle</strong>: to reap the earth with, as hereafter, and is expressive of his power as King of saints and Judge of the world, to gather all nations before him; for the sickle is used to gather with, as well as to cut down.</p>
