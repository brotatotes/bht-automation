<p><strong>And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth</strong>,.... He put forth, and made use of that power which he had in his hand, in answer to the entreaty of the angel, the time being fully come which was fixed for this great event:</p>
<p><strong>and the earth was reaped</strong>; and the harvest of it was got in; reaping and harvest sometimes are used in an ill sense, and design the wrath of God, and his judgments inflicted upon men; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+17:5">Isaiah 17:5</span>. Hence some think, that both this and the vintage following intend the judgments of God upon antichrist, and that they are contemporary with the pouring out of the fifth and sixth vials upon the beast and his followers; and the rather, since the destruction of Babylon, literally taken, is expressed in such language, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:33">Jeremiah 51:33</span> though these seem to have respect to times after the fall of the Romish Babylon, before declared in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span> and most interpreters refer the harvest to the last judgment at the end of the world; and which sense is greatly countenanced, and to be illustrated by the parable of the tares and wheat, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:30">Matthew 13:30</span> sometimes these phrases are used in a good sense, and intend the gathering in of souls by the preaching of the Gospel; as there are the appointed weeks of the harvest, so there is a time fixed for the calling and conversion of God's elect; and when this time is come, and especially to any number of them in any particular place, it is an harvest, as in Galilee and Samaria in the times of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:37">Matthew 9:37</span> the reapers are the ministers of the Gospel; such were the apostles of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:36">John 4:36</span> and the sickle is the Gospel, by which not only men are cut to the heart, and cut down, and removed from their old bottom, and principles and practices, but are gathered to Christ, and into his churches; and when large numbers are brought in, it is an harvest time, as in the times of Christ and his apostles; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:1">Isaiah 9:1</span> hence some interpreters think that the harvest here has respect to the Reformation, which followed upon the preaching of Luther, Calvin, and others, when a large harvest of souls were gathered in, in Germany, France, England, and elsewhere; but rather it may be thought to refer to the conversion of the Jews, and the bringing in the fulness of the Gentiles in the latter day, in the spiritual reign of Christ, to which the preceding visions belong, as we have seen; the earth will be reaped indeed, and a great harvest it will be, when a nation shall be born at once, and the vast multitudes of the Gentiles shall be brought in, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:8">Isaiah 66:8</span> and the rather this may be judged to be the meaning of it, since the passage from whence these phrases are borrowed respects the bringing again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joe+3:1">Joel 3:1</span> though it seems best to understand it of the Lord's wheat harvest at the end of the world, when the wheat of the earth shall be reaped, and gathered into Christ's barn, or garner, or into his and his Father's kingdom; this reaping of the earth is the removing of the saints out of it, not by death, but by the resurrection of them from the dead; for when Christ shall come in the clouds of heaven, and sit on the white cloud, or throne, the dead in him will rise first, and the living saints will be changed, and both will be caught up together, to meet the Lord in the air; so that the earth will be reaped, and be clear of them, and there will be none left in it but the wicked of the world; and what will become of them is declared in the following verses, under the representation of a vintage.</p>
