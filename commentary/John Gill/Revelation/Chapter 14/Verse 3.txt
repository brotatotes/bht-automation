<p><strong>And they sung as it were a new song</strong>,.... The song of redeeming grace; the same with that in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span>; see the note there: this is to be understood of the 144,000, who sung it</p>
<p><strong>before the throne, and before the four beasts and the elders</strong>; that is, publicly in the church, the ministers and members being present; of these; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9- :">Revelation 5:9- :</span>;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9- :">Revelation 5:9- :</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and no man could learn that song but the hundred [and] forty [and] four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth</strong>; out of every kindred, tongue, people, and nation; from among the men of the earth, and out of the apostate church, called the earth, in opposition to the pure church, which so often goes by the name of heaven in this book; and these, in consequence of being redeemed by the blood of Christ, were called by grace out of the world; and such only can sing the song of redemption with application to themselves; and say he has redeemed us, and loved us, and washed us from our sins in his blood; to none but these is it given to know spiritually and experimentally the mysteries of electing and redeeming grace; the natural and carnal man neither knows nor receives the things of the Spirit of God; nor can he learn them by hearing, reading, study, and conversation, unless it be only in a notional and speculative way. The Jews speak of a new song, which the angels have never used m;</p>
<p>"it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+98:1">Psalms 98:1</span>; "sing unto the Lord a new song"; a new song, for there is an old song; but this song is what the angels never praised him with, and therefore it is new;''</p>
<p>and indeed the song of redeeming love is peculiar to men.</p>
