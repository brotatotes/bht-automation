<p><strong>And the third angel followed them</strong>,.... The two preceding ones, and that very quickly; by whom is meant not Luther, and his associates in the Reformation, as some think; nor his successors, or the ministers of the Gospel in general from his time till Christ's second coming, as others have thought; but a set of Gospel ministers in the spiritual reign of Christ: the first set of them publish the everlasting Gospel, which leads on to the ruin of antichrist; the second set proclaim the downfall of Rome, and this third set denounce the wrath of God upon all that have professed the Popish religion:</p>
<p><strong>saying with a loud voice</strong>; as the first angel did, with like authority and vehemence, in order to strike terror, and express indignation:</p>
<p><strong>if any man worship the beast and his image</strong>; give in to the idolatries of the church of Rome, and embrace, maintain, and defend the Popish religion, which bears a resemblance to the worship of the Heathens, and is the very image of Rome Pagan; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:4">Revelation 13:4</span></p>
<p><strong>and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand</strong>; openly profess Popery, and swear allegiance to the man of sin, and do all they can to support his interest; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:16">Revelation 13:16</span>.</p>
