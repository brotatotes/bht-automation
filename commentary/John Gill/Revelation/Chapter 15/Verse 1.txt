<p><strong>And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous</strong>,.... This chapter is a preparation to the pouring out of the seven vials, as</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:1">Revelation 16:1</span> is to the sending of the seven epistles, and <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:1">Revelation 2:1</span> to the seven seals and seven trumpets: the vision is called a "sign", because what was seen was significative of future events; a sign of the coming of Christ, of his kingdom, and of the destruction of antichrist; and it is said to be a sign "in heaven", where John was called up, and where he had his visions; and it was "another", a different one from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:1">Revelation 12:1</span> which represented the downfall of Paganism, but this the downfall of Popery; and it is a very "great" one, it is expressive of great things, as the fall of Babylon the great, or the judgment of the great whore, and the great glory of the church and kingdom of Christ; and it is "marvellous", for the two grand events it respects are very wonderful; as that antichrist, who was once in such power, should be destroyed, and that by such weak means, in the esteem of men, as the preaching of the Gospel, which is no less marvellous than the fall of Jericho by the sound of rams' horns; and that the church, which was in so low an estate in the wilderness, for the space of 1260 days or years, should become so glorious. The vision follows,</p>
<p><strong>seven angels, having the seven last plagues</strong>; these are not the same angels that blew the seven trumpets, for they are not contemporary with them, but are more likely the same with those in the preceding chapter; though they seem rather to be different from them: if these were angels literally understood, their having plagues is no objection to their being good angels, since such are often the executioners of God's wrath; and that these good ones, appears from one of them talking with John, and showing him the judgment of antichrist, and another the bride, the Lamb's wife, and her glory,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span> though they seem rather to be the ministers of the Gospel, since they are said to come out of the temple, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:6">Revelation 15:6</span> and since the destruction of antichrist will be by the breath of Christ's mouth, or by the preaching of the Gospel; unless it should be thought that members of churches are designed, since these angels receive their vials from one of the four living creatures, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:7">Revelation 15:7</span> or preachers of the word; and may denote some very principal men, as kings, who will now be come to Zion, and be members of Gospel churches, and will be the nursing fathers and protectors of them; and these will hate the whore, and burn her flesh with fire; but of these angels, see more on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:6">Revelation 15:6</span>. They are said to have "the seven last plagues"; that is, in their vials; for these seven plagues are the same with the seven vials of the wrath of God, to be poured out upon antichrist; and are no other than so many steps, ways, and means, by which God will bring on and finish his destruction: these are called the last plagues, because they will be in the last days: there have been plagues before, as at the destruction of the old world, and of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the plagues of Egypt, and the downfall of several monarchies and kingdoms, and of Paganism in the Roman empire; but these will fall upon antichrist, and will be the last upon him, for they will issue in his utter ruin; they will be the last plagues upon the earth, there will be no other after them, but the conflagration of the world, and the general destruction of the wicked in hell. These plagues are the same with the third woe, and are an explanation of it, and belong to the sounding of the seventh trumpet, which brings in the kingdoms of this world to become the kingdoms of Christ, and the time of God's wrath upon the nations, or Gentiles, the Papists, and of judging the dead, and destroying them that destroyed the earth, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span> for these plagues do not follow upon the harvest and vintage, nor has this vision any respect to them, nor to be connected with the preceding chapter, but with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:1">Revelation 11:1</span> and gives an enlarged view, both of the glory of Christ's kingdom, and of the ruin of antichrist, by these plagues, called the last:</p>
<p><strong>for in them is filled up the wrath of God</strong>; upon the beast, and his followers.</p>
