<p><strong>Who shall not fear thee, O Lord</strong>,.... At this time the people of the Jews shall seek after Christ, and fear him and his goodness; the forces of the Gentiles shall be brought into Zion, whose heart shall then fear, and be enlarged; the fear of the Lord will be in all places, and in all men, both Jews and Gentiles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ho+3:5">Hosea 3:5</span></p>
<p><strong>and glorify thy name</strong>? by ascribing all divine perfections to him, giving him divine worship and adoration, and attributing the whole of salvation to him, and the glory of all that is done for his church, and against its enemies:</p>
<p><strong>for thou only art holy</strong>; not only perfectly holy, as man, but infinitely and essentially holy, as God, and the fountain of holiness to his people, as Mediator: this character seems to be given in opposition to antichrist, who arrogantly assumes the title of holiness to himself, when it only belongs to Christ.</p>
<p><strong>For all nations shall come and worship before thee</strong>; the Gospel shall now be preached to all nations, and the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of it; the kingdoms of this world will become Christ's, and his kingdom shall be to the ends of the earth, and all people shall obey him: the words seem to be taken, with some other phrases before used, out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+86:8">Psalms 86:8</span></p>
<p><strong>for thy judgments are made manifest</strong>; or "thy justifications", or "righteousnesses"; the perfect righteousness of Christ, and the doctrine of justification by it, will now be most clearly revealed, and generally received, in opposition to the Popish doctrine of merits, works of supererogation, c. or the judgments of the King of saints upon antichrist, who will now avenge their blood, which he has shed see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span> and the justice and righteousness of his proceedings against the man of sin will be notorious and manifest to all, and be acknowledged, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:5">Revelation 16:5</span>.</p>
