<p>INTRODUCTION TO REVELATION 16</p>
<p>This chapter gives an account of the pouring out of the seven vials by the angels; their orders for it are in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:1">Revelation 16:1</span>. The first angel pours out his vial on the earth, the effect of which is a noisome and grievous sore upon the followers of antichrist, and the worshippers of his image, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:2">Revelation 16:2</span>. The second pours out his upon the sea; the events of it are, the sea became blood, and every living creature in it died, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:3">Revelation 16:3</span>. The third pours out his upon the rivers and fountains of water, which thereby became blood; upon which the angel of the waters applauds the justice of God, declaring the righteousness of his judgments, and giving a reason for it; and which is confirmed by another angel from the altar, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:4">Revelation 16:4</span>. The fourth angel pours out his vial on the sun, the effects of which are, scorching men with heat, their blasphemy against God, and impenitence, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:8">Revelation 16:8</span>. The fifth pours out his on the seat of the beast, the consequences of which are darkness in his kingdom, men gnawing their tongues because of their pains, their blasphemy of the name of God because of them, and their impenitence, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:10">Revelation 16:10</span>. The sixth angel pours out his on the river Euphrates, and what followed upon it are, the drying up of that river to make way for the kings of the east; there unclean spirits are seen, described by their original, coming out of the mouths of the dragon, beast, and false prophet; by their form, like frogs; by their internal nature, spirits of devils; by their works, doing miracles; by the errand they are sent, and go upon, to gather the kings of the earth to the battle of God Almighty, which they succeed in; but before this is done, a declaration is made of the suddenness of Christ's coming, exciting the saints to watchfulness, and to keep their garments, that they might not be naked, and exposed to shame, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:12">Revelation 16:12</span> Then the seventh angel pours out his vial into the air, the consequences of which are, a voice from heaven declaring it is done: other voices, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake; a rupture of the great city into three parts; the fall of other cities; the remembrance of Babylon before God; the flight of every island and mountain, and a great hail storm, which causes men to blaspheme God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:17">Revelation 16:17</span>. </p>
