<p><strong>And blasphemed the God of heaven</strong>,.... Who made it, and dwells in it, and from whence wrath is revealed, and comes upon the seat of the beast, upon the kingdom of antichrist, and the subjects of that kingdom; they will curse him who is of right their King, and their God, and look upwards to heaven, where he is, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:21">Isaiah 8:21</span> and this,</p>
<p><strong>because of their pains and their sores</strong>: see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:2">Revelation 16:2</span> the inward frettings and distresses of their minds, the gallings and gnawings of their consciences, the horror and terror of their souls, and their fearful looking for of judgment, which the present face of things upon antichrist will bring upon them; just as the Egyptians, in the time of their darkness, were distressed with internal guilt, and black horror of mind, and with evil spirits, which were sent among them, and haunted them during that season; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:49">Psalms 78:49</span> and repented not of their deeds; their antichristian works of darkness; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:20">Revelation 9:20</span>.</p>
