<p><strong>For they are the spirits of devils</strong>,.... They are of their father the devil; they are acted and influenced by him, he works effectually in them, and leads them captive at his will; they do his lusts, and are murderers and liars, and false teachers, like him:</p>
<p><strong>working miracles</strong>; lying ones, to deceive men; this clearly points out who are meant, namely, the followers of antichrist, who, as they spread the doctrines of devils, endeavour to confirm them by signs and lying wonders:</p>
<p><strong>which go forth unto the kings of the earth</strong>: those who have committed fornication with the Romish antichrist, such of them as will remain:</p>
<p><strong>and of the whole world</strong>; as many Pagan princes as they can come at, and engage by any ways and means in their interest; they will go forth to them like the lying spirit to Ahab's prophets, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:22">1 Kings 22:22</span></p>
<p><strong>to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty</strong>; that is, they will persuade them to gather together, to fight against the saints, the Gentile Christians in the several parts of the world, and the Jewish Christians, now settled in their own land; and this will be the battle of the Lord, who is God Almighty, and it will be fighting against him; and therefore the attempt must be vain and fruitless, and issue in the ruin of those who are gathered to it, who will be deceived and drawn into it by these diabolical spirits: and this is called "the battle of that great day of God"; not of the day of judgment, for it will be before that time; but of that day of vengeance upon all the remains of his and his church's enemies, both Pagan, Papal, and Mahometan, who will for this purpose be gathered together; "which", as the Ethiopic version renders it, "God has appointed".</p>
