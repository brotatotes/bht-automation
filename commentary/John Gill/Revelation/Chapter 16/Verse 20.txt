<p><strong>And every island fled away</strong>,.... This may be understood either of the dissolution of the world, the present heavens and earth, when there will be no more sea, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:1">Revelation 21:1</span> and so consequently no islands:</p>
<p><strong>and the mountains were not found</strong>; for the earth and the heaven will be fled away at the appearance of Christ the Judge, and there will be no place found for them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:11">Revelation 20:11</span> and new heavens, and a new earth, without sea or mountains, will succeed: or rather this may signify the utter extirpation of all the antichristian powers in every shape, whether on islands or on the continent; for this day of the Lord will be upon every high mountain and hill, to bring them low, and the Lord alone shall be exalted, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:14">Isaiah 2:14</span> and may particularly respect the dissolution of monasteries, and the plundering them of their riches and revenues.</p>
