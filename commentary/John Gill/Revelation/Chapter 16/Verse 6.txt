<p><strong>For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets</strong>,.... Which shows that rivers and fountains cannot be literally understood, but men are designed, wicked and bloody men; and it is notorious to all, how much of the blood of the saints, of the preachers of the Gospel, of the prophets and witnesses, have been shed in Italy, Savoy, and other places near Rome, as well as in Rome itself; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:6">Revelation 17:6</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And thou hast given them blood to drink</strong>; sent the sword among them, making great slaughter and devastation; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:26">Isaiah 49:26</span></p>
<p><strong>for they are worthy</strong>; or deserving, to have their blood shed by the law of retaliation.</p>
