<p><strong>And I heard another out of the altar say</strong>,.... That is, another angel that came out of the altar; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:18">Revelation 14:18</span> and who represents the souls under the altar, whose blood had been shed by the above persons; compare with this <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span> though, there, such whose blood had been shed by Rome Pagan are described; the Ethiopic version calls this angel as before, "the angel of the fountains of water"; and the Alexandrian copy, and Syriac and Arabic versions, read, "I heard the altar saying": as follows,</p>
<p><strong>even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments</strong>; the same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:3">Revelation 15:3</span>. This angel joins the other, and approves and confirms what he says; applauding the judgements of Christ upon the worshippers of the beast, from the verity of them, being what were threatened, and from the justice of them, being what they deserved.</p>
