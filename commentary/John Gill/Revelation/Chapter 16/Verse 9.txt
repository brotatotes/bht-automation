<p><strong>And men were scorched with great heat</strong>,.... Burned with rage against the followers of Christ; were filled with envy at the success of his Gospel, and with fury and madness at the ruinous condition of the antichristian state, being deprived of its head, and chief officers:</p>
<p><strong>and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues</strong>; plagues or judgments are from God, when and wherever they come; they are sent and inflicted by him, and he can lessen or increase them, continue or remove them, as he pleases; and these, unless sanctified, will not reform men, but harden them, and set them a blaspheming the author of them. And this blasphemy may either respect the nature and perfections of God, charging him with inequality in his ways, and with injustice and unfaithfulness; or the Gospel, and the truths of it, which declare his glory, and his greatness; and which will now have a general spread, to the great mortification and confusion of the followers of antichrist:</p>
<p><strong>and they repented not to give him glory</strong>; that is, they did not repent of their wicked deeds, their idolatries, murders, sorceries, fornications, and thefts, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:20">Revelation 9:20</span> so as to own and confess them, which is, the meaning of giving glory to God in repentance; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jos+7:19">Joshua 7:19</span>. This shows that repentance is not in man's power, but in the gift of God's grace; for though he may give space, yet if he does not give grace to repent, no man will repent; nor will any means of themselves produce it; as not the most powerful and awakening ministry, as the ministry of John the Baptist, and of Christ, and of the Gospel preachers that will be in those times, this vial refers to, nor the greatest mercies and favours, so not the severest judgments; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="am+6:6">Amos 6:6</span>. The event of this vial, or the plague of it, is applied, by Mr. Daubuz, to the wars between the emperors and the popes, and between the Guelphs and Gibelines.</p>
