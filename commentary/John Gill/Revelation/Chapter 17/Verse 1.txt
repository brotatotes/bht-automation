<p><strong>And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven vials</strong>,.... It may be the first of them, since one of the four beasts designs the first of them, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:1">Revelation 6:1</span> though Brightman thinks the fifth angel is meant, because he poured out his vial on the seat of the beast, who is by this angel described; but rather this is the seventh and last angel, concerned in the utter destruction of antichrist: and therefore proposes to John to show him the judgment of the great whore:</p>
<p><strong>and talked with me, saying unto me, come hither</strong>: he conversed with him in a friendly manner, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+1:9">Zechariah 1:9</span> and desires him to come nearer to him, and go along with him, adding,</p>
<p><strong>I will show unto thee the judgment of the great whore</strong>; that noted and famous one, known before to John by the names of Jezabel and Babylon, who taught and caused many to commit fornication, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:20">Revelation 2:20</span></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span> and is no other than Rome Papal; for that a city or state is meant is clear from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:18">Revelation 17:18</span> and it is usual for idolatrous or apostate cities to be called whores or harlots, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:21">Isaiah 1:21</span></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+23:2">Ezekiel 23:2</span> and she is called a "great" one, because of the largeness of the Papal see; and because of the multitude of persons, the kings of the earth, and the inhabitants of it, with whom the Romish antichrist has committed spiritual fornication, or idolatry: her "judgment" signifies either her sin and wickedness; in which sense the word is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16">Romans 5:16</span> and which is exposed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:5">Revelation 17:5</span> namely, her idolatry and cruelty; or else her condemnation, and the execution of it, suggested in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span> and more largely described in the following chapter:</p>
<p><strong>that sitteth upon many waters</strong>; which in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:15">Revelation 17:15</span> are interpreted of people, multitudes, nations, and tongues, subject to the jurisdiction of Rome; and so several antichristian states are in the preceding chapter signified by the sea, and by rivers and fountains of water: and this is said in reference to Babylon, an emblem of the Romish harlot, which was situated upon the river Euphrates, and is therefore said to dwell upon many waters, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:13">Jeremiah 51:13</span> her sitting here may be in allusion to the posture of harlots plying of men; or may denote her ease, rest, and grandeur, sitting as a queen; and is chiefly expressive of her power and dominion over the kings and nations of the earth, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:18">Revelation 17:18</span>.</p>
