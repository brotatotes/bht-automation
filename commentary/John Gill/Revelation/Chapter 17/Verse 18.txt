<p><strong>And the woman which thou sawest</strong>,.... <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:3">Revelation 17:3</span> as there described,</p>
<p><strong>is that great city</strong>, often mentioned in this book; great Babylon, the city of Rome, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:8">Revelation 11:8</span> which reigneth over the kings of the earth; which then reigned in John's time over the kings of the earth; and this clearly points out the city of Rome, for there was no other city then, but that, which reigned over the kings of the earth; that was then the metropolis of the Roman empire, to which the whole world was subject; and therefore it is called all the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:1">Luke 2:1</span> and since, all the kings of the empire have been under the jurisdiction of Rome Papal. It was formerly called Urbs Regum, a "city of kings" z, either for the reason in the text, or because its inhabitants looked like kings.</p>
<p>z Justin. l. 18. c. 2.</p>
