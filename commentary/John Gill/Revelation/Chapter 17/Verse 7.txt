<p><strong>And the angel said unto me</strong>,.... The same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span></p>
<p><strong>wherefore didst thou marvel</strong>? which is not said by way of reproof, as questions of this kind sometimes are, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:12">Acts 3:12</span> for John did not wonder at her with a sinful admiration, so as to have her in great veneration, and to do homage and worship to her, as the inhabitants of the world wondered after the beast, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:3">Revelation 13:3</span> but his admiration was an amazement, or stupefaction of mind, joined with indignation at her; and this is said by the angel to lead on to what he had to declare unto him.</p>
<p><strong>I will tell thee the mystery of the woman</strong>; that is, what is mysteriously or mystically designed by her; for till it was made known to John by the angel, it was a mystery to him; and when it was revealed, the interpretation is given in such an obscure manner, that it is only understood by the mind that has spiritual wisdom; and still remains a mystery to carnal men, just as the Gospel itself does. The hidden meaning of this woman, or the mystery of her, is told by the angel in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:18">Revelation 17:18</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And of the beast that carried her, which hath the seven heads, and ten horns</strong>; the mystical sense of the beast, its heads and horns, and which is also delivered in a mysterious manner, is given in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>.</p>
