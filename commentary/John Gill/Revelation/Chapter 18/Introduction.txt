<p>INTRODUCTION TO REVELATION 18</p>
<p>This chapter gives an account of the fall of Babylon, and of the lamentation of many, and of the joy of others, by reason of it; which account is published by several angels: the first that declares her fall is described by his original, descending from heaven; by the great power he had; by his resplendent glory, and by his mighty cry in publishing her destruction; which is illustrated by the desolate condition she will be in upon her fall; the reasons of which are given, became the nations and kings of the earth had committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth were enriched by her luxury, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:1">Revelation 18:1</span>. Another voice is heard from heaven, calling upon the people of God, first to come out of her, lest partaking of her sins they should share in her plagues, seeing her iniquities had reached to heaven, and were remembered before God; and next to take full vengeance on her, because she had glorified herself, lived deliciously, and in great security,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:4">Revelation 18:4</span>. And then follows a continuation of the account of her destruction, what her plagues would be, death, mourning, famine, and fire; and which would be sudden, in one hour, and certain, from the power and justice of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:8">Revelation 18:8</span>. Next follow the lamentations of the kings, merchants, and masters of ships, because of her greatness, riches, and merchandise, which are all come to nothing,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:9">Revelation 18:9</span>. And then the church; the saints, apostles, and prophets, are called upon to rejoice at the vengeance taken on her,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:20">Revelation 18:20</span> upon which a mighty angel appears, who by an action signifies the manner of her destruction, and the irrecoverableness of her state and condition, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:21">Revelation 18:21</span> and declares her utter ruin, by affirming that nothing that was either delightful or profitable, or necessary or comfortable, should any more be found in her; giving the reasons of it, because of her luxury, idolatry, and bloodshed,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:22">Revelation 18:22</span>. </p>
