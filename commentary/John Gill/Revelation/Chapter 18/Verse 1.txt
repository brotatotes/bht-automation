<p><strong>And after these things</strong>,.... The vision of the woman on the scarlet coloured beast, and the interpretation of both by the angel:</p>
<p><strong>I saw another angel</strong>; not the Lord Jesus Christ, though the several things said of this angel agree with him; nor one of the ministering spirits, though the characters of him will also suit with one of them, but rather a minister of the Gospel, or a set of Gospel ministers, who will arise a little before the downfall of Babylon, in the spiritual reign of Christ; though not the same with the angel of fire, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:18">Revelation 14:18</span> as some have thought, because of his illustrious appearance, and the loudness of his voice; but the same with the angel, or third thundering voice in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6">Revelation 14:6</span> for not only the times of both agree, but the selfsame words are expressed by one as by the other; and this angel is distinct from him that showed John the preceding vision, and gave him the interpretation of it, and from all the seven angels that had the vials, and is described as follows: and first by the place from whence he came, John saw him</p>
<p><strong>come down from heaven</strong>; denoting the suddenness of his appearance and cry; he came down at once, and cried out immediately; the subject of his cry, the destruction of Babylon, being what will be at an unawares; and also the commission and authority of the ministers signified by him, who will have their warrant from heaven to say what they will deliver; so that this likewise expresses the truth of their message, since both that and they come from heaven:</p>
<p><strong>having great power</strong>; to do great work, to declare the fall of Babylon the great: or "having great authority"; being sent from the King of kings, in his name, as his ambassador, to proclaim what shortly will come to pass; an event of the greatest importance to the glory of God, the interest of Christ, and the comfort of his people:</p>
<p><strong>and the earth was lightened with his glory</strong>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+43:2">Ezekiel 43:2</span> by which is meant the glorious Gospel of Christ, the light of which will at this then be very great: these ministers will run to and fro the earth, and knowledge will be increased, and the earth will be filled with it: the Arabic version reads, "with the splendour of his countenance"; and the Ethiopic version, "with the splendour of his countenance, and his glory"; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:1">Isaiah 60:1</span>.</p>
