<p><strong>The merchants of these things</strong>,.... Before mentioned, who have traded in them for themselves and for Rome:</p>
<p><strong>which were made rich by her</strong>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:3">Revelation 18:3</span></p>
<p><strong>shall stand afar off for fear of her torment</strong>; as the kings of the earth before, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:10">Revelation 18:10</span> being conscious to themselves of their being partners in her crimes, and so might justly fear they should share in her punishment; and it may be, they will outwardly deny they are now of her religion, and will externally embrace the reformed religion; though they will be inwardly weeping and wailing for the destruction of Rome, and the loss of their merchandise and goodly things.</p>
