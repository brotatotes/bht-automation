<p><strong>For in one hour so great riches is come to nought</strong>,.... That is, in a very short time, expressing the suddenness and speediness of Rome's destruction, the quick dispatch and expedition that will be made in it, by the instruments of it, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:10">Revelation 18:10</span>.

<p><strong>and every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off</strong>; the lamentation of the kings and merchants of the earth being ended, masters of ships, sailors, and seafaring men begin theirs: by "ships" are meant dioceses, abbeys, priories, and monasteries; and by the masters, or governors of them, bishops, abbots, priors, the heads of monasteries, and of the several orders of the Franciscans, Dominicans, c. and by "all the company in ships", or "every shipmate", the fellows that belong to every religious house and order and by "sailors" and "traders at sea", all such who compass sea and land to make proselytes to the Romish religion, like the Pharisees of old, and who, as they, make them two fold more the children of hell than themselves; and, in general, these traders abroad may design the pope's legates, sent by him into various parts, to collect his revenues, and the Jesuits, who are everywhere sent abroad to sow sedition and false doctrine, and the priests that travel about to sell pardons and indulgences: these</p>
<p><strong>stood afar off</strong>; as the kings and merchants before, for fear of sharing in the condemnation and punishment of Babylon; knowing full well that they deserved it, having been associates with her in her crimes.</p>
<p>l T. Bab. Kiddushin, fol. 49. 2.</p>
