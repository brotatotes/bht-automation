<p><strong>And they cast dust on their heads</strong>,.... As the seafaring men on account of Tyre, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+27:30">Ezekiel 27:30</span> this was a gesture used in mourning when persons were in afflicted and distressed circumstances, denoting disorder, confusion, and debasement; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jos+7:6">Joshua 7:6</span></p>
<p><strong>and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, alas, alas! that great city</strong>; as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:10">Revelation 18:10</span> so it was once, though now in flames:</p>
<p><strong>wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea</strong>; not only the merchants of the earth, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:3">Revelation 18:3</span> the cardinals, archbishops, and bishops, but the governors of religious houses; these accumulated great wealth to themselves, and got the best of lands into their possession for the use and support of their abbeys and monasteries:</p>
<p><strong>by reason of her costliness</strong>; or costly things; pardons, indulgences, absolution, saying Mass, and praying souls out of purgatory, all which are costly, and hereby these traders have been enriched; and now the remembrance of these things, of which they will be deprived, will affect and grieve them, as well as the suddenness of Rome's ruin:</p>
<p><strong>for in one hour is she made desolate</strong>; her judgment come, and her riches come to nought, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:10">Revelation 18:10</span>.</p>
