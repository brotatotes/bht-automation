<p><strong>And he cried mightily with a strong voice</strong>,.... Which shows not only the vehemence and affection of the ministers of the word, who will publish what follows, but the greatness and importance of it; and this loud voice may be, as for the sake of the whole church in general, that all may bear, so for the sake of those of the Lord's people in particular, that will be in Babylon at this time; and it may have regard to that deep sleep and spirit of slumber that Babylon itself will be in, which, notwithstanding this loud cry, will remain insensible of its ruin till it comes upon her, as was the case of old Babylon, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:39">Jeremiah 51:39</span>,</p>
<p><strong>saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen</strong>: the whole world is not designed by Babylon, for it is distinguished from all nations in the following verse; nor Babylon in Chaldea, which was fallen long before John saw this vision, but Rome Papal; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:39- :">Jeremiah 51:39- :</span> so the woman is called in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:5">Revelation 17:5</span> who sits on seven mountains, and is that great city, the city of Rome, that reigns over the kings of the earth, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:9">Revelation 18:9</span> this is said to be fallen, because, in a very little time after this declaration, it will fall; for as yet it was not destroyed, since after this the Lord's people are called upon to come out of her, and are bid to reward her double; and it is declared, that her plagues, should come in one day, and she should be burnt with fire; and an angel after this throws a millstone into the sea, saying, that so should Babylon be thrown down,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:4">Revelation 18:4</span> and it is repeated to denote the certainty and utter destruction of her: and which is more fully expressed by what follows,</p>
<p><strong>and is become the habitation of devils</strong>; as old Babylon was of satyrs, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:21">Isaiah 13:21</span> demons, which appeared in a hairy form, like goats, and the word is rendered devils in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="le+17:7">Leviticus 17:7</span> and the inhabitants of Rome now are no other; the pope and his cardinals, the priests, Jesuits, monks, and friars, are the spirits of devils, and their doctrines the doctrines of devils; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:14">Revelation 16:14</span></p>
<p><strong>and the hold of every foul spirit</strong>: devils are frequently called unclean spirits, and these appear in desert and desolate places,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:43">Matthew 12:43</span> where they are either of choice, or rather are obliged to it; and so the word translated "hold" signifies a prison, or place of confinement; and such as are comparable to unclean spirits now haunt and abound in Rome, and its territories; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:13">Revelation 16:13</span></p>
<p><strong>and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird</strong>; such, as vultures, kites, owls, c. which generally reside in desolate and uninhabited places the Alexandrian copy, the Syriac and Ethiopic versions, add, "and the hold", or "seat of every unclean and hateful beast"; and so the desolation of old Babylon is described by wild beasts and doleful creatures dwelling in it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:21">Isaiah 13:21</span>. Some consider all this as a reason of the destruction of Babylon or Rome, because it now is the residence of persons comparable to devils, foul spirits, hateful birds, and beasts of prey; but this account rather describes its state and case in which it will be after its ruin, being never more to be inhabited by men, in allusion to old Babylon, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:19">Isaiah 13:19</span>.</p>
