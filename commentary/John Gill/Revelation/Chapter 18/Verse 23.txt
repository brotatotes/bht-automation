<p><strong>And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee</strong>,.... Either for common use, or at feasts, or at marriages, which being kept at night, required candies, lamps, or torches; this shows that Babylon, or Rome, shall be deprived of everything, even of the least thing that is comfortable in life; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+25:10">Jeremiah 25:10</span> this will be a just punishment upon her for her abuse of this blessing of life; so where wax candles in great numbers have been burning in the daytime, there will not be so much as a single candle to give light in the night; and where candles have been lighted up for the dead, there will not be one for the use of the living:</p>
<p><strong>and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee</strong>: there will be no marrying, nor giving in marriage; no procreation of children, or propagation of posterity, in this place; which denotes the utter extirpation of the inhabitants of it; the phrases are taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+7:34">Jeremiah 7:34</span></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+25:10">Jeremiah 25:10</span> and this will be in righteous retaliation for the prohibition of marriage; which God has instituted, and is honourable, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:2">1 Timothy 4:2</span> the reasons of Babylon's destruction follow:</p>
<p><strong>for thy merchants were the great men of the earth</strong>: in allusion to the merchants of Tyre, said to be princes, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+23:8">Isaiah 23:8</span> for by trading and dealing in the wares and merchandise of Rome, persons of mean extract, and of very low circumstances of life, have grown exceeding rich, and have equalled the princes of the earth; as for instance, Cardinal Wolsey here in England, a butcher's son at Ipswich; and on the other hand, the princes and great men of the earth have become Rome's merchants, and have thought it an high honour to get a cardinal's hat, as the Cardinals Albertus duke of Austria, Bourbon, Pool, and others, mentioned by Brightman:</p>
<p><strong>for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived</strong>; meaning her false doctrines, traditions, idolatry, superstition, and will worship, with which, as another Jezebel, she has bewitched, allured, and deceived the nations of the empire, and the kings thereof, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:3">Revelation 18:3</span>.</p>
