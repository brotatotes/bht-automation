<p><strong>And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints</strong>,.... Such as before mentioned, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:20">Revelation 18:20</span> this is another reason of her destruction, besides her luxury and idolatry, namely, her shedding the blood of the saints, with which she is said to be drunk, and therefore blood is now given her to drink, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:6">Revelation 17:6</span> for she will now be found guilty of slaying the witnesses, who are meant by the prophets and saints, that have been from the beginning of the apostasy:</p>
<p><strong>and of all that were slain upon the earth</strong>: not only of those that have been slain in the city of Rome, but of all those that have been slain throughout the empire; they being slain by her order, or with her consent, and she conniving at it, encouraging it, and therefore will be justly chargeable with it all; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:31">Matthew 23:31</span> the Ethiopic version adds, "for the name of Christ".</p>
