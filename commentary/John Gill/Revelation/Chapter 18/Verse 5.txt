<p><strong>For her sins have reached unto heaven</strong>,.... Or "have followed unto heaven"; one after another, in one age after another, until they have been as it were heaped up together, and have reached the heavens; the phrase denotes the multitude of them, God's knowledge and notice of them, and the cry of them to him; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:20">Genesis 18:20</span> the Alexandrian copy and Complutensian edition read, "have cleaved", or "glued", and so the Syriac and Arabic versions seem to have read; her sins were as it were soldered together, and stuck fast to her, and being joined and linked together, made a long chain, and reached to heaven, and cleaved to that, and cried for vengeance:</p>
<p><strong>and God hath remembered her iniquities</strong>; and is about to punish her for them; for as forgiveness of sin is signified by a non-remembrance of it, so punishment of sin by a remembrance of it, and of the persons that commit it; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:19">Revelation 16:19</span>.</p>
