<p><strong>How much she hath glorified herself</strong>,.... And acted the proud and haughty part in exalting herself above all emperors, kings, and princes, above all kingdoms and states, and also above all churches, assuming arrogant titles, and even blasphemous names; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span></p>
<p><strong>and lived deliciously</strong>: in a very luxuriant manner, as the popes, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, monks, and friars have done; some being clothed in purple and scarlet, and in gold and silver, and all living upon the fat of the land, and in rioting and drunkenness, in chambering and wantonness:</p>
<p><strong>so much torment and sorrow give her</strong>: by pulling down her pride, which goes before a fall, than which nothing could more torment and afflict her; by stripping her of her fine clothes and rich apparel; and by taking away her fat benefices from her, which will cut her to the heart; and by burning her with fire, which will be very excruciating:</p>
<p><strong>for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen</strong>; a lady of kingdoms, as in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+47:5">Isaiah 47:5</span> to which the reference is; having a temporal power and authority over the kings of the earth, and a spiritual jurisdiction over all churches, apostate ones, being the mother of harlots; and her "sitting" as such, as it well agrees with the whore on many waters, and the woman on the scarlet coloured beast and seven mountains, who are all the same, and is very suitable to antichrist, who pretends to sit in Peter's chair, and does sit in the temple of God, as if he was God; so it is expressive of her empire and government over nations and churches, and of the continuance of it, as she imagines, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+46:7">Isaiah 46:7</span> and so the Ethiopic version renders it, "I shall reign always": to which she adds,</p>
<p><strong>and am no widow</strong>; nor never shall be, as she flatters herself, see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+47:8">Isaiah 47:8</span>. Were she the true spouse of Christ, as she boasts herself, she indeed would be no widow, for Christ is an everlasting and never dying husband; but she is the whore of the kings of the earth, and though she fancies she shall be no widow, that is, bereft of people and power, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="la+1:1">Lamentations 1:1</span> because she now sits on many waters, people, multitudes, and nations and tongues; yet ere long, like old Babylon, she will have no men in her, but will be inhabited by devils, foul spirits, and hateful birds:</p>
<p><strong>and shall see no sorrow</strong>; through loss of children, power, and authority; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+47:8">Isaiah 47:8</span> but in this also she will be mistaken; her children will be killed with death, as is threatened to Jezebel, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:23">Revelation 2:23</span> and her plagues shall come upon her at once: now these words may be considered either as spoken by her when in the height of her power and glory, as she was about three or four hundred years ago; or just before her destruction, which seems to be the case, and looks as if she would regain her power, and be in her former state before her utter ruin; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:23- :">Revelation 2:23- :</span>.</p>
