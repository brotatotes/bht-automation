<p><strong>And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication</strong>,.... Idolatry, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:2">Revelation 17:2</span></p>
<p><strong>and lived deliciously with her</strong>; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:3">Revelation 18:3</span> joining with her in her sensual, as well as in her idolatrous practices:</p>
<p><strong>shall bewail her, and lament for her</strong>: shall mourn inwardly, and by various gestures outwardly express their sorrow at her desolation; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+27:30">Ezekiel 27:30</span> these will not be the ten kings who will burn the whore with fire, and then repent of what they have done, and weep over her, as Titus did at the destruction of Jerusalem, as some Popish writers have fancied, for they will hate the whore, and eat her flesh; but earthly and idolatrous kings, who will be in the communion of the church of Rome:</p>
<p><strong>when they shall see the smoke of her burning</strong>: as Abraham saw the smoke of Sodom and Gomorrah go up like the smoke of a furnace; by which they will perceive that her judgment is come, and her ruin begun.</p>
