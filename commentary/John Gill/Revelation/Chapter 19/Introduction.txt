<p>INTRODUCTION TO REVELATION 19</p>
<p>This chapter contains the triumph of the saints over Babylon, and their thanksgiving to God because of his judgments on her; the marriage of Christ and his church, and a battle between him and his and her enemies, with the success of it. The congratulations are first of a promiscuous multitude in the church, ascribing salvation, praise, honour, glory, and power to God, because of the righteousness of his judgments, and because of the perpetuity of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:1">Revelation 19:1</span> and then of the four and twenty elders and four living creatures, who worship God, assent to what had been before said, and join in praising the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:4">Revelation 19:4</span> and then another voice out of the throne is heard, calling upon all the servants of the Lord, and those that fear him, whether small or great, to praise our God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:5">Revelation 19:5</span> after which is heard the voice of a great multitude, stirring up one another to praise, because of the reign of the Lord God Almighty, and to rejoice and be glad because the time of the Lamb's marriage with his bride was come; who is described by her dress, the righteousness of the saints, comparable to fine linen, clean and white, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:6">Revelation 19:6</span> upon which an angel bids John write those persons happy who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb, and affirms these to be the true sayings of God; wherefore John, in a transport of joy, was just going to worship the angel, had he not been forbidden by him; from which he dissuades him, by observing that he was his fellow servant, that God only is the object of worship, and that the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9">Revelation 19:9</span> next follows a vision of a battle between Christ and his enemies; and first he the General is described, by the horse he sat upon, a white one; by the characters he bears, faithful and true; by what he did, judging and making war in righteousness; by his eyes, which were as a flame of fire; by his having many crowns on his head; by having a name, or names unknown, and particularly one, which is the Word of God; by his habit, a vesture dipped in blood; by the armies he was at the head of, riding on white horses, and clothed in fine linen; by a sharp sword coming out of his mouth, with which he should utterly destroy the nations; and by having a name on his vesture and thigh, King of kings, and Lord of lords, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:11">Revelation 19:11</span> upon which an angel is seen standing in the sun, and calling to all the fowls of the heaven to come to the supper of the great God, and to eat the flesh of kings, captains, mighty men, horses and horsemen, of all ranks, and degrees,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:17">Revelation 19:17</span> and next an account is given of the armies of the beast, and of the kings of the earth, that came to make war with the above warrior, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:19">Revelation 19:19</span> the issue and success of which follow; the beast and false prophet are taken, and cast alive into a lake of fire and brimstone; and the rest are killed by the sword of the above General, and the fowls have a feast of their flesh, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span>. </p>
