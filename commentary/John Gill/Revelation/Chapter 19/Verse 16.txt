<p><strong>And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written</strong>,.... This name, afterwards expressed, is said to be written on his vesture, in allusion to the custom of persons of note and eminence having their names interwoven in their garments, and which was sometimes done in letters of gold, as Zeuxis had t; and it is expressive of the conspicuousness of Christ's kingdom, which now will come with observation; his judgments, the administrations of his kingly office, will be manifest, and he will reign before his ancients gloriously: and its being said to be written on his thigh may mean either that it was upon that part of his garment which covered his thigh; or else that it was also on his sword, which he sometimes girt upon his thigh. Mr. Daubuz has given an instance out of Victor Vitensis, of Clementianus, a monk, who had written on his thigh,</p>
<p>""a manichee" disciple of Jesus Christ.''</p>
<p>And this being done in Africa, he supposes it to be a Phoenician custom continued. It may here denote the perpetuity of Christ's name, power, and dominion, which will continue to the latest posterity, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+72:17">Psalms 72:17</span> which spring from the thigh; and it may denote the subjection of his people to him, signified by the putting the hand under the thigh,</p>

<p><strong>King of kings and Lord of lords</strong>; which will well suit him now when he shall be openly King over all the earth; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+24:2- :">Genesis 24:2- :</span>.</p>
