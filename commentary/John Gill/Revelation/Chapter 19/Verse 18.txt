<p><strong>That ye may eat the flesh of kings</strong>,.... Of the earth, and of the whole world, who will fall in the battle at Armageddon; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:14">Revelation 16:14</span> and design either those antichristian kings and states, which have drunk of the wine of Rome's fornication, and will bewail the downfall of Babylon, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:3">Revelation 18:3</span> or those Pagan kings which will be drawn in by the pope and Turk, to aid and assist in this war, or both, when, upon the defeat of them, the Christian princes will seize upon, possess, and enjoy their kingdoms and dominions, which is meant by eating their flesh;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:3- :">Revelation 18:3- :</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And the flesh of captains</strong>; of their generals, and officers under them:</p>
<p><strong>and the flesh of mighty men</strong>; the common soldiers, who are so called,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+46:5">Jeremiah 46:5</span> who will be rifled and plundered:</p>
<p><strong>and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them</strong>; whose rich trappings and clothes will be taken away from them:</p>
<p><strong>and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great</strong>; that is, the substance of all the inhabitants of the antichristian empire, both eastern and western, of whatsoever rank, state, and condition they be, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:16">Revelation 13:16</span>. The metaphors are taken from, and there is a manifest allusion to, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+39:17">Ezekiel 39:17</span> and the whole denotes the entire slaughter and utter ruin of the whole antichristian army, and the certainty of Christ's victory over it before hand; and also the destruction of all that are the followers of antichrist, throughout his dominions, which will now wholly fall into the hands of the saints, and be enjoyed by them.</p>
