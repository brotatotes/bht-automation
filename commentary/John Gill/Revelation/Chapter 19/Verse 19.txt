<p><strong>And l saw the beast</strong>,.... Not the devil, for after this he is taken and bound for a thousand years, and then loosed, and laid hold on again, and cast into the lake of fire; not but that this war will be by his instigation, and under his influence, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:14">Revelation 16:14</span> not the Roman Pagan empire, which has been destroyed long ago, under the sixth seal, and was the issue of the battle between Michael and his angels, and the dragon and his; but the antichristian civil powers, or antichrist in his civil capacity; and which, though it may chiefly regard the western antichrist, and the remains of the Latin idolatry, yet may take in the eastern antichrist, or the Mahometan powers, which may all join together in this battle; the beast will survive for a while the downfall of his seat, Babylon or Rome.</p>
<p><strong>And the kings of the earth</strong>; these, as they stand distinguished from the beast, or the antichristian kings, and civil states, may design as many of the Pagan kings and princes, as the pope and Turk by their emissaries can persuade to assist them in this war;</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:14- :">Revelation 16:14- :</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And their armies gathered together</strong>; at Armageddon, or in the valley of Jehoshaphat, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:16">Revelation 16:16</span></p>
<p><strong>to make war against him that sat on the horse</strong>; the white horse,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:11">Revelation 19:11</span> as the Arabic and Ethiopic versions read, which must be downright folly and madness, since he is the Word of God, the great God, the King of kings, and Lord of lords:</p>
<p><strong>and against his army</strong>, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:14">Revelation 19:14</span> who, though unarmed, and only clothed in fine linen, have nothing to fear, since Christ, the Captain of their salvation, is at the head of them.</p>
