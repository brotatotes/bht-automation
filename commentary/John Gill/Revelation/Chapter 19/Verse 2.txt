<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>: this is to be understood of God's judgments in general, and is a reason of the attribution of praise and glory to him; which may be said to be true, because, being threatened, are now fulfilled; and to be "righteous", because according to the demerit of sin; and particularly God's judgments on antichrist are intended:</p>
<p><strong>for he hath judged the great whore</strong>; Jezebel, Babylon, the Romish antichrist, before spoken of, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span> not only by passing a sentence of condemnation on her, but by executing it, putting it into the hearts of the kings to hate and burn her, and utterly destroy her; and which is judging right, since it follows:</p>
<p><strong>which did corrupt the earth with her fornication</strong>; drew the kings and inhabitants of the Roman empire into wicked and idolatrous practices, and so corrupted and destroyed them in soul, body, and estate; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1- :">Revelation 17:1- :</span> for this vision is contemporary with the seventh trumpet:</p>
<p><strong>and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand</strong>; shed by her,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:20">Revelation 18:20</span> and this being done in righteous judgment, is matter of joy and praise to the saints.</p>
