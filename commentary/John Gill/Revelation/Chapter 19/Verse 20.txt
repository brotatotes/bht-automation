<p><strong>And the beast was taken</strong>,.... At the first onset, as soon as ever the battle begun, and carried away captive, as it was threatened he should, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:10">Revelation 13:10</span> and this by Christ, who will destroy him with the breath of his mouth, and the brightness of his coming, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And with him the false prophet</strong>; that is, the second beast in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:11">Revelation 13:11</span> as appears by the characters by which he is here described, or antichrist in his ecclesiastic capacity; that is, the pope with his clergy: and indeed, when the antichristian princes and states are taken and destroyed, which are the support of the Papacy, that must in consequence sink, be crushed and ruined; the Alexandrian copy reads, "and they that are with him, the false prophet Jezebel"; the false prophetess and her children, who will now be killed with death, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:20">Revelation 2:20</span></p>
<p><strong>that wrought miracles before him</strong>: the beast, or the civil antichristian powers, even signs and lying wonders, which were approved of, and applauded by him, by which, believing them, he was confirmed in antichristian principles:</p>
<p><strong>with which he deceived them that had the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image</strong>; the several subjects of the antichristian states; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span> but none of God's elect, who cannot be seduced by such means, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>.</p>
<p><strong>These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone</strong>; which is the second death, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:8">Revelation 21:8</span>. The severe punishment of antichrist, considered in both his capacities, civil and ecclesiastic, is expressed by being "cast into a lake of fire", not material fire, but the wrath of God, which will be poured out like fire, and will be intolerable; and by this lake "burning with brimstone", which, giving a nauseous stench, aggravates the punishment. Says R. Joden t, when a man smells the smell of brimstone, why does his breath draw back at it (or catch)? because he knows he shall be judged with it in the world to come. The allusion seems to be to the place where Sodom and Gomorrah stood, which is become a sulphurous lake, and is an emblem of the vengeance of eternal fire, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:7">Judges 1:7</span> and these two are said to be "cast alive" into it, which shows that they will not only suffer a corporeal death at this battle, and in the issue of it, but will be destroyed, body and soul, in hell: the phrase denotes the awfulness, inevitableness, and severity of their punishment; there seems to be some reference to the earth's swallowing up Korah and his company alive, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:33">Numbers 16:33</span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:11">Daniel 7:11</span>.</p>
