<p><strong>And the remnant were slain</strong>,.... Not only the kings of the earth, and their armies, that will now be gathered together, but all the remains of Papists, Pagans, and Mahometans, in the several parts of the world, even all the enemies of Christ: these will be slain</p>
<p><strong>with the sword of him that sat upon the horse</strong>; upon the white horse, as the Ethiopic version reads; the Arabic version reads, that sat upon the throne,</p>
<p><strong>which sword proceedeth out of his mouth</strong>, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:15">Revelation 19:15</span> and is the word of God, or the judiciary sentence of Christ according to it; and the meaning is, either that these shall be subdued, conquered, and converted by the word; and so are fitly called a "remnant", a remnant according to the election of grace among the antichristian party; and which sense agrees with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:13">Revelation 11:13</span> or else that they will be convicted and confounded, and not be able to stand against the light and evidence of the word of God, and will be sentenced by Christ to everlasting punishment; and it may be partly one, and partly the other.</p>
<p><strong>And all the fowls were filled with their flesh</strong>; all the Christian princes and people will be satisfied with their kingdoms, riches, and wealth, and will rejoice at their destruction, and in the righteousness of God, which will be displayed in it; and now the world being clear of all Christ's enemies, Pagan, Papal, and Mahometan, the way will be prepared for Christ's open and glorious kingdom in it.</p>
