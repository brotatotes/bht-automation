<p><strong>And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts</strong>,.... Mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:4">Revelation 4:4</span> and who represent the churches of Christ and ministers of the Gospel in the several periods of time, these join in the chorus, and praise the Lord on the account of the destruction of Rome, and ruin of antichrist; so they are often heard of in this book, when any remarkable thing is done, or when there is any breaking forth of the kingdom and glory of Christ; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:8">Revelation 5:8</span> these</p>
<p><strong>fell down</strong>; on their faces before God, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:10">Revelation 4:10</span> in great reverence of him, and of his righteous judgments:</p>
<p><strong>and worshipped God that sat on the throne</strong>; described in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:2">Revelation 4:2</span> this refers to the public worship of God in the churches, by the ministers and members of them:</p>
<p><strong>saying, Amen; Alleluia</strong>; they said "Amen", and signified their assent to what the much people in heaven had said, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:1">Revelation 19:1</span> and joined in the same "hallelujah", or expressions of praise to God, for this great appearance of his in the downfall of Babylon. Both these words are used together in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+106:48">Psalms 106:48</span>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:14">Revelation 5:14</span>.</p>
