<p><strong>And a voice came out of the throne</strong>,.... Not from God the Father, that sat upon it, for the phrase,</p>
<p><strong>praise our God</strong>, could not be said by him with propriety and pertinence; but rather from Christ, the Lamb, in the midst of the throne, who as Mediator could say of him to his people, my God and your God, and my Father and your Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:17">John 20:17</span> though it seems best to understand it of the voice of one of the angels about the throne, since one of these is afterwards spoken of, whom John would have worshipped, but was forbid, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9">Revelation 19:9</span> and which may design either one of the ministering spirits, or a preacher of the Gospel, and a set of such, calling upon the saints to the discharge of their duty, or to return to it on this occasion:</p>
<p><strong>saying, praise our God, all ye his servants</strong>; meaning not the ministers of the Gospel only, who serve in the Gospel of Christ, by preaching and defending it, and in the administration of Gospel ordinances to the comfort of the saints, but all the people of God; for though they are sons, and no more servants to sin and Satan, and the world, yet they are servants of God and of righteousness, and serve him willingly and cheerfully in a way of duty, and without slavish fear, and with a godly one, and from principles of love and gratitude, and without mercenary views and selfish ends; and these are called upon, as a part of their service, to say hallelujah, or to sing the praises of God for his judgments on antichrist; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+134:1">Psalms 134:1</span>.</p>
<p><strong>and ye that fear him, both small and great</strong>; who fear the Lord, not with a servile, but filial fear, with the new covenant grace of fear, which springs from, and is increased by, the goodness and grace of God; whether greater or lesser believers, fathers, young men, or children; whether Jews or Gentiles, or of whatsoever nation, kindred, or people; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+115:13">Psalms 115:13</span>.</p>
