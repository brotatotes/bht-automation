<p><strong>And I heard, as it were, the voice of a great multitude</strong>,.... Even of all the servants of the Lord, and them that fear him, small and great; a vast multitude of converted Jews and Gentiles, in the several parts of the world, who in answer to the voice out of the throne, which came with great power and energy, lift up their voices in praise to God, both for their own conversion, and for the downfall of Babylon:</p>
<p><strong>and as the voice of many waters</strong>: falling down in a descent, or in rough and rocky places, which make a great noise, and is heard afar off; and such must be the united voice of so great a multitude of converts as will be gathered together everywhere at this time: the same metaphor is used of the voice of Christ in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:15">Revelation 1:15</span></p>
<p><strong>and as the voice of mighty thunderings</strong>; violent claps of it, which are sometimes so loud that they rend the very heavens, and strike the inhabitants of the earth with the utmost consternation: these are the same voices which will be heard in the church when the seventh angel sounds his trumpet, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span></p>
<p><strong>saying, Alleluia</strong>; or praise ye the Lord; they will call upon one another to celebrate the praises of God, on account of the above things, in the same manner, and using the same word the people in heaven, and the four and twenty elders and four living creatures, do; and this is the fourth time the word is used in this context, and confirms the observation that has been made, that this vision refers to the conversion of the Jews, which will quickly follow the destruction of Rome: and the Jews themselves have a notion, that when Rome is destroyed the Messiah will come; and so he will in his spiritual reign. They say o,</p>
<p>"our redemption will be immediately upon the destruction of Rome.''</p>
<p>And again p,</p>
<p>"the root of our redemption depends upon the destruction of Rome.''</p>
<p>The reason for their saying "hallelujah" follows,</p>
<p><strong>for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth</strong>; by whom is meant the Lord Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all, and God over all, blessed for ever, and is the Almighty; and though he was set up as King over the holy hill of Zion, and has reigned over the church in every age, and came as King into this world, though his kingdom was not of it, and at his resurrection was declared Lord and Christ, and his kingdom was then more manifest, and he has ever since displayed his kingly power in defending his church, and defeating the enemies of it; yet now will he reign more visibly and gloriously, his kingdom will be enlarged from one end of the earth to the other, and he will be King over all the earth, which will occasion great joy to Jews and Gentiles; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+47:1">Psalms 47:1</span> and</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+47:1- :">Psalms 47:1- :</span>.</p>
