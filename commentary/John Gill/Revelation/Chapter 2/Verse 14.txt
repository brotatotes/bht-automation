<p><strong>But I have a few things against thee</strong>,.... The members of this church before their open separation from the apostasy; who still continued in the communion of the corrupt church of Rome, though they remonstrated against the errors and evil practices that crept in; and so were a stumbling block, and a snare to others to join in their idolatry and superstition:</p>
<p><strong>because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication</strong>: which latter was in order to the former: the instruction Balaam gave to Balak, which is here called his doctrine, was, that Balak should get some of the most beautiful women in his kingdom to ply the men of Israel, and draw them into uncleanness, and so to idolatry; by which means, God being angry with them, he might get an advantage over them: that the Israelites did commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab, and eat things sacrificed to idols, and bowed down to Baal Peor, is certain, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:1">Numbers 25:1</span>; but that this was brought about through the counsel of Balaam is not so plainly expressed, though it is hinted at in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+31:15">Numbers 31:15</span>; but the Jewish writers are very express about this matter. Jonathan ben Uzziel, one of their Targumists on <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+24:14">Numbers 24:14</span>, has these words of Balaam;</p>
<p>"Come, and I will counsel thee, (speaking to Balak,) go and set up inns, and place in them whorish women, to sell food and drink at a low price: and this people will come and eat and drink, and be drunken, and will lie with them, and deny their God; and they will be quickly delivered into thine hands, and many of them shall fall.''</p>
<p>This now was the stumbling block he taught Balak to lay before them. And elsewhere g it is said,</p>
<p>"that Balaam, the wicked, gave counsel to Balak, the son of Zippor, to cause the Israelites to fall by the sword; he said to him, the God of this people hates whoredom, cause thy daughters to commit whoredom with them, and ye shall rule over them.''</p>
<p>And then they go on to relate how they built shops, and placed an old woman without, and a young woman within; and when the Israelites came to buy, how well they used them, and what familiarity they admitted them to; how they made them drink of Ammonitish wine, which inclined to lust and when the signified their desire, oblige them to worship Baal Peor, and renounce the law of Moses. Both Philo h and Josephus i speak of this counsel of Balaam, much to the same purpose. The Samaritan Chronicle says k that this counsel pleased the king, and he sent into the camp of Israel, on a sabbath day, twenty four thousand young women, by whom the Israelites were so seduced, that they did everything they desired them, which was just the number of those that were slain, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:9">Numbers 25:9</span>. By Balaam may be meant the pope of Rome, for that name signifies, "the lord of the people"; and is very appropriate to him, who in this interval took upon him to be universal bishop, and lorded it over both church and state, in a most haughty and tyrannical manner; and the Balaamites were those who submitted to his power and authority, and received his doctrines; and by Balak, king of Moab, may be intended the secular powers, the emperors, kings, and princes of the earth, who were instructed by the popes of Rome, to draw their subjects into idolatry, which is spiritual fornication, to eat the breaden God, to worship the host, images, and saints departed; and which proved a snare, and a stumbling to some of this church, as to the Israelites of old, to do the same things.</p>
