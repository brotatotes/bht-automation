<p><strong>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans</strong>,.... These impure heretics sprung up in the time of the apostolic church, but their doctrines were not received, and their deeds were hated, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:6">Revelation 2:6</span>. This seems to design the doctrines of the church of Rome, which in this period took place; which forbid marriage to the priests, and recommended celibacy and virginity to others also; which were the source of all uncleanness and abominable lusts; for which pardons and indulgences were given, and, in process of time, brothel houses were set up, and licensed and encouraged by authority.</p>
<p><strong>Which thing I hate</strong>; the doctrine of these men, as well as their deeds.</p>
