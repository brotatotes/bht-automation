<p><strong>But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira</strong>,.... The copulative and is left out in the Alexandrian copy and Complutensian edition, and if retained, it may be rendered thus, "even unto the rest"; the persons spoken to are the same, the pastor of this church, with his colleagues, and all the rest of the faithful in it; which shows that this epistle, and so the rest, were not written to the pastors only, but to the churches; and that the pastor and his colleagues, with others, were free from the abominable errors and corruptions before spoken of; and that, in the worst of times, God does, and will reserve a people for himself, who are described as follows:</p>
<p><strong>as many as have not this doctrine</strong>; who had not given into, and embraced this doctrine of the antichristian church of Rome, concerning infallibility, the worshipping of images, transubstantiation, c. the Arabic version reads, "this new doctrine" for notwithstanding the large pretensions of the Romish church to antiquity, her doctrine is but a novel doctrine:</p>
<p><strong>and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak</strong>; that is, had not approved of the doctrines of antichrist, which though his followers called deep things and mysteries of their holy religion, such as transubstantiation, c. yet, to speak in the language of the pure and faithful professors of the Gospel, they are no other than the depths of Satan, or doctrines of devils or else the sense is, as Jezebel and her followers say, to the contempt of the faithful, arrogating knowledge to themselves, and upbraiding them with simplicity and ignorance, as not knowing Satan's devices, nor how to rescue souls out of them, as they did; but the former sense seems best:</p>
<p><strong>I will put upon you none other burden</strong>; meaning not any affliction or tribulation than the present one; nor any other errors and heresies than what were broached; but no other precept or command than what follows; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+9:25">2 Kings 9:25</span>.</p>
