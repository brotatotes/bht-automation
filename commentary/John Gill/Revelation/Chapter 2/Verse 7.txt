<p><strong>He that hath an ear</strong>,.... Such who have new ears given them, as all have who are made new creatures; such who have their ears circumcised, and opened by the Spirit of God; who hear with understanding, affection, and faith; who try what they hear, and approve, embrace, and retain that which is good.</p>
<p><strong>Let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches</strong>; let such hearken, and listen with attention to what is said by the Spirit, in what goes before, and follows after, in this epistle, designed for the use of all the churches; from whence it appears, that this epistle was endited by the Spirit of God, and is of divine inspiration; that it was not intended for the single use of the church at Ephesus, but of all the churches; and not of the seven churches only, though the Alexandrian copy reads, "to the seven churches": but of all the churches in that period of time, which the Ephesine church represents; and which may also be useful to the churches of Christ in all other ages and periods of time. And moreover, it may be concluded from hence, that there are in this epistle, and so in all the rest, for the same words are subjoined to them all, some things which are parabolical and prophetic, and not obvious to everyone's understanding and view; for a like expression is used by our Lord, when he had delivered anything in a parabolical way, or was obscure; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:15">Matthew 11:15</span>.</p>
<p><strong>To him that overcometh</strong>: the false apostles, false teachers, and their doctrines; coldness, lukewarmness, and remissness in love; the impure tenets and practices of the Nicolaitans:</p>
<p><strong>will I give to eat of the tree of life</strong>; by which is meant Jesus Christ himself, in allusion to the tree of life in the garden of Eden; and is so called, because he is the author of life, natural, spiritual, and eternal; and because of his fruit, the blessings of life and grace, that are in him, of which believers may eat by faith, and which they find to be soul quickening, comforting, strengthening, and satisfying; and which are Christ's gift to them, even both the food they eat, and the faith by which they eat, are his gifts. So Christ, under the name of Wisdom, is called the Tree of life, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:18">Proverbs 3:18</span>; and this is a name which is sometimes given by the Jews to the Messiah e:</p>
<p><strong>which is in the midst of the paradise of God</strong>; as the tree of life was in the garden of Eden, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:9">Genesis 2:9</span>. The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions read, "the paradise of my God"; the God of Christ, as well as of his people; and by which may be meant, either the church on earth, which is as a paradise, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="so+4:12">Song of Solomon 4:12</span>; in the midst of which Christ is, affording his gracious presence, and reaching forth his grace, and the benefits of it, to his people; or heaven,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="so+4:12- :">Song of Solomon 4:12- :</span>, said to be of God, because it is of his preparing, and where he dwells, and in the midst of which Christ, the Tree of life, is; and this shows, that he is to be come at by faith, and his fruit to be eaten, and lived upon; and he is to be beheld and enjoyed by all his saints, as he is now, and will be more perfectly hereafter.</p>
