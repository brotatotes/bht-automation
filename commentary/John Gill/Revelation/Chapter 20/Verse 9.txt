<p><strong>And they went up on the breadth of the earth</strong>,.... Either the whole earth, in the several parts of which they will be raised; or the land of Israel, where Christ and his people will be; and so the wicked being raised, will come up from the several parts of the world, and spread themselves over the holy land; just as Gog and Magog are said to cover the land of Israel, as a cloud, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+38:16">Ezekiel 38:16</span> and it may be observed, that the very phrase of רחב ארצך, "the breadth of thy land", is used of Immanuel's land, or the land of Israel, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:8">Isaiah 8:8</span></p>
<p><strong>and compassed the camp of the saints about</strong>; these are the blessed and Holy Ones, who have part in the first resurrection, even all the saints; not only the martyrs under the Heathen persecutions, and the confessors of Christ under the Papacy, but all the saints from the beginning of the world; these will be all encamped together, with the tabernacle of God in the midst of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:3">Revelation 21:3</span> and Christ their King at the head of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mic+2:13">Micah 2:13</span> the allusion is to the encampment of the children of Israel in the wilderness, about the tabernacle, which was in the midst of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="nu+2:2">Numbers 2:2</span> c. afterwards the city of Jerusalem itself was called a camp, and answered in all respects to the camp in the wilderness f, to which the reference is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:11">Hebrews 13:11</span> and which serves to illustrate the passage here, since it follows:</p>
<p><strong>and the beloved city</strong>: not Constantinople, as some have thought, but the holy city, the new Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span> the general assembly and church of the firstborn, beloved by God and Christ, and by the holy angels, and by one another and these very probably will be with Christ upon the same spot of ground where the Old Jerusalem stood, a city so highly favoured, and so much distinguished by God; so that where Christ suffered so much reproach and shame, and such an accursed death, he will now be glorified, and live in triumph with his saints:</p>
<p><strong>and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them</strong>; not material fire; with this the earth, and the bodies of the wicked then upon it, will be burnt at the beginning of the thousand years; but now their bodies will be raised immortal, and not capable of being consumed with such fire; but the fiery indignation of God, or his wrath, which will be poured out like fire, is here meant, which will destroy both body and soul; this is no other than the lake of fire, or second death, into which they will be cast; and which will not be until the judgment is over, though it is here related to show what will be the event and issue of their attack upon the saints: the allusion is to the fire sent upon Gog and Magog, and to the burning of their weapons, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+38:22">Ezekiel 38:22</span> and so the Jews g say of their Gog and Magog, that</p>
<p>"they shall be killed with the burning of the soul, with a flame of fire, which shall come from under the throne of glory.''</p>
