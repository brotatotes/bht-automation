<p><strong>Having the glory of God</strong>,.... Not only upon their souls, which will lie in the glorious robe of Christ's righteousness, the bride's wedding garment being on them, in the perfect holiness which will be in them, and in that complete knowledge of all spiritual and heavenly things they will be possessed of, they will have a glory revealed in them; but upon their bodies also, for this city, the church, the bride of Christ, will consist only of risen and changed saints, whose bodies will be freed from all dishonour; deformity, diseases, and imperfections, and will be made like unto Christ's glorious body, and will shine like the sun in the kingdom of God. Moreover, the presence of God may be intended by his glory, as the Shechinah, or the divine majesty of God in the tabernacle and temple was called, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+40:35">Exodus 40:35</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:11">1 Kings 8:11</span> for the glorious presence of God will now be in this church state, which will cast a lustre on all that are in it; for if the face of Moses, and of Stephen, shone so bright and glorious, through the presence of God with them; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7">2 Corinthians 3:7</span> how much more gloriously will the saints shine in this state, when they shall enjoy the presence of God in a far more illustrious manner? to which may be added, that Jesus Christ, who is the brightness of his Father's glory, will now appear in that, and in his own, and in the glory of his angels; and all the saints will appear with him in glory; and to see them in all this glory is a glorious sight indeed!</p>
<p><strong>And her light was like unto a stone most precious</strong>; by her "light" is not meant the light she will have in her, though that will be exceeding great, but the fountain of it from whence it comes; that which holds it forth to her, and supplies her with it: the word φωστηρ signifies an illuminator, and is used of the ministers of the Gospel, that hold forth the word of life and light to others, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:15">Philippians 2:15</span> but here it intends Christ, who is the sun of righteousness, the church's light or enlightener, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:23">Revelation 21:23</span> not with the light of nature, as he enlightens every man, nor with the light of grace, with which the saints are enlightened by him in the present state of things, by his Spirit, through the word and ordinances, but with the light of glory: and he is comparable to the most precious stone; he is more precious than rubies; he is so now to them that believe, in his person, offices, grace, and righteousness, and will be more so in his light and glory in the new Jerusalem state:</p>
<p><strong>even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal</strong>: God the Father, who sits on the throne, is said to be to look upon like a "jasper";</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:23- :">Revelation 21:23- :</span>; and here Christ, the illuminator of his church, is said to be like one, because of the exceeding brightness of this stone, and the durableness of it, expressive of the perpetuity of Christ, as the light of his church and people; he is the everlasting light of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:19">Isaiah 60:19</span> and he is compared to the crystallising "jasper". There is one sort which is called "Aerizusa", like to air c, and another "Crystallizusa" d, clear as crystal. So Pliny speaks e of a white "jasper" called "Astrios", and which, he says, is crystallo propinquans, "near to crystal", found in India, and on the shores of Pallene. To this Christ is like, because he is light itself, and in him is no darkness at all, and will cause an everlasting day; and such a clear and bright state of things, as that there will be no night, nor any more darkness, nothing but everlasting joy, peace, prosperity, and happiness; there seems to be some reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:1">Isaiah 60:1</span>.</p>
