<p><strong>On the east three gates</strong>,.... On which were written the names of Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan:</p>
<p><strong>on the north three gates</strong>; on which were written the names of Reuben, Judah, and Levi:</p>
<p><strong>on the south three gates</strong>; on which were written the names of Simeon, Issachar, and Zabulon:</p>
<p><strong>and on the west three gates</strong>; on which were written the names of Gad, Asher, and Naphtali; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+48:31">Ezekiel 48:31</span>. This denotes the collection of the saints from all parts of the world, who shall come from east, west, north, and south, and sit down in the kingdom of God; and therefore here are gates at every point to enter in at; see</p>
