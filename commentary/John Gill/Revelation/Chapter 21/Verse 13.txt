On the east three gates,.... On which were written the names of Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan:on the north three gates; on which were written the names of Reuben, Judah, and Levi:on the south three gates; on which were written the names of Simeon, Issachar, and Zabulon:and on the west three gates; on which were written the names of Gad, Asher, and Naphtali; see Ezekiel 48:31. This denotes the collection of the saints from all parts of the world, who shall come from east, west, north, and south, and sit down in the kingdom of God; and therefore here are gates at every point to enter in at; seeIsaiah 43:5.
