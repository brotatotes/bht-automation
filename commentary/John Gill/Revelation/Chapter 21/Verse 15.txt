<p><strong>And he that talked with me</strong>,.... One of the seven angels,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span> for not a man is the measurer of this city, as in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+40:3">Ezekiel 40:3</span> nor John, as of the temple, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:1">Revelation 11:1</span> but an angel, the same that showed to John this great sight:</p>
<p><strong>had a golden reed</strong>; not a common measuring reed, or rod, as in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+40:4">Ezekiel 40:4</span> but one covered with gold, denoting the present glorious state of the church, being without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing:</p>
<p><strong>to measure the city</strong>; the new Jerusalem, its length and breadth; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+2:1">Zechariah 2:1</span> to show how exactly conformable this church state will be to the rule of God's word, even to perfection: and the gates thereof; to signify who had a right to enter into it, and who not:</p>
<p><strong>and the wall thereof</strong>; its height, it being exceeding high.</p>
