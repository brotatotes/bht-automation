And he that talked with me,.... One of the seven angels,Revelation 21:9 for not a man is the measurer of this city, as inEzekiel 40:3 nor John, as of the temple, Revelation 11:1 but an angel, the same that showed to John this great sight:had a golden reed; not a common measuring reed, or rod, as inEzekiel 40:4 but one covered with gold, denoting the present glorious state of the church, being without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing:to measure the city; the new Jerusalem, its length and breadth; see Zechariah 2:1 to show how exactly conformable this church state will be to the rule of God's word, even to perfection: and the gates thereof; to signify who had a right to enter into it, and who not:and the wall thereof; its height, it being exceeding high.
