<p><strong>And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits</strong>,.... The root of which is twelve, for twelve times twelve is a hundred and forty four; which number is mystical and apostolical, and suited to the perfect state of this church: hence twelve gates, and twelve angels at them, and the names of the twelve tribes on them, and twelve foundations of the wall, and twelve thousand furlongs, the measure of the city.</p>
<p><strong>According to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel</strong>; who talked with John, and measured the city, gates, and wall, and who appeared in the form of a man; and his reed might be, as some have supposed, the length of a man, six cubits, or six feet, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+40:5">Ezekiel 40:5</span> and may denote that this business requires the utmost wisdom and understanding of a man, and even of an angel, to look into, and find out; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:18">Revelation 13:18</span> and also may signify the angelic state of the saints at this time, when the children of the resurrection will be like the angels of God, for immortality and glory.</p>
