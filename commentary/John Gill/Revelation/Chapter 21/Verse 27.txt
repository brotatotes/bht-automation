<p><strong>And there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth</strong>,.... As evil thoughts, words, and actions do; and therefore he that enters into this city must be free from all these: or "that is defiled", as the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions read; or "that is unclean", as the Arabic and Ethiopic versions; alluding to the tabernacle and temple, into which no unclean person might come; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:1">Isaiah 52:1</span>. No profane sinner, whose mind and conscience are defiled, and whose conversation is defiling, may enter here; nor any self-righteous person, whose righteousness is as filthy rags, and he himself is as an unclean thing, shall be admitted here; only such who are washed in the blood of Christ, and have on his righteousness, and so are without spot or wrinkle; which shows the pure and perfect state of this church and therefore cannot design any state of the church previous to the coming of Christ and the first resurrection:</p>
<p><strong>neither whatsoever worketh abomination</strong>; commits sin, which is abominable in the sight of God, lives and dies in a course of wickedness; or particularly is guilty of idolatry, either makes idols, or serves them, or both, which are an abomination to the Lord; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+11:7">1 Kings 11:7</span></p>
<p><strong>or maketh a lie</strong>; any lie in general; who is a common liar, loves and invents a lie, and speaks one; delivers that which is false with an intention to deceive; or in particular, who embraces and propagates antichristian lies, doctrinal ones, lies spoken in hypocrisy; such shall be damned; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span> but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life; who are predestinated to eternal life; and though they are naturally, and in themselves defiled and sinful creatures, yet they are justified by the righteousness of Christ, and sanctified by his Spirit, and so are made meet and fit to enter this city; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1- :">1 Timothy 4:1- :</span>. It is by the Jews observed d, that</p>
<p>"the Jerusalem of the world to come is not as the Jerusalem of this world; the Jerusalem of this world, whoever would go up to it (or enter into it) might; but that of the world to come, אין עולין אלא המזומנין לה, "none may go up to it (or enter into it) but those who are prepared", or appointed for it.''</p>
<p>d T. Bab. Bava Bathra, fol. 75. 2.</p>
