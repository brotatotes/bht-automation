<p><strong>And I heard a great voice out of heaven</strong>,.... Either of an angel, or rather of Christ, or God himself; since the Alexandrian copy and Vulgate Latin version read, "out of the throne",</p>
<p><strong>saying, behold the tabernacle of God is with men</strong>; in allusion to the tabernacle being with the Israelites, and the "Shechinah", or divine Majesty, being in the midst of them, and as an accomplishment of the promise in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:27">Ezekiel 37:27</span> in the fullest sense of it; and designs something distinct from the spiritual presence of Christ in his church, as his tabernacle and temple, and in the hearts of his people; and from the heavenly glory, or ultimate state of happiness, in which they will be "with him", and that not as in a tabernacle, but as in a city, which has foundations: the phrase seems to denote the personal presence of Christ with his saints in human nature, like, though different from, that in the time of his humiliation; then he dwelt or tabernacled with men on earth, but it was in the form of a servant; but now he will appear in a glorious body, and indeed in all his personal glory, and reign among them as their King:</p>
<p><strong>and he will dwell with them</strong>; in person and not by his Spirit, or by faith, as before, nor as a wayfaring man only for a night; but he will dwell with them for the space of a thousand years, and after that for ever: Christ and his church will now be come together as husband and wife:</p>
<p><strong>and they shall be his people</strong>; that is, they shall appear to be his covenant people, that will be out of all doubt; this is made manifest in some measure in the effectual calling; but it does not yet appear neither to the saints themselves, nor to others, what they are, and shall be, but now it will be evident and unquestionable.</p>
<p><strong>And God himself shall be with them</strong>; the "Immanuel", God with us; not by his Spirit, as he was after his ascension to heaven, and since is; but in person, he himself will descend from heaven, when his church, the new Jerusalem does; the Lord their God will come in person with all the saints, and will be King over all the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[And be] their God</strong>, as Thomas styles him, my Lord, and my God,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:28">John 20:28</span>. The covenant of grace, with all its blessings and promises, are in him, and now will it have its full accomplishment, and the saints be in a state inexpressibly happy; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+144:15">Psalms 144:15</span>.</p>
