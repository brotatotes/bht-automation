<p><strong>And he that sat upon the throne said</strong>,.... By whom is meant, either God the Father, who is often represented in this book as sitting on the throne, and as distinguished from Christ the Lamb; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:2">Revelation 4:2</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:13">Revelation 5:13</span> and who may seem the more to be intended, since he is by adopting grace the God and Father of his people, and they are his sons and daughters; or rather Christ, who not only is set down on the same throne with his Father, but has a throne of his own, called the throne of the Lamb, and was seen upon one by John in the preceding vision, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:11">Revelation 20:11</span> which though in order of time will be after this, yet in the order of the visions was seen before; and especially since the person on the throne speaking, calls himself the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, as Christ does in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:8">Revelation 1:8</span> and seeing he it is that gives to thirsty souls of the water of life, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span> and makes promises to the overcomer so largely and frequently in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:7">Revelation 2:7</span>. He addresses John, and delivers the following things to him,</p>
<p><strong>behold, I make all things new</strong>; which is to be understood not of the renovation of persons at conversion, when a new heart and spirit are given, and men are made wholly new creatures; for this is the work of the Spirit, and which is done daily, and is not peculiar to any particular period of time; nor of the renewing of the church state at the beginning of the Gospel, when the Jewish church state and ordinances waxed old, and vanished away, and a new covenant took place, a new and living way was opened, and new ordinances appointed, since all this was before John had this vision; nor was there any need of it to represent it to him; but of the making of the new heaven, and the new earth, which Christ ascribes to himself and of his forming his church anew, making it a new Jerusalem, bestowing new glories upon his people, both in soul and body, and so presenting them to himself a glorious church; and of the new administration of his kingdom in a very singular and glorious manner; so that it respects a new people, a new habitation, and a new manner of ruling over them; all which is his own doing, and is marvellous; and because it is a matter of great importance, and is wonderful and certain, therefore a "behold" is prefixed to it; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+43:19">Isaiah 43:19</span>. The Jews say z, that the holy blessed God will make ten things new in the future state, or world to come; the first is, he will enlighten the world; (See <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:11">Revelation 21:11</span>) the second is, he will bring living water out of Jerusalem; (see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:6">Revelation 21:6</span>) the third is, he will make trees to bring forth their fruit every month; (see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:2">Revelation 22:2</span>) and the fourth is, all the waste places shall be built, even Sodom and Gomorrha; the fifth is, Jerusalem shall be built with sapphire stone; (see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:19">Revelation 21:19</span>) the sixth is, the cow and the bear shall feed; the seventh is, a covenant shall be made between Israel, and the beasts, fowls, and creeping things; the eighth is, there shall be no more weeping and howling in the world; the ninth is, there shall be no more death in the world; the tenth is, there shall no more be sighing, and groaning, and sorrow in the world; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:4">Revelation 21:4</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And he said unto me, write</strong>; what John had seen, and Christ had said, and was about to say; and particularly what concerned the renewing of all things, the whole being a matter of moment, and worth noting and taking down in writing, that it might be on record for saints to read, and receive comfort and advantage from; and to denote the certainty of it, as well as to show that it was a clear point, and to be known, whereas, when it was otherwise, he was bid not to write; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:11">Revelation 1:11</span>.</p>
<p><strong>for these words are true and faithful</strong>; both what he had said, and was about to say; they were "true", because they came from God, who cannot lie, and "faithful", because they would be punctually and exactly fulfilled; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9">Revelation 19:9</span>. The Syriac version adds, they are God's, and so the Arabic version.</p>
