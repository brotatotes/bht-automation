<p><strong>And there came unto me one of the seven angels</strong>,.... Either the first of them, as one of the four beasts is the first of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:1">Revelation 6:1</span> or it may be the last, and very likely the same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span></p>
<p><strong>which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues</strong>; that is, the wrath of God poured out by them on the antichristian party; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:1">Revelation 15:1</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And talked with me, saying, come hither</strong>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span>.</p>
<p><strong>I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife</strong>. The "Lamb" is Christ, who is often so called in this book; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7">Revelation 19:7</span> and is the Son of God, the heir of all things, the Maker and Governor of the universe, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; and who, as Mediator, has all accomplishments and qualifications to recommend him as a bridegroom, such as beauty, riches, and wisdom: the bride, his wife, is not any particular believer, nor any particular church; not the Gentile church, nor the Jewish church only, but all the elect of God, consisting of the raised and living saints at the coming of Christ; who will make up one body, one general assembly, and be as a bride, prepared and adorned for her husband: these were first betrothed to Christ in eternity, and were openly espoused by him, one by one, at conversion; and now being all gathered in by the effectual calling, the dead being raised, and the living changed, and all glorified, the marriage is consummated, and they are declared publicly to be the bride, the Lamb's wife; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7- :">Revelation 19:7- :</span>. And now, though John had had a sight of her before, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span> yet that was but a glimmering one, at a distance, he being in the wilderness, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:3">Revelation 17:3</span> wherefore the angel calls him to him, and proposes to give him a clear, distinct, and particular view of her, in all her glory; and a glorious sight this indeed! to see the bride brought to the King in raiment of needlework, and the queen stand at his right hand in gold of Ophir. This is a sight of a quite different nature from that of the filthy strumpet, which the same angel proposed to give to John in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span>.</p>
