<p><strong>And, behold, I come quickly</strong>,..... This is repeated, to confirm the truth of Christ's second coming, and the speediness of it, and to point at the time when the above shall be, and to add what follows.</p>
<p><strong>And my reward is with me</strong>: which words are taken out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:10">Isaiah 40:10</span> and which being compared together, furnish out a clear proof of Christ being the true Jehovah, the eternal God. There is a reward of debt, or a due reward, a reward of punishment, which is the just recompense of reward, which, shall be righteously given to wicked men for their sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span> and there is a reward of grace, which is also called the recompence of reward, the reward of the inheritance, which is no other than the gift of eternal life, which God of his free grace bestows upon his people, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:26">Hebrews 11:26</span> and both these are with Christ; they are in his hands, he has authority from God, as Mediator, to inflict vengeance on the wicked, and to give eternal life to his people; both which he will do, for this is with him:</p>
<p><strong>to give every man according as his work shall be</strong>; if his work is evil, and he is an unjust and filthy man, and the course of his conversation has been vicious, the reward of debt, or just punishment, will be rendered to him; but if his work is the fruit of grace, and he has had his conversation in the world by the grace of God, and he is a righteous person, justified by the righteousness of Christ, and a holy, good man, sanctified by the Spirit of God, the reward of grace, the crown of righteousness, will be given to him.</p>
