<p><strong>I am Alpha and Omega</strong>,.... <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. These characters are all put together here, which are before used in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:8">Revelation 1:8</span> and are very pertinently mentioned in this place, when all promises and prophecies, relating to the glorious kingdom of Christ, were just finishing, and that itself was ready to appear, in which Christ alone should be exalted, the mystery of God would be completed, and time itself be no more. The Ethiopic version adds, "the beginning and end of days", or time. A testimony this, of the deity, eternity, infinity, and perfection of Christ.</p>
