<p><strong>Blessed are they that do his commandments</strong>,.... Either the commandments of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:17">Revelation 12:17</span> the precepts of the moral law, which are the whole duty of man; which are done either legally in order to obtain life, and then they must be perfectly done, which no man can do; hence none live, and are justified by the deeds of it, and consequently are not blessed, but cursed; or evangelically, when they are done in the strength of Christ, from love to God, in the exercise of faith upon him, with a view to his glory, and without dependence on them, acknowledging the imperfection of them, and looking unto Jesus for righteousness and life, in whom such find both, and so are blessed persons: or else the commandments of Jesus are intended, who is speaking in the context, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:12">Revelation 22:12</span> and is speaking of himself, and his, as the angel does in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span> Christ's commandments are his new commandment of love, and the ordinances of baptism, and the Lord's supper; which are to be observed in the same evangelical manner as the commandments of God, and to be kept exactly as they are delivered, without any alteration, addition, or diminution; and they are to be attended to immediately, and without delay; and such as regard them in a right way and manner are blessed; they have much pleasure and delight in the observance of them; these commandments are not grievous, especially when they have the presence of Christ, the discoveries of his love, and are under the gracious influences of his Spirit: or it may be rather the commandments in this book are designed, for it may be rendered, "that do its commandments"; keep the sayings of this book, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:7">Revelation 22:7</span> such as relate to the worship of God, and forbid the worship of the beast, which caution against idolatry, and exhort to come out of Babylon, and direct to follow the Lamb, and charge not to add or take from anything written in this prophecy; and such persons as keep the words of it are pronounced blessed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>. The Alexandrian copy reads, "that wash their garments"; and so the Ethiopic version, and also the Vulgate Latin, which adds, "in the blood of the Lamb", agreeably to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:13">Revelation 7:13</span> and such whose persons and garments are washed in the blood of Christ are blessed indeed; they are justified by it, pardoned through it, and both they and their services are accepted on account of it. The instances of their happiness follow,</p>
<p><strong>that they may have right to the tree of life</strong>; or "power over the tree of life"; that is, Christ, not of government over him, but of enjoyment of him; a liberty of eating of the fruit of this tree, having interest in it, and so a right to partake of it; which right, or liberty, is not obtained by obedience to the commands of God, or Christ, or of this book, for this is what is due to God, and obligatory on men; and which, when done, is but their duty, and can merit nothing; though a cheerful and evangelical obedience to the divine will makes such appear to have a right to such a privilege, as the disciples of Christ are not made so, but appear to be such by bringing forth fruit, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:8">John 15:8</span> but to have interest in Christ, the tree of life, and a right, power, and liberty to eat thereof, is a free grace gift, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:7">Revelation 2:7</span> and happy are those who enjoy such a privilege! <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:18">Proverbs 3:18</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And may enter in through the gates into the city</strong>: the Ethiopic version reads, "into this holy city": and which intends not entrance into a particular church of Christ, the way into which is faith in Christ, and a profession of it, and submission to the ordinance of baptism; nor entrance into heaven, which, as a Gospel church, is often called a city, and into which none shall enter, but such who are justified by the righteousness of Christ, and are regenerated by his Spirit, the gates of it are Christ and his grace; but the holy city, the new Jerusalem, is meant, and entrance into that, which is so largely described in the preceding chapter, and particularly its gates; and they must be happy persons, indeed, who enter there; and their right to it is from, and lies in Christ, his blood, righteousness, and grace, under a sense of which they yield a ready obedience to his will, which makes their right to appear. Frequent mention is made of the gates of this city in the book of Zohar; and, says R. Isaac i,</p>
<p>"when the soul זוכה לכנס בשערי, "is fit" (or worthy, or has a right) "to enter through the gates of Jerusalem" that is above, Michael the great prince goes with it, who anticipates for it the peace of the ministering angels, wondering at him, and inquiring concerning it, saying, "who is this that comes out of the wilderness", &amp;c. <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="so+3:6">Song of Solomon 3:6</span>.''</p>
<p>i Medrash Haneelam in Zohar in Gen. fol. 77. 1.</p>
