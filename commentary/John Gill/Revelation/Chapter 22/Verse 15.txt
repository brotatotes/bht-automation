<p><strong>For without are dogs</strong>,.... That is, without the holy city are such persons who are comparable to dogs for their filthiness, impudence, and voraciousness, as are persecutors, heretics, and apostates, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:6">Matthew 7:6</span>. Some think Sodomites are intended, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+23:18">Deuteronomy 23:18</span>. So Abarbinel and others interpret the law; and who abound in the Roman jurisdiction, called therefore Sodom,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:8">Revelation 11:8</span> and indeed all wicked men, who will be cast out into outer darkness, may be signified hereby. The Jews say k,</p>
<p>"when a man dies, if he be worthy (or righteous) he descends in the likeness of a lion to receive "his" soul, but if not, in the likeness of "a dog", concerning which David says,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:20">Psalms 22:20</span>.''</p>
<p><strong>And sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters</strong>; characters of the antichristian party, who will have no place in this city, or glorious kingdom of Christ; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:20- :">Psalms 22:20- :</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And whosoever loveth and maketh a lie</strong>; who loves both to invent and tell lies, and loves to hear them told by others; meaning more especially the doctrinal lies of antichrist, which are spoken in hypocrisy by him, and his followers are given up to believe.</p>
<p>k Raya Mchimna in Zohar in Numb. fol. 95. 2.</p>
