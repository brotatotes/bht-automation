<p><strong>And the Spirit and the bride say, come</strong>,.... Hearing Christ say that he should come quickly, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:7">Revelation 22:7</span> the Spirit and the bride express an earnest wish, and a most affectionate desire after his coming: by "the Spirit" may be meant the Spirit of God in the hearts of his people, who not only convinces them of, and acquaints with the coming of Christ to judgment, and gives them reason to expect it, but fills their souls with the love of his appearance, so that they look and long for it, and hasten in the breathings of their souls after it: and this in like manner he may be said to wish for, and desire it in them, as he is said to cry "Abba", Father, in them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:6">Galatians 4:6</span> and to make intercession for them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</span>. Hence, some interpreters, by the spirit, understand such as have the Spirit, and are spiritual men; either have spiritual gifts, the gift of prophecy, as John, who in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:20">Revelation 22:20</span> expresses an ardent desire that Christ would come quickly; or regenerate men in common, who are born of the Spirit, and bear his name, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:5">John 3:5</span> and so by an hendyadis, "the Spirit and the bride" signify one and the same; namely, the spiritual bride of Christ, who is sanctified by the Spirit of God; even all the elect of God, whom Christ loved from all eternity, and who are espoused to him as a chaste virgin; the new Jerusalem, who is as a bride adorned for her husband, and is the bride, the Lamb's wife: these wait for the bridegroom's coming, and most earnestly desire it, as there is good reason for them so to do, since his appearing in itself will be a glorious one, being in his own glory, and his Father's, and the holy angels; and seeing then will be the solemnization of the marriage day between Christ and his church; it will be the saints' redemption day; they will then possess full salvation in soul and body; complete grace will be given to them, and glory will be revealed in them, and they shall be for ever with the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>And let him that heareth</strong>; what the Spirit and the bride say; or the words of this prophecy; or that has spiritual ears given him, and he hears so as to understand spiritual things, the kingdom of Christ, and the glories of it, let him join the Spirit and bride, and</p>
<p><strong>say, come</strong> likewise; or express his wishes and desires in the same earnest and affectionate manner, that Christ would hasten his second coming:</p>
<p><strong>and let him that is athirst come</strong>. These seem to be the words of Christ inviting such who thirst after him, his grace and righteousness, after more knowledge of him, and communion with him, to come unto him, by faith, and partake thereof, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span> or who thirst after his second coming, and the glories and delights of the new Jerusalem state, to come into it, and eat of the tree of life, and drink of the river of water of life in it; for the character seems to design such, to speak in the language of the Jews, who use like phrases with this, who hunger, וצמאים לשתות מים חיים, "and thirst to drink living water" m, as appears by what follows:</p>
<p><strong>and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely</strong>. The water of life designs the free favour and love of God, and the communications and displays of it in the new Jerusalem state, even the comfort, refreshment, and glories of that state: to "take" it is to enjoy it, to partake of it, being led unto it, and that being given to them by Christ the Lamb in the midst of the throne, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:17">Revelation 7:17</span> and which is had "freely", without money, and without price, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:1">Isaiah 55:1</span> which seems to be referred to; for the happiness of this state, as well as eternal life, is the free gift of God through Christ; and the persons encouraged to partake of it are "whosoever will"; that is, whoever has a will to divine and spiritual things, wrought in him by God, for no man has such a will of himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:13">Philippians 2:13</span> though this does not so much regard the character of the person that may take of the water of life, as the free manner in which he may take it: so the Jews are wont to express themselves, when they would signify the liberty that might be used, or the free way in which anything might be taken, particularly when speaking of the law, and the things of it, חרוצה ליטול יבא ויטול</p>
<p>כל, "whosoever has a mind to take, let him come and take", as it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:1">Isaiah 55:1</span> "ho, everyone that thirsteth", c. n that is, he is free to take, he is welcome to it which passage referred to, is thus paraphrased by the Targumist, "ho, כל דצבי, "whosoever "will" learn, let him come and learn, &amp;c.</p>
