<p><strong>For I testify to every man</strong>,.... These are not the words of a scribe, who having wrote out a copy of this book, added the following adjuration to it, to deter persons from adding to it, or diminishing it; for the book is not yet finished, and both Christ and John speak after this; and to insert such a passage into the text would be a bold and daring action; nor are they even the words of John, the inspired writer of it, but of the Lord Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:16">Revelation 22:16</span> who in a most solemn manner declares to every man, high or low, rich or poor, of whatsoever character, or however dignified, either in a civil or ecclesiastic way,</p>
<p><strong>that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book</strong> read or explained,</p>
<p><strong>if any man shall add unto these things</strong>. To "add" to the things contained in this book, is not to deliver, or write an exposition of it, in a modest manner, with a sincere view to give light into it, agreeably to the analogy of faith; for to expound Scripture, or to preach from it, consistent with it, is not to add unto it, but to give the sense of it; but then may it be said to be added unto, and so this book, when it is wrested and perverted, and a false gloss is put upon it, as the Pharisees did upon the law; and when unwritten traditions are made to be equal to it, or above it, as the same persons made the traditions of the elders, whereby they transgressed the law, and made the word of God of none effect, and so broke through the precept given, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+4:2">Deuteronomy 4:2</span> as do the Papists in like manner; and when men pretend to visions and revelations, and make them the rule of faith and practice, and to confirm things that are neither in this book, nor in any other part of the word of God; and when men interpolate it, and set up human fictitious writings upon equal authority with it; which shows the authenticity of this book, and of all the whole Scripture, and the perfection of it, whose canon is closed with it: the punishment of such a crime follows,</p>
<p><strong>God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book</strong>; the things threatened to the antichristian party, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:22">Revelation 2:22</span> the seven last plagues in which the wrath of God is filled up, which will be inflicted on the same, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:1">Revelation 16:1</span>, the lake of fire and brimstone, into which the beast, the false prophet, the devil, and all wicked men will be cast, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+30:5">Proverbs 30:5</span>.</p>
