<p><strong>He which testifieth these things</strong>,.... Not the angel,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:16">Revelation 22:16</span> nor John, who sometimes used this way of speaking,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:24">John 21:24</span> but Christ, as appears from what follows; for he</p>
<p><strong>saith, surely I come quickly</strong>; who not only asserts the speediness of his coming, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:7">Revelation 22:7</span> but expresses the certainty of it, so that it ought not to be doubted of by any, especially by his own people; though it may seem to be deferred, and, upon that account, be derided by ungodly men; and Christ may have some respect, in this strong repetition of it, to the certainty of the punishment that will then be inflicted upon such who add to, or diminish from this book; for he himself will certainly come in person, and execute the vengeance threatened. John next puts his</p>
<p><strong>Amen</strong> to it, signifying his assent unto it, declaring his faith in it, and expressing his earnest desire after it, and wish for it: and in words at length adds,</p>
<p><strong>even so come, Lord Jesus</strong>; quickly, speedily as thou hast said, and in all thy glory; set up thy kingdom, let that come, introduce thy people into it, and destroy thine enemies; this he said as one that loved the appearance of Christ, longed for it, hastened to it, and was impatient at the delay of it.</p>
