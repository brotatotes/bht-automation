<p><strong>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</strong> That is, let a sense of the love of Christ, shown in all his regards to his church and people, which is always the same in itself, though the saints have not always the same perception of it, abide upon you: may you see your interest in the redeeming grace of Christ, in all its branches, and in his justifying, pardoning, sanctifying, and persevering grace; let the fulness of grace in Christ be the object of your trust and confidence; may you have a supply from it to enable you to overcome every temptation, to exercise every grace, and discharge every duty. This shows this book was written in the form of an epistle, and sent to the seven churches of Asia, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:11">Revelation 1:11</span> and through them to the churches in all ages. It begins with a salutation of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span> and ends with one commonly used by the Apostle Paul in all his epistles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>. The Arabic version, instead of "you", reads "us"; and the Complutensian edition and the Syriac version read, "with all the saints".</p>
