<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:25">Revelation 21:25</span> to express the certainty of it, and to observe, that the happiness of this state will greatly lie in the light thereof; it will be one everlasting day, ημερα αιωνος, "day of eternity", or eternal day, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:18">2 Peter 3:18</span></p>
<p><strong>and they need no candle, nor the light of the sun</strong>; neither artificial nor natural light; neither the dimmer light of the ceremonial law, under the legal dispensation, which was like a candle lighted up in Judea; nor the more clear light of the Gospel and its ordinances, under the present dispensation, which now will be at an end:</p>
<p><strong>for the Lord God giveth them light</strong>; immediately from himself, without the use of means and ordinances; and in his light the saints will see all things clearly; who will be always communicating it to them, and will be their everlasting light; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:18- :">2 Peter 3:18- :</span>.</p>
<p><strong>and they shall reign for ever and ever</strong>; they are made kings now, and in this state they shall reign with Christ for the space of a thousand years; and when they are ended, they shall not cease to reign; nor will Christ, when he delivers up the kingdom to the Father, for his and their kingdom is an everlasting one, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:6">Revelation 1:6</span> and here ends the account of this glorious state of things; what follows is the conclusion of the whole book.</p>
