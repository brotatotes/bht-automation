<p><strong>Behold, I come quickly</strong>,.... These are the words not of the angel, but of Christ, as is manifest from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:12">Revelation 22:12</span> and which are to be understood not of Christ's coming in his power to destroy Jerusalem, for this was past when John had these visions, and wrote this book; but of the second and personal coming of Christ to judgment, as is clear from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:12">Revelation 22:12</span> which though it will not be sooner than the time appointed, yet will be as soon as that time is come, and sooner than is generally expected by men. The Ethiopic version adds, "as a thief", as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:15">Revelation 16:15</span> and because the second coming of Christ is an affair of the utmost moment, and will be attended with events of the greatest consequence and importance, in which the visions of this book issue, a "behold" is prefixed to it, as a note of attention and admiration:</p>
<p><strong>blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book</strong>; this book is a prophecy of things to come, and therefore cannot refer to the times of Jerusalem's destruction, which some interpreters make it chiefly to concern, for then it would be a narrative of things past; the sayings of it are the things contained in it; to keep these sayings is to read them with observation, to take notice of the accomplishment of them, so far as it has taken place, to keep them in mind and memory, to meditate upon them, and through the grace of God to steer the life and conversation according to the instructions, directions, and cautions here given; and such are blessed in life, and will be in death; they will die in the Lord, share in the first resurrection, and enter through the gates into the city.</p>
