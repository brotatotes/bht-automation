<p><strong>And I John saw these things, and heard them</strong>,.... He was both an eye and an ear witness; some things he saw, and others he heard; and to render his testimony the more authentic, he puts his name to it; and he being an apostle of Christ, and a man of great sincerity and probity, is to be believed.</p>
<p><strong>And when I had heard and seen</strong>; the things related in this book, being amazed at them, and filled with joy on account of many of them, and firmly believing the whole as coming from God:</p>
<p><strong>I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things</strong>. This is the second time John did so, though warned of it, and rebuked for it, which shows the proneness even of good men to fall into sin again and again; and what a propensity there is in mankind to idolatry; and very likely this might be suffered, that a second reproof might be given, and repeated instructions be on record, to prevent the worshipping of angels, introduced in the first ages of Christianity.</p>
