<p><strong>Then saith he unto me</strong>,.... The angel at whose feet John fell down to worship:</p>
<p><strong>see thou do it not</strong>; this he said in great haste, and with much vehemence, to hinder him from doing it, as his short way of speaking shows:</p>
<p><strong>for I am thy fellow servant</strong>: of God, and of Christ, and am no more the object of worship than thyself; and both of us are, and ought to be, the worshippers of God, whose servants we are:</p>
<p><strong>and of thy brethren the prophets</strong>; the apostles and ministers of the word; for prophesying and preaching are the same thing; these were the brethren of John in a spiritual sense, and by reason of their function:</p>
<p><strong>and of them which keep the sayings of this book</strong>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:7">Revelation 22:7</span> and this is said to encourage the observation of them, and is the character of private Christians, and shows the great condescension of the angel to put himself, not only upon a level with John, and the ministers of the word, but with common believers:</p>
<p><strong>worship God</strong>; and him only, and that in a spiritual manner, with reverence and godly fear, in faith, and according to his revealed will;</p>
