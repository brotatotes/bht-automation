<p>INTRODUCTION TO REVELATION 3</p>
<p>This chapter contains the epistles to the churches at Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea, and begins with that to Sardis; in which the sender describes himself by some things taken out of a former description of him; and gives an account of the state of this church; that her works were known by him, which were imperfect; and that she had the name of a living church, but was dead; wherefore she is exhorted to watchfulness and diligence, to remember how she had heard and received the Gospel, and to hold it fast, and repent of her sins: if not, he threatens to come as a thief unawares upon her, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:1">Revelation 3:1</span>, but excepts some few persons from this general account, who were not defiled with the corruptions of the majority, and who therefore should be favoured with communion with him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:4">Revelation 3:4</span>, and then some gracious promises are made to persevering saints, and the epistle is concluded in the usual form, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span>. Next follows the epistle to the church at Philadelphia; in which the sender assumes some peculiar titles not before mentioned, taken from his holiness, truth, and power, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:7">Revelation 3:7</span>, signifies his approbation of her works; declares he had set before her an open door, which could not be shut; affirms she had a little strength, and commends her for keeping his word, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:8">Revelation 3:8</span>, and, for her encouragement, promises that some persons, formerly of bad characters, should come and worship before her, and should know what an interest she had in his love; and that since she had kept his word, he would keep her from an hour of temptation, which will be a trying time to all the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9">Revelation 3:9</span>, and in consideration of his speedy coming, he exhorts her to hold fast what she had, that she might not lose her honour and glory; and promises the overcomer a fixed place and name in the house of God; and closes the epistle as the rest, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:11">Revelation 3:11</span>, and then follows the last epistle of all, which is that to the church at Laodicea; in which the sender describes himself by some characters taken from his truth and faithfulness, and from his eternity, power, and dominion, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>, represents the members of this church as lukewarm, and very disagreeable to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:15">Revelation 3:15</span>, and as having a vain opinion of themselves, being ignorant of their real state and case, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:17">Revelation 3:17</span>, wherefore he gives them some wholesome counsel and advice, suitable to their condition, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:18">Revelation 3:18</span>, and whereas there were some among them he loved, he lets them know that his rebukes and chastenings were from love, and with a view to stimulate them to zeal, and bring them to repentance, which became them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:19">Revelation 3:19</span>, and then he informs them where he was, what he expected from them, and what they might upon a suitable behaviour enjoy with him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:20">Revelation 3:20</span>, and next promises to the overcomer great honour and glory, such as he had with his Father; and concludes the epistle in his usual manner, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21">Revelation 3:21</span>. </p>
