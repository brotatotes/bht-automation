<p><strong>Behold, I come quickly</strong>,.... To bring on this hour of temptation on the reformed churches, which will be at the beginning of this period; to help and deliver, save and preserve the truly godly among them; to destroy antichrist, and introduce the latter day glory:</p>
<p><strong>hold that fast which thou hast</strong>; either her grace in the exercise of it, as her faith, patience, c. or rather the doctrines of the Gospel, and the ordinances of it, which she had received, as delivered by Christ and his apostles: and which she had held in the truth and purity of them, and is now exhorted to hold them fast, since this hour of temptation would be a trying time to her faith, patience, integrity, and constancy:</p>
<p><strong>that no man take thy crown</strong> not eternal happiness, called a crown of life, glory, and righteousness, and which was prepared for her, and promised to her, and would be certainly given her; nor was there any danger of another's taking it from her; not but that exhortations of this kind to the saints are necessary, with respect to that, to excite to diligence, care, and watchfulness; and are no ways contrary to their final perseverance, and certain salvation, but are means thereof: but either her honour for her faith and faithfulness, for her integrity, sincerity, and purity, is here meant; or the glorious things which were spoken of this church state, and to be accomplished in it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+87:3">Psalms 87:3</span>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:1">Isaiah 60:1</span>.</p>
