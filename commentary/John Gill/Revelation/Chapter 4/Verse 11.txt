<p><strong>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory honour, and power</strong>,.... The Alexandrian copy, and some others, the Complutensian edition, the Vulgate Latin version, and all the Oriental ones, read, "thou art worthy, O Lord, and our God, to receive"; that is, to receive the acknowledgment and ascription of glory, honour, and power; for otherwise God cannot be said to receive these from his creatures, than by their confessing and declaring that they belong unto him: and that for the reasons following,</p>
<p><strong>for thou hast created all things</strong>; the whole universe, the heavens, the earth, and sea, and all that in them are:</p>
<p><strong>and for thy pleasure they are and were created</strong>; God is the first cause, and the last end of all things; by his power they are made, and according to his will, and for his own glory, and therefore is worthy of such a doxology; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+16:4">Proverbs 16:4</span>. What is here said is contrary to a notion imbibed by the Jews z, that the world was not created but for the sake of the Israelites: and elsewhere a they say,</p>
<p>"the world was not created but for David; and one says for Moses; and Rabbi Jochanan says for the Messiah;''</p>
<p>which last is truest.</p>
