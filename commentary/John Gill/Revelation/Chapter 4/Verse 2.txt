<p><strong>And immediately I was in the Spirit</strong>,.... As he had been before, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:10">Revelation 1:10</span>; it seems he had been some little time out of his ecstasy, how long cannot be said, and now, upon this new scene of things, returned to it; upon the opening of the door in heaven, and hearing the former voice, and the things it said, the Spirit of God at once possessed and filled him, in an extraordinary manner; and his soul or spirit was immediately taken from the consideration of all sensible objects, and was fixed and intent upon the things presented to it in the vision, so that it was as if it was out of the body. The Arabic version reads, "then therefore I went in the Spirit"; in obedience to the voice that called him up, in which he was assisted by the Spirit of God, who lifted him up as he did Ezekiel, when he saw what follows:</p>
<p><strong>and behold, a throne was set in heaven</strong>; not for the final judgment, on which the son of man will sit, when he comes to judge the quick and dead, for he is not the person that fills this but this is a symbol of the power, authority, and dominion now exercised by God, not over the world in general, who has prepared his throne in the heavens, and governs among the nations, according to his sovereign will and pleasure, but which he exercises in his church, signified by "heaven". The allusion is to the temple, and the throne of God in it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:1">Isaiah 6:1</span>. The temple was an emblem of the Gospel church, Jerusalem, or the Gospel church state, and was to be called the throne of the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+3:17">Jeremiah 3:17</span>, and now his throne is set there. Here he exercises a jurisdiction and government; he is King and lawgiver in it; he has enacted laws, and he writes them on the hearts of his people, and puts his Spirit within them, and makes them both able and willing to obey them.</p>
<p><strong>And [one] sat on the throne</strong>; not the trinity of persons in the Godhead, which some think are signified by the three precious stones in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:3">Revelation 4:3</span>, the jasper, sardine, and emerald; for, as distinct from him that sat upon the throne, the Lamb is said to be in the midst of it, and the seven spirits of God are said to be before it: nor is Jesus Christ intended, and his two natures; his divine nature by the jasper, and his human nature by the red and blood coloured sardine; since he, the Lamb, is represented as in the midst of the throne, and is often distinguished from him that sat upon it; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>; but God the Father is designed, who sits on the throne, though not to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit, yet in distinction from them. This clause is left out in the Ethiopic version.</p>
