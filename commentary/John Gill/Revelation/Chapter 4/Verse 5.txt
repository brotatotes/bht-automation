<p><strong>And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>and voices</strong>,.... Which may be understood either of the doctrines of the Gospel which come out of Zion, and out of Jerusalem, the church of God, where he has his throne; and which are comparable to "lightning", both for the light and knowledge they give, and for the swiftness with which they were spread over the world, by the apostles of Christ; and to "thunderings", for the awfulness, authority, and majesty of them, especially as they were delivered out by the Boanergeses, or sons of thunder; and as the prophesies of the prophets are called "the voices" of the prophets, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:27">Acts 13:27</span>; so may the doctrines of the Gospel be called "voices", as they are the voice of God, and of Christ, and of his ministers; and are voices of love, grace, mercy, peace, pardon, righteousness, and eternal life. The allusion is to the giving of the law on Mount Sinai, when such things were seen and heard, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:16">Exodus 19:16</span> or else the judgments of God, and the punishments inflicted upon his enemies, and the enemies of his church and people, and his awful threatenings of them, may be designed; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:13">Psalms 18:13</span>; with which compare <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:5">Revelation 8:5</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And [there were] seven lamps of burning fire before the throne</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>which are the seven spirits of God</strong>; in allusion to the seven lamps in the tabernacle and temple, which were trimmed by the priests, and always kept burning, and are expressive of the Spirit, and his gifts; and these being signified by the number "seven", denote the fulness and perfection of them; and being said to be "before the throne", show that there is always a sufficiency of them for the supply of the churches in all ages, to fit and qualify proper persons to minister the word, and administer ordinances; and these being called "lamps of burning fire", point at the light the Spirit of God in his gifts communicates to the churches; and that warmth and heat, comfort and refreshment; conveyed to them, through the preaching of the Gospel, and the dispensation of the ordinances of it, under his illuminating and quickening influences.</p>
