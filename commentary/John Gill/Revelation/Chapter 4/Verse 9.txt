<p><strong>And when these beasts give glory</strong>,.... When they give God the glory of all his perfections, covenant, and promises, and of all the gifts and grace bestowed on them, and of the success of their ministry; and in it glorify Father, Son, and Spirit, who bear their respective parts in the business of salvation; and ascribe to each their due glory in election, redemption, and sanctification:</p>
<p><strong>and honour</strong>; in the several parts of religious worship performed by them; and not with their lips only, but with their hearts also:</p>
<p><strong>and thanks</strong>; for all blessings, temporal and spiritual, bestowed on them, and on the saints: even</p>
<p><strong>to him that sat on the throne</strong>; God the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:3">Revelation 4:3</span>;</p>
<p><strong>who liveth for ever and ever</strong>; he who is the living God, and will always continue so.</p>
