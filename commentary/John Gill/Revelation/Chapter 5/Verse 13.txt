<p><strong>And every creature which is in heaven</strong>,.... Animate or inanimate, angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect, sun, moon, and stars, and the fowls of the air:</p>
<p><strong>and on the earth</strong>; men and beasts, and every creeping thing, mountains, hills, fruitful trees, and all cedars: and under the earth: in the bowels of it, metals, minerals, and everything of that kind:</p>
<p><strong>and such as are in the sea</strong>; that sail in ships upon the mighty waters, and fishes great and small that are therein:</p>
<p><strong>and all that are in them</strong>; in heaven, earth, and sea:</p>
<p><strong>heard I saying, blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever</strong>; all creatures in their way praise God, and are subservient to the glory and interest of Christ, and are the occasion of glorifying of both; and even the enemies of Christ, wicked men and devils, will be obliged to own Christ to be Lord, to the glory of God the Father, as well as angels and saints; and the same glory and honour which are given to the one are ascribed to the other, which shows the proper deity of Christ, and his equality with the Father. The Syriac version reads, "and I heard him who sitteth upon the throne, saying, to the Lamb be given blessing and honour", &amp;c. with which compare <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:22">John 5:22</span>.</p>
