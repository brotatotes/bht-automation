<p><strong>And the four beasts said, Amen</strong>,.... Giving their assent to what the angels and every creature said, and expressing their desires and wishes that so it might be, and also their faith, that so it was, and would be:</p>
<p><strong>and the four [and] twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever</strong>; either God the Father, who sat upon the throne, and is so described, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:9">Revelation 4:9</span>; or else the Lamb who had been slain, and was now alive, and lives for evermore; or both of them, for the Alexandrian copy, the Complutensian edition, and the Syriac and Arabic versions, omit the words "him that liveth for ever and ever"; and leave it to be understood of either of them, or both; and the Ethiopic version reads, "and the elders worshipped him"; as the four living creatures and four and twenty elders led the chorus, and begun the song, so they close it, as being the persons more immediately concerned in the death and sufferings of the Lamb, and redemption by him, and in the sealed book, and in the things contained in it; the seals of which are next opened, and an account is given of them in some following chapters.</p>
