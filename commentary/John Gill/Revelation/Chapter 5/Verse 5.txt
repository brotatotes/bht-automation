<p><strong>And one of the elders said unto me</strong>,.... The Ethiopic version reads, "one of these elders"; that is, one of the four and twenty elders that were round about the throne; not the first of the four and twenty books of the Old Testament; nor the patriarch Jacob, because of the prophecy concerning Shiloh, Judah's son, which stands in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span>, nor Moses, who spoke of the Messiah as the great prophet of the church; nor John the Baptist, who pointed out the Lamb of God; these are all fancies and conjectures. It was one of the members of the Christian church, who was near the throne of God, had communion with him, and knowledge of his will, who in this visionary way is represented as comforting John under his sorrow and concern, and giving him information: and sometimes persons of superior abilities may receive instruction from meaner persons, as did Apollos from Aquila and Priscilla: the same said unto John,</p>
<p><strong>weep not</strong>; cease sorrowing, do not be cast down, nor despair;</p>
<p><strong>behold the lion of the tribe of Judah</strong>; by whom is meant Christ, who, according to the flesh, was to come of the tribe of Judah; and certain it is, that our Lord sprang from thence: and he is said to be the lion of that tribe, in allusion to the prophecy concerning Judah in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:9">Genesis 49:9</span>, where he is said to be a lion, an old lion stooping down and couching, and on whose standard was the figure of a lion. Christ may be compared to one, because of his great strength, he being the mighty God, the able Saviour, and strong Redeemer, and protector of his church and people, and the avenger of their enemies; and because of his courage and intrepidity when he engaged with Satan, and his principalities and powers, when he bore the sins of his people, sustained his Father's wrath, and the terrors of death set themselves in array against him; and because of the fierceness of his wrath, and fury against the wicked, and for his generosity and lenity towards those that stoop unto him, and obey him. So the Jews say f, that</p>
<p>"of Messiah, the son of David, who comes forth from Judah, is it said, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:9">Genesis 49:9</span>, "Judah is a lion's whelp";''</p>
<p>and a little after, Messiah, the son of David, who is אריה, "a lion", shall be on his right hand, and Messiah, the son of Joseph, who is an ox, on his left hand; so the word of the Lord frequently, in the Chaldee paraphrase, is said to be a lion g.</p>
<p><strong>The root of David</strong>; in like manner is Christ called the root of Jesse in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:10">Isaiah 11:10</span>; and the meaning either is, that he is a branch that springs out of the roots of Jesse and David, is David's son and offspring, according to his human nature; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:16">Revelation 22:16</span>; or that he is David's Lord, according to his divine nature: and the metaphor of a root well agrees with him as Mediator, he being hidden out of sight, and unknown to a natural man; and may denote his meanness in his state of humiliation, when he was as a root out of a dry ground; and because he is the root from whence all the elect of God spring, in whom they have their being, and by whom they are bore and supported, and from whom are derived to them all the blessings of grace, all their spiritual life, holiness, fruitfulness, and perseverance. Now this illustrious Person, so described,</p>
<p><strong>hath prevailed</strong>; or overcome all difficulties, being one of worth and value, of great authority and ability:</p>
<p><strong>to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof</strong>; and deliver out all the prophecies in it, and fulfil them; and this through the merits of his blood, and in consequence of his sufferings and death: hence, in the next verse, he is represented as a lamb as it had been slain; and the four living creatures, and the four and twenty elders, put his worthiness to take the book, and open it, upon his having been slain, and having redeemed them by his blood, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span>. And as he, upon his resurrection from the dead, had all power in heaven and in earth given him, as Mediator, for the protection of his church, so he was deserving; and it was fit and necessary that he, as the great prophet of the church, should have and deliver out the prophecies concerning the state and condition of his redeemed ones in all ages.</p>
