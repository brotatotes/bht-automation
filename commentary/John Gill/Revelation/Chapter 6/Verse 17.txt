<p><strong>For the great day of his wrath is come</strong>,.... The Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions read, "of their wrath"; both of him that sits upon the throne, and of the Lamb, against the Heathen gods and Heathen persecutors, in answer to the cry of the martyrs in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And who shall be able to stand</strong>? against either of them, or in their presence, and so as to bear their wrath and displeasure; all which expresses guilt, shame, fear, and despair.</p>
