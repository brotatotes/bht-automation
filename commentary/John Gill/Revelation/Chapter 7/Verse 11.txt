<p><strong>And all the angels stood round about the throne</strong>,.... The holy and elect angels, even all of them, the ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, the innumerable company of them, who are represented in the same position; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and [about] the elders, and the four beasts</strong>; the churches and ministers; yea, round about the great multitude before mentioned, the camp of the saints, and the beloved city; whose guardians they will be, and to whom they will always be ministering spirits.</p>
<p><strong>And fell before the throne on their faces</strong>: in token of submission and reverence:</p>
<p><strong>and worshipped God</strong>; by celebrating the perfections of his nature, and ascribing to him the glory of all his works.</p>
