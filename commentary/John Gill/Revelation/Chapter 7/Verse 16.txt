<p><strong>They shall hunger no more, nor thirst any more</strong>,.... The words are taken out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:10">Isaiah 49:10</span>, and will be true in a literal and corporeal sense. Now the saints are often in hunger and thirst, then they shall be so no more; and in a mystical and spiritual sense, there will be no famine of the word; for though there will not be the outward ministration of the word, as now, the substance of it will be enjoyed, to full satisfaction; nor will there be any uneasy desires after spiritual things, and much less any hungerings and thirstings, or lusting after carnal, sensual, and earthly things.</p>
<p><strong>Neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat</strong>; not the sun of persecution, see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:6">Matthew 13:6</span>; nor the heat of Satan's temptations, or his fiery darts; nor of any fiery trial, or sore affliction; nor of the divine displeasure, or any fearful sense and apprehension of it; nor of toil and labour, called the burden and heat of the day, from all which they will be now free.</p>
