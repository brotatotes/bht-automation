<p><strong>Of the tribe of Manasses [were] sealed twelve thousand</strong>; this word signifies "forgetting", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+41:51">Genesis 41:51</span>; and shows that the followers of Christ should forget the things that are behind, their sinful lusts and pleasures, the onions and garlic in Egypt, and their former company and acquaintance, their own people, and their father's house, and all their labours and sufferings for the sake of Christ.</p>
