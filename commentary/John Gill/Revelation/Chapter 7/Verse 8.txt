<p><strong>Of the tribe of Zabulon [were] sealed twelve thousand</strong>,.... Which signifies "dwelling", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+30:20">Genesis 30:20</span>; and was the tribe in which Christ had his dwelling, and where he much conversed; and may denote his gracious inhabitation, as well as that of God the Father, md of the Spirit, among the saints and sealed ones.</p>
<p><strong>Of the tribe of Joseph [were] sealed twelve thousand</strong>; whose name signifies "adding", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+30:24">Genesis 30:24</span>; and may intend the additions both of numbers, and of gifts and graces to the churches of those times.</p>
<p><strong>Of the tribe of Benjamin [were] sealed twelve thousand</strong>; this word signifies "the Son of the right hand", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+35:18">Genesis 35:18</span>; showing, that these sealed ones are as a signet on God's right hand, and are as near and dear unto him as a man's right hand is to him; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+80:17">Psalms 80:17</span>. Now twelve thousand out of each tribe make just the number of a hundred forty and four thousand, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:4">Revelation 7:4</span>; the tribe of Dan is not mentioned, it may be because of the apostasy of that tribe, one of Jeroboam's golden calves being set up there; showing that God had no sealed ones of that sort, and instead of him Levi is reckoned; though that tribe had no part in the division of the land of Israel, yet had a part in Christ, and is therefore mentioned in this mystical account. Nor is the name of Ephraim used, it may be for the same reason; there having been a great defection in that tribe from the pure worship of God, and instead of him the name of Joseph appears.</p>
