<p>INTRODUCTION TO REVELATION 8</p>
<p>This chapter contains the opening of the seventh seal, and the things that followed on it, and particularly the sounding of the first four trumpets. Upon the opening of the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for half an hour, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:1">Revelation 8:1</span>; then follows a vision of seven angels, who stood before God, and had seven trumpets given to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:2">Revelation 8:2</span>; then of another angel, described by his position, standing at the altar; by his having a golden censer, and by much incense being given him, the end of which was to offer up the prayers of all saints, which with it went up to God, and were acceptable to him; and by filling his censer with the fire of the altar, and casting it to the earth; the effects of which were voices, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:3">Revelation 8:3</span>, after which the seven angels prepare to sound their trumpets, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:6">Revelation 8:6</span>; the first blows his, which brings hail and fire, mingled with blood, upon the earth, which burns up the third part of trees and all green grass, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:7">Revelation 8:7</span>; the second blows, upon which a burning mountain is cast into the sea, and a third part of it becomes blood, a third part of the creatures in it die, and a third part of the ships upon it are destroyed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:8">Revelation 8:8</span>; the third angel blows; upon which a star, like a burning lamp, falls upon the third part of rivers and fountains, whose name is Wormwood, and embitters them, so that many men die of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:10">Revelation 8:10</span>; the fourth angel blows, and the third part of the sun, moon, and stars, is smitten, and becomes dark, so that there is no light for a third part of the day and night, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:12">Revelation 8:12</span>; and the chapter is concluded with the vision of another angel flying through the midst of heaven, proclaiming three times woe to the inhabitants of the earth, on account of what would be uttered by the three following angels, who were yet to blow their trumpets, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13">Revelation 8:13</span>. </p>
