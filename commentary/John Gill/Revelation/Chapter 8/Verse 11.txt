<p><strong>And the name of the star is called Wormwood</strong>,.... Because of the bitter afflictions, sorrows, and distresses which it was the instrument of; just as Naomi called herself Mara, because the Almighty had dealt bitterly with her, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ru+1:20">Ruth 1:20</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and the third part of the waters became wormwood</strong>; that is, the inhabitants of the provinces and cities belonging to the Roman empire were afflicted with grievous and bitter afflictions and calamities; so great distresses are called wormwood, and waters of gall given to drink, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+9:15">Jeremiah 9:15</span>;</p>
<p><strong>and many men died of the waters, because they were bitter</strong>; through the barbarities and cruelties of these savage people, who afflicted the empire: there seems to be an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:23">Exodus 15:23</span>.</p>
