<p><strong>And I saw the seven angels</strong>,.... Not the seven spirits of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>; their names, as well as their office, differ; nor the ministers of the word, though these are often called angels in this book, and blow the trumpet of the Gospel, and lift up their voice like a trumpet; but the angelic spirits, and these either evil ones, since they are the executioners of wrath and vengeance, and bring judgments on the earth; and who, are sometimes said to stand before God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:21">1 Kings 22:21</span>; or rather good angels, who are sometimes ministers of divine wrath; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+24:16">2 Samuel 24:16</span>; "seven" of them are mentioned, as being a proper number for the blowing of the seven trumpets, which would complete all the woes that were to come upon the world, and in allusion to the seven princes the eastern monarchs used to have continually about them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="es+1:14">Esther 1:14</span>, as it follows:</p>
<p><strong>which stood before God</strong>; and denotes their nearness to him, and familiarity with him, they always behold his face; and their service and ministrations, and their readiness to execute his will: the allusion is to the two priests standing at the table of fat, with two silver trumpets in their hands, with which they blew, and another struck the cymbal, and the Levites sung, which was always done at the time of the daily sacrifice p:</p>
<p><strong>and to them were given seven trumpets</strong>: everyone had one; and which were an emblem of those wars, and desolations, and calamities, which would come upon the empire, and upon the world, at the blowing of each of them; the trumpet being an alarm, preparing for, proclaiming, and introducing these things; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+4:19">Jeremiah 4:19</span>; these are said to be given them; either by him that sat upon the throne, about which they were; or by the Lamb that opened the seal; and shows that they did nothing but what they had a commission and order to do. Here is manifestly an allusion to the priests and Levites blowing their trumpets at the close of the daily sacrifice, and at the offering of incense q as before observed.</p>
