<p><strong>and cast [it] into the earth</strong>: the Roman empire: by "fire" some understand the Spirit of God, and his gifts and graces, which sat upon the apostles as cloven tongues of fire on the day of Pentecost; and which they suppose were now plentifully bestowed on the ministers of the word, to enlighten them, inspire them with zeal, and abundantly fit them for the work of the ministry, in consequence of Christ's mediation and intercession: and others think the Gospel is intended, which is sometimes compared to fire, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+20:9">Jeremiah 20:9</span>, or else those contentions and quarrels which, through the corruptions of men, arise on account of the Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:49">Luke 12:49</span>; though rather by fire here are meant the judgments of God, and his wrath and fury poured forth like fire upon the Roman empire, now become Christian; and so was an emblem of those calamities coming upon it at the sounding of the trumpets; and shows that as Christ prays and intercedes for his, own people, for their comfort and safety, so he will bring down, his judgments upon his and their enemies; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+10:2">Ezekiel 10:2</span>; and the Targum on it:</p>
