<p><strong>And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea</strong>,.... The fishes; by whom men are meant, the inhabitants of the Roman empire; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eze+29:4">Ezekiel 29:4</span>, where by fish the Targum understands mighty princes and governors:</p>
<p><strong>and had life, died</strong>; were put to death by these savage and barbarous people, who killed all they met with, men, women, and children, young and old, rich and poor, high and low:</p>
<p><strong>and the third part of the ships were destroyed</strong>; by which may be designed either the cities and towns within such a part of the Roman jurisdiction, which were burnt or plundered by them; or their goods and effects, which they pillaged, and carried off the wealth and riches of the people, even all their substance, as Austin p and Jerom q, who lived in those times, affirm.</p>
