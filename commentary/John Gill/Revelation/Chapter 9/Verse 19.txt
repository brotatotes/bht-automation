<p><strong>For their power is in their mouth</strong>,.... In what proceeded out of their mouth, or seethed to do so; in their guns, and what came out of them:</p>
<p><strong>and in their tails</strong>; which may design their foot soldiers, which were as the tail to their horse, and who sometimes did great service; or their way of fighting when they fled, by casting up arrows into the air, which would fall upon the heads and horses of those that pursued them; or their ambushments, by which they destroyed many; or their perfidious violation of treaties; or it may be their tails may intend the doctrine of Mahomet, the false prophet, who is the tail, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:15">Isaiah 9:15</span>,</p>
<p><strong>for their tails [were] like unto serpents</strong>; crooked, crafty, poisonous, and, pernicious:</p>
<p><strong>and had heads</strong>; every tail had a head to it; which may be understood of the officers of the foot soldiers, or of the priests and teachers of the Mahometan religion:</p>
<p><strong>and with them they do hurt</strong>; with their guns, the power in their mouth, they did hurt to the bodies of men; and with their false doctrines, their tails, they did hurt to the souls of men; the Ethiopic version here adds, "five months"; which seems to be taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:10">Revelation 9:10</span>.</p>
