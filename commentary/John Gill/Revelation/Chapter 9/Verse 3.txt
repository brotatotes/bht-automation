<p><strong>And there came out of the smoke locusts the earth</strong>,.... Not literally, for these locusts might not meddle with the grass, nor any green thing, or tree, as locusts do, only men, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:4">Revelation 9:4</span>; and had a king over them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:11">Revelation 9:11</span>; which locusts have not, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+30:27">Proverbs 30:27</span>, though the allusion is to such, which spawn and breed in pits, and may be properly said to come out of them; hence in the Hebrew tongue they are called גבי, from גבא, "a pit", or "ditch": nor are devils intended, though they may be compared to locusts for their original, hell, or the bottomless pit; and for their numbers, we read of a legion of them in one man; and for their hurtful and mischievous nature: nor are the Goths and Vandals designed; these, though they harassed some parts of the eastern empire, yet chiefly the western; besides, they appeared under the former trumpets: but these are to be understood of the western and eastern locusts, especially the latter. The western locusts are the clergy of the church of Rome, cardinals, bishops, priests, monks, and friars, of every order; these were not instituted by Christ, but rose out of the bottomless pit, from the antichristian smoke of councils, decrees, and traditions; and are fitly compared to locusts for their number, which have been almost as the sand of the sea innumerable, and have spread themselves all over the nations of the earth, that have gone by the name of Christendom; and for their devouring nature, living in plenty and idleness, upon the fat of the land, in the best commons, glutting themselves with the spoils of others, devouring widows' houses, and impoverishing countries and kingdoms wherever they come. The eastern locusts are the Saracens, and who are chiefly designed; and who were to harass and distress the eastern empire, and prepare for its ruin, which is brought on under the next trumpet by the Turks. These are fitly signified by locusts, because the locusts generally come out of the eastern parts: it was an east wind which brought the plague of locusts into Egypt, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+10:13">Exodus 10:13</span>; and the children of the east, the Arabians, are compared to grasshoppers, or locusts, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+7:12">Judges 7:12</span>; and one of the names of a locust is ארבה, "Arbeh", not much unlike in sound to an Arab. To which may be added, that it is a tradition of the Arabians, that there fell locusts into the hands of Mahomet, on whose backs and wings were written these words;</p>
<p>"we are the army of the most high God; we are the ninety and nine eggs, and if the hundred should be made perfect, we should consume the whole world, and whatever is in it.''</p>
<p>And it was a law established by Mahomet, ye shall not kill the locusts, for they are the army of the most high God; and the Mahometans fancy that the locusts were made of the same clay as Adam was: and besides the tradition before mentioned, they say, that as Mahomet sat at table a locust fell, with these words on its back and wings;</p>
<p>"I am God, neither is there any Lord of the locusts besides me, who feed them; and when I please I send them to be food to the people, and when I please I send them to be a scourge unto them;''</p>
<p>hence his Saracens may well go by this name. Now these Saracens sprung up in the times of antichristian darkness, both Papal and Mahometan, and may be said to come out of the smoke of the bottomless pit; and the religion of Mahomet, which they embraced, was no other; and like locusts they were innumerable, they went in troops and bands, as locusts do, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="pr+30:27">Proverbs 30:27</span>; pillaging and ravaging all they could and their sudden and frequent incursions, the desolations and ravages which they made in the eastern empire, are very aptly expressed by the running to and fro of locusts; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+33:4">Isaiah 33:4</span>.</p>
<p><strong>And unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power</strong>; that is, to torment then, by striking them with their stings in their tails, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:5">Revelation 9:5</span>. These are called "scorpions of the earth", to distinguish them from sea scorpions, which are a kind of fish: so Aristotle d and e Pliny speak of terrestrial scorpions, which are the most hurtful; these are of the serpentine kind have an innocent and harmless look, but are soon angry; have stings in their tails, which they are always striking with, that they may miss no opportunity of doing mischief, and with which they strike in an oblique way f; and which very fitly describes the Saracens, the race of the Ishmaelites, a generation of vipers, a subtle and treacherous sort of people, very furious and wrathful, and who lived by continual robbing and plundering of others at an unawares: and this may be applied to the western locusts, the monks and friars, who are the seed of the serpent; and who by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple, have a form of godliness, and speak lies in hypocrisy, and lie in wait to deceive; and being provoked, are full of wrath and anger, and strike very hard with their anathemas and excommunications, and other sorts of punishment, which they have power to inflict.</p>
