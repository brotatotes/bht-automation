<p><strong>And in those days men shall seek death</strong>,.... Or desire to die, as Job did:</p>
<p><strong>and shall not find it</strong>; or shall not die:</p>
<p><strong>and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them</strong>; death will be preferred to a miserable life; it will be chosen rather than life, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+8:3">Jeremiah 8:3</span>. The ravages of the Saracens, their incursions, and the invasions by them, struck such terror into the inhabitants of divers parts of the empire, that they made death more eligible to them than life.</p>
