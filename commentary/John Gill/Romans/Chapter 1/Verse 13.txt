<p><strong>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren</strong>,.... The apostle calls them brethren, because many of them were Jews, his brethren and kinsmen according to the flesh, and all of them were his brethren in a spiritual relation; and this he does to express his affection to them, and engage their attention and credit to him, and particularly to this matter which he now acquaints them with, being unwilling they should be ignorant of it;</p>
<p><strong>that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you</strong>: it was not a sudden start of mind, or a desire that lately arose up in him, but a settled resolution and determination, and which he had often made:</p>
<p><strong>but was let hitherto</strong>; either by God, who had work for him to do in other places; or by Satan, who sometimes by divine permission has had such power and influence; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:18">1 Thessalonians 2:18</span>, or through the urgent necessities of other churches, which required his stay with them longer than he intended: his end in taking up at several times such a resolution of coming to them was, says he,</p>
<p><strong>that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles</strong>: by fruit he means, not any reward of his labour, either temporal or eternal; but the conversion of sinners, the edification of saints, and the fruitfulness of believers in grace and works. The apostle seems to allude to the casting of seed into the earth: Christ's ministers' are husbandmen, who sow the seed of the word, which lies some time under the clods; wherefore patience is necessary to wait its springing up, first in the blade, and then in the ear, then in the full corn in the ear, when it brings forth fruit; all which depend on the blessing of God: and when he adds, "as among other Gentiles", his design is not so much to let them know that they were as other Gentiles, upon a level with them, had no pre-eminence as citizens of Rome, over other saints, being all one in Christ Jesus; as to observe to them his success in other places, where he had been preaching the Gospel of the grace of God.</p>
