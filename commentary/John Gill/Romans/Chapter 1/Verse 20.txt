<p><strong>For the invisible things of him</strong>,.... Not the angels, the invisible inhabitants of heaven: nor the unseen glories of another world; nor the decrees of God; nor the persons in the Godhead; but the perfections of God, or his "properties", as the Arabic version reads it; and which are explained by "his eternal power and Godhead": these,</p>
<p><strong>from the creation of the world are clearly seen</strong>; this is no new discovery, but what men have had, and might, by the light of nature, have enjoyed ever since the world was created; these</p>
<p><strong>being understood</strong>, in an intellectual way, by the discursive faculty of the understanding,</p>
<p><strong>by the things that are made</strong>; the various works of creation; all which proclaim the being, unity, and perfections of God their Creator,</p>
<p><strong>so that they are without excuse</strong>; the very Heathens, who have only the light of nature, and are destitute of a revelation, have no colour or pretext for their idolatrous practices, and vicious lives; nor have they, nor will they have anything to object to God's righteous judgment against them, or why they should not be condemned.</p>
