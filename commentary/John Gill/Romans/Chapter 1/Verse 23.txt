<p><strong>And changed the glory of the incorruptible God</strong>,.... God is incorruptible and immortal in his nature, and so is opposed to all corruptible creatures and things: he has a glory which is essential to him, and a manifestative one in the creatures, and which is relative, and of right belongs to him: his absolute essential glory cannot be changed, cannot be taken away from him, nor given to another; but his relative glory may be said to be changed, when another is worshipped in his stead, and called by his name. So Philo the Jew g speaks of</p>
<p>"some, who, leaving the true God, make to themselves false ones, and impose the name of the eternal and incorruptible upon created and corruptible beings.''</p>
<p><strong>Into an image made like to corruptible man</strong>; which was worshipped in different forms by the several nations of the world:</p>
<p><strong>and to birds</strong>; as the dove by the Samaritans, the hawk, the ibis, and others by the Egyptians:</p>
<p><strong>and fourfooted beasts</strong>; as the ox, and other creatures:</p>
<p><strong>and creeping things</strong>; such as beetles, serpents, and others, by the same.</p>
