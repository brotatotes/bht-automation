<p><strong>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections</strong>,.... Because of their idolatrous practices, God left them to very dishonourable actions, sodomitical ones, both among the men and women:</p>
<p><strong>for even the women did change the natural use into that which is against nature</strong>; either by prostituting themselves to, and complying with the "sodomitical" embraces of men, in a way that is against nature h; or by making use of such ways and methods with themselves, or other women, to gratify their lusts, which were never designed by nature for such an use: of these vicious women, and their practices, Seneca i speaks, when he says,</p>
<p>"libidine veto nec maribus quidem cedunt, pati natae; Dii illas Deoeque, male perdant; adeo perversum commentae, genus impudicitiae, viros ineunt:''</p>
<p>also Clemens Alexandrinus k has respect to such, saying,</p>
<p>"gunaikev andrizontai para fusin, gamou men ai te kai</p>
<p>γαμουσαι γυναικες.'</p>
<p>and such there were among the Jews, whom they call חמסוללות זו בזו</p>
<p>נשים l, and whom the priests were forbidden to marry.</p>
