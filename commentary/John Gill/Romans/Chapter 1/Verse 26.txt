For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections,.... Because of their idolatrous practices, God left them to very dishonourable actions, sodomitical ones, both among the men and women:for even the women did change the natural use into that which is against nature; either by prostituting themselves to, and complying with the "sodomitical" embraces of men, in a way that is against nature h; or by making use of such ways and methods with themselves, or other women, to gratify their lusts, which were never designed by nature for such an use: of these vicious women, and their practices, Seneca i speaks, when he says,"libidine veto nec maribus quidem cedunt, pati natae; Dii illas Deoeque, male perdant; adeo perversum commentae, genus impudicitiae, viros ineunt:''also Clemens Alexandrinus k has respect to such, saying,"gunaikev andrizontai para fusin, gamou men ai te kaiγαμουσαι γυναικες.'and such there were among the Jews, whom they call חמסוללות זו בזונשים l, and whom the priests were forbidden to marry.h Vid.
