<p><strong>And likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the women</strong>,.... The very sin of "sodomy" is here designed, so called from Sodom, the place where we first hear of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:5">Genesis 19:5</span>, the men of which place, because they</p>
<p><strong>burned in their lust one towards another</strong>, as these Gentiles are said to do, God rained upon them fire and brimstone from heaven: an exceeding great sin this is, contrary to nature, dishonourable to human nature, and scandalous to a people and nation among whom it prevails, as it did very much in the Gentile world, and among their greatest philosophers; even those that were most noted for moral virtue are charged with it, as Socrates, Plato, Zeno, and others m: it is a sin which generally prevails where idolatry and infidelity do, as among the Pagans of old, and among the Papists and Mahometans now; and never was it so rife in this nation as since the schemes of deism and infidelity have found such a reception among us. Thus God, because men dishonour him with their evil principles and practices, leaves them to reproach their own nature, and dishonour their own bodies:</p>
<p><strong>men with men working that which is unseemly</strong>; and of which nothing like it is to be observed in the brutal world:</p>
<p><strong>receiving in themselves the recompence of their error, which was meet</strong>: God punishes sin with sin; for as the Jews say n, as</p>
<p>"one commandment draws on another, so one transgression draws on another; for the reward of the commandment is the commandment, ושכר עבירה עבירה and the reward of transgression is transgression.''</p>
