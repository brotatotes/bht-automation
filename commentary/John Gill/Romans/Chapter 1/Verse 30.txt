<p><strong>Backbiters</strong>,.... Who more publicly defamed the characters of their neighbours, and hurt their good name, credit and reputation, though behind their backs:</p>
<p><strong>haters of God</strong>; some read it, "hated of God"; as all workers of iniquity are; but rather this expresses their sin, that they were deniers of the being and providence of God, and showed themselves to be enemies to him by their evil works:</p>
<p><strong>despiteful</strong>; both by opprobrious words, and injurious actions:</p>
<p><strong>proud</strong>; of their natural knowledge, learning, eloquence and vain philosophy:</p>
<p><strong>boasters</strong>: of their parts, abilities, wisdom and works; all which they attributed to themselves, and to the sharpness of their wit, their sagacity and industry:</p>
<p><strong>inventors of evil things</strong>; of evil schemes of morality and philosophy, and of evil practices, as well as principles:</p>
<p><strong>disobedient to parents</strong>; which was acting contrary to the light of nature.</p>
