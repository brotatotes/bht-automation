Backbiters,.... Who more publicly defamed the characters of their neighbours, and hurt their good name, credit and reputation, though behind their backs:haters of God; some read it, "hated of God"; as all workers of iniquity are; but rather this expresses their sin, that they were deniers of the being and providence of God, and showed themselves to be enemies to him by their evil works:despiteful; both by opprobrious words, and injurious actions:proud; of their natural knowledge, learning, eloquence and vain philosophy:boasters: of their parts, abilities, wisdom and works; all which they attributed to themselves, and to the sharpness of their wit, their sagacity and industry:inventors of evil things; of evil schemes of morality and philosophy, and of evil practices, as well as principles:disobedient to parents; which was acting contrary to the light of nature.
