<p><strong>Without understanding</strong>,.... Of God, of his nature and worship, of things divine and even moral, being given up to a reprobate mind:</p>
<p><strong>covenant breakers</strong>; had no regard to private or public contracts:</p>
<p><strong>without natural affection</strong>; to their parents, children, relations and friends:</p>
<p><strong>implacable</strong>; when once offended there was no reconciling of them:</p>
<p><strong>unmerciful</strong>; had no pity and compassion to persons in distress.</p>
