<p><strong>For the Scripture saith</strong>,.... Of this form of expression, or mode of speaking, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. The passage referred to is</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>, cited before in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span>; the view with which it is produced is to prove the certain connection between faith and righteousness, and confession and salvation; or in other words, to observe that such who cordially believe in Christ, and make a sincere profession of their faith in him, shall be saved. There are some things somewhat different from, though agreeing in sense with, the words as they stand in the prophet; there it is indefinitely said, "he that believeth", here an universal is made use of,</p>
<p><strong>whosoever</strong>, or "everyone"</p>
<p><strong>that believeth</strong>: which phrases are equipollent, and a certain truth it is, that whosoever believes in Christ, whether Jew or Gentile, be he who he will, shall surely be saved: here the object believed in, is expressed</p>
<p><strong>in him</strong>, which is there implied, and may easily be understood of the stone laid in Zion for a foundation, which is Christ; for other foundation can no man lay, and whoever by faith builds on this foundation is safe:</p>
<p><strong>and shall not be ashamed</strong>; neither in this world, nor in that to come; in the Hebrew text it is, "shall not make haste"; how this may be reconciled, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33- :">Romans 9:33- :</span>,</p>
