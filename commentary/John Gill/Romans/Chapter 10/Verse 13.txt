<p><strong>For whosoever shall call upon the name the Lord</strong>,.... This testimony is taken out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:32">Joel 2:32</span> and is brought to prove the truth of what the apostle had just suggested, that all that call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, will find him rich and plenteous in mercy, and ready to dispense his grace and salvation to them: such</p>
<p><strong>shall be saved</strong>; be they who they will, whether Jews or Gentiles; not with a temporal salvation only, but with a spiritual and eternal one; for the words of the prophet refer to Gospel times, as the context shows, and is cited and applied thereunto by the Apostle Peter, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:16">Acts 2:16</span>; besides, the deliverance and salvation Joel speaks of, is of a "remnant whom the Lord shall call", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:32">Joel 2:32</span>; and designs the remnant according to the election of grace, whether among Jews or Gentiles, whom God calls by his efficacious grace; between which call and eternal glory, there is a certain and inseparable connection.</p>
