<p><strong>But to Israel he saith</strong>,.... Or against Israel, or concerning Israel he saith in the same prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:2">Isaiah 65:2</span>.</p>
<p><strong>All day long I have stretched forth my hands, unto a disobedient and gainsaying people</strong>: very rightly does the apostle apply these words to Israel, as he does the former to the Gentiles; and just in like manner does the above mentioned Jewish writer, R. Moses the priest, interpret them. The Lord's "stretching out [his] hands all the day long" to them, designs the ministry of the prophets one after another to them, the preaching of John the Baptist, of Christ and his apostles among them: but they were a stiffnecked and rebellious people, uncircumcised in heart and ears; would have none of his counsel, and despised his reproof; contradicted and blasphemed the word; rejected the Messiah and his Gospel; killed the Prince of life, and persecuted his apostles; so that it was just with God to write a "Lo-ammi", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ho+1:9">Hosea 1:9</span>, upon them, and cast them off; and, to pave the way for the account of the rejection of these people in the next chapter, is all this said, and these testimonies produced.</p>
