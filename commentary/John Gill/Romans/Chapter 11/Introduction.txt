<p>INTRODUCTION TO ROMANS 11</p>
<p>The apostle having spoken of the calling of the Gentiles, and given a hint of the perverseness of the Jews in slighting the Gospel, proceeds in this chapter to treat of their rejection; in which he shows, that it was not universal, though of the greater part in his time; and which he confirms by some passages out of the Old Testament, and then points at the end and design of God in the casting them off; and exhorts the Gentiles not to insult them, but to learn to be humble and cautious by what was done to them; and foretells the conversion of the Jews in the latter day, which will be general, so that their rejection is not final; and resolves the whole dispensation of God, both with respect to Jews and Gentiles, into the unsearchable wisdom and sovereign will of God: he begins with an objection he saw would be made upon what he had said, concerning the calling of the Gentiles, and the unbelief of the Jews, that then God had wholly cast off his people, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:1">Romans 11:1</span>, to which he answers with a "God forbid", by way of detestation; and by instancing in himself, who was of the people of the Jews, and yet was called; and by distinguishing between some and others among them: there were some who were foreknown, loved, and chosen of God from everlasting: these were not cast off, but others who were not foreknown, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:2">Romans 11:2</span>, and then he illustrates the present case of the Jews by observing how it was with them in the times of Elias; who though he complained of their apostasy and cruelty, and imagined that there were none left but himself that worshipped the true God, yet there were then seven thousand, which were preserved from the idolatry of Baal, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:2">Romans 11:2</span>, and so the apostle observes it was now,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:5">Romans 11:5</span>, there was a small number whom God of his free grace had chosen, and reserved for himself, and so were not all cast away, as the objection suggested; and having called this choice an election of grace, he argues the contrariety and inconsistency of grace and works in this affair, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:6">Romans 11:6</span>, and since it appeared that there were two sorts of people among them, one that were chosen and the other not, hence it was, that though Israel did not obtain the righteousness they sought for, yet they that were chosen obtained it, and so were not cast away, when the rest were, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:7">Romans 11:7</span>, and that so it should be, or that this should be the case of the greater part of the Jews, that they should be given up to blindness and hardness of heart, the apostle proves by some testimonies of Isaiah and David, which he produces,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:8">Romans 11:8</span>, hence follows an objection, that if this be the case, then God had appointed them to stumble, that they might fall even all of them, and always continue fallen; to which the apostle answers with a "God forbid", as usual, when anything is objected which is abhorred; and by observing the view, event, and order of things; showing, that the fall of the Jews issued in the salvation of the Gentiles; and the salvation of the Gentiles was to provoke the Jews to seek the same mercy, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:11">Romans 11:11</span>, and then follows an improvement and illustration of this end, or event of their fall, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:12">Romans 11:12</span>, that if the fall and lessening of the Jews were the means of enriching the Gentiles with the riches of Christ and his grace, what a glory must be brought to them, when they should all of them be converted and join them! and that the rejection of the Jews was neither total nor final, the apostle argues from his office, even as an apostle of the Gentiles, whom he addresses as such, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:13">Romans 11:13</span>, and from his view and end in executing that office, which was to provoke the Jews to emulate the Gentiles, and so save some of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:14">Romans 11:14</span>, and then he repeats in other words, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:15">Romans 11:15</span>, the argument he had used in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:12">Romans 11:12</span>, and proves the future conversion of the Jews, from the instances of conversion and sanctification, which had been, and were then among them; which were as the firstfruits to the lump, and the root to the branches; and were pledges and tokens of a general conversion and sanctification of them hereafter, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:16">Romans 11:16</span>, and by occasion of the metaphor of the root and branches before used, he expresses the rejection of the Jews, by the breaking off some of the branches, and the reception of the Gentiles by their ingrafting into a Gospel church state among the converted Jews, enjoying the same privileges with them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:17">Romans 11:17</span>, and since they were originally of a wild olive tree, and merely of grace partook of the root and fatness of the good olive of the Gospel church state, as consisting first of the Jews, they ought not to be haughty and insolent, and boast and brag over the Jews, since they were beholden to them, and not the Jews to them,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:18">Romans 11:18</span>, and whereas an objection might be made, that the Jews were cast out, to make room for the Gentiles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:19">Romans 11:19</span>, and therefore the one must be more deserving than the other; the apostle replies to it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:20">Romans 11:20</span> by granting, that the one were broken off, or rejected, that the other might be ingrafted, or taken in but then as it was owing to unbelief in the Jews that they were cast off, in which the Gentiles were before conversion as well as they, so it was by faith they stood in their church relation, which was the gift of God, and owing to his grace; so that their ingrafting and continuance in a Gospel church state were not the effect of merit in them; wherefore he gives them this good advice, not to be proud and lifted up with their privileges, as though they were of their own deserving, but to fear the Lord and his goodness, from whence they sprung; and suggests, that they should be so far from making such an use of the rejection of the Jews, that it ought rather to engage them to caution, care, and fear; for they were the natural branches in the olive tree, and if these were not spared when behaving disagreeably, they must not expect to fare otherwise, who were originally of the wild olive tree, should they act unworthy of the privileges they enjoyed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:21">Romans 11:21</span>, wherefore the apostle recommends to their serious consideration the severity of God in the casting off of the Jews, and his goodness in taking in them, the Gentiles; and threatens them with cutting off, should they slight, neglect, or misuse the goodness of God to them in his house and ordinances, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:22">Romans 11:22</span>, and on the other hand, an intimation is given, that the Jews, though broken off shall be grafted in again, should their unbelief discontinue, and faith in Christ be given them, which was not impossible with God; he is able both to remove their unbelief, give them faith, and reinstate them in a church relation,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:23">Romans 11:23</span>, and as it is without doubt he can do it, it looks very likely that he will; which may be argued from the ingrafting of the Gentiles, who were like the olive tree, wild by nature; were cut out from thence, and, contrary to nature, grafted into the good olive tree; wherefore by an argument from the lesser to the greater, much more may it be thought, that the Jews, the natural branches, will, in God's own time, be grafted in their former church state, some of their ancestors were in, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:24">Romans 11:24</span>, yea, the apostle argues the certainty of their conversion, and reinstatement into the Gospel church, from the design of Providence in suffering blindness in part to happen to them; which was not intended always to continue, only until all the elect of God are gathered in among the Gentiles; and this mystery of Providence and grace, he thought fit to acquaint the Gentiles with, lest they should be conceited of themselves, as if they only shared the favour of God, and were deserving of it, to the contempt of the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:25">Romans 11:25</span>, Moreover, the apostle affirms that all Israel shall be saved,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:26">Romans 11:26</span>, which is consequentially deduced from what he had said, and which he proves by a passage, out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:20">Isaiah 59:20</span>, and by its being a principal part of the covenant, which God has made with them, which he will not break, but shall be fulfilled; when he shall make them sensible of their sins, and take them away by the application of his pardoning grace, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:27">Romans 11:27</span>, and whereas the implacable enmity of the Jews to Christ and his Gospel might be objected to such a gracious procedure of God towards them, the apostle removes the objection, by granting that they were enemies to the Gospel on account of the Gentiles, to whom it was preached; but then there was a chosen people among them, who were beloved of God; which would be made manifest, because of the oath and promise made unto their their fathers, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:28">Romans 11:28</span>, wherefore as the purposes, promises, and covenant of God are immutable, so the gifts of his grace, and the calling of his people included in them, are things certain and irrevocable, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:29">Romans 11:29</span>, and so the calling of the Jews, and the gifts of his grace designed for them, which is another proof of their calling and conversion; and which is further argued, and made both more probable and certain, by comparing the case of the Jews and Gentiles together; as for the Gentiles, they were formerly infidels and obtained mercy, through the unbelief of the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:30">Romans 11:30</span>, wherefore arguing from the less probable to that which is more so, the Jews, though for the present unbelievers, yet it may be thought, that through the mercy the Gentiles had received, they would some time or other be provoked to seek for, and so obtain the same mercy,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:31">Romans 11:31</span>, and the rather this may be given into and received, not only because they both have been in a state of unbelief, but the end and design of God in concluding them in it, were to have mercy on each of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:32">Romans 11:32</span>, which dispensation of God both to one and to the other by turns, in different ways, was so amazing and unaccountable to the apostle, that he breaks out into admiration at the wisdom and knowledge of God: which were so abundant, that they could not be searched out, conceived of, and expressed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:33">Romans 11:33</span>, the reasons of which lay in his own breast, and are only known to himself no one having known his mind, or been his counsellor, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:34">Romans 11:34</span>, nor is he obliged to give an account of his matters, and the reasons of his proceedings, to any of his creatures; he is not indebted to them for anything, nor does he any injustice to any of them, by whatsoever steps he takes in Providence and grace; let that appear, and recompense will be made, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:35">Romans 11:35</span>, everything must be resolved into his sovereign will and pleasure, and so this of choosing some, and leaving others, of rejecting the Jews, and receiving the Gentiles, and also that of calling the Jews again; as it is reasonable everything should, since all things are from him, through him, and to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36">Romans 11:36</span>, and so all glory is due unto him, and here ends the doctrinal part of this epistle. </p>
