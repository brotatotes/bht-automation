<p><strong>For this is my covenant unto them</strong>,.... This is what God has promised to them in covenant, and he will be as good as his word; his covenant will never be broken, it will always remain sure and inviolable; so that there is not only a possibility, and a probability, but even a certainty, of the call and conversion of the Jews; which promise and covenant will have their accomplishment,</p>
<p><strong>when I</strong>, saith the Lord,</p>
<p><strong>shall take away their sins</strong>: some think that the apostle alludes to</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:34">Jeremiah 31:34</span>; others, that he takes this passage out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+27:9">Isaiah 27:9</span>; where in the Septuagint version the selfsame phrase is used; though it may be no citation, or reference, but the apostle's own words, explaining what is meant by "turning away ungodliness from Jacob",</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:26">Romans 11:26</span>; and as before; regards not the taking away of their sins by the sacrifice of Christ, which is done already, and is what the blood of bulls and goats could not do; but of the removing of their sins from themselves, from their consciences, by the application of the blood of Christ, and the imputation of his righteousness.</p>
