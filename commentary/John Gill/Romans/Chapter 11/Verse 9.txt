<p><strong>And David saith</strong>,.... That is, Christ by the mouth of David, or David in the person of Christ; for the psalm out of which the following words are taken is a prophecy of the Messiah, as appears from some passages cited out of it in the New Testament, and applied to Christ; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:4">Romans 11:4</span> with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:25">John 15:25</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:9">Romans 11:9</span> with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:17">John 2:17</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:21">Romans 11:21</span> with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:28">John 19:28</span>; and what are here cited are not so much imprecations, as predictions of what should befall the Jews, by way of recompense for their ill usage of the Messiah, in giving him gall for meat, and vinegar for drink,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:34">Matthew 27:34</span>:</p>
<p><strong>let their table be made a snare, and a trap and a stumbling block</strong>. By their "table" may be meant, the altar; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mal+1:7">Malachi 1:7</span>; and the sacrifices offered up upon it, their meat offerings and drink offerings, and all others; likewise the laws concerning the difference of meats, and indeed the whole ceremonial law may be intended, which lay in meats and drinks, and such like things: now the Jews placing their justifying righteousness before God, in the observance of these rites and ceremonies, and imagining that by these sacrifices their sins were really expiated and atoned for, they neglected and submitted not to the righteousness of Christ, but went about to establish their own; so that that which should have led them to Christ, became an handwriting of ordinances against them, and rendered Christ of no effect to them: moreover, the sacred writings, which are full of spiritual food and divine refreshment, the prophecies of the Old Testament, which clearly pointed out Christ, not being understood, but misapplied by them, proved a trap, a snare, and a stumbling block to them; so that they rejected the true Messiah, which issued in their utter ruin and destruction: yea, the preaching of the Gospel, the salutary truths and wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ, were a stumbling block to the Jews, nay, even the savour of death unto death. Though these words may be literally understood of their table mercies, the necessary provisions of life, their common food and drink, of which they had great scarcity in their last wars; so that they not only by wicked methods stole it from one another, but ate what was forbidden by their law, and what was abhorrent to nature, as one is said to eat her own child; nor is it to be overlooked what is suggested by some, that the passover may be meant by their "table"; which was their grand yearly feast, and which they were eating s when they were surrounded and taken by the Roman army, like birds in a net, or beasts in a trap: and all this as</p>
<p><strong>a recompense to them</strong>; a just judgment upon them, by way of retaliation for their ill treatment of Christ when on the cross, giving him gall and vinegar for his meat and drink.</p>
<p>s Josephus de Bello Jud. l. 6. c. 9.</p>
