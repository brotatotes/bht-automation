<p><strong>If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably</strong>,.... Or be at peace, seek after peace, pursue it, and cultivate it:</p>
<p><strong>with all men</strong>; with those that we are immediately concerned with, in a natural relation; so husbands should live peaceably with their wives, and wives with their husbands; parents with their children, and children with their parents; masters with their servants, and servants with their masters; and one brother, relation, and friend, with another: and so with all we are concerned with in a spiritual relation, as members of Christ, and in the same church state; such should be at peace among themselves, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:13">1 Thessalonians 5:13</span>; peace should rule in their hearts, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:15">Colossians 3:15</span>, and they should study to keep "the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:3">Ephesians 4:3</span>: yea, with all we are concerned in a civil sense; saints should live peaceably in the neighbourhood, towns, cities, and countries, where they dwell, and show themselves to be the quiet in the land; should pray for the peace of the place where they are; and do all that in them lies to promote it, by living themselves peaceably and quietly, in all godliness and honesty; yea, they should live peaceably with their very enemies, "if it be possible"; which is rightly put, for there are some persons of such tempers and dispositions, that it is impossible to live peaceably with; for when others are for peace, they are for war; and in some cases it is not only impracticable, but would be unlawful; as when it cannot be done consistent with holiness of life and conversation, with the edification of others, the truths of the Gospel, the interest of religion, and the glory of God; these are things that are never to be sacrificed for the sake of peace with men: the apostle adds another limitation of this rule, "as much as lieth in you"; for more than this is not required of us; nothing should be wanting on our parts; every step should be taken to cultivate and maintain peace; the blame should lie wholly on the other side; it becomes the saints to live peaceably themselves, if others will not with them.</p>
