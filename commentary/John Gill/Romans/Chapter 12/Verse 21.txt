<p><strong>Be not overcome of evil</strong>,.... Neither of the evil one, Satan, who is very busy to stir up the corruption of nature to an hatred of enemies, and to seek revenge; but give no place nor heed unto him, resist him, and he will flee from you, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:7">James 4:7</span>; "put on the whole armour of God", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:11">Ephesians 6:11</span>, whereby you may defend yourselves, that he cannot touch you: nor of the evil of sin that dwells in you; "for whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:19">2 Peter 2:19</span>; nor of the evil of the man that has done you an injury, as you will be, if you return evil for evil, or take any steps and measures to avenge yourselves; for then not you, but he that has done you the wrong, will be the conqueror:</p>
<p><strong>but overcome evil with good</strong>; overcome the evil man, and the evil he has done you, by doing good to him, by feeding him when hungry, by giving him drink when thirsty, by clothing him when naked, and by doing other offices of kindness and humanity to him; which is most likely to win upon him, and of an enemy to make him your friend: and if not, however it will show that you are conquerors, yea, "more than conquerors", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:37">Romans 8:37</span>, through the grace and strength of him that has loved you, over Satan, over the corruptions of your own hearts, and over the malice and wickedness of your enemies.</p>
