<p><strong>Or ministry, [let us wait] on our ministry</strong>,.... The word</p>
<p>διακονια sometimes signifies the whole ecclesiastical ministry, even the office of apostleship, as well as the ordinary ministration of the Gospel; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:17">Acts 1:17</span>; but here "deaconship", or the office of ministering to the poor saints, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>, being a distinct office from prophesying: or preaching the word, and should be used, exercised, and attended to with diligence, care, and constancy; for such who are appointed to this office, are chosen not only to a place of honour, but of service and business, in which they should behave with prudence, sobriety, and humility:</p>
<p><strong>or he that teacheth, on teaching</strong>. The gift of prophesying or preaching is subdivided into "teaching" and "exhorting"; the one belongs to "teachers" or doctors, the other to "pastors"; as the distinction is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>, not that different officers and offices are intended, but different branches of the same office; and one man's talent may lie more in the one, and another man's in the other; and accordingly each should in his preaching attend to the gift which is most peculiar to him: if his gift lies in teaching, let him constantly employ himself in that with all sobriety and "teaching" does not design an office in the school, but in the church; it is not teaching divinity as men teach logic, rhetoric, and other arts and sciences, in the schools; but an instructing of churches and the members thereof in the doctrines of the Gospel, in order to establish and build them up in their most holy faith; see</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>; it chiefly lies in a doctrinal way of preaching, in opening, explaining, and defending the doctrines of Christ, as distinct from the practical part of the ministry of the word, and the administration of ordinances, in which the pastor is employed as well as in this.</p>
