Love worketh no ill to his neighbour,.... That is, the man that truly loves his neighbour, will contrive no ill against him, nor do any to him; he will not injure his person, nor defile his bed, nor deprive or defraud him of his substance; or do hurt to his character, bear false testimony against him, or covet with an evil covetousness anything that is his; but, on the contrary, will do him all the good he is capable of:therefore love is the fulfilling of the law: so far as a man loves his neighbour, he acts agreeably to the law, and the particular precepts of it above mentioned: what the apostle says of love to the neighbour, the Jews frequently say of love to God;"he that loveth God (they say d) מקיים עשר אמירן, "hath fulfilled the decalogue", both above and below.''And again e,"there is no service like the love of God, R. Abba saith it is כללא דאורייתא, "the sum of the law"; for the ten words of the law הכא אתכלילו, "are herein comprehended", or "fulfilled":''and elsewhere f they observe,"that כל התורה כלולה באהבה, "the whole law is comprehended", or fulfilled "in love".''d Zohar in Deut. fol. 111. 3. e Zohar in Deut. fol. 113. 1. f Moses Kotsensis Mitzvot Tora, praecept. affirm. 3. prope finem.
