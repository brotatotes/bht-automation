<p><strong>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour</strong>,.... That is, the man that truly loves his neighbour, will contrive no ill against him, nor do any to him; he will not injure his person, nor defile his bed, nor deprive or defraud him of his substance; or do hurt to his character, bear false testimony against him, or covet with an evil covetousness anything that is his; but, on the contrary, will do him all the good he is capable of:</p>
<p><strong>therefore love is the fulfilling of the law</strong>: so far as a man loves his neighbour, he acts agreeably to the law, and the particular precepts of it above mentioned: what the apostle says of love to the neighbour, the Jews frequently say of love to God;</p>
<p>"he that loveth God (they say d) מקיים עשר אמירן, "hath fulfilled the decalogue", both above and below.''</p>
<p>And again e,</p>
<p>"there is no service like the love of God, R. Abba saith it is כללא דאורייתא, "the sum of the law"; for the ten words of the law הכא אתכלילו, "are herein comprehended", or "fulfilled":''</p>
<p>and elsewhere f they observe,</p>
<p>"that כל התורה כלולה באהבה, "the whole law is comprehended", or fulfilled "in love".''</p>
