Let us walk honestly as in the day,.... Being under the day of the Gospel dispensation, and the day of grace having dawned, and the daystar of spiritual light and knowledge being risen in our hearts, and we being exposed to the view of all men in broad daylight, ought not to lie down and sleep, but to arise and be active, and walk decently with the armour of light on us, as becomes the Gospel of Christ; not naked and unclothed, which would expose us and the Gospel to shame and contempt:not in rioting; the Syriac and Arabic versions read, "in singing", or "songs"; meaning lewd ones, sung at riotous feasts and banquets, made not for refreshment, but for pleasure and debauchery, what the Romans i call "comessations"; feasts after supper in the night season, and design all sorts of nocturnal revels: "Comus", the word here used, is with the Heathens the god of feasts, perhaps the same with "Chemosh", the god of the Moabites, 1 Kings 11:33.And drunkenness; which always attended such unseasonable and immoderate festivals:not in chambering; in unlawful copulations, fornication, adultery, and all the defilements of the bed:and wantonness; lasciviousness, unnatural lusts, as sodomy, c.not in strife and envying contention and quarrels, which are usually the consequences of luxury and uncleanness.i Seutonius in Vita Vitell. c. 13.
