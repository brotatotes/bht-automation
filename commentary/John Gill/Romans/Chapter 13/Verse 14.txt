<p><strong>But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ</strong>,.... As a man puts on his clothes when he rises in the morning: the righteousness of Christ is compared to a garment, it is the best robe, it is fine linen, clean and white, and change of raiment; which being put on by the Father's gracious act of imputation, covers the sins and deformities of his people, defends them from divine justice, secures them from wrath to come, and renders them beautiful and acceptable in his sight: which righteousness being revealed from faith to faith, is received by faith, and made use of as a proper dress to appear in before God; and may be daily said to be put on by the believer, as often as he makes use of it, and pleads it with God as his justifying righteousness, which should be continually: moreover, to put on Christ, and which indeed seems to be the true sense of the phrase here, is not only to exercise faith on him as the Lord our righteousness, and to make a profession of his name, but to imitate him in the exercise of grace and discharge of duty; to walk as he walked, and as we have him for an example, in love, meekness, patience, humility, and holiness:</p>
<p><strong>and make not provision for the flesh</strong>; the body: not but that due care is to be taken of it, both for food and clothing; and for its health, and the continuance and preservation of it by all lawful methods; but not so as</p>
<p><strong>to fulfil the lusts thereof</strong>; to indulge and gratify them, by luxury and uncleanness: it is a saying of Hillell k, מרבה בשר מרבה רמה "he that increases flesh, increases worms"; the sense his commentators l give of it is, that</p>
<p>"he that increases by eating and drinking, until he becomes fat and fleshy, increases for himself worms in the grave:''</p>
<p>the design of the sentence is, that voluptuous men, who care for nothing else but the flesh, should consider, that ere long they will be a repast for worms: we should not provide, or be caterers for the flesh; and, by pampering it, stir up and satisfy its corrupt inclinations and desires.</p>
