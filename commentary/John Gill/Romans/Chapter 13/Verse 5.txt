<p><strong>Wherefore ye must needs be subject</strong>,.... To the higher powers, to the civil magistrates; there is a necessity of it, because magistracy is God's ordinance, it is for the good of men; and such that oppose it will severely smart for it: but subjection to it from Christians should be,</p>
<p><strong>not only for wrath</strong>; through fear of punishment, and for the sake of escaping it; either the wrath of men or of God, in this or the other world:</p>
<p><strong>but also for conscience sake</strong>: to keep conscience clear, to exercise a good one void of offence towards God and men; for natural reason, conscience itself, dictates that there ought to be such order among men, that civil government should take place, and ought to be submitted to.</p>
