<p>INTRODUCTION TO ROMANS 14</p>
<p>The apostle, having finished his exhortations to duties of a moral and civil kind, proceeds to the consideration of things indifferent, about eating some sorts of meats, and keeping days; to which he might be led by the last clause of the preceding chapter, lest that should be interpreted as referring to those who used their Christian liberty in eating every sort of food; in the use of which it was requisite to exercise that love which is the fulfilling of the law, he had so much pressed and recommended in the foregoing chapters. The church at Rome consisted both of Jews and Gentiles: and the former, though they believed in Christ, were not clear about the abrogation of the ceremonial law, and thought they ought still to observe the distinction of meats and days, which were made in it; the latter looked upon themselves under no manner of obligation to regard them; and even among thee Jews, some might have greater light and knowledge in these things than others, and used their Christian liberty, when others could not; and this occasioned great animosities and contentions among them; and some on account of these things were called strong, and others weak: and the chief view of the apostle in this chapter, is to give advice to each party how to behave one towards another; how the strong should behave to the weak, and the weak to the strong: and he begins with the strong, and in general exhorts them to a kind, tender, and affectionate regard to their weaker brethren, and not to perplex their minds with disputations about things to little profit, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1">Romans 14:1</span>, then a distribution of the members of this church into two parts is made,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:2">Romans 14:2</span>, showing the reason of the above exhortations; the one sort being strong believers, the others weak, the one eating all things, the other herbs; when some advice is given to each, that the strong should not despise the weak, nor the weak judge the strong; for which reasons are given: and the first is taken from the common interest they both have in the affection of God, and in divine adoption, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:3">Romans 14:3</span>, And another is taken from the relation which believers stand in to God, as servants; and therefore not to be judged and condemned, but to be left to their Lord and master, which is illustrated by a simile of such a relation among men, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:4">Romans 14:4</span>, and then another instance of different sentiments about Jewish rites and ceremonies is given, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:5">Romans 14:5</span>, respecting the observation of days, in which also the members of the church were divided, some observing them, and some not; and the apostle's advice is, that every man should act as he was persuaded in his own mind, and not be uneasy with another: the reason for which he gives, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:6">Romans 14:6</span>, because the end proposed by the one, and the other, is the honour and glory of God, and which is the same in the man that eats, or does not eat meat, since both give thanks to God. And this is further confirmed from the general end of the Christian's life and death likewise, which is not to himself, but to the Lord,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:7">Romans 14:7</span>, from whence it is concluded, that they are the Lord's in life and death, and all their actions are devoted to him; who by dying, rising, and living again, appears to be the Lord of quick and dead, and will judge both, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:9">Romans 14:9</span>, and therefore to his judgment things should be left, and one should not condemn or despise another, since all must stand at his bar, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:10">Romans 14:10</span>, which is proved</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:11">Romans 14:11</span>, from a passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:23">Isaiah 45:23</span>, from all which it is concluded, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:12">Romans 14:12</span>, that an account must be given by everyone to God, at the general judgment; wherefore it is right and best, not to judge and condemn one another, but to judge this to be the most reasonable and agreeable to Christian charity, that care be taken not to offend, or cause a brother to stumble, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:13">Romans 14:13</span>, and whereas it might be objected, that nothing was impure in itself, and therefore might be lawfully eaten, which the apostle allows, and as for himself, was fully persuaded of, yet it was impure to them who thought it so,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:14">Romans 14:14</span>, and therefore should not eat; nor should others, when it gave offence to such persons; and which is dissuaded from, because to eat to the grief of the brethren, is contrary to Christian charity; and because it destroys the peace of such persons, and they are such whom Christ has died for, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:15">Romans 14:15</span>, besides, hereby reproach might be brought upon them, the Gospel they professed, and the truth of Christian liberty they used, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:16">Romans 14:16</span>, and moreover, the kingdom of God did not lie in the use of these things, but in spiritual ones,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>, and which should be chiefly regarded, since the service of God in them, is what is grateful to him, and approved by all good men, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:18">Romans 14:18</span>, wherefore the things which make for peace and edification should be followed after, things much preferable to meats and drinks, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:19">Romans 14:19</span>, for the sake of which the peace of a brother, which is the work of God, should not be destroyed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:20">Romans 14:20</span>, for though all things are pure in themselves, and lawful to be eaten, yet it is an evil to eat them to the offence of another, and for another to eat them against his conscience, which he may be drawn into by the example of others; wherefore it is best to abstain from eating flesh or drinking wine, and everything else that is stumbling and offensive to a weak brother, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:21">Romans 14:21</span>, and whereas the strong brother might object and say, I have faith in this matter, I believe it is lawful for me to eat anything, and why should I not? the apostle answers, by granting that he had faith, but then he observes, he ought to keep it to himself, and not disturb his weak brother, by putting it into practice openly; but should keep it to himself, it being his happiness not to condemn himself by using his liberty with offence,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:22">Romans 14:22</span>, and then some advice is given to the weak brother, not to eat with a doubting conscience, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</span>, because in so doing, he would be self-condemned, and because it would not be of faith, and therefore sinful. </p>
