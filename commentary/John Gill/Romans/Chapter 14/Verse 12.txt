<p><strong>So then everyone of us</strong>,.... this is the conclusion, drawn from the foregoing account of things, that there will be a general judgment, that Christ will be Judge, and all must appear at his bar; from whence it necessarily follows, that every man, and so every Christian, strong or weak, whatever may be his gifts, talents, and abilities,</p>
<p><strong>shall give an account of himself to God</strong>; that is, to Christ, who is God; which is another proof of his deity, for he will be the Judge, the Father will judge no man; it is before his judgment seat all shall stand; and therefore the account must be given to him by every one, of himself, and not another; of all his thoughts, words, and deeds, which will be all brought into judgment; and of his time and talents, how they have been spent and used; and of all his gifts of nature, providence, and grace, how they have been exercised for the glory of God, his own good, and the good of others: the formal manner in which this will be done is unknown unto us; however, this is certain, that the saints will have upon this reckoning, in what sort soever it may be, a full and open discharge, through the blood and righteousness of Christ. The Jews q, say, in much such language as the apostle does, that</p>
<p>"when a man removes out of this world, then חושבנא למאריה</p>
<p>יהיב, "he gives an account to his Lord", of all that he has done in the world.''</p>
<p>q Zohar in Gen. fol. 49. 3.</p>
