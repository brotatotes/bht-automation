<p><strong>And again he saith</strong>,.... God or Christ, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+32:43">Deuteronomy 32:43</span>;</p>
<p><strong>rejoice ye Gentiles with his people</strong>; which from the Hebrew text are by some rendered, "rejoice his people O ye Gentiles"; to which agree the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan, who render it, "praise O ye nations his people"; or as some copies of the former, "the judgment of his people"; and the latter adds, the house of Israel. The note of R. Sol. Jarchi on the text is,</p>
<p>"at that time the nations shall praise Israel; see what is the praise of this people that cleave unto the Lord, c.''</p>
<p>But the design of this song is to praise God, and not the people of Israel who in it are severely reproved for their many iniquities, and especially their very great ingratitude to God, and are threatened with the heaviest judgments. This is seen by other Jewish writers, who interpret the words accordingly, as R. Aben Ezra does, whose note is</p>
<p>"then shall they praise him, when God shall avenge their blood;''</p>
<p>and to this sense is the Jerusalem Targum,</p>
<p>"praise before him O ye people, praise him O his people of the house of Israel;''</p>
<p>but the words may be better translated either thus, "rejoice O ye nations, his people"; that is, ye Gentiles who are his people, whom God has taken into his covenant, and whom he will declare as such in his own time, which time was now come, and therefore had reason to rejoice; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>; or thus, "rejoice ye Gentiles, and his people"; let both Jews and Gentiles rejoice; let them rejoice together when they come to be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of the same promises and privileges; when they shall be together in one fold, under one shepherd; and especially when the fulness of each of them is brought in, and God has avenged himself of his and their enemies; and which agrees with the apostle's sense, and whose version is supported by the Septuagint interpreters; and his supplement is to be justified, there only wanting a copulative in the Hebrew text, which is often the case in that language, and which may easily be supplied by "and" or "with"; as it is with the latter by the apostle, in perfect agreement with the sense of the words.</p>
