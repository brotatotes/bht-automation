<p><strong>And I am sure when I come to you</strong>,.... He intended to go to Spain; he was not sure he should reach thither; but he was positive in it he should come to Rome. It had been much and long upon his mind; and under an impress of the Spirit of God upon him, he had signified some time before this, that after he had been at Jerusalem, he "must see, Rome also", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:21">Acts 19:21</span>, and it was afterwards more expressly told him by the Lord, that as he had testified of him at Jerusalem, he should bear witness at Rome also,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:11">Acts 23:11</span>, and therefore he was fully assured he should come to Rome, and was as confident of the manner of his coming thither.</p>
<p><strong>I shall come in</strong>, or "with"</p>
<p><strong>the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ</strong>; with the Gospel, the good news of salvation by Christ; and which must make him a welcome person to every sensible soul wherever he came; to this he was chosen, separated, and called; for this he was abundantly qualified; this was committed to his trust, and which he carried with him wherever he went: and he was not ashamed of it, and was ready to preach it even at Rome also. With "the Gospel of Christ"; not his own, or another's, or any man's, but Christ's, which he had by the revelation of Christ; of which Christ is the sum and substance, and which Christ himself preached; "with the blessing of the Gospel of Christ". Some by "blessing" understand a liberal contribution, which he trusted he should make at Rome, for the poor saints at Jerusalem; believing that their hearts would be opened, under the preaching of the Gospel, to give freely to them, and that this would be a blessing that would attend it: but rather he means, either the blessed gifts he had, qualifying him for preaching the Gospel, with which he should come and deliver it among them, and which would attend it with success; such as boldness of spirit, freedom of speech, enlarged knowledge, mighty signs and wonders, and the demonstration of the Spirit, and of power: or the blessed effects it would have on them, in establishing them in the present truths; in further enlightening and instructing their minds; in edifying, quickening, and comforting them; and in nourishing up with the words of faith and sound doctrine, unto eternal life: or the blessings of grace exhibited and set forth in the Gospel; such as justification and forgiveness of sins, peace and reconciliation, salvation and eternal life. Nay, he believed he should come in, or with the "fulness" of all this; meaning, either that he believed he should find them full of the Gospel, and the fruits of it; or rather that he should come full fraught with it, and fully preach it to them, and keep back thing that would be profitable. There is a fulness in the Gospel; it is full of the deep things of God, which the Spirit searches and reveals, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:10">1 Corinthians 2:10</span>; it is full of the doctrines of grace and truth, which Christ himself is said to be full of, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>: it is full of exceeding great and precious promises transcribed from Christ, and out of the covenant of grace; and it is full of a variety of food, of milk for babes, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:13">Hebrews 5:13</span>, and meat for strong persons, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:14">Hebrews 5:14</span>. The Alexandrian copy, and some others, read only, "with the fulness of the blessing of Christ"; and so the Ethiopic version.</p>
