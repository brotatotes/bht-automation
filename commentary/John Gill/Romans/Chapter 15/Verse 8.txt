<p><strong>Now I say</strong>,.... Or affirm that Christ has received both Jews and Gentiles: that he has received the Jews, and therefore they are not to be despised, though they are weak, appears from hence,</p>
<p><strong>that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision</strong>; he is rightly called a minister, for this was the end of his coming into the world, and the whole of his work in it was not to be ministered unto, but to minister to others, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>, both in life and at death. This character agrees with him in all his offices; as King he ministers judgment to the people; and as priest he is the minister of the true tabernacle of the human nature, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:2">Hebrews 8:2</span>, in which he offered himself a sacrifice for the sins of his people, and now in it makes intercession for them; but here it is expressive of his prophetic office, in which he is such a minister as never was before, or since, or ever will be; if we consider the dignity of his person, being the Son of God; the greatness of his qualifications, having the Spirit without measure; the nature of his doctrines, which were amazing words of grace and truth; and the manner of his delivery, which was with authority; and that all other ministers receive their mission, qualifications, doctrine and success from him: he is styled a minister of "the circumcision", not literally considered, as if he administered circumcision to any, which he did not; he was indeed subject to it as a son of Abraham, as a Jew by birth, as under the law, and in order to fulfil all righteousness, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:15">Matthew 3:15</span>, and to show that he was truly man, and that he had regard to the people and ordinances of the Old Testament, as he showed by baptism he had to those of the New, and to signify our cleansing and atonement by his blood; but circumcision is either to be understood in a spiritual sense of circumcision in the Spirit, and not in the flesh, with which the true circumcision, or believers in Christ, are circumcised in him, through his circumcision; or rather the word here is to be taken metonymically, for the uncircumcised Jews, as it often is in this epistle; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:26">Romans 2:26</span>. So that the meaning is, that Christ was their minister and preacher, just as Peter is said to have the apostleship of the circumcision, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:8">Galatians 2:8</span>, or to be the apostle of the Jews; as Paul was of the Gentiles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:13">Romans 11:13</span>, and to have the Gospel of the circumcision committed to him, it being his province to preach it to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:7">Galatians 2:7</span>, Christ as a minister or preacher in the personal discharge of his prophetic office, was sent only to the Jews; among them he lived, and to them he only preached; nor did he allow his apostles to preach to any other till after his resurrection; and which is a manifest proof that he received the Jews, and took them under his care, and showed a particular regard unto them: the ends of his being a minister to them were,</p>
<p><strong>for the truth of God</strong>; to preach the Gospel of salvation, the word of truth unto them, for which he was promised and sent; and in doing of which he declared the righteousness, faithfulness, loving kindness, and truth of God unto them:</p>
<p><strong>and to confirm the promises made unto the fathers</strong>; the fathers of the world, Adam, Noah, c. or rather the Jewish fathers, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and others concerning the Messiah's being the seed of the woman, and of Abraham, and of David; concerning the coming of Shiloh, the raising up of the great prophet among the Jews, &amp;c. all which promises are yea and amen in Christ, ratified and fulfilled in him.</p>
