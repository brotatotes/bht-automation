<p><strong>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</strong> This verse is placed by the Syriac at the end of the chapter, and is wanting in the Ethiopic version, and in one ancient copy, being, excepting the word all, the same as at the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:20">Romans 16:20</span>; but inasmuch as it is in all other copies, it ought to be repeated and stand here: the reason of the repetition may either be, because the former might be written by his amanuensis, and this with his own hand, as was usual with him in all his epistles, by which they might be known to be his, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>; or the apostle having so great an affection for this church, knew not how to take his leave of them, but repeats his valediction again and again, as here, and in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:20">Romans 16:20</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span> are placed in some copies, at the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:14">Romans 16:14</span>, and omitted here, as they are by the Arabic version, which begins thus, "to the only most wise God, Jesus Christ": and so considers the following doxology as be, longing to Christ, and to him as God, and as the only most wise God.</p>
