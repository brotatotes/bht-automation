<p><strong>But glory, honour, and peace</strong>,.... Which are so many words for the everlasting happiness of the saints; which is a "crown of glory that fadeth not away" (<span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span>); an honour exceeding that of the greatest potentates upon earth, since such that enjoy it will be kings and priests, and sit with Christ on his throne to all eternity; and is a peace that passes all understanding: all which will be rendered</p>
<p><strong>to every man that doth good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile</strong>; which none without Christ, and his grace, and by the strength of nature, does, or can do; not that good works are causes of salvation, but are testimonies of faith, and fruits of grace, with which salvation is connected, whether they be found in Jews or Gentiles; for neither grace nor salvation are peculiar to any nation, or set of people.</p>
