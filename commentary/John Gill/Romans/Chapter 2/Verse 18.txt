<p><strong>and approvest the things that are more excellent</strong>: or "triest the things that differ"; from one another, and from the will and law of God; or as the Syriac, "discernest" וליתא, "things that are convenient"; agreeable, which are fit and ought to be done: and having tried and discerned them, they approved of them in their judgment as the things more excellent; but then they did not put these excellent things in practice which they approved of; and the knowledge and approbation they had of these things, arose from their</p>
