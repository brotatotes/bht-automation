<p><strong>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature</strong>,.... That is, the Gentiles, who are by nature uncircumcised; for as circumcision was by the command of God, and performed by the art of men, uncircumcision is by nature, and what men naturally have. Now</p>
<p><strong>if it</strong>, such persons,</p>
<p><strong>fulfil the law</strong> in Christ, they will</p>
<p><strong>judge thee</strong>, the circumcision: and condemn, as Noah condemned the old world, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:7">Hebrews 11:7</span>, and the men of Nineveh and the queen of the south will condemn the men of that generation, in which Christ lived,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:41">Matthew 12:41</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Who by the letter and circumcision transgress the law</strong>; that is, either by the law, which is "the letter", and "by circumcision", or "by circumcision which is in the letter", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span>, sin being increased by the prohibitions of the moral law, and the rituals of the ceremonial law, and the more so by a dependence upon an obedience to either of them, or both, for justification.</p>
