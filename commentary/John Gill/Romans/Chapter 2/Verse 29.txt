<p><strong>But he is a Jew which is one inwardly</strong>,.... Who has an internal work of grace upon his soul: who has not only an outward name, but an inward nature; not the law of God in the hand, but in the heart; not an external righteousness only, but internal holiness; and who is not a mere outward court worshipper, but a worshipper of God in Spirit and in truth. The Jews have a e saying themselves,</p>
<p>"that whosoever denies idolatry, נקרא יהודי, "is called a Jew":''</p>
<p>so that, according to them, this is a name that is not confined to themselves, but belongs to all such who truly fear and worship God; and they say, in the same place, that Pharaoh's daughter was called</p>
<p>יהודית, "a Jewess", because she denied idolatry, and went down to wash herself from the idols of her father's house. And elsewhere f,</p>
<p>"that faith does not depend upon circumcision, but upon the heart: he that believes not as he should, circumcision does not make him a Jew; and he that believes as he ought, he indeed is a Jew, though he is not circumcised.''</p>
<p><strong>And circumcision is that of the heart</strong>; which God requires, and he himself promises to give, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+10:16">Deuteronomy 10:16</span>, upon which last passage, a very noted Jew g has this observation, זאת היא מלת הלב, "this is the circumcision of the heart"; the very phrase the apostle here uses: circumcision of the flesh was typical of this, which lies in a godly sorrow for sin, in a putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, and in renouncing a man's own righteousness in the business of justification. The ancient Jews had some notion of this typical use of circumcision. So Philo the Jew says h, that circumcision taught</p>
<p>ηδονων και παθων παντων εκτομην, "the cutting off of all pleasures and affections": and elsewhere he says i: it is a symbol of two things particularly; the one is the cutting off of pleasures, as before; and the other is the removal of arrogancy, that grievous disease of the soul: and in another place k he calls purity, or chastity, περιτομης περιτομην, "the circumcision of circumcision". Now this our apostle says is</p>
<p><strong>in the spirit</strong>; meaning either the spirit or soul of man, which is the seat and subject of it; or the Spirit of God, who is the author of it: the Ethiopic version reads it, "by the Holy Ghost":</p>
<p><strong>and not in the letter</strong>; or "by the letter" of the law; but the Holy Ghost produces this spiritual work instrumentally, by the preaching of the Gospel. To which the apostle adds,</p>
<p><strong>whose praise is not of men, but of God</strong>; referring not to circumcision immediately spoken of before, but to the Jew who is one inwardly: and alludes to the name Judah, from whence the Jews are called, which comes from the word ידה, which signifies to "praise"; and intimates here, that such persons must not expect praise from men, who are only taken, with outward things, but from God, who searches and knows the heart.</p>
