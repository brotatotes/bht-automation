<p><strong>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same</strong>,.... Some men may be so vain as to imagine, that though they do the same things which they condemn in others, they</p>
<p><strong>shall escape the judgment of God</strong>: but such will find themselves most sadly mistaken; there is no avoiding the general judgment; all men must come to it; there will be no eluding it through craftiness and deceit, through bribery and corruption; there will be no escaping condign punishment, through might in the criminal, or through the judge's ignorance of his crimes, or want of ability and power to punish.</p>
