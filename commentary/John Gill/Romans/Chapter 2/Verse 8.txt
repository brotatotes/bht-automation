<p><strong>But unto them that are contentious</strong>,.... This is a description of the other sort of persons to whom God will render according to their deeds, "who are of the contention"; who contend for victory, and not truth; strive about words to no profit; are quarrelsome, and sow discord among men, and in churches;</p>
<p><strong>and do not obey the truth</strong>; neither attend to the light of nature, and to that which may be known of God by it; nor regard and submit to the Gospel revelation and so design both the Gentiles, which knew not God, and Jews, and others, who obey not the Gospel:</p>
<p><strong>but obey unrighteousness</strong>; are servants of sin: to these God renders</p>
<p><strong>indignation and wrath</strong>; wrathful or fiery indignation, the hottest of his fury.</p>
