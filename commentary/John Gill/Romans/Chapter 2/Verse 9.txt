Tribulation and anguish,.... These, with the foregoing words, are expressive of the second death, the torments of hell, the worm that never dies, and the fire that is not quenched: which will fallupon every soul of man that doth evil; whose course of life and conversation is evil; for "the soul that sins shall die",Ezekiel 18:4, unless satisfaction is made for his sins by the blood of Christ:of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; regard being had to what nation they belong.
