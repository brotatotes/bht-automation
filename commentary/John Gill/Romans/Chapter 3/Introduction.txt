<p>INTRODUCTION TO ROMANS 3</p>
<p>In this chapter are an answer to several objections which follow one upon another, relating to what the apostle had said concerning the equality of the Gentiles with the Jews; and various proofs out of the Psalms and Prophets, showing the general depravity and corruption of mankind, of the Jews as well as of the Gentiles; and the conclusion from all this, that there is no justification by the works of the law, but by the righteousness of God received by faith, of which a large and clear account is given. The first objection is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:1">Romans 3:1</span>, and is taken from the unprofitableness of being a Jew and a circumcised person, if that is true which is asserted in the preceding chapter; to which an answer is given, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:2">Romans 3:2</span>, showing that though many things might be instanced in, in which the Jew had the advantage of the Gentile in external things; this might be mentioned as one for all, and taken sufficient answer, that the Jews had the oracles or word of God committed to their trust, by which they became acquainted with the will of God. The apostle foreseeing that another objection would arise upon this; what signifies their having the oracles of God, when these are not believed by them? prevents it by observing, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:3">Romans 3:3</span>, that though some did not believe, some did, and as for the unbelief of others, the truth and faithfulness of God in his word were not made void by it; however false and deceitful men are, God is always true to his word, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:4">Romans 3:4</span>, and which is confirmed by a passage of Scripture, cited out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:4">Psalms 51:4</span>, hence arises another objection, that if the righteousness of God is commended and illustrated by the unrighteousness of man, then it would be unjust in God to take vengeance on men for their sins, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:5">Romans 3:5</span>, which is removed with abhorrence, and answered by observing, that if there was any truth in it, the world could not be judged by God, as it certainly will, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:6">Romans 3:6</span>, but still the objection is continued and strengthened, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:7">Romans 3:7</span>, that if God is glorified through the sins of men, not only men ought not to be punished for them, but they should not be reckoned sinners, or as doers of evil things, but of good things, and be indulged in them; to which is replied, that this was the common calumny cast upon the doctrine of the apostle, and persons of such principles and practices are deserving of damnation, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:8">Romans 3:8</span>. Having removed these objections, the apostle reassumes his former assertion, and supports it, that a carnal circumcised Jew is no better than a carnal uncircumcised Gentile; it being already sufficiently made to appear, that they are both under the power and guilt of sin; and as a further evidence of it, he produces several passages out of the book of Psalms, and out of the prophecies of Isaiah, which fully express the sad corruption of human nature, and especially of the Jews; and this account begins in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:10">Romans 3:10</span>, and ends in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:18">Romans 3:18</span>, and which account he suggests, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:19">Romans 3:19</span>, carries in it such a full conviction of the truth of what he had said, that all men are under sin, that no one would be able to open his mouth in his own defence, but all must acknowledge themselves guilty before God: and then he proceeds to the conclusion he meant to draw from all this, that there is no justification of any before God by the deeds of the law; giving this as a reason for it, because the law discovered sin, but not a justifying righteousness, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20">Romans 3:20</span>, that is revealed in another way, by the Gospel, and not the law, though both law and prophets bear a testimony to it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:21">Romans 3:21</span>, which righteousness is described by the author of it, God; by the means through which it comes to the use and comfort of men, the faith of Christ; and by the subjects of it, them that believe; in the justification of which there is no difference, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:22">Romans 3:22</span>, of which a reason is given, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:23">Romans 3:23</span>, taken from the general state of men, as sinners, and bereaved of the image of God: the several causes, ways, means, and end of the justification of such persons are suggested; the moving cause is the free grace of God, the meritorious or procuring cause the redemption that is in Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24">Romans 3:24</span>, and his propitiatory sacrifice, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>, which is owing to the eternal purpose of God, whose end in it was to declare his purity, holiness, and justice; which end is repeated and enlarged on, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:26">Romans 3:26</span>, upon which the apostle asks, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:27">Romans 3:27</span>, what is become of boasting in the creature? and answers himself by saying, it was excluded, not by the doctrine of works, but by the doctrine of faith, and particularly the doctrine of justification by faith in the righteousness of Christ; wherefore the conclusion stands firm and just, from the premises, that justification is by faith without the works of the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:28">Romans 3:28</span>, and it is further confirmed, that Jews and Gentiles, with respect to their state and condition God-ward, are on a level; he is the God of the one, as well as of the other, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:29">Romans 3:29</span>, and this appears by his justifying both in one and the same way, through faith in the righteousness of this Son, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:30">Romans 3:30</span>, and the chapter is concluded by obviating an objection that might be made, that through this doctrine of justification by faith the law is made void, and is of no use, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:31">Romans 3:31</span>, to which the apostle answers, that this is so far from being fact, that the law is established by it. </p>
