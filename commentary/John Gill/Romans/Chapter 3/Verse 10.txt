<p><strong>As it is written, there is none righteous, no, not one.</strong> The several passages cited here, and in some following verses, are taken out of the Psalms and Isaiah; and are brought to prove, not only that the Jews are no better than the Gentiles, being equally corrupt and depraved as they; but also to show the corrupt state and condition of mankind in general: and the words are not always literally expressed, but the sense is attended to, as in this passage; for in the original text of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:1">Psalms 14:1</span>, it is, "there is none that doth good"; from whence the apostle rightly infers, "there is none righteous"; for he that does not do good, is not righteous; and therefore if there is none on earth that does good and does not sin, there is none righteous upon earth, "no, not one" single person. The Jews allegorizing that passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:31">Genesis 19:31</span>, "there is not a man in the earth to come into us", remark u on it thus,</p>
<p>"Urab qydu vya Nya, "there is not a righteous man in the earth"; and there is not a man that rules over his imagination.''</p>
<p>There is none righteous as Adam was, in a state of innocence; for all have sinned, and are filled with unrighteousness, and are enemies to righteousness; none are righteous by their obedience to the law of works; nor are there any righteous in the sight of God, upon the foot of their own righteousness, however they may appear in their own eyes, and in the sight of others; nor are any inherently righteous, for there is none without sin, sanctification is imperfect; nor is it, either in whole or in part, a saint's justifying righteousness; indeed there is none righteous, no, not one, but those who are justified by the righteousness of Christ imputed to them.</p>
