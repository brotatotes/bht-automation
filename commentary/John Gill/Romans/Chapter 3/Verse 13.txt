<p><strong>Their throat is an open sepulchre</strong>,.... The several vices of the instruments of speech are here, and in the following verse, exposed: "the throat" is said to "be an open sepulchre", as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+5:9">Psalms 5:9</span>, so called, for its voracity and insatiableness; both as an instrument of speech, for the words of the wicked are devouring ones; and as an instrument of swallowing, and so may denote the sinner's eager desire after sin, the delight and pleasure he takes in it, the abundance of it he takes in, and his insatiable greediness for it; likewise for its filthy stench, the communication of evil men being corrupt; and because, as by an open grave, persons may fall unawares to their hurt, so the evil communications of wicked men, as they corrupt good manners, are dangerous and hurtful: R. Aben Ezra explains it by</p>

<p><strong>the poison of asps is under their lips</strong>; or as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+140:3">Psalms 140:3</span>, "adders' poison is under their lips". The asp is but a small creature, and so is the tongue, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:5">James 3:5</span>, but there is a world of mischief in it, signified by poison; which, as that, is latent and secret, is under it; and as that stupefies and kills insensibly, so an evil tongue does, and that in a deadly and incurable manner: oftentimes the Jews speak of the evil imagination, or corruption of nature entering into persons, and operating in them, כארס בכעוס "as poison in an angry serpent" w.</p>
