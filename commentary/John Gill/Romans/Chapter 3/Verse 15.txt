<p><strong>Their feet are swift to shed blood.</strong> The sins of the heart and mouth are before described, and now the sins of action are taken notice of; for "the feet" are the instruments of motion and action: and when these are said to be "swift to shed blood", it denotes the readiness and eagerness of men, to murder innocent creatures; which shows the dreadful malice and hatred that is in them. The words are cited from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:7">Isaiah 59:7</span>, and seem to point at the times of Manasseh, who shed so much innocent blood, as to fill Jerusalem with it from one end to the other.</p>
