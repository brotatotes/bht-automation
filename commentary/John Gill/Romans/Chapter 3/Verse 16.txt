<p><strong>Destruction and misery are in their ways.</strong> This passage also is to be found in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:7">Isaiah 59:7</span>, and may be understood either actively thus: all the ways they take, and methods they pursue, are to make their fellow creatures miserable, to ruin and destroy them; or passively, that by their sinful ways and vicious course of life, they themselves are brought to destruction and misery: the way they are walking in is, "the broad way, that leadeth to destruction", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:13">Matthew 7:13</span>; the end of it, what it issues in, is eternal death, the destruction of the body and soul in hell, which will be attended with endless and inexpressible misery.</p>
