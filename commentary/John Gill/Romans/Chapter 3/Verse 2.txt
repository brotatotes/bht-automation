<p><strong>Much every way</strong>,.... The circumcised Jew has greatly the advantage of the uncircumcised Gentile, מכל פנים, "in all respects",</p>
<p>על כל צד, "on every side", as the Rabbins speak; phrases to which this in the text answers:</p>
<p><strong>chiefly</strong>; more especially, particularly, and in the first place;</p>
<p><strong>because that unto them were committed the oracles of God</strong>; by which are meant the law of Moses, and the writings of the prophets, the institutions of the ceremonial law, and the prophecies of the Messiah and the Gospel church state; and in a word, all the books of the Old Testament, and whatsoever is contained in them; which are called so, because they are of divine inspiration, contain the mind and will of God, and are infallible and authoritative: and it was the privilege and profit of the Jews that they were intrusted with them, when other nations were not, and so had the advantage of them; they had them for their own use; for hereby they had a more clear and distinct knowledge of God than the Gentiles could have by the light of nature; and besides, became acquainted with the doctrines of a trinity of persons in the Godhead, of the sonship and deity of the Messiah, of the sacrifice, satisfaction, and righteousness of the Redeemer, and of salvation by him; and also with the manner of worshipping of God according to his will; all which the Gentiles were ignorant of. Moreover, they had the honour of being the keepers of these sacred books, these divine oracles, and of transmitting them to posterity, for the use of others.</p>
