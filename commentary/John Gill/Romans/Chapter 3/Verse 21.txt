<p><strong>But now the righteousness of God</strong>,.... The apostle having proved that all men are unrighteous, and that no man can be justified in the sight of God by his obedience, either to the law of nature or of Moses, proceeds to give an account of that righteousness, which does justify before God; and so returns to his former subject, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>, concerning "the righteousness of God", the revelation of which he makes to be peculiar to the Gospel, as he does here; since he says, that it</p>
<p><strong>without the law is manifested</strong>: meaning, either that this righteousness is without the law, and the deeds of it, as performed by sinful men; or that the manifestation of it is without the law, either of nature or of Moses; for the law discovers sin, but not a righteousness which justifies from sin; it shows what righteousness is, but does not direct the sinner where there is one to be had, that will make him righteous in the sight of God: this is made known without the law, and only in the Gospel:</p>
<p><strong>being witnessed by the law and the prophets</strong>; a testimony is borne to the justifying righteousness of Christ both "by the law", particularly in the five books of Moses; which testify of Christ, of his obedience, sufferings, and death, by which he brought in life and righteousness; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>, compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="da+9:24">Daniel 9:24</span>; and</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:6">Genesis 15:6</span> with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:9">Romans 4:9</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:18">Genesis 22:18</span> with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:8">Galatians 3:8</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="de+30:11">Deuteronomy 30:11</span> with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:5">Romans 10:5</span>. And the prophets; Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, and others; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:21">Isaiah 42:21</span>.</p>
