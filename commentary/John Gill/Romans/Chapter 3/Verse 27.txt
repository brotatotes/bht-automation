<p><strong>Where is boasting then</strong>?.... There is no room nor reason for it, either in Jews or Gentiles: not in the Jews, who were very apt to boast of their being Abraham's seed; of their circumcision; of their being Israelites; of their having and keeping the law; of God being their God; and of their knowledge of him: nor in the Gentiles, who were ready to boast of their philosophy, wisdom, and learning; of their self-sufficiency, freewill, and of the things they had in their own power.</p>
<p><strong>It is excluded</strong>; it is shut out of doors; the key is turned upon it; it is not allowed of; it is entirely exploded:</p>
<p><strong>by what law? of works? nay</strong>; for, that establishes boasting when men seek life, righteousness, and salvation by the works of it, and fancy they shall be able to attain them this way:</p>
<p><strong>but by the law of faith</strong>: not by a law requiring faith; nor as if the Gospel was a law, a new law, a remedial law, a law of milder terms; but the word "law" here answers to the Hebrew word תורה, which signifies any "doctrine" or "instruction", and oftentimes the doctrine of the Gospel, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:3">Isaiah 2:3</span>, and here particularly, the doctrine of a sinner's justification by faith in the righteousness of Christ; according to which doctrine the most unlikely persons are justified, even ungodly persons, the worst and vilest of sinners; and that without any consideration of works, by faith only, which is freely given them; and by faith in Christ's righteousness only: so that there is not the least room for boasting in the creature, but all their boasting is in Christ, who is made unto them righteousness, and by whom they are justified.</p>
