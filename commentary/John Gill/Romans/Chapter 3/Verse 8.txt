<p><strong>And not rather, as we be slanderously reported</strong>,.... These are the apostle's own words, in answer to the objector he represented; and it is as if he should say, why do not you go on? why do you stop here? "and not rather" say, as we are evil spoken of, and our doctrine is blasphemed:</p>
<p><strong>and as some affirm</strong>; ignorantly and audaciously enough:</p>
<p><strong>that we say</strong>; and teach:</p>
<p><strong>let us do evil that good may come</strong>; a slander cast upon the apostle's doctrine of unconditional election, free justification, and of God's overruling the sins of men for good; and is the same which is cast on ours now, and is no small proof of the likeness and sameness of doctrines:</p>
<p><strong>whose damnation is just</strong>; whose judgment would have been right, and their censure of our doctrines just, had it been true that we held such a principle, taught such a doctrine, or encouraged such a practice: or their condemnation is just, for aspersing our principles and practices in so vile a manner; and all such persons are deserving of damnation, who teach such things, or practise after this sort.</p>
