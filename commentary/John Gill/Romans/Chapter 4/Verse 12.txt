<p><strong>And the father of circumcision</strong>,.... So the Jews call Abraham ראש הנימולים l, "the head of those that are circumcised"; and ראש למולים m, "the head to them that are circumcised"; but the apostle here says, he is a father</p>
<p><strong>to them who are not of the circumcision only</strong>; not to the Jews only, in a spiritual sense, and not to all of them, since some were "of Israel", who were not Israel, not Israelites indeed, or true believers;</p>
<p><strong>but [to such] also [who] walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had, being yet uncircumcised</strong>; that is, who have the same faith he had; imitate and follow him in the exercise of faith; walk by faith, as he did when he was uncircumcised, as they are; and so the Jews say n,</p>
<p>"Abraham is the father of all, באים אחריו באמונתו, "that go after him in his faith".''</p>
