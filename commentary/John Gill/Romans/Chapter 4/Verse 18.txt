<p><strong>Who against hope believed in hope</strong>,.... Abraham believed the promise of God,</p>
<p><strong>that he might become the father of many nations</strong>, being assisted by a supernatural aid: "in hope"; of the fulfilment of it by the grace and power of God: "against hope": against all visible, rational grounds of hope; Sarah's womb and his own body being dead, but inasmuch as God had said it, he believed:</p>
<p><strong>according to that which is spoken, so shall thy seed be</strong>; his faith rested upon the word of God, which showed the nature of it, and that it was of the right kind.</p>
