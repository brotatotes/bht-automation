He staggered not at the promise of God,.... There is no reason to stagger at, or hesitate about any of the promises of God, since they are made by him that cannot lie; his faithfulness is engaged to perform them; with him all things are possible; every promise is in Christ, yea and amen, and never did any fail; and yet so it is, that some of God's children,through unbelief, do stagger at the promises of God; thinking either that they are too great for them, or demur upon them through difficulties which attend them:but so did not Abraham, hewas strong in faith; nothing moved him, no difficulties discouraged him, he made no demur upon the promise, nor had the least hesitation in his mind about the accomplishment of it; but was fully assured that so it would be, as God had said; and thus he wasgiving glory to God; ascribing to him the glory of his veracity, faithfulness, power, grace, and goodness, as all such who are strong in faith do; such persons bring the most glory to God, and are the most comfortable in their own souls. This phrase, לאתתקפא במהימנותא, "to be strong" or strengthened, or strengthen themselves "in faith", is to be met with in Jewish writings u, and is particularly used of the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; all the tribes of Israel are not said to be חזקים באמונתם, "strong in their faith"; only the tribe of Levi, when Moses stood in the gate and said, "who is on the Lord's side, let him come unto me", Exodus 32:26: whoever is חזק באמונתו, "strong in his faith" w; and there were none in all Israel but the tribe of Levi, who were "strong in their faith".u Zohar in Gen. fol. 83. 4. w Tzeror Hammor, fol. 87. 4.
