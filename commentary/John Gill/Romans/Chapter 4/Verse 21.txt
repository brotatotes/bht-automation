<p><strong>And being fully persuaded</strong>,.... He had not only faith, a strong faith, but full assurance of faith:</p>
<p><strong>that what he [God] had promised</strong>; though it was so long ago, and there were so many difficulties in the way;</p>
<p><strong>he was able</strong>, being the Lord God Almighty,</p>
<p><strong>to perform</strong>; so his faith rested upon the power of God, with whom nothing is impossible.</p>
