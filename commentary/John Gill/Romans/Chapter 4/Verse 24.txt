<p><strong>But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed</strong>,.... What was written in the books of the Old Testament, was not written merely on account of them who are the subjects thereof, but for the use, learning, instruction and profit of saints under the New Testament dispensation; and particularly this concerning the pulsation of Abraham's faith for righteousness, or of the imputation of the righteousness of faith unto him for justification; which was not Abraham's faith, but that "righteousness" which his faith looked to, and laid hold on: see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:12">Romans 4:12</span>; for Abraham's faith itself could never be reckoned for righteousness to another, nor indeed was it to himself; but such as believe as Abraham did, they have the same righteousness imputed to them as he had; and truly of the same kind is the faith of Abraham, who believed in "God that quickeneth the dead", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:17">Romans 4:17</span>; and that of ours:</p>
<p><strong>if</strong>, or "seeing"</p>
<p><strong>we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead</strong>; which descriptive of the faith of New Testament believers, and of the object of it; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:9">Romans 10:9</span>; and which object of faith is further described in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span>.</p>
