<p><strong>And not as [it was] by one that sinned, [so is] the gift</strong>,.... The apostle goes on with the dissimilitude between the effects of Adam's sin, and Christ's righteousness:</p>
<p><strong>for the judgment was by one to condemnation</strong>; by "judgment" is meant, not the judgment of God, or the judiciary sentence pronounced by God on Adam and his posterity for sin; but the guilt of the one man's sin, which is imputed to all men to condemnation, on account of which the sentence of condemnation passed on all men; the law transgressed, became a ministration of condemnation to them:</p>
<p><strong>but the free gift is of many offences unto justification</strong>; the righteousness of Christ, which stands opposed to the guilt of Adam's sin, being imputed to all his offspring, is to the justification of them; and that not only from the guilt of that particular offence, but from many other offences, even all their actual sins and transgressions, of every sort; which is another instance of the exuberance, or abounding of the grace of God, in the righteousness of Christ, not only over the sin of the one man, but also over the sins of many, even all the elect of God; for the last clause may be also thus rendered, "the free gift is of the offences of many, unto justification".</p>
