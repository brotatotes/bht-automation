<p><strong>For if by one man's offence death reigned by one</strong>,.... It may be rendered, "by one offence death reigned by one"; for it was the single sin of Adam, the first sin that was committed by him, which gave death its reigning power over the sons of men:</p>
<p>"Adam, say f the Jewish doctors, transgressed,</p>
<p>על פקודא חד דאורייתא, one commandment of the law,''</p>
<p>and was the cause of death to himself, and to all the world. These words are a repetition, with a further explanation, of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span>; there it is said, "through the offence of one many be dead"; here "by one man's offence", or "by one offence, death reigned by one"; in which death is represented as a mighty monarch, a powerful king; and designs not only corporeal death, which has mounted the throne by sin, and is supported in its dominion by an ordinance of heaven; but also a moral or spiritual death, which has seized on all mankind, and reigns in every power and faculty of the soul of man; and likewise an eternal one, which will have power over all those, who have no part in the first resurrection: in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span>, "the grace of God, and the gift by grace", are said to "abound unto many"; here they are said to</p>
<p><strong>receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness</strong>: by abundance of grace is designed, either something distinct from the justifying righteousness of Christ; such as the abundant grace and mercy of God, in regeneration and conversion; the various graces of the Spirit then implanted; the many things then wrought in the heart; the large discoveries! of pardoning grace, and the abundance of the love of God shed abroad in the soul by the Spirit: or rather the same with "the gift of righteousness", because of the large display of the grace of God in it; by which "righteousness" is meant, not righteousness or holiness infused into us; but the righteousness of Christ, which is a free grace gift, and is enjoyed in a way of receiving; which denotes the act of faith, and supposes giving; and hence there is no room for boasting, but great reason for thankfulness: now such persons who have received this abundant grace and free gift,</p>
<p><strong>shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ</strong>; in corporeal life, they are not now subject to death as a penal evil, as other persons are, and though they die this death, they will triumph over it in the resurrection morn, they will rise again to everlasting life; they reign now in spiritual life over sin, Satan, and the world; and they will reign in eternal life, they will sit on thrones, wear crowns, and possess a kingdom of glory for ever and ever; and all by and through one, Jesus Christ, and not on account of any works, or merits of theirs.</p>
