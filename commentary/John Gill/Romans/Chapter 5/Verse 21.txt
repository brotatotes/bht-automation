<p><strong>That as sin hath reigned unto death</strong>,.... This is another end of the law's entrance, or rather an illustration of the grace of God, by comparing the reigns of sin and grace together: sin has such a power over man in a state of nature, as amounts to a dominion; it has not only an enticing, ensnaring power, to draw into a compliance with it, and an obstructive power to hinder that which is good, and an operative one of that which is evil, and a captivating, enslaving one to the same; but it has a kingly, governing, and commanding power: its dominion is universal as to men, and with respect both to the members of the body, and faculties of the soul; it is supported by laws, which are its lusts; and has its voluntary subjects, to whom it gives wages; its reign is very cruel and tyrannical; it is "unto death" corporeal, moral, or spiritual, and eternal. The ancient Jews often represent sin in the same light; they frequently speak h of יצר הרע שולט, "the corruption of nature reigning" over men; and say i: that he is מלך "a king" over the several members of the body, which answer to him at the word of command. "The old and foolish king" in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ec+4:13">Ecclesiastes 4:13</span>, is commonly interpreted by them of sin; which they say k is called "a king", because he rules in the world, over the children of men, and because all hearken to him: it is a petition much used by them l,</p>
<p>"let not the evil imagination or corruption of nature "rule" over me:''</p>
<p>and on the other hand, they represent grace, or a principle of goodness, as a king, reigning over the corruption of nature; thus interpreting these words, "my son, fear thou the Lord and the king", they ask m,</p>
<p>"who is the king? the king (say they) המלך יצר טוב, is "the good imagination", or principle of goodness, who reigns over the evil imagination, which is called a king.''</p>
<p>And in another place n they say of a good man, that he המליך יצר טוב, "caused the good imagination to reign" over the evil one; with which in some measure agrees what follows:</p>
<p><strong>even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord</strong>; by grace is meant, either grace as it is in the heart of God; which reigns or bears sway in man's salvation in all the parts of it, "through righteousness"; consistent with the justice of God, in a way in which that is glorified, through the redemption of Christ: it reigns "unto eternal life"; grace has promised, prepared it, and makes meet for it, and will introduce into it, and freely give it: it reigns "by Jesus Christ"; grace reigns by him, righteousness, or justice, is glorified by him, and eternal life is in him, through him, and by him: or grace as it is in the hearts of converted persons, is meant where it reigns, has the dominion, is the governing principle, and that in a way of righteousness and true holiness; and will reign until it is perfected in glory, or is crowned with eternal life; all which are by Jesus Christ, namely, grace, righteousness, and life.</p>
