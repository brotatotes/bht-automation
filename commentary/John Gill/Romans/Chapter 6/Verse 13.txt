<p><strong>Neither yield ye your members</strong>,.... The apostle more fully explains what he means by obeying sin in the lusts thereof; a presenting, or making use of the "members, as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin": by their "members" he means the several powers and faculties of the soul, and so the Ethiopic version renders it, "your souls"; or the several parts of the body, or both; by "yielding", or presenting of them, is designed the employment of them in the service of sin,</p>
<p><strong>as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin</strong>: that is, as means of performing unrighteous actions, in obedience to sin, or the corruption of nature with its lusts: the word translated "instruments", signifies "arms" or "weapons": so the ancients w formerly reckoned weapons the members of soldiers; and here the apostle calls the members weapons, which he would not have the saints use in favour of sin, an enemy and a tyrant; for that would be unrighteous in itself, and injurious to God and themselves: says he,</p>
<p><strong>but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead</strong>: that is, present themselves soul and body to God, give up and devote themselves to him, and to his service, and yield a cheerful obedience to him; considering themselves as under great obligation so to do, inasmuch as they are freed from condemnation and death, by the righteousness of Christ; and quickened, when dead in trespasses and sins, by his Spirit and grace; and therefore should yield</p>
<p><strong>your members</strong>, their whole selves,</p>
<p><strong>as instruments</strong>, or weapons</p>
<p><strong>of righteousness unto God</strong>; by fighting against sin, revenging all disobedience, and fulfilling obedience to the commands of God: the same is here meant, as is by putting on "the armour of light" <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:12">Romans 13:12</span>, and wearing and making use of "the armour of righteousness, on the right hand and the left", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:7">2 Corinthians 6:7</span>.</p>
