<p><strong>Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead</strong>,.... That Christ is risen from the dead, is a certain fact, well attested, thoroughly known, and firmly believed; the prophets prophesied of it, Christ himself foretold it, angels affirmed it, and the apostles were witnesses of it, as is also the Holy Ghost: and it is as certain, that he</p>
<p><strong>dieth no more</strong>; he is raised to an immortal life, and will live for evermore; there is no need of his dying again, his death having been a full atonement and expiation of all the sins and transgressions of his people:</p>
<p><strong>death hath no more dominion over him</strong>: it once had dominion over him; it held him under its power for a time, according to the divine determination, and by his own consent: but it was not possible he should be holden of it longer; both on account of the dignity of his person, as the Son of God, and the virtue and efficacy of his sacrifice, as the surety of his people, having put away sin for ever by it. He is the holy man the Jews u speak of,</p>
<p>"who is the mystery of the name Jehovah, and in him there is no sin, neither shall death have the dominion over him.''</p>
