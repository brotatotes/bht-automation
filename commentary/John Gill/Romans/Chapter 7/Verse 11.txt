<p><strong>For sin taking occasion by the commandment</strong>,.... As in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8">Romans 7:8</span>,</p>
<p><strong>deceived me</strong>; either by promising pleasure or impunity: the same effect is ascribed by the Jews to the evil imagination or corruption of nature, which they say is called an enticer, שמפתה אדם, "that deceives man" g:</p>
<p><strong>and by it slew me</strong>; mortally wounded me: not the law, but sin by the law, deceived and slew him; so that as before, the law is cleared from being the cause of sin, so here, from being the cause of death; for though the law is a killing letter, the ministration of condemnation and death, yet it is not the cause of it; but sin, which is a transgression of the law, is that which deceives or leads out of the way, as the word signifies, and then kills. The metaphor is taken from a thief or a robber, who leads a man out of the way into some bypath, and then murders him.</p>
<p>g Tzeror Hammor, fol. 141. 3. &amp; 150. 1.</p>
