<p><strong>For the good that I would, I do not</strong>,.... The apostle here repeats what he had delivered in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:15">Romans 7:15</span> to strengthen and confirm this part of his experience; that though he had a will to that which was good, yet he wanted power, and had none of himself to perform; and therefore often did what he would not, and what he would he did not.</p>
