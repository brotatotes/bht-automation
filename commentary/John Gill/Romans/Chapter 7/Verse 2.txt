<p><strong>For the woman which hath an husband</strong>,.... The former general rule is here illustrated by a particular instance and example in the law of marriage; a woman that is married to a man,</p>
<p><strong>is bound by the law to her husband</strong>; to live with him, in subjection and obedience to him,</p>
<p><strong>so long as he liveth</strong>; except in the cases of adultery, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:9">Matthew 19:9</span>, and desertion, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:15">1 Corinthians 7:15</span>, by which the bond of marriage is loosed, and for which a divorce or separation may be made, which are equal to death:</p>
<p><strong>but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband</strong>; the bond of marriage is dissolved, the law of it is abolished, and she is at entire liberty to marry whom she will, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:39">1 Corinthians 7:39</span>.</p>
