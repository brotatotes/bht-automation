So then if while her husband liveth,.... True indeed it is, that whilst her husband is alive, ifshe be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; she will be noted and accounted of as such everybody, except in the above mentioned cases:but if her husband be dead; then there can be no exception to her marriage:she is free from the law; of marriage, by which she was before bound:so that she is no adulteress; nor will any reckon her such; she is clear from any such imputation:though she be married to another man; hence it appears that second marriages are lawful.
