<p><strong>So then if while her husband liveth</strong>,.... True indeed it is, that whilst her husband is alive, if</p>
<p><strong>she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress</strong>; she will be noted and accounted of as such everybody, except in the above mentioned cases:</p>
<p><strong>but if her husband be dead</strong>; then there can be no exception to her marriage:</p>
<p><strong>she is free from the law</strong>; of marriage, by which she was before bound:</p>
<p><strong>so that she is no adulteress</strong>; nor will any reckon her such; she is clear from any such imputation:</p>
<p><strong>though she be married to another man</strong>; hence it appears that second marriages are lawful.</p>
