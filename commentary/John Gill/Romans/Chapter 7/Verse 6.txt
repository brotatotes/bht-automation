<p><strong>But now we are delivered from the law</strong>,.... From the ministration of it, by Moses; from it, as a covenant of works; from its rigorous exaction; from its curse and condemnation, all this by Christ; and from its being an irritating, provoking law to sin, through the corruption of nature, by the Spirit and grace of Christ; but not from obedience to it, as in the hands of Christ. The Vulgate Latin version, and some copies read, "from the law of death"; and the Ethiopic version renders it, "we are loosed from the law, and are delivered from the former doctrine"; the doctrine of the legal dispensation.</p>
<p><strong>That being dead</strong>; not sin, but the law: in what sense believers are dead to the law, and that to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Wherein we were held</strong>: as a woman is by the law to her husband, or as persons guilty, who are detained prisoners; so we were "kept under the law, shut up unto the faith", as in a prison, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:23">Galatians 3:23</span>; Now the saints deliverance from the law through the abrogation of it, that losing its former life, vigour, power, and dominion, is not that they may live a loose licentious life and conversation, but that they</p>
<p><strong>should serve</strong> the Lord their God without slavish fear, and with a godly one, acceptably, in righteousness and holiness, all the days of their lives; and their Lord and Master Jesus Christ, who is King of saints, lawgiver in his church, and whose commandments are to be observed from a principle of love, in faith, and to his glory; yea, even the law itself, as held forth by him, as the apostle says in the close of this chapter, "with the mind I myself serve the law of God", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:25">Romans 7:25</span>: the manner in which this service is to be, and is performed, is,</p>
<p><strong>in newness of Spirit</strong>; under the influences of the Spirit of God, the author of renovation, of the new creature, or new man created in us, in righteousness and true holiness; and from a new heart, and new Spirit, and new principles of life, light, love, and grace, formed in the soul; and by walking in "newness of life", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>, or by a new life, walk, and conversation:</p>
<p><strong>and not in the oldness of the letter</strong>; not in the outward observance of the law of Moses, which is the "letter"; not indulging the old man, or walking after the dictates of corrupt nature; nor behaving according to the old former course of living: on the whole it may be observed, that a believer without the law, being delivered from it, that being dead to him, and he to that, lives a better life and conversation under the influence of the Spirit of God, than one that is under the law, and the works of it, destitute of the grace of God; the one brings forth "fruit unto death", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5">Romans 7:5</span>, the other serves the Lord, "in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter".</p>
