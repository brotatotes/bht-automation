<p><strong>What shall we say then? is the law sin</strong>?.... The apostle having said, that "the motions of sins were by the law", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5">Romans 7:5</span>, meets with an objection, or rather an ill natured cavil, "is the law sin?" if the motions sins are by it, then it instigates and prompts men to sin; it cherishes it in them; it leads them and impels them to the commission of it, and therefore must be the cause of sin; and if the cause of sin, then it must be sin, or sinful itself: "what shall we say then?" how shall we remove this difficulty, answer this objection, and silence this cavil? To this it is replied by way of detestation and abhorrence,</p>
<p><strong>God forbid</strong>! a way of speaking often made use of by the apostle, when any dreadful consequence was drawn from, or any shocking objection was made to his doctrine, and which was so monstrous as scarcely to deserve any other manner of refutation; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:3">Romans 3:3</span>; and next by observing the use of the law to discover sin; which it does by forbidding it, and threatening it with death; by accusing for it, convincing of it, and representing it in its proper colours, it being as a glass in which it may be beheld just as it is, neither greater nor less; which must be understood as attended with a divine power and light, otherwise as a glass is of no use to a blind man, so neither is the law in this sense, to a man in a state of darkness, until the Spirit of God opens his eyes to behold in this glass what manner of man he is: now since the law is so useful to discover, and so to discountenance sin, that itself cannot be sin, or sinful. The apostle exemplifies this in his own case, and says,</p>
<p><strong>nay, I had not known sin, but by the law</strong>; which he says not in the person of another, there is no room nor reason for such a fancy; but in his own person, and of himself: not of himself at that present time, as is evident from his way of speaking; nor of himself in his childhood, before he came to years of discretion to discern between good and evil; but as, and when he was a grown person, and whilst a Pharisee, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:5">Philippians 3:5</span>; he did not know sin during his being in that state till the law came, and entered into his conscience, and then, and by it, he knew sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7">Romans 7:7</span>, the exceeding sinfulness of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:13">Romans 7:13</span>, and that he himself was the chief of sinners, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span>. Nay he goes on to observe, that by the law he came to know, not only the sinfulness of outward actions, but also of inward lusts; says he,</p>
<p><strong>for I had not known lust, except the law had said, thou shall not covet</strong>: as it does in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:17">Exodus 20:17</span>. This is a way of speaking used by the Jews, when they produce any passage out of the law, thus e,</p>
<p>התורה אמרה, "the law says", if anyone comes to kill thee; referring either to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+24:11">1 Samuel 24:11</span> or <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:1">Exodus 22:1</span>; and a little after, "the law says", namely, in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:5">Exodus 3:5</span>, "put off thy shoes from off thy feet", c. By "lust" is meant the inward motions of sin in the heart, any and every desire of the mind after it not only studied and concerted schemes, how to bring about and compass an evil action; but every loose vagrant thought of sin, and inclination to it; yea, every imagination of the thought of the heart, before the imagination is well formed into a thought; and not only a dallying with sin in the mind, dwelling upon it with pleasure in thought, but even such sudden motions and starts of the mind to sin, to which we give no assent; such as are involuntary, yea, contrary to the will, being "the evil [we] would not", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:19">Romans 7:19</span>, and are displeasing and hateful to us; these are meant by lust, and which by the law of God are known to be sinful, and only by that. These were not known to be so by the Gentiles, who only had the law and light of nature; nor are they condemned, nor any provision made against them, nor can there be any made, by the laws of men: and though these inward lusts are condemned by the law of God, yet inasmuch as they were not punishable by men, and could be covered with the guise of an external righteousness, multitudes who were born under, and brought up in that law, were secure and indolent about them, did not look upon them as sins, or as at all affecting their righteousness; but imagined that, "touching the righteousness of the law", they were "blameless", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:6">Philippians 3:6</span>; which was the case of all the Pharisees, and of the apostle whilst such: but when the law came and entered his conscience with power and light attending it, then he saw, such innumerable swarms of lusts in his heart, and these to be sinful, which he never saw and knew before: just as in a sunbeam we behold those numerous little bits of dust, which otherwise are indiscernible by us. Now since the law is of such use, not only to discover the sinfulness of outward actions, but also of inward lusts and desires, that itself cannot be sinful.</p>
