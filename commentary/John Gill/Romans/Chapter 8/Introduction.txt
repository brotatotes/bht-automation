<p>INTRODUCTION TO ROMANS 8</p>
<p>As the former chapter shows that sanctified ones are not free from the being of sin in them, which is a ground of general complaint and uneasiness; this chapter shows, that justified ones are freed from the guilt of sin, and secure from punishment for it; and have the utmost reason to rejoice and be glad, and even to triumph in a plerophory and full assurance of faith, on account of the various privileges they enjoy, through the grace of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit; and which are distinctly, largely, and severally mentioned: it begins, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1">Romans 8:1</span>, with taking notice of a particular privilege saints have in Christ, and, by virtue of union to him, security from all condemnation; and which is inferred from their sure and certain deliverance from sin by Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:25">Romans 8:25</span>, the persons sharing in this privilege are described by their being in Christ, and by their walking after the Spirit of Christ, in consequence of it: a reason confirming this privilege is given, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:2">Romans 8:2</span>, taken either from the Gospel, declaring the saints' freedom from the law; or from the power and efficacy of the Spirit, delivering them from the tyranny and dominion of sin; or rather from the holiness of Christ's human nature, as a branch of their justification: this privilege is made more fully to appear, and the saints' interest in it by the mission of Christ, to bring in everlasting righteousness for them, which is the foundation of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span>, the occasion of which was the weakness of the law, or rather the impotency of man, through the corruption of nature, to fulfil the law: the sender, or the efficient cause of this mission, is God the Father; the person sent, his own Son; the manner in which he was sent, in human nature, which had the appearance of being sinful; what God did in it, he condemned sin in it; which is a reason, why there is no condemnation to them, that are in him; and the end of all this, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:4">Romans 8:4</span>, was, that the law of righteousness might be perfectly fulfilled by Christ for them, or by them in him; who are described in part, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1">Romans 8:1</span>, upon the repetition of which part of the description, the apostle proceeds to show the difference between unregenerate and regenerate persons, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:5">Romans 8:5</span>, partly by their characters; the one being carnal, or after the flesh, the other being spiritual, or after the Spirit; and by their different affections, the one minding the things of the flesh, the other the things of the Spirit; the different issue and effect of which, namely, a carnal and a spiritual mind are observed, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:6">Romans 8:6</span>, death following upon the one, life and peace upon the other; the reasons of which, with respect to the former, are given, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:7">Romans 8:7</span>, taken from the enmity of the carnal mind to God, and the non-subjection of it to the law of God, and the impossibility of its being subject to it; and therefore nothing but death can be expected; from whence this conclusion is made, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:8">Romans 8:8</span>, that unregenerate men are not in a state, nor in a capacity to please God, or do what is acceptable to him, the above being the disposition and temper of their minds: and then in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span>, the apostle returns to the argument from whence be had digressed, and suggests, that though he had said the above things of unregenerate men, he had other thoughts of those to whom he writes; they were not in the flesh, nor minded the things of the flesh, and so were not liable to condemnation and death; and which he proves by the inhabitation of the Spirit of God in them; for such who have him not, have no proof nor evidence of their being Christ's, and so consequently have no proof of their security from condemnation; and partly by Christ's being in them, and which is the evidence of their being in Christ, and so of the above privilege, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10">Romans 8:10</span>, the consequence of which is, that though by reason of sin the body is mortal, and does die, yet the soul lives not only naturally, but spiritually, by faith in Christ now, and in glory hereafter, by virtue of Christ's righteousness imputed to it, and so is free from condemnation and death; besides, by virtue of the Spirit's dwelling in them, their mortal bodies will be quickened in the general resurrection, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span>, and from all these blessings of divine goodness, both in soul and body, the apostle infers, that the saints are under obligation, not to live in a carnal, but in a spiritual manner, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:12">Romans 8:12</span>, and to which he exhorts, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:13">Romans 8:13</span>, and presses by motives, taken from the different consequences of those things; death following by living after the flesh, and life through the mortification of sin, by the Spirit of God: and whereas the walking after the Spirit, by which he had described those that are safe from condemnation, is owing to their being led by him; and their being led by him, being an evidence of their divine sonship, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:14">Romans 8:14</span>, from hence he passes to consider the privilege of adoption: and that these saints were interested in this privilege, he proves <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>, partly by their not having the spirit of bondage which belongs to servants; and partly by their having the spirit of adoption, who had made known this grace unto them, and their interest in it: and that they had received him as a spirit of adoption, was evident by their calling God their Father under his influence; and also by the witness he bore to their spirits, that they were the children of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:16">Romans 8:16</span>, of which they were conscious: and from this privilege of adoption, the apostle concludes heirship, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>, and which is of such a nature, that there is none like it; both with respect to the subject of it, God himself; with respect to him with whom they are heirs, Christ Jesus; and the way in which they come to share the glorious inheritance with him, is through suffering with him, and for him; and this they need not grudge to do, since there is no comparison between their sufferings, and the glory they shall enjoy, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:18">Romans 8:18</span>, which both Jews and Gentiles were in the expectation of; the latter of which are described in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19">Romans 8:19</span>, by their name, the creature, the whole creation; and by their present condition, the Gospel being come among them to the conversion of many, which raised an expectation of many sons and daughters being born to God among them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19">Romans 8:19</span>, and by their former state and condition, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:20">Romans 8:20</span>, which is mentioned, to illustrate the grace of God in the present blessing bestowed upon them, in sending the Gospel to them; which state was a subjection to vanity, through the god of this world, who led them captive at his will, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21">Romans 8:21</span>, and then by the deliverance of them, they were in hope and expectation of, from bondage to liberty, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21">Romans 8:21</span>, and this groaning and travailing: in birth in a spiritual sense, for the bringing forth of many sons to God among the Gentiles, the apostle, and other ministers of the word, who had preached the Gospel among them, were witnesses of, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:22">Romans 8:22</span>, yea, not only the Gentiles, but the Jews also, who are described as having the first fruits of the Spirit, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>, were waiting for the manifestation of the children of God among the Gentiles, with them to complete at last the mystical body, who shall share together the glory before spoken of, which their sonship and heirship entitle them to; and for which there is encouragement to wait with patience and in hope, from the connection of salvation with the grace of hope; and from, the nature of the thing hoped for, which is unseen, but certain, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:24">Romans 8:24</span>. From hence the apostle proceeds to consider another privilege which the saints have, who are in the Spirit, and walk after the Spirit, the Spirit helps their infirmities; particularly in prayer, the matter of which, in some cases, they are at a loss about, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</span>, and this he does, by making intercession for them; the manner in which this is done in them, is with unutterable groans; and the rule according to which it is made, is the will of God, the mind of the Spirit being known by the searcher of hearts, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:27">Romans 8:27</span>, in a word, such are the privileges of believers in Christ, that every thing in the whole world, in heaven, and in earth, in themselves and others, whether good or bad, prosperous or adverse, work together for their good, so that nothing can go wrong with them in the issue, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>, who are described by their love to God, and by their effectual calling, according to his purpose; which being mentioned, leads the apostle to the source and spring of all these and other privileges, the everlasting love of God; signified by his foreknowledge of his people, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>, which is the cause of their predestination to a conformity to the image of Christ, the firstborn among many brethren; with which predestination, calling, justification, and glorification, are inseparably connected, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:30">Romans 8:30</span>, from all which blessings of grace it may be concluded, that God is on the side of such persons, who are interested in these favours; and nothing is to be feared, but every good thing is to be expected by them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:31">Romans 8:31</span>, which is confirmed by an argument from the greater to the lesser, that if God has given his Son for them, he will freely give all things to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:32">Romans 8:32</span>, in a view of which, the apostle rises up in a triumph of faith, and challenges all the enemies of the saints, and denies that any charge can be brought against them of any avail, since God is the justifier of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:33">Romans 8:33</span>, or that they shall ever enter into condemnation, being secured from it by the death of Christ; and which security is yet more strengthened by his resurrection, session at the right hand of God, and intercession for them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:34">Romans 8:34</span>, and then asks, since Christ has shown such love to them, by these instances of it, what can separate from it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:35">Romans 8:35</span>, and enumerates several things which befall the saints in this life, which, however mean and abject they may render them in the esteem of men, do not at all abate the love of Christ to them: that such is their case, that they are exposed to afflictions and sufferings, and even death itself, for the sake of Christ, is proved <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:36">Romans 8:36</span>, by a testimony out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+44:22">Psalms 44:22</span>, and then an answer is returned to the above question in the negative, that none of the things mentioned could separate them from the love of Christ; so far from it, that by virtue of Christ who had loved them, they were conquerors, and more than conquerors in all these things, and over all their enemies, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:37">Romans 8:37</span>, and the chapter is concluded in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:38">Romans 8:38</span>, with the full and firm persuasion of the apostle, that nothing in the whole universe, in the whole compass of created beings, be they what they will, good or bad, or which are or shall be, an enumeration of many of which is made, should ever separate him, or any of the people of God from his love, which is in Christ Jesus: so that upon the whole, notwithstanding indwelling sin, notwithstanding the various afflictions which attend them in this world, yet in consideration of the many privileges they enjoy, and the glory they are heirs of, they have great reason to rejoice, and look upon themselves to be in the most safe and happy condition. </p>
