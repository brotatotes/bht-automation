<p><strong>As it is written, for thy sake we are killed</strong>,.... This passage is a citation out of <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+44:22">Psalms 44:22</span>; and the meaning is, that for the sake of God, and his pure worship, Old Testament saints were frequently put to death, or exposed to the persecutions of men, which often issued in death; as New Testament saints have been, for the sake of Christ and his Gospel, even</p>
<p><strong>all the day long</strong>; that is, they were liable to death all the day long; or every day, one or other of them was put to death:</p>
<p><strong>we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter</strong>; they were reckoned as fit for nothing else, and were continually exposed unto it; were used as sheep are, as if they were made for no other use and service, but to be slaughtered; hence they are called, "the flock of slaughter", <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="zec+11:7">Zechariah 11:7</span>; and as this expresses the brutality of their persecutors, so their harmlessness, meekness, humility, and patience in sufferings, being under them like lambs or sheep. This testimony is produced, to show that suffering death has been the common lot of the saints in all ages: and is designed to animate the people of God under the Gospel dispensation, to suffer with cheerfulness; the allusion may be to the lambs and sheep daily slain for sacrifice; either to the lambs of the sacrifice slain morning and evening; or to others that were slain in any part of the day from morning to night, for other sacrifices, in the court of the tabernacle and temple.</p>
