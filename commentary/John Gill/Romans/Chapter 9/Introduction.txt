<p>INTRODUCTION TO ROMANS 9</p>
<p>The apostle having discoursed of justification and sanctification, and of the privileges of justified and sanctified ones, proceeds to treat of predestination, the source and spring of all the blessings of grace; and to observe how this distinguishing act of God's sovereign will has taken place, both among Jews and Gentiles; in treating of which, he knew he should go contrary to the sense of his countrymen the Jews, who have a notion that all Israel shall have a part in, or inherit the world to come q: and that the Gentiles will be for ever miserable; and nothing was more disagreeable to them, than to talk of their rejection of God, and the calling of the Gentiles; wherefore that it might be manifest, that it was not out of pique and ill will to them, that the apostle said the things hereafter related; he expresses the most cordial affection to them imaginable, and which he introduces in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:1">Romans 9:1</span>, by way of appeal to Christ, who knew the truth of what he was about to say, and who could, together with the Spirit of God and his own conscience, testify for him that it was no lie: the thing he appeals for the truth of, is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:2">Romans 9:2</span>, that the salvation of the Jews lay near his heart; that it was no pleasure to him to think or speak of their rejection, but was what gave him continual pain and uneasiness: and his great desire for their good is expressed in a very strong and uncommon manner, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</span>, the reasons of it are partly the relation they stood in to him, being his brethren and kinsmen; and partly the many privileges they had been favoured with of God; an enumeration of which is given, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:4">Romans 9:4</span>, and foreseeing an objection, he prevents it, which might be made, that if the Jews were cast off, the promise of God to that people that he would be their God, would become void, and the preaching the Gospel of Christ to them of no effect; to which he answers by distinguishing between Israel and Israel, or the elect of God among them, and those that were not; wherefore though the latter were rejected according to the purpose of God, the promise and preaching of the word had their effect in the former, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:6">Romans 9:6</span>, and that there was such a distinction, he proves from the two sons of Abraham, Isaac and Ishmael, who were both Abraham's seed; yet one was a child of promise, and the other a child of the flesh, and were emblematical of the children of the promise, and the children of the flesh among that people; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:7">Romans 9:7</span>, and further confirms this by the instance of Jacob and Esau, who were born of the same parents, and were twins; and yet one was in the favour of God, and the other not; and that this was owing not to works, but to the sovereign will of God in election, he proves by observing that this was before good or evil were done by either of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:11">Romans 9:11</span>, and that this was notified to Rebekah before, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:12">Romans 9:12</span>, as appears from a passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:23">Genesis 25:23</span>, and by another passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mal+1:2">Malachi 1:2</span>, which is cited, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:13">Romans 9:13</span>, then an objection is started, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:14">Romans 9:14</span>, that if God loves one, and hates another, both being in equal circumstances, as Jacob and Esau were, he must be guilty of unrighteousness; which he answers and removes, first by a detestation of such a charge against God, and then by producing testimonies out of the books of Moses, proving both election and reprobation, as being not of the works of men, but of the will of God; the former of these he proves, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:15">Romans 9:15</span>, from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:19">Exodus 33:19</span>, by which it appears, that the choice of men to salvation is not according to the will of man, but according to the grace and love of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:16">Romans 9:16</span>, the latter he proves by the case of Pharaoh, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:17">Romans 9:17</span>, and the Scripture relating to that, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ex+9:16">Exodus 9:16</span>, and from both testimonies concludes, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:18">Romans 9:18</span>, that God's having mercy on one, and hardening another, are according to his sovereign will and pleasure; then another objection rises, up, if so, God has no reason to find fault with men that are hardened in sin, since they are according to his will, and in sinning do but fulfil it, and which no man resists; and this objection is formed in a very pert and sneering manner, and insinuates that God is cruel and acts unreasonably, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:19">Romans 9:19</span>, to which he answers, by putting the objector in mind that he was a man, a mere creature that started it, and that it was God against whom it was made; and by observing the folly and madness of replying against God, and the absurdity of such a procedure, taken from the consideration of the one being a creature, and the other the Creator, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:20">Romans 9:20</span>, and by instancing in the case of the potter, who has power over his clay, to form it in what shape, and for what use he pleases, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:21">Romans 9:21</span>, and accommodates this, both to the affair of election and reprobation, and to the business of the latter first, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:22">Romans 9:22</span>, where he observes the end of God in it to show forth his power and wrath, and describes the subjects of it, which clears him from injustice, and points at the patience of God towards them, which frees him from the charge of cruelty, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:22">Romans 9:22</span>, and then proceeds to apply the metaphor before used, to the objects of election styled vessels of mercy, and the end of the Lord to manifest the riches of his glory in them, and the method he takes to bring them to eternal happiness, by preparing them for it by grace, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:23">Romans 9:23</span>, which is done in the effectual calling, the objects of which are both Jews and Gentiles, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:24">Romans 9:24</span>, That it is the will of God that the Gentiles should be called, he proves, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:25">Romans 9:25</span>, from some passages in Hosea, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:23">Hosea 2:23</span>, and that God had chosen, and so would call some among the Jews, he clearly makes appear, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:27">Romans 9:27</span>, from some prophecies of Isaiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+10:22">Isaiah 10:22</span>, and then he concludes the chapter by observing the free and distinguishing grace of God, in the calling of the Gentiles, and the justification of them by the righteousness of Christ; that such who were far off from it, and sought not after it, should enjoy it, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:30">Romans 9:30</span>, when the Israelites, who were diligent and zealous in seeking after a righteousness to justify them before God, yet did not arrive to one, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:31">Romans 9:31</span>, the reasons of which are given, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:32">Romans 9:32</span>, because it was not the righteousness of faith, or the righteousness of Christ received by faith they sought; but a legal one, and by works which can never be attained by sinful men: they sought after a wrong righteousness, and in a wrong way, because they stumbled at Christ, and rejected him and his righteousness; and this removes an objection which is suggested in the two preceding verses, that God is unrighteous in calling the Gentiles, who never sought after righteousness, and in rejecting the Jews that followed after one: and that they did stumble at Christ and his righteousness, is no other than what was foretold in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:14">Isaiah 8:14</span>, and that whoever believes in Christ, whether Jew or Gentile, shall be saved, he suggests is a doctrine agreeably to <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>, which passages are referred to, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span>.</p>
