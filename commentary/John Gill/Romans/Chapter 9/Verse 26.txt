<p><strong>And it shall come to pass that in the place</strong>,.... This is another citation out of Hosea, and is to be seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ho+1:10">Hosea 1:10</span>, and the meaning is, that in those countries, as here in Great Britain, in the very selfsame place, or spot of ground,</p>
<p><strong>where it was said unto them, ye are not my people</strong>; where were nothing but idolatry and idolatrous worshippers, and whose worship, works, and actions, declared them not to be the people of God:</p>
<p><strong>there shall they be called the children of the living God</strong>; not only children of God, but of the living God; in opposition to their idol gods, their lifeless deities, and senseless statues of gold, silver, brass, wood, or stone, they fell down to and worshipped. The chosen of God among the Gentiles, were from all eternity predestinated to the adoption of children; this blessing was provided, laid up, and secured for them, in the covenant of grace; in this relation of children were they given to Christ, and under this consideration of them did he partake of the same flesh and blood with them, and died, to gather them together, who were scattered abroad in the several parts of the world; and because they were antecedently sons by adopting grace, therefore the Spirit of God in effectual calling is sent down into their hearts to bear witness to their spirits, that they are the children of the living God, and to work faith in their souls to believe it; by which grace they receive this blessing, as all others, even the right and privilege of being the children of God; by this they claim it, and enjoy the comfort of it; and so are manifestly, both to themselves and others, the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus; though this will more clearly appear another day, than it does now.</p>
