<p><strong>Who are Israelites</strong>,.... Which were their national name, as descended from Jacob, whose name was Israel; and it was accounted a very honourable one; see <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:5">Philippians 3:5</span>; and the very name they bore gave the apostle some concern that they should be cut off; and then he proceeds to enumerate the several distinguishing favours and privileges they had been partakers of:</p>
<p><strong>to whom pertaineth the adoption</strong>; not that special adoption, which springs from eternal predestination, is a blessing of the covenant of grace, comes through the redemption of Christ, and is received and enjoyed only by believers in him; for all that were Israelites, were not in this sense the children of God; but national adoption is here meant, by which the whole body of the people, as nation, were the sons of God, his firstborn:</p>
<p><strong>and the glory</strong>; either the ark of the covenant, which is so called in</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+63:2">Psalms 63:2</span>, according to Kimchi; or the clouds in the tabernacle and temple, which were called the glory of the Lord, and were symbols of his presence, the same with the Shekinah; and so Aben Ezra interprets power, the ark, and glory, the Shekinah, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ps+63:2">Psalms 63:2</span>,</p>
<p><strong>and the covenants</strong>; not the two Testaments, Old and New, but the covenant of circumcision, made with Abraham their father, and the covenant at Sinai they entered into with the Lord; some copies, and the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, read, "the covenant":</p>
<p><strong>and the giving, of the law</strong>: מתן תורה, a way of speaking the x Jews make use of when they take notice of this privilege; for it was peculiarly given to them with great solemnity by God himself, through the disposition of angels into the hands of Moses the mediator, and by him to them; and on account of this, they reckoned themselves more beloved of God than the rest of mankind y</p>
<p><strong>and the service of God</strong>; or "the service", as in the Greek text. So the Jews z are used to call it עבודה, "the service"; and false worship is called by them עבודה זרה, "strange service", which is the title of one of their Misnic tracts; and here it signifies the whole worship of God, in the whole compass of it, sacrifices, prayer, praise, c. daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly:</p>
<p><strong>and the promises</strong> both temporal and spiritual, especially such as related to the Messiah, and which now had their accomplishment.</p>
