<p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO TITUS 1</strong></p>
<p>This chapter contains the inscription of the epistle, the apostle's salutation and preface to it; an account of the qualifications of an eider, or pastor of a church; a description of these teachers; and a charge to Titus to rebuke the Cretians for their errors and immoralities. The inscription and salutation are in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:1">Titus 1:1</span>, in which the writer of the epistle is described by his name and office; by the faith and hope he had; and by the ministration of the Gospel, committed to him by the order of Christ: and the person to whom it is written is mentioned by name; and is described by the spiritual relation he stood in to the apostle, and to whom he wishes grace, mercy, and peace: the preface to the epistle is in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span> which gives the reason of the apostle's leaving Titus in Crete, which was to set things in order there, and to ordain elders in all the churches; which leads him to point at the necessary qualifications of them for his direction; some of which respect their moral life and conversation, and others their doctrine, and are in <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:6">Titus 1:6</span> and on occasion of the latter, and which is a reason why the elders should be sound in the faith, and hold it fast, the apostle takes notice of the false teachers that were in Crete, whom he describes by their noisy, vain, and deceitful talk; by their being pernicious and hurtful to whole families; and by their covetousness and sensuality, which is confirmed by a testimony out of one of the Cretian poets, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:10">Titus 1:10</span> wherefore he charges Titus sharply to rebuke either these false teachers, or those they had corrupted, that they regard sound doctrine, and not Jewish fables, and the commandments of erroneous men, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:13">Titus 1:13</span> and instances in things forbidden in the law of Moses as unclean, which were not now to be attended to by those who were pure in heart, and sound in faith, to whom all things were pure and lawful; and as for others that were impure, whose minds and consciences were defiled, and were unbelieving, nothing was pure to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:15">Titus 1:15</span> and who are further described as professors in words of the true knowledge of God, and yet practically were deniers of him; and as abominable in their nature and actions, disobedient to law and Gospel, and unfit for any good work whatever, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:16">Titus 1:16</span>. </p>
