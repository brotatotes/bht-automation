<p><strong>Not giving heed to Jewish fables</strong>,.... Concerning God himself, the angels, and the creation of man; concerning the giving of the law at Mount Sinai; concerning the Messiah and his earthly kingdom, and the feast that will be made for the righteous in his days, which will consist of flesh, fish, and fowl, Behemoth, Leviathan, and Zuz, and of wine kept in the grape from the foundation of the world; and concerning the rolling of the dead through the caverns of the earth at the resurrection, with a multitude of other things which were traditionally received.</p>
<p><strong>And commandments of men</strong>: the traditions of the elders, which the Jews charged the disciples of Christ with the transgression of; and he, on the other hand, very justly reproached them with breaking the commands of God, by attending to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:1">Matthew 15:1</span>. These were the laws and traditions of the fathers, which the Apostle Paul was brought up in, and was zealous of, before his conversion, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:3">Acts 22:3</span> and which these judaizing preachers and professors, he here has respect to, were fond of, though they were made by men,</p>
<p><strong>that turn from the truth</strong>; or "hate it", as the Syriac version renders it; who were enemies unto it, as Hillell and Shammai, the heads of the traditional doctors, and as the Jews, and their Rabbins in general were; and therefore their commandments, of all men, should not be given heed to, by those that bear the Christian name.</p>
