<p><strong>For a bishop must be blameless</strong>,.... This shows that a bishop and an elder is the same; and the Syriac version here renders it, "an elder"; the character or qualification necessary to him is the same as before, and in like manner to be understood; unless it should more particularly refer to his faithfulness in the discharge of his office: since it follows,</p>
<p><strong>as the steward of God</strong>; one appointed by God over his household and family, the church, to give to everyone their portion of meat in due season; one that dispenses the manifold grace, or various doctrines of the grace of God, and mysteries of Christ; and of such an one it is required, that he be faithful, both to his Lord and master, to the trust committed to him, and to the persons under his care.</p>
<p><strong>Not selfwilled</strong>; not doing things in the worship and house of God, in the ministry of the word, and administration of ordinances, according to his own will, but according to the will of God, revealed in his word; otherwise what he does will come under the name of will worship: or obstinate, stubborn, and inflexible, conceited of his own sense and judgment, and resolute to have his own will and way in all things relating to the affairs of God's house. The word signifies one that is pleased with himself, has an over weening opinion of himself, is proud and haughty, and despises others:</p>
<p><strong>not soon angry</strong>: but slow to wrath, which shows a man to be a man of understanding, and fit to teach others, which an angry man is not. It is a saying of R. Hillell h, that</p>
<p>"neither one that is ashamed (to ask questions) learns well, nor one that is "angry" teaches well''</p>
<p>And the Jews say i, that</p>
<p>"the law is not rightly explained but by one that is not angry.''</p>
<p>Hence, that direction k,</p>
<p>"for ever let a man be meek as Hillell, and not angry as Shammai;''</p>
<p>who were two of their principal doctors, the heads of their schools, in the times of Christ: a man that rules his own spirit, and has the command of his temper and passions, is fit to govern in the church of God.</p>
<p><strong>Not given to wine, no striker, nor given to filthy lucre</strong>;</p>
