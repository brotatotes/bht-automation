<p><strong>But a lover of hospitality</strong>,.... <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span></p>
<p><strong>a lover of good men</strong>, or "of good"; the Syriac version renders it, "of good things"; as prayer, preaching, reading, meditation, spiritual conversation, and every religious exercise: or "of good men"; for such an elder or bishop has chiefly to do and converse with; and if he is not a lover of them, their company will be disagreeable to him, and he will be of no advantage to them; and if he does not love the souls of men, he will not naturally care for their state, or be concerned for their good.</p>
<p><strong>Sober</strong>: in body, using moderation in diet and dress; and in mind, being prudent, modest, and humble, and thinking soberly of himself, and others, as he ought.</p>
<p><strong>Just</strong>; righteous in his dealings with men, giving to everyone their due; upright and sincere in his conversation with the saints; and faithful in his counsel, admonitions, and reproofs.</p>
<p><strong>Holy</strong>; devout towards God, constant in all religious exercises in the closet, family, and church; and living soberly, righteously, and godly in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Temperate</strong>; in eating and drinking; continent from the lusts of the flesh; and even abstaining from those things which might be lawfully used, though inexpedient, for the sake of the weak, the peace of the church, and the glory of God.</p>
