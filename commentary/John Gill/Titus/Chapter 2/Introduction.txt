<p>INTRODUCTION TO TITUS 2</p>
<p>In this chapter the apostle exhorts Timothy to the discharge of his office with respect to all sorts of persons, of every age, sex; and condition, he was concerned with, giving reasons for it, taken from the nature of the Gospel of Christ: he exhorts him in general to insist in his public ministry on those things, which were agreeable to sound doctrine, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:1">Titus 2:1</span> and particularly what became aged men and aged women, and young men and young women, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:2">Titus 2:2</span> in all which, both with respect to doctrine and practice, he desires him to be a pattern to them, that so even his very adversaries may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of him, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:7">Titus 2:7</span>. And next he charges him to exhort servants, to obey their masters, and seek to please them, and not contradict them, and to be faithful to them; that so the doctrine of God their Saviour, professed by them, might be adorned in all things, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:9">Titus 2:9</span>. And the reasons why the apostle would have duty urged on persons of every age, sex, and state, are taken from the nature of the Gospel being a doctrine of grace and salvation, which was preached to all sorts of persons, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:11">Titus 2:11</span>, and from the efficacy of it, in teaching men to deny sin, and live a holy life and conversation, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:12">Titus 2:12</span> and from an expectation of eternal glory and happiness at the appearance of Christ, which the Gospel encourages to, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span>; and from the end of Christ's giving himself for his people, and redeeming them from sin, the sum and substance of the Gospel, which was, that they might be purified, and be zealous of good works, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:14">Titus 2:14</span> and these exhortations were to be delivered by Titus with authority, and in such a manner, that he might not be despised, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:15">Titus 2:15</span>. </p>
