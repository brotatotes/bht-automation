<p><strong>[Exhort] servants to be obedient to their own masters</strong>,.... And not others, whether they be believers, or unbelievers, gentle or froward, all their lawful commands ought to be obeyed; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> and to please [them] well in all things; not only to obey and serve them, and do what they order, but to seek and endeavour to do it in such a way as may be grateful, acceptable, and well pleasing to them, whereby an interest in their affection, esteem, and commendation, may be gained: and this should be done always, and in all things, that are not contrary to a good conscience and to the Christian religion, and to the laws of God and nature. Or "that they may be well pleased in all things"; that is, be satisfied and contented with such things as they have, and in their state and condition as servants, and cheerfully abide in the calling wherein they are called:</p>
<p><strong>not answering again</strong>; replying to their masters' orders, or complaints, either in a pert, or saucy, or grumbling manner; an evil very incident to servants, and which greatly provokes.</p>
