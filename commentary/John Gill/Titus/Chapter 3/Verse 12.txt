<p><strong>When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus</strong>,.... These were both of them ministers of the Gospel; there is no mention of Artemas anywhere else; some say he was one of the seventy disciples, and that he was afterwards bishop of Lystra; but these are uncertain things; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; the name is a contraction of Artemidorus.
