<p><strong>Bring Zenas the lawyer</strong>,.... Whether he was brought up to the civil law, either among the Greeks or Romans, is not certain; it may be he was a Jewish lawyer, or scribe, an interpreter of Moses's law among the Jews; for with them a lawyer and a scribe were one and the same, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:35">Matthew 22:35</span> compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:28">Mark 12:28</span> and the Syriac version here calls him "a scribe", and the Ethiopic version "a scribe of the city"; which looks as if it was a civil office he bore; but however, be he what he will, he seems to have been now a preacher of the Gospel, being joined with Apollos, who certainly was one: he is said to have been one of the seventy disciples of Christ, and afterwards bishop of Diospolis; <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:28- :">Mark 12:28- :</span>; his name is the contraction of Zenodorus: him the apostle would have Titus bring,</p>
<p><strong>and Apollos, on their journey diligently</strong>; who was a Jew born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures; who had preached at Corinth, but was now at Crete; and whom the apostle, with Zenas, would have provided with everything necessary for their journey:</p>
<p><strong>that nothing be wanting unto them</strong>; which might be proper for them in their travels, to make them comfortable, and their journey pleasant and easy.</p>
