<p><strong>All that are with me salute thee</strong>,.... All the apostles, fellow labourers, and the ministers of the Gospel that were with him; and all the members of the church where he was, sent their Christian salutation to Titus; he being a person greatly esteemed, and whose praise was in all the churches:</p>
<p><strong>greet them that love us in the faith</strong>; not merely as men, as their countrymen, as related to them in the flesh; or on account of any external things, but as believers; because of the doctrine of faith, professed and preached; and because of the grace of faith obtained and possessed; or who love us faithfully, sincerely, and uprightly, from their hearts, and not in word and tongue only:</p>
<p><strong>grace be with you all, Amen</strong>; which is the common concluding salutation in all Paul's epistles. This shows that this epistle was not designed for Titus only, but for the saints at Crete.</p>
<p><strong>It was written to Titus the first bishop of the church of the Cretians</strong>. But this subscription, as many others, is not to be depended upon; it is not very likely that Titus was bishop of this church at all; since his stay there was but short, nor indeed elsewhere, seeing he was an evangelist; though this is asserted both by Eusebius d, and Sophronius e, who adds, that he died and was buried here: and what follows, that it was written</p>
<p><strong>from Nicopolis of Macedonia</strong>, does not seem to be just, as may be concluded from <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:12">Titus 3:12</span>. Many learned men think it was written from Colosse, or some neighbouring place; though when he wrote his epistle to the Colossians it looks as if he had never been there before: the Syriac version adds, "sent by the hands of Zenas and Apollos"; which is not unlikely, since he desires they might be accommodated by Titus with what was necessary for the remaining part of their journey, <span class="scriptRef" com="geb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:13">Titus 3:13</span>.</p>
