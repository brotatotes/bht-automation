Here it is the communication of the mind of God in the gospel of Christ. (See ch. 2.1.) I retain 'word' in the expression 'all word, and all knowledge,' adding 'of doctrine' in brackets, because 'in all word' is scarcely English, and the 'word of doctrine' is, I believe, the sense here. 'Utterance' gives the sense imperfectly. It is the matter and form of thought and expression, as well as the utterance of it. It is a word so large in sense as to be very hard to express. Whatever expresses the mind is  logos .  Nous (ch. 2.16, 'mind') is the intelligent faculty. whatever expresses the thought formed in it is  logos . There is thus the intelligent and the intelligible. Thus all that communicates the divine mind (the intelligible) is  logos , and first of all Christ himself. But we are said, having the Holy Spirit, to have also the 'mind' of Christ, the intelligent faculty with its thoughts (ch. 2.16).
