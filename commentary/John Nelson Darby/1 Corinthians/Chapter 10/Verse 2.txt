	 10:2 baptised (d-4) The middle form of the verb, which has a reflexive force. It is when an act returns back in its effect on oneself. see Note e, <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span> . Paul was to act thus in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:16">Acts 22:16</span> ; not to baptise himself, that would be active; but 'get baptised.' They passed through the sea and so got baptised. There was no action of course of a baptiser here, hence the middle voice.</p>
