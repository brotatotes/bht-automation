	 11:31 ourselves, (n-5) ' <em> Judged</em> ourselves' is not the same in Greek as ' <em> judged</em> ,' used later in this ver. and in ver. 32, but as ' <em> distinguish</em> the Lord's body,' ver. 29. But 'distinguish' does not imply the active exercise of judgment on our own state, nor a formal scrutiny. Here the force is, If I scrutinize and judge myself, I shall not come under an actual judgment from the Lord's hand. Judging oneself has this force in English, while the Lord's judgment is felt to be a positive result of judgment exercised towards us.</p>
