But 'distinguish' does not imply the active exercise of judgment on our own state, nor a formal scrutiny. Here the force is, If I scrutinize and judge myself, I shall not come under an actual judgment from the Lord's hand. Judging oneself has this force in English, while the Lord's judgment is felt to be a positive result of judgment exercised towards us.
