	 14:12 spirits, (b-9) 'Spiritual gifts,' though in sum the sense, deprives the phrase of its force here. As Gentiles, they were in danger of confounding demons' action with the Holy Spirit; and they did not adequately hold the unity of the Spirit, but looked for a spirit's power and action to distinguish themselves. The apostle was obliged to point out the difference between demons and the Holy Spirit. But the word further tends to show the reality of a personal spirit acting, though for the Christian there be but one, the Spirit of God.</p>
