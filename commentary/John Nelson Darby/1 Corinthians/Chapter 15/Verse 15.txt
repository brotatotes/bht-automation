	 15:15 raised. (a-34) 'Are not raised,' vers. 15,16, applies to the abstract fact whenever it may be; the doctrinal fact as to dead people; 'he (Christ) is raised,' vers. 12,13,16,20, is an accomplished but continuing fact. The English tenses do not always secure this distinction. I have not put 'do not rise,' because then the thought of being raised by God is lost.</p>
