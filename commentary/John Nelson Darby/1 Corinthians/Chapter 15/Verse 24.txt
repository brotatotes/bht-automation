	 15:24 Father; (c-16) It is almost impossible to render the Greek idiom, which unites with one article either two qualities of the same person, or two persons under the same quality. But I prefer this awkward English to 'God, even the Father,' because this phrase is uncertain in doctrine, and might be used as meaning that the Father only is God, which is not the sense.</p>
