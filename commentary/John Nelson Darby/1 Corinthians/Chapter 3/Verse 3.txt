'Carnal,' twice in verse 3, is  sarkinos , a form used, in some places, to express either material or physical or moral ideas. It occurs also in Romans 15:27 ; 1 Corinthians 9:11 ; 2 Corinthians 1:12 ; 2 Corinthians 10:4 ; 1 Peter 2:11 . This last passage, 'fleshly lusts,' shows how the material and moral thoughts run into one another.
