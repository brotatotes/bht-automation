	 4:16 entreat (b-2) <em> Parakaleo</em> . The word has to be rendered very differently in English in different places, and is hard to render, though simple and easy to understand. It means 'to call upon a person so as to stimulate him to anything;' hence 'to exhort, comfort or encourage.' see Note to <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:4">2 Corinthians 1:4</span> . It has a fuller force here than a mere apostolic or pastoral exhortation.</p>
