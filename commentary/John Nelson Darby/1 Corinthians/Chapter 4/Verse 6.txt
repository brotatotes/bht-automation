Amos says, 'The lion has roared,' speaking of God's threatening ways with Israel, as if he were his prey. in thought it is to be transferred to Israel. So here Paul is really speaking of those who came with great pretensions amongst the Corinthians, and he transferred it to himself and Apollos, that he might establish the principle universally, without naming these persons. By saying he 'transferred' it, the application was easy. but one can hardly say that is a figure.
