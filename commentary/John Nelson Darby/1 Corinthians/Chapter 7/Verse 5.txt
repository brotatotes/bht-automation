	 7:5 (b-1) It means to 'deprive another of anything wrongfully.' so that it has the sense of 'rob,' 'defraud;' but with the sense of taking away, or depriving of, what another had a right to. Such is the sense. I have said 'defraud,' as it is the same word as in ch. 6.7,8. The sense is just the same; only here it is of one another.</p>
