Used in vers. 12.28; chs. 3.7,18; 4.4; 5.21; John 13:33 ; Galatians 4:19 patron (h-24)  Parakletos , as 'comforter,' John 14:16 ,John 14:26 ; John 15:26 ; John 16:7 . Christ manages all our affairs for us above; the Holy Spirit below. I use 'patron' in the sense rather of the Roman patron, who maintained the interests of his clients in every way. So Christ on high; the Spirit here for saints.
