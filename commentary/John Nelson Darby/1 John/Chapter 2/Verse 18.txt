	 2:18 children, (f-2) <em> Paidion</em> (diminutive); it has reference to growth. It stands in contrast to 'young men' and 'fathers.' hour, (a-7) John uses 'hour' continually in the sense of 'time,' as <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:35">John 5:35</span> , 'a season.' It is properly a given point of time. With John it is constantly a period characterized by one thing, and hence looked at as only one time. As we say 'the hour of Napoleon's greatness.' come (b-21) 'There have come' ( <em> ginoma<span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:17">1 John 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:17">1 John 1:17</span></em> ) is not from the same word as 'comes' in this verse. It is what did not exist before, but begins or becomes. 'There have come' I believe nearest the sense. The perfect tense conveys the thought that they still exist.</p>
