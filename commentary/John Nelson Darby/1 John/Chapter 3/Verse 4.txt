	 3:4 lawlessness. (m-12) To translate this 'sin is the transgression of the law,' as in A.V., is wrong, and gives a false definition of sin, for sin was in the world, and death as a consequence, before the giving of <em> the</em> law. see <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:13">Romans 5:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:13">Romans 7:13</span> . The Greek reads 'sin is lawlessness,' that is, the absence of the <em> principle</em> of law (not <em> the</em> law), or, in other words, of the control of God over the soul. I ought to have no will of my own, but be in obedience. The statement is reciprocal, and may be read 'lawlessness is sin.'</p>
