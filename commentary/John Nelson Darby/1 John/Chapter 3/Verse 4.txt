(m-12) To translate this 'sin is the transgression of the law,' as in A.V., is wrong, and gives a false definition of sin, for sin was in the world, and death as a consequence, before the giving of  the law. see Romans 5:13 ; Romans 7:13 . The Greek reads 'sin is lawlessness,' that is, the absence of the  principle of law (not  the law), or, in other words, of the control of God over the soul. I ought to have no will of my own, but be in obedience. The statement is reciprocal, and may be read 'lawlessness is sin.'
