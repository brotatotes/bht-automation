	 2:10 mercy. (h-20) I have endeavoured to express the perfect participle of the verb 'to show mercy' by 'enjoying mercy,' and the aorist participle of the same verb by 'having found mercy.' See <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ho+1:10">Hosea 1:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:23">Hosea 2:23</span> .</p>
