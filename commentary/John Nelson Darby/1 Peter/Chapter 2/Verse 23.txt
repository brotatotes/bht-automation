The sense must be 'gave himself up to, suffered all, as accepting all from his hand.' gave himself up to take whatever he sent who would in the end righteously judge. It has the sense of committing any one to the care of another. See Acts 14:26 ; Acts 15:40 . 'committed.' Compare John 19:30 . 'delivered up.'
