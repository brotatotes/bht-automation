	 3:21 demand (n-20) Or 'engagement,' or 'testimony.' The Greek word here translated 'demand' is a very difficult one, and has puzzled all critics and commentators. It means 'a question.' All the commentators speak of its use as a legal term with the sense of contract, or rather stipulations or obligations of a contract. I judge (as usual in these forms) that it refers to the question asked rather than to the asking of the question. The legal use arises from a questioning which settled the terms of the contract, hence called the questioning. I am disposed to think it is the thing demanded. It requires as before God, and has it in baptism as a figure by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It must be remembered that 'of a good conscience' in English may be the thing requested or 'he who requests.' The form of the word in the Greek would rather make it the thing requested or demanded.</p>
