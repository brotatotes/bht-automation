	 3:7 in (g-8) <em> Epi</em> with a dative. Here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:7">2 Corinthians 7:7</span> , the apostle states what gave occasion for comfort to him -- the circumstance, not the cause. It is a similar construction in ver. 9. 'for all the joy.' We can say 'for' perhaps there, but it is the occasion of his thanksgiving; his thanksgiving was conditional; that was necessary to it as a condition precedent.</p>
