	 4:4 sanctification (g-13) <em> Hagiasmos</em> . See Note i at <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span> . possess (h-8) The Greek is not, I think, 'acquire,' but 'come into possession of,' the difference being great in moral things. What I possess myself of, I possess when the action is complete and permanent. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:12">Luke 18:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:19">Luke 21:19</span> . You cannot say 'acquire your souls by patience.' 'Keep,' 'preserve,' is a kindred sense of the word.</p>
