	 5:22 wickedness. (b-7) The distinction between the expressions 'the right' and the word translated 'wickedness' (lit. 'evil') without an article is profoundly beautiful. The latter is looked at as a general thing, a genus, and has kinds or species. They were to hold fast ' <em> the</em> right,' the thing in itself. But we cannot speak of evil in itself as an abstract existence. Its most absolute form is Satan (as 'the wicked one,' see <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:19">Matthew 13:19</span> ), though we may practically speak of 'evil,' but I cannot say 'evilness' as I can 'goodness.' I must suppose an existence of what is good to have an idea of evil. But if I say ' wickedness,' I think of an act or of evil will in someone, malice, and this gives the sense here.</p>
