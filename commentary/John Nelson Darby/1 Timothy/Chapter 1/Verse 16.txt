Paul was a delineation of Christ's ways in  their case, even, I doubt not, in the case of the rebellious Jews hereafter. the whole long-suffering was in Paul's case, so as to picture every case. In those who companied with Christ when alive this was not so, though the grace was really the same but there was not the same showing forth of it.
