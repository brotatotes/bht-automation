	 3:6 fault (h-13) <em> Krima</em> is the subject-matter of which a person had to be accused. They set up the <em> krima</em> of the Lord on the cross; that for which he came into accusation -- the charge. So it is used here. The devil was puffed up with his own excellency, and abode not in the truth. Hence, in a strongly taken sense, our word 'crime.'
