The adversary found in the reproach a motive to exercise his hostility. As to 'adversary,' the habit of Paul is to speak thus of Satan directly when acting through men, because he knew the activity of the adversary, and the part he takes in such matters. To such an adversary reproach is a favoured, accepted motive.
