	 1:13 know (e-14) Or 'own' (personally). Some would render this 'but what ye read.' The word has this sense also; but it refers here, I think, to what they knew and had learnt of him by his being amongst them. recognise (a-23) <em> Epiginosko</em> , 'know well,' as <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:16">Matthew 7:16</span> and 11.27.</p>
