	 11:28 burden (e-16) 'Burden' here means any solicitude or anxiety, but 'care' misleads, because it conveys the idea of taking care of, which is not the sense. Same word as 'anxious care,' <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:22">Matthew 13:22</span> , and 'care,' <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:7">1 Peter 5:7</span> .</p>
