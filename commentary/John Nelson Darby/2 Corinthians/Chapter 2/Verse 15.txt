	 2:15 odour (b-6) An allusion to the Roman triumphal processions, in which sweet odours were used, and when often many captives were killed, while others were spared. The 'sweet odour' was therefore unto death or unto life, as the gospel when received is a means of life, but when not received, however sweet it may be, is only a cause for condemnation.</p>
