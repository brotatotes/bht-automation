But I think  touto auto can hardly mean that; and in the following words he refers it to the present time, when he  was coming. It is evident that, if  egrapsa (ver. 4) refers to his first letter, it must be translated 'I wrote;' but  ekrina , 'I have judged,' (ver. 1) refers to the general determination of his mind.  Egrapsa clearly often refers to what is written in the letter that contains it, and then we must say in English, 'I have written.'
