	 3:11 annulled (a-4) 'That annulled,' or 'done away,' may appear a little harsh, but the apostle uses it as a formula for the old covenant done away in Christ. If this be borne in mind, the sense will be clearer by the use of it. It contrasts 'that annulled' with 'that which abides.' so vers. 13 and 14.</p>
