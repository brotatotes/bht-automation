	 3:14 darkened, (b-6) As 'hardened,' <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:5">Mark 3:5</span> ; 'blinded,' <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:7">Romans 11:7</span> . annulled. (c-25) I have no doubt that the text is right, and that Moses covered his face <em> while</em> he talked to the people, and that the Hebrew, <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:33">Exodus 34:33</span> , means nothing else, and ver. 34 proves it.</p>
