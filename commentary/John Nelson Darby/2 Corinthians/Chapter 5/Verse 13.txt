But the sense is, I think, 'If he lost the blessed calculations of love which was his path towards men, it was to be out of himself with God, and for God.' a blessed alternative. His ecstasy was not excitement or folly, but if out of himself it was with God; if sober, it was the calculation of love for their good.
