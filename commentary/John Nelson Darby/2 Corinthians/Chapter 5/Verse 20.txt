	 5:20 were] (g-10) 'As of God beseeching;' 'as though,' or 'as if,' is too much similarity or comparison. God being in Christ, and they Christ's ambassadors, they besought on God's behalf. He was as beseeching by them. The apostle will not say God was beseeching, but softens it by 'as it were.' yet it amounted to that, as done on his behalf. It is difficult to translate, though the sense is most evident and beautiful.</p>
