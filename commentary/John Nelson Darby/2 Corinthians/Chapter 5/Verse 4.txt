	 5:4 yet (g-13) Or 'though meanwhile,' 'yet in such sort that.' It is a necessary condition of the right understanding of ver. 4. 'Clothed' is the same word as 'to have put on' in ver. 2. For 'groan,' vers. 2 and 4, see <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:34">Mark 7:34</span> .</p>
