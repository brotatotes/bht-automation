Instead of Paul having to press this grace on the Macedonians, they beg of him the grace and fellowship (  koinonia ) of the administration; that is, to be the instrument (though an apostle) of its manifestation by them. The 'grace and fellowship' is the active exercise of grace towards the Jewish saints. This they begged of Paul. (See ver. 19.)
