I do not say 'comfort,' as that is rather conveyed in  paramutheomai , so translated in 1 Thessalonians 2:11 ; 1 Thessalonians 5:14 ; 'console,' John 11:19 ,John 11:31 ; and 'consolation,' 1 Corinthians 14:3 . The difference is slight, but here, as in Acts 20:0 , there is the sense of 'cheered,' and this might replace 'encourage' and 'encouragement' if there were a suitable noun.
