Followed by  eis with an accusative, as frequently in John, it is to believe on a person as an object of faith, as John 14:1 ('ye believe on God, believe also on me'). Followed by  epi with an accusative, it goes on to the idea of confidence. I rest my faith on him, yet with a more general idea of looking to him with this confidence. It is only used thus six times, so far as I am aware. Acts 9:42 ; Acts 11:17 ; Acts 16:31 ; Acts 22:19 ; Romans 4:5 ,Romans 4:24 . Followed by  epi with a dative, it is used only in Luke 24:25 , and in the three passages where Isaiah 28:16 is quoted, Romans 9:33 ; Romans 10:11 ; 1 Peter 2:6 , where it is confidence in, or reliance upon, a person or thing. Followed by  en with a dative, it occurs more seldom, and refers to believing in the truth of a thing, receiving a statement as true, as Mark 1:15 ('believe in the glad tidings').
