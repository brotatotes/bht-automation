	 2:10 endure (g-5) 'Endure' has a double sense in English. 'to last,' and 'to go through suffering patiently.' Here it is the latter, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:7">Romans 2:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:25">Romans 8:25</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:11">James 5:11</span> . obtain (h-18) Not in an active sense, but simply get it, not miss it.</p>
