There it was to get rid of the old leaven out of the lump; here the one who names the name of the Lord has to purge himself from among the vessels. Hence we have an additional preposition which is rendered by 'separating from.' Lit. 'purified himself away from these.' Master, (c-26)  Despotes , as Acts 4:24 .
