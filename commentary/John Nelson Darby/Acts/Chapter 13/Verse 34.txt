It may, and sometimes does, mean 'holy,' but is not the regular word for it, which is  Hagios . here it answers to  chasid in Hebrew, which is contrasted in Psalms 89:19 with 'holy' (  kadosh ), which is applied to Jehovah (ver. 18). The beginning of the psalm speaks of the mercies (  chasadim ) or gracious ways of the Lord, and then in ver. 19 of that One in whom these graces or mercies are centred and conveyed, the Christ, to whom the apostle here applies it. The word  chesed is generally 'grace' and 'loving-kindness' in God;  chasid , 'pious,' 'gracious' applied to men, and 'merciful,' 'holy' to God. see Hebrews 7:26 .
