	 13:34 thus. (e-18) See <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:3">Isaiah 55:3</span> . mercies (f-26) 'Mercies' and 'gracious one' ( <em> Hosios</em> ) are the same word, only singular and plural. It may, and sometimes does, mean 'holy,' but is not the regular word for it, which is <em> Hagios</em> . here it answers to <em> chasid</em> in Hebrew, which is contrasted in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:19">Psalms 89:19</span> with 'holy' ( <em> kadosh</em> ), which is applied to Jehovah (ver. 18). The beginning of the psalm speaks of the mercies ( <em> chasadim</em> ) or gracious ways of the Lord, and then in ver. 19 of that One in whom these graces or mercies are centred and conveyed, the Christ, to whom the apostle here applies it. The word <em> chesed</em> is generally 'grace' and 'loving-kindness' in God; <em> chasid</em> , 'pious,' 'gracious' applied to men, and 'merciful,' 'holy' to God. see <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26">Hebrews 7:26</span> .</p>
