	 1:2 up; (a-21) The word means 'receiving,' but with the prefix ( <em> ana</em> ) 'up,' as here, it has the active sense of 'taking up.' It is so translated except in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span> . The more passive reception is seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:21">Acts 3:21</span> , where another word is used.</p>
