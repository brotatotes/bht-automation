	 2:47 assembly] (e-16) See Note g, ch. 3.1. saved. (f-23) The remnant of Israel whom God was sparing. The Lord now added these to the Christian assembly. The present participle as here gives the character instead of the fact; as I might say, 'the being spared ones;' it is the class of persons God was then saving. It is not a doubt as to their being saved, nor a state, but a class. see <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:23">Luke 13:23</span> .</p>
