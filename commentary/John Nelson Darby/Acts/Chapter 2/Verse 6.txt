It was what happened at the place which brought the crowd there. it was not the mighty rushing wind being heard everywhere. The end of the verse goes to confirm this. What struck those who came was hearing their own tongues. Genesis 45:16 and Jeremiah 50:46 are examples. The rumours of Jacob's coming spread to Pharaoh's house.
