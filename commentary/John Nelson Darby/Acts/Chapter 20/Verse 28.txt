	 20:28 purchased (b-29) Middle voice; reflexive. see Note e, <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span> . own. (c-35) I am fully satisfied that this is the right translation of ver. 28. To make it a question of the divinity of Christ (which I hold to be of the foundation of Christianity) is absurd. It has been questioned whether 'of his own' can be used thus absolutely in the singular. But we have it in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:19">John 15:19</span> , and in the neuter singular for material things, <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:32">Acts 4:32</span> . The torturing of the passage by copyists arose, I believe, from not seeing, the real sense of it; a touching expression of the love of God.</p>
