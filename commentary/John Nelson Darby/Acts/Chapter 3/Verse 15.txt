	 3:15 originator (a-3) This word is difficult to render in English. It is a 'leader,' but it is more. It is used for one who begins and sets a matter on. The Greek word occurs four times in the New Testament, here and ch. 5.31; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span> . In <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span> it means, 'he began and finished the whole course;' 'the origin' or 'originator,' though the word is harsh in connexion with life. The word is only used of our Lord.</p>
