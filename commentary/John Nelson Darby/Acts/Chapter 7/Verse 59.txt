The Authorized Version seems to separate God and the Lord Jesus. 'Calling on the Lord' would leave out God. The Spirit of God, I doubt not, has purposely left out both 'Lord' and 'God'. No one can be called upon really but God, so that the word has great force as used here. I have said 'praying' for want of a better word.
