	 1:6 favour (f-16) 'Taken us into his favour,' i.e. 'put us into a position of grace and favour.' The Greek word is used here and <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:28">Luke 1:28</span> . 'Accepted us' is too formal a doctrine here. 'Shown us grace or favour' does not give the force, for then 'the Beloved' would be merely the instrument. It is 'in the Beloved' that we enter into favour. An alternative reading is, 'the favour or acceptance in grace, which he has freely bestowed upon us.'</p>
