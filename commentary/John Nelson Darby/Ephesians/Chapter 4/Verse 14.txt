	 4:14 in (i-22) The form of the Greek phrase makes it somewhat difficult to translate. I do not think that the phrase 'in the sleight of,' &amp;c., is in connection with 'tossed and carried about,' but, in sense, with 'that teaching.' The cheating, as of dice-players, and still more methodic craft, characterized the teaching. 'In the sleight of men' marks the power and character of the teaching. What I have given is literal, and is sufficiently clear. 'that' is emphatic.</p>
