	 2:14 Peter (f-22) See Note, ch. 1.18. not (h-8) The present tense here is characteristic; it is not the present of time; as <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:11">Acts 25:11</span> , 'have done any wrong,' and <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:14">John 8:14</span> , 'I come.' Perhaps we might say 'saw them not walking,' but it is too free.</p>
