	 4:31 servant's (d-8) Or 'bondmaid,' <em> paidiske</em> (as <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:13">Acts 12:13</span> ). Though in practice the word amounted to the same as a bondmaid, yet the Greek root is essentially different from that of <em> doulos</em> , a bondman, or slave.</p>
