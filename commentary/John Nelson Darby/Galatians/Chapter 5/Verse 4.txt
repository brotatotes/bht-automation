	 5:4 profit (i-6) The word translated here 'deprived of all profit' is hard to translate. The active form means to render anything useless and unprofitable, or miss an opportunity; as 'annulled,' <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span> . Here it is passive and with the preposition ( <em> apo</em> ) 'from.' Hence it is to be deprived of the profit or effect of anything. It is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:6">Romans 7:6</span> ('we are clear') in the same form as here, for our deliverance from under the law; only there it refers not to profit, but to the action of the law. It had <em> for them</em> become void of effect. So here Christ. What the word speaks of is, not separation from Christ personally, but from what is for us in him.</p>
