The active form means to render anything useless and unprofitable, or miss an opportunity; as 'annulled,' Ephesians 2:15 . Here it is passive and with the preposition (  apo ) 'from.' Hence it is to be deprived of the profit or effect of anything. It is used in Romans 7:6 ('we are clear') in the same form as here, for our deliverance from under the law; only there it refers not to profit, but to the action of the law. It had  for them become void of effect. So here Christ. What the word speaks of is, not separation from Christ personally, but from what is for us in him.
