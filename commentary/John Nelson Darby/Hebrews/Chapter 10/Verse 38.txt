The sense runs well and is the same. he (e-10) Or 'any one.' The apostle is contrasting two characters; the one who perishes, and the one who saves, preserves, his life (spiritually, of course). The professing Hebrews were in danger of drawing back. It is certain that in what the apostle  quotes (Habakkuk 2:3 ,Habakkuk 2:4 ) there is no reference in the word 'he' to the just who lives by faith. The Hebrew and the LXX prove this. All through this Epistle the Hebrews who acknowledged Jesus as Messiah are treated as a people; that is, the whole people accepted on condition of believing. So Peter. 'but are now the people of God.' And here. 'Jesus, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood.' In this Epistle there is nothing of the sanctification of the Spirit; but the writer urges as a practical truth 'the just shall live by faith.' and then he says, 'and, if he draw back;' that is, any one holding this position of a professed believer; but if he was living by faith in him,  he was not drawing back. In a word, drawing back is one character, living by faith another.
