	 11:17 himself (f-15) The Greek implies the will or action of the person receiving. It is used only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:7">Acts 28:7</span> . Publius received, 'took,' Paul and his company into his house. It has the sense of taking on oneself physically, or as a debt or responsibility. Abraham's own mind had taken up and appropriated the promises, and yet he gave up Isaac. It was not merely they were given and taken away, with which he had nothing to do; but he had adopted them by faith in his heart, and trusted God enough to give them up according to flesh.</p>
