	 2:14 partake (o-5) <em> Koinoneo</em> . that is, they are in that condition, as their common lot. manner, (p-14) 'In like manner' is strictly 'near to,' as <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:27">Philippians 2:27</span> , 'close to.' in (q-17) There is an intended difference here between the words for 'partake' ( <em> koinoneo</em> ) and 'took part in' ( <em> metecho</em> ), ver. 14. The first, referring to the children, is a common equal sharing of the nature. The second, referring to Christ, means, he took a part in it; and refers always to something outside myself, but which I take, or take a part in. The first work refers to a joint participation in that which belongs to me or to known fellowship. The second is used in ch. 5.13, 'partakes of milk,' in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:10">1 Corinthians 9:10</span> , where the reaper gets a share in the sower's hope, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:17">1 Corinthians 10:17</span> ,<span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:21">1 Corinthians 10:21</span> ,<span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:30">1 Corinthians 10:30</span> , 'partake,' where 'partaking' ( <em> metecho</em> ) is proof of participation in fellowship ( <em> koinonia</em> ), ver. 16. The word does not say how far the taking share went. has (r-28) Or 'who had;' lit. 'having,' without reference to time. Cf. ch. 13.20.</p>
