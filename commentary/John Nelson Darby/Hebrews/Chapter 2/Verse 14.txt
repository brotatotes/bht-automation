The first, referring to the children, is a common equal sharing of the nature. The second, referring to Christ, means, he took a part in it; and refers always to something outside myself, but which I take, or take a part in. The first work refers to a joint participation in that which belongs to me or to known fellowship. The second is used in ch. 5.13, 'partakes of milk,' in 1 Corinthians 9:10 , where the reaper gets a share in the sower's hope, and in 1 Corinthians 10:17 ,1 Corinthians 10:21 ,1 Corinthians 10:30 , 'partake,' where 'partaking' (  metecho ) is proof of participation in fellowship (  koinonia ), ver. 16. The word does not say how far the taking share went. has (r-28) Or 'who had;' lit. 'having,' without reference to time. Cf. ch. 13.20.
