	 2:16 hand], (a-12) It means 'to take hold of,' but it is constantly used for 'taking up a person to help him,' though in other senses as well. We say, 'he took him by the hand,' but this may be too familiar. It is used in the sense of 'taking hold of,' literally 'deliver.' The same word is used in this verse as to 'the seed of Abraham,' and also in the quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:0">Jeremiah 31:0</span> in ch. 8.9, but there 'hand' is added in the Greek.</p>
