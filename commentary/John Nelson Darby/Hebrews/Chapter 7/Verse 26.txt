	 7:26 holy, (i-8) There are two Greek words used for 'holy' in the New Testament -- <em> hagios</em> and <em> hosios</em> ( <em> hosios</em> is used in this passage). The word most commonly used is <em> hagios</em> (corresponding to the Hebrew word <em> kadosh</em> ). This, when applied to God, designates him as holy, knowing good and evil perfectly, and absolutely willing good and no evil. When applied to men, it designates them as separated, set apart to God from evil and from common use. The corresponding verb is commonly translated 'to sanctify;' and the word when used as a substantive is the ordinary word for 'saints.' The word <em> hosios</em> , on the other hand, conveys the thought of pious, that which is not profane. It speaks of God in mercy and grace, and of Christ, in whom all gracious qualities are concentrated, as well as perfect piety. It corresponds to the Hebrew <em> chesed</em> , of which the plural ( <em> chasadim</em> ) is the word translated 'mercies' or 'sure mercies' in the Old Testament. When applied to men, it is in general the sum of qualities which suit and form the divine character in man, as opposed to the human will. It refers to the exercise of gracious suitable affections in the relationships in which we are to God, and (e.g.) to parents. Hence, as suitable affections to God practically constitute holiness, the word is used in this sense for holy. The two Hebrew words are used side by side in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:18">Psalms 89:18</span> ,<span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:19">Psalms 89:19</span> , 'The Holy One ( <em> kadosh</em> ) of Israel is our king. ... Then thou spakest in vision to thy Holy One ( <em> Chasid</em> ).' The beginning of the Psalm speaks of the mercies or gracious ways ( <em> chasadim</em> ) of the Lord. (See, for <em> hosios</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:27">Acts 2:27</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:34">Acts 13:34</span> ,<span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:35">Acts 13:35</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:8">1 Timothy 2:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:8">Titus 1:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="re+15:4">Revelation 15:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="re+16:5">Revelation 16:5</span> .) harmless, (a-9) Or 'guileless,' without an evil thought.</p>
