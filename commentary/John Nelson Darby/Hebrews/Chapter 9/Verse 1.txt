	 9:1 service, (c-9) <em> Latreia</em> , from the same root as <em> latreuo</em> in ver. 6, see Note e. one. (d-15) The form of words here is greatly disputed. The grammatical order would require it to be translated 'the holy universal order;' but the word, it is contended, does not exist with this sense. I have not ventured so to translate it. I doubt it to be the same as <em> kosmion</em> , 'ornament.' <em> Kosmos</em> is 'the world,' from the order which is in it. The tabernacle represented all this order, the pattern of heavenly things. Hence, if <em> kosmikon</em> be used, a neuter adjective for a substantive, or coined in this use, it would mean 'the holy order of the tabernacle, which represented the vast scene in which God's glory is displayed in Christ.' If not, we must say, 'and the sanctuary, a worldly one.' 'A worldly sanctuary' is not the sense. 'A worldly sanctuary' it is not, according to regular grammar and the constant usage of the Greek language.</p>
