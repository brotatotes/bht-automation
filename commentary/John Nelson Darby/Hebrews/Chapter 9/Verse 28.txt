The first time He bore our sins, and was made sin (being sinless); but now, having put sins wholly away for them who look for Him, and having made them partakers of the whole fruit of his sacrifice to put sin away, He appears to  them without having to say, or need to have anything to say, to it. It is gone, as regards them, by his first coming.
