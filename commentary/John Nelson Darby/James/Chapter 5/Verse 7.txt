In vers. 7 and 8 the verb  makrothumeo , and in ver. 10 the noun  makrothumia , as Hebrews 6:12 . In Romans 2:4 ; 2 Timothy 4:2 ; 1 Peter 3:20 , this reads 'longsuffering' in this translation. In ver. 11 and elsewhere 'endurance' is  hupomone , also translated 'patience' at times, according to the context. In general,  makrothumia expresses patience in respect of persons, but  hupomone in respect of things. The man who is 'longsuffering' (  makrothumia ) does not suffer himself easily to be provoked by injurious persons, or to be angered, 2 Timothy 4:2 . The man who is 'patient' (  hupomone ), though under great trials, bears up, and does not lose heart or courage, Romans 5:3 ; 2 Corinthians 1:6 .
