	 5:7 patience, (e-2) Aorist. see Note a. patience (f-22) Two Greek words are translated 'patience' in the New Testament. In vers. 7 and 8 the verb <em> makrothumeo</em> , and in ver. 10 the noun <em> makrothumia</em> , as <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:12">Hebrews 6:12</span> . In <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:2">2 Timothy 4:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:20">1 Peter 3:20</span> , this reads 'longsuffering' in this translation. In ver. 11 and elsewhere 'endurance' is <em> hupomone</em> , also translated 'patience' at times, according to the context. In general, <em> makrothumia</em> expresses patience in respect of persons, but <em> hupomone</em> in respect of things. The man who is 'longsuffering' ( <em> makrothumia</em> ) does not suffer himself easily to be provoked by injurious persons, or to be angered, <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:2">2 Timothy 4:2</span> . The man who is 'patient' ( <em> hupomone</em> ), though under great trials, bears up, and does not lose heart or courage, <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:3">Romans 5:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:6">2 Corinthians 1:6</span> .</p>
