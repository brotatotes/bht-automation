Elsewhere only in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:30">Matthew 9:30</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:43">Mark 1:43</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:5">Mark 14:5</span> , translated, 'sharply charged,' 'spoke very angrily.'
