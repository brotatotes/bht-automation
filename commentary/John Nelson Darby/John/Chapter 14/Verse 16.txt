There are times when they may be used indiscriminately, at other times each has a sense peculiar to itself.  erotao expressing a familiar request to a person where intimacy exists [or equality, either assumed or actual];  aiteo , the request rather for something by an inferior to his superior. The disciples employ both of these words in their relations with Jesus, but only  aiteo with relation to the Father. In his relations with his Father, Jesus employs  erotao but not  aiteo . Martha uses  aiteo in ch. 11.22. For the difference between the two, compare John 16:23 . In ch. 14.16 the word is  erotao ; in vers. 13 and 14  aiteo . Comforter, (b-13) One who carries on the cause of any one and helps him. This Christ did on earth; this (1 John 2:1 ) he does now in heaven, and the Holy Spirit on earth 'manages our cause, our affairs, for us.' If 'solicitor' were not too common, it just answers the sense.
