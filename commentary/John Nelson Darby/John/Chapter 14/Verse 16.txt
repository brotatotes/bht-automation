	 14:16 beg (a-4) In the latter chapters of John's Gospel, in order to maintain the distinction, frequently important, between <em> erotao</em> and <em> aiteo</em> , the first is translated 'demand' [except <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16">John 14:16</span> (beg)], the second 'ask.' There are times when they may be used indiscriminately, at other times each has a sense peculiar to itself. <em> erotao</em> expressing a familiar request to a person where intimacy exists [or equality, either assumed or actual]; <em> aiteo</em> , the request rather for something by an inferior to his superior. The disciples employ both of these words in their relations with Jesus, but only <em> aiteo</em> with relation to the Father. In his relations with his Father, Jesus employs <em> erotao</em> but not <em> aiteo</em> . Martha uses <em> aiteo</em> in ch. 11.22. For the difference between the two, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:23">John 16:23</span> . In ch. 14.16 the word is <em> erotao</em> ; in vers. 13 and 14 <em> aiteo</em> . Comforter, (b-13) One who carries on the cause of any one and helps him. This Christ did on earth; this (<span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span> ) he does now in heaven, and the Holy Spirit on earth 'manages our cause, our affairs, for us.' If 'solicitor' were not too common, it just answers the sense.</p>
