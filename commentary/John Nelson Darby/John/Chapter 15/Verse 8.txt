	 15:8 this (b-2) 'In this' refers to what follows. no one, I think, can be familiar with John's writings and doubt it. Thus the <em> Father</em> is glorified and they become disciples of his. mine. (c-18) Perhaps more exactly, 'In this will my Father have been glorified that ye have borne much fruit, and ye will have become,' &amp;c.</p>
