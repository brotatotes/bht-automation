	 1:2 <em> He</em> (c-1) In John, the personal pronoun, generally emphatic in Greek where inserted, is used so constantly that it can hardly be considered such in many cases, but certain instances which are considered to be more definitely emphatic are given in italics. The same spirit of emphasis causes the very frequent use of <em> ekeinos</em> for the third person ('he,' 'they,' c.). Its sense is 'that,' contrasted with 'this,' and hence is emphatic as 'that man' in English, sometimes having the sense of 'such a one as that.' A number of cases where this word also is used emphatically have also been indicated.</p>
