The former signifies the love of friendship, and is more intimate and intense. It is here translated 'I am attached to,' and in ch. 16.27 'have affection for.'  Agapao , more often used in the New Testament, is more general, and signifies love as the settled disposition of a person rather than as an emotion. It is used for God's love to man (except in Titus 3:4 , where a compound word is used which embodies the word  phileo ) and for the love of men to God. Both words are used for the love of the Father for the Son,  phileo once only, John 5:20 , and  agapao in John 3:35 , &c.. and for the love of Christ for his own,  phileo in John 11:3 and  agapao in John 11:5 and elsewhere.  Phileo is used in John 16:27 , of the love of the Father for the disciples, and of the love of the disciples for Christ.
