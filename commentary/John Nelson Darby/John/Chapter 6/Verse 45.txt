	 6:45 prophets, (h-6) <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:13">Isaiah 54:13</span> . from (a-20) <em> Para</em> with a genitive (as 'of' God, ver. 46). It is what is received directly from the Father. I add 'himself' that its immediateness may be felt, which is the point of the sentence.</p>
