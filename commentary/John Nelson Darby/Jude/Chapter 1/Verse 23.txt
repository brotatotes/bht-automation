	 1:23 fire; (g-11) The sense of this passage is much disputed and depends on conflicting manuscripts. I have left it as generally taken (see A.V.), but am disposed to think that the word translated 'have compassion' should be omitted, in which case the passage would read. 'And some who dispute correct; and some save, snatching them out of the fire with fear, hating,' c. Perhaps this is the best reading. He tells them in fact to make a difference. If men contested, he put them to silence if not, he saved them with fear, snatching them out of the fire, hating every trace of evil.</p>
