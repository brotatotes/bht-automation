For the second, the Greek certainly means 'possess,' as 'owners,' Acts 4:34 . See 1 Thessalonians 4:4 , which evidently does not mean 'obtain a wife,' as alleged. There is the idea in the word of 'having by getting.' see Matthew 10:9 Luke 18:12 . The idea is, 'they would have Messiah's deliverance,' and it is so worded as to allow that it would be a better deliverance to the killed, though some would win life here below.
