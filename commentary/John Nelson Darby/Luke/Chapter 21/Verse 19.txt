	 21:19 souls. (b-7) Or 'possess your souls.' In the first sense, that of the text, it is the same thought as <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:13">Matthew 24:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:33">Luke 17:33</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:25">Matthew 16:25</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:24">Luke 9:24</span> , c.. see <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:13">Mark 13:13</span> . For the second, the Greek certainly means 'possess,' as 'owners,' <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:34">Acts 4:34</span> . See <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:4">1 Thessalonians 4:4</span> , which evidently does not mean 'obtain a wife,' as alleged. There is the idea in the word of 'having by getting.' see <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:9">Matthew 10:9</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:12">Luke 18:12</span> . The idea is, 'they would have Messiah's deliverance,' and it is so worded as to allow that it would be a better deliverance to the killed, though some would win life here below.</p>
