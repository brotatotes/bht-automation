	 6:1 second-first (d-8) The expression 'second-first sabbath' is explained thus. The year, as regards the worship of God amongst the Jews, began with the month Abib (Heb. 'green corn'), which lasted from the middle of March to the middle of April. In <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="le+23:0">Leviticus 23:0</span> , in which we find the Jewish feasts described, we may observe that in addition to the general and weekly recurring feasts of the sabbath, the chief feasts begin with the passover (the 14th of Abib), and that, in immediate connexion with it, it was ordained that on the day after the following sabbath the first-fruits of the corn should be offered in the ear, a foreshadowing of the resurrection of Jesus which took place on the morrow after the sabbath of the passover week, or feast of unleavened bread. The sabbath immediately following the passover was therefore the 'first' or great sabbath, and after the offering of the first-fruits on the morrow after the sabbath, the first day of the week, the harvest might be commenced, and the new corn eaten, which was not permitted before, even though corn stood ripe in the fields. On the following sabbath, the 'second' after the 'first' or great sabbath, we see that the disciples ate ears of corn on the way, for the offering of the first-fruits had already taken place on the first day of the week; and, as seven weeks or sabbaths were counted from this day to the feast of Pentecost, it was therefore the 'first' of these seven sabbaths, or the 'second' with reference to the great sabbath of the Passover.</p>
