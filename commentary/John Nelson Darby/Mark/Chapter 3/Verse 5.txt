	 3:5 distressed (c-8) The Greek word is found here only. It is questioned whether it means 'sympathizing grief' (as LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:20">Psalms 69:20</span> ;) or 'deep grief.' There is, I apprehend, sorrow for, with an intensive force in it; not sympathy, which is feeling with, but feeling what a state they were in, with grief for it.</p>
