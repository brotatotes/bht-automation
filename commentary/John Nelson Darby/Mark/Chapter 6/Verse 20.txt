Which of these applications is the just one is the question. It is used four times (three besides this); twice for 'preserved,' as the wine and the bottles, Matthew 9:17 ; Luke 5:38 ; once for Mary's 'keeping' things in her heart, Luke 2:19 . I should have preferred 'observed him diligently,' but that I do not find it used of  a person , meaning 'paying attention to what he says.' It is used of words and opinions, but then it has still the force of 'keeping them safe.'
