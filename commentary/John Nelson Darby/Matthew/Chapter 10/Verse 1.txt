	 10:1 power (d-12) Or 'authority.' <em> exousia</em> not <em> dunamis</em> . More than authority, but not simply <em> dunamis</em> ; it is more than <em> dunamis</em> , as it includes the right to exercise this. Hence 'power' is nearer to it in English. <em> dunamis</em> is the ability to do a thing. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:36">Luke 4:36</span> .</p>
