	 13:12 whoever (a-2) who (a-20) <em> Hostis</em> . as ch. 7.24. abundance; (b-17) As to the good thing given. It is abstract; the object is not to day what is given, but the <em> manner</em> of God's dealing. What is given is caused to be in abundance. We may say, also, 'he shall be in abundance,' a word used of the thing and of the person possessing it</p>
