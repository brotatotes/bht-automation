	 13:14 in (c-2) i.e. what is wanting is supplied and so 'filled up.' Since Esaias's time there had been much of this, but the rejection of Christ completed and filled it up. 'In them' has therefore the sense of 'as to,' 'in their case.' 'By' would cast more on their act and responsibility. <em> epi</em> seems to have been introduced to avoid this sense of it. says, (d-12) <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:9-10">Isaiah 6:9-10</span> . not (e-19) not (e-27) Emphatic negative.</p>
