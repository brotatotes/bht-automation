	 2:23 through (a-19) <em> Dia</em> . see ch. 1.22; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:15">Jeremiah 31:15</span> . that (c-11) 'That that might be,' ch. 1.22; 'so that that should be,' as here; and, 'then was fulfilled,' ver. 17, are never confounded in the quotations of the Old Testament. The first is the object of the prophecy; the second, not simply <em> its</em> object, but an event which was within the scope and intention of the prophecy; the third is merely a case in point, where what happened was an illustration of what was said in the prophecy. Nazaraean. (d-27) Perhaps a reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:1">Isaiah 11:1</span> , the Hebrew for 'Branch' being <em> Netzer</em> .</p>
