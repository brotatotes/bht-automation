	 3:10 to (l-7) I so translate, because 'laid to' implies actual execution. perhaps not meant so by the translators, but merely to be as literal as possible. but 'applied to' ('to,' <em> pros</em> . see ch. 21.1) is more the moral way of acting -- something more than 'set for' ('for,' <em> eis</em> ) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:34">Luke 2:34</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="php+1:16">Philippians 1:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:3">1 Thessalonians 3:3</span> . producing (a-17) Present tense; it is characteristic. see ch. 1.19.</p>
