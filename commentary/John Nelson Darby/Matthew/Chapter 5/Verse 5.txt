It was not the haughty Pharisee or the violent who were to have it. God would give it to the meek of the earth that waited on Him. I have put 'earth' as giving a larger thought, as characteristic, not local only. Here  ge in Greek, agrees with  erets , in Hebrew. See Notes, 1 Samuel 2:8 ; Psalms 2:8 .
