	 5:5 earth. (f-9) Or 'land.' This is a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ps+37:11">Psalms 37:11</span> . For a Jew, inheriting the land was inheriting the earth, and vice versa. It was not the haughty Pharisee or the violent who were to have it. God would give it to the meek of the earth that waited on Him. I have put 'earth' as giving a larger thought, as characteristic, not local only. Here <em> ge</em> in Greek, agrees with <em> erets</em> , in Hebrew. See Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1sa+2:8">1 Samuel 2:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:8">Psalms 2:8</span> .</p>
