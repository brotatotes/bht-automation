	 1:9 abound (h-9) It is a question how far the abounding applies to the love itself; or, supposing the love, that it should grow in these qualities. It is, I think, determined to be the latter by <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:8">Ephesians 1:8</span> . It means 'grow in these,' yet love that would grow in them.</p>
