Ambrose, till the Benedictine edition, was given as reading  Theo(i) , 'serving God the Spirit.' but they give  Theou , 'serving the Spirit of God.' The diplomatic evidence is in favour of  Theou , 'who worship by the Spirit of God.' but I do not feel assured of its correctness. aleph has  Theou ; but after all aleph is only an Alexandrian witness of the completest kind. But it is anything but a correct manuscript. In Revelation it is very incorrect indeed. D and P (in Tisch. M.S.I.) read  Theo-(i) , and so Am Syrr.
