	 3:3 God, (a-12) T.R. reads 'God in spirit.' The reading was in question as early as Ambrose and Augustine. Augustine reads both. Ambrose, till the Benedictine edition, was given as reading <em> Theo(i)</em> , 'serving God the Spirit.' but they give <em> Theou</em> , 'serving the Spirit of God.' The diplomatic evidence is in favour of <em> Theou</em> , 'who worship by the Spirit of God.' but I do not feel assured of its correctness. aleph has <em> Theou</em> ; but after all aleph is only an Alexandrian witness of the completest kind. But it is anything but a correct manuscript. In Revelation it is very incorrect indeed. D and P (in Tisch. M.S.I.) read <em> Theo-(i)</em> , and so Am Syrr.</p>
