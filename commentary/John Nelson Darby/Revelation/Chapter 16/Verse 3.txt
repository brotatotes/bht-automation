But I apprehend 'it' (ver. 3) and 'they' (ver. 4) are the sense, in spite of accuracy of grammar. blood took place as a consequence in what is spoken of. The sense is more striking as it stands in Greek considered as a vision. What he saw took that character. soul (k-23) Lit. 'every soul of life.' a Hebraism.
