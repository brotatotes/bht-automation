	 16:4 became (i-19) Or 'there was blood.' <em> Ginomai</em> . see <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span> . Strictly 'and there was,' or 'came to be,' 'blood.' But I apprehend 'it' (ver. 3) and 'they' (ver. 4) are the sense, in spite of accuracy of grammar: blood took place as a consequence in what is spoken of. The sense is more striking as it stands in Greek considered as a vision. What he saw took that character.</p>
