	 19:8 righteousnesses (e-24) <em> Dikaioma</em> . see <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:32">Romans 1:32</span> . In Hebrew the plural of acts expressing a quality is used for the abstract quality itself. This may be the case, by analogy, here. See <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ps+11:7">Psalms 11:7</span> , where, in Hebrew, it is 'righteousnesses,' but it is actual, not imputed, righteousness.</p>
