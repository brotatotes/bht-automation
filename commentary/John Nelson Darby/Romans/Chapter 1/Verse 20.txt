	 1:20 divinity, (h-30) What is characteristic of God; <em> not</em> 'Godhead,' as in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9">Colossians 2:9</span> . render (i-35) The Greek expression does not affirm that they are so, but states the consequence of the display of creative glory in what was seen. 'So that they should,' or 'might be,' is ambiguous in English, and implies purpose. Hence I have said 'so as to render,' which gives the sense.</p>
