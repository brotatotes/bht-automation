	 1:4 Spirit (h-11) In many cases it is impossible to put a small or a large S rightly to the word Spirit, as the presence and power of the Holy Spirit characterizes the state, and that and the state are both included; so it is here. It is divine, not merely human, perfectness, and by the Holy Spirit, yet it is Christ's state. But it is not merely a state, but that state which consists in the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, and is the absolute expression of it. On the whole, I put a large S here, but it is the Son manifested on earth who is spoken of, and characteristic of him. Resurrection was the proof, but he who had eyes to see, saw what came in flesh justified in the Spirit even when here, the same Spirit which was quickening power in resurrection, as <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:18">1 Peter 3:18</span> . holiness, (i-13) <em> Hagiosune</em> , the nature and quality itself, as <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:1">2 Corinthians 7:1</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span> .
