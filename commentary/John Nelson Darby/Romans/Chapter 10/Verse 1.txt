	 10:1 delight (i-3) i.e. his good pleasure, the thought that delighted him. The order of the words gives the force of 'own,' or an emphatic ' <em> my</em> .' The connection of the beginning of the phrase with ' <em> for</em> salvation' is not very grammatical; but this abruptness of style is usual with Paul. See Note, ch. 9.3. them (k-17) Some authorities have 'for Israel,' but 'for them' is the more correct reading, and, occupied as the apostle is with his subject, is far more beautiful. 'For salvation' is perhaps a little obscure; but what he says is, what would satisfy his heart was that; and his prayers tended that way, not to their judgment, evil as they were, and rejecters of Christ. But the judgment was not yet revealed.</p>
