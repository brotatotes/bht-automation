(e-20) This means that the Jews would not believe in the mercy shown to the Gentiles, and thus lost the glad tidings of the grace of God for themselves; and thus, their right to the promises being gone, they come in at the end as objects of mere mercy, as any poor Gentile might be, though, by that mercy, God accomplishes his promises, to which, as to their present responsibility, they had lost all title. It is this which gives rise to the apostle's expressions of admiration as to the wisdom of God.
