' It was used for a Roman patron, and is applied in special honour to Phoebe as one whose help many had been dependent on and had profited by. It was a complimentary touch of heart in which the apostle never fails.  they were to 'stand by her for assistance,' but  she had been 'a patron' in the matter.
