	 16:2 assist (f-16) helper (f-32) 'Assist' is 'to stand by her and help her.' 'Helper,' <em> prostatis</em> , in this verse is stronger and has a higher sense, and means 'helping as a patron. ' It was used for a Roman patron, and is applied in special honour to Phoebe as one whose help many had been dependent on and had profited by. It was a complimentary touch of heart in which the apostle never fails. <em> they</em> were to 'stand by her for assistance,' but <em> she</em> had been 'a patron' in the matter.</p>
