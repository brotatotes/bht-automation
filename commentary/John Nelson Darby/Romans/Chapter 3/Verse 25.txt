I have hesitated as to using  dia with the accusative in this sense here; but on the whole I do not doubt it gives the sense. God had passed by, not brought into judgment, the sins of Old Testament believers; and the accomplishment of the atonement showed His righteousness in this.  Now the righteousness is itself shown, and to be relied on.
