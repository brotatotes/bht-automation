	 3:25 mercy-seat, (q-7) I do not think this word can be used for '[a] propitiatory [sacrifice]' or 'propitiation;' it certainly is not the habitual use in the LXX; and we have the two parts of the work of the great day of atonement, here and in ch. 4.25; 'set forth,' here, has a reflexive force; see Note e, <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span> . by (a-25) 'In respect of the passing by the sins.' I have hesitated as to using <em> dia</em> with the accusative in this sense here; but on the whole I do not doubt it gives the sense. God had passed by, not brought into judgment, the sins of Old Testament believers; and the accomplishment of the atonement showed His righteousness in this. <em> Now</em> the righteousness is itself shown, and to be relied on.</p>
