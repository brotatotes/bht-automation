	 3:5 wrath? (c-17) 'Inflicts wrath' is hardly English, as wrath is a sentiment of the mind; and it is what reaches another which is inflicted, as punishment or pain. But 'executes' is not the sense, nor is 'takes vengeance.' The form of expression in Greek, as in the use of 'inflict' in English, is a figure of the effect for the cause, so I have ventured to use it.</p>
