	 4:3 say? (b-6) See <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:6">Genesis 15:6</span> . as (c-17) I am not quite satisfied with 'as;' but it is the nearest approach to the sense in English. 'For,' I object to; because then faith is made of positive worth, having the value of righteousness; whereas the sense is that he was holden for righteous in virtue of faith. 'For' does not go far enough as righteousness; too far as to a positive value of faith. Faith might be reckoned for righteousness, and yet the righteousness come short of what was required; whereas if it be reckoned as righteousness, then the full value of righteousness, as such, is seen. 'the man was held to have righteousness.' It is a Hebrew form. See <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ps+106:31">Psalms 106:31</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:6">Genesis 15:6</span> , where there is no preposition, makes the force of the expression plain.</p>
