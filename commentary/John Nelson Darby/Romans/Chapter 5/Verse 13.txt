	 5:13 account (c-15) This is a different word from that translated 'reckoned' in ch. 4.22,23 (both 'imputed' in A.V.). There, a man is judicially estimated such or such. here, a particular fault is put to a person's account. The former is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:6">Galatians 3:6</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19">2 Corinthians 5:19</span> ; this only in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:18">Philemon 1:18</span> .</p>
