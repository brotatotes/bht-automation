	 5:14 reigned (d-3) Or 'has reigned,' aorist. in (e-15) Or 'according to.' 'Sinned after' is not the sense here. It refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:7">Hosea 6:7</span> , 'They, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant.' this of Israel. But they who had no law did not. The point here is the form or character in or with which anything happens; that which gives it its character.</p>
