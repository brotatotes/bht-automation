This will distinguish them. of (i-17) That is, had its foundation in, was grounded on, one single thing or act. justification. (k-30) <em> Dikaioma</em> ; or 'judicial righteousness.' Here the Greek is more exact than English perhaps allows. It is the state of accomplished subsisting righteousness before God, in which justification places us. The word <em> dikaiosis</em> , 'justification,' in ver. 18 and ch. 4.25 is the act of justifying. In English we must use justification for both. I cannot say 'righteousness;' that might be practical. In ch. 4.25 the doing of it was in view, 'for our justifying;' not, as some read, 'because we are justified,' which could only be said in connection with faith, whereas 'for our justifying' is the effect future to the rising again.</p>
