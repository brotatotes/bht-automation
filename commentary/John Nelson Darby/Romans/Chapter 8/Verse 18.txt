	 8:18 revealed (b-23) Or 'the glory about to be revealed.' but the sense is most nearly given in the text. See <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:23">Galatians 3:23</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:22">1 Corinthians 3:22</span> . The emphasis is on 'coming,' in contrast with 'this present time.'</p>
