	 2:12 teaching (i-1) This word has certainly the sense of discipline, and always perhaps carries with it something of the thought of setting right; but it is used unquestionably for instructing, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:22">Acts 7:22</span> , and elsewhere. soberly, (k-13) That is, with self-restraint and consideration, or sound mind; as 'discreet,' ch. 1.8. things, (l-23) <em> Aion</em> . see <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:22">Matthew 13:22</span> , but 'age' hardly gives the sense. 'World' gives the false idea of this world as one, and heaven another. It was, for the Jews, the present state of things in contrast with that to be introduced by Messiah.</p>
