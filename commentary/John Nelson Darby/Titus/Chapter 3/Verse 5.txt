	 3:5 washing (b-28) 'Washing' is right here. It is a bath, or the water for it. 'Regeneration' is not the same word as 'being born again,' nor is it used so in scripture.

The word is only used here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="dsn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span> for the Saviour's coming kingdom.</p>
