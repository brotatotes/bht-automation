<p><em>Now I exhort you</em> — Ye have faith and hope; secure love also.</p>
<p><em>By the endearing name of our Lord Jesus Christ</em> — lnfinitely preferable to all the human names in which ye glory.</p>
<p><em>That ye all speak the same thing</em> — They now spoke different things, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span> And that there be no schisms among you - No alienation of affection from each other. Is this word ever taken in any other sense in scripture? But that ye be joined in the same mind - Affections, desires.</p>
<p><em>And judgment</em> — Touching all the grand truths of the gospel.</p>
