Now I exhort you — Ye have faith and hope; secure love also.By the endearing name of our Lord Jesus Christ — lnfinitely preferable to all the human names in which ye glory.That ye all speak the same thing — They now spoke different things, 1 Corinthians 1:12 And that there be no schisms among you - No alienation of affection from each other. Is this word ever taken in any other sense in scripture? But that ye be joined in the same mind - Affections, desires.And judgment — Touching all the grand truths of the gospel.
