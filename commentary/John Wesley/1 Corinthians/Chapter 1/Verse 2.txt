<p><em>To the church of God which is in Corinth</em> — St. Paul, writing in a familiar manner to the Corinthians, as also to the Thessalonians and Galatians, uses this plain appellation. To the other churches he uses a more solemn address.</p>
<p><em>Sanctified through Jesus Christ</em> — And so undoubtedly they were in general, notwithstanding some exceptions.</p>
<p><em>Called</em> — Of Jesus Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:6">Romans 1:6</span> And - As the fruit of that calling made holy.</p>
<p><em>With all that in every place</em> — Nothing could better suit that catholic love which St. Paul labours to promote in this epistle, than such a declaration of his good wishes for every true Christian upon earth.</p>
<p><em>Call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ</em> — This plainly implies that all Christians pray to Christ, as well as to the Father through him.</p>
