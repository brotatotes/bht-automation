<p><em>And all drank the same spiritual drink</em> â€” Typical of Christ, and of that cup which we drink. For they drank out of the spiritual or mysterious rock, the wonderful streams of which followed them in their several journeyings, for many years, through the wilderness. And that rock was a manifest type of Christ - The Rock of Eternity, from whom his people derive those streams of blessings which follow them through all this wilderness. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ex+17:6">Exodus 17:6</span>.</p>
