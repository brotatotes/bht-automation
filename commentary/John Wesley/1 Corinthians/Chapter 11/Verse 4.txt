<p><em>Every man praying or prophesying</em> — Speaking by the immediate power of God.</p>
<p><em>With his head</em> — And face.</p>
<p><em>Covered</em> — Either with a veil or with long hair.</p>
<p><em>Dishonoureth his head</em> — St. Paul seems to mean, As in these eastern nations veiling the head is a badge of subjection, so a man who prays or prophesies with a veil on his head, reflects a dishonour on Christ, whose representative he is.</p>
