Every man praying or prophesying — Speaking by the immediate power of God.With his head — And face.Covered — Either with a veil or with long hair.Dishonoureth his head — St. Paul seems to mean, As in these eastern nations veiling the head is a badge of subjection, so a man who prays or prophesies with a veil on his head, reflects a dishonour on Christ, whose representative he is.
