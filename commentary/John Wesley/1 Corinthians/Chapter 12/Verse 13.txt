For by that one Spirit, which we received in baptism, we are all united in one body.Whether Jews or gentiles — Who are at the greatest distance from each other by nature.Whether slaves or freemen — Who are at the greatest distance by law and custom.We have all drank of one Spirit — In that cup, received by faith, we all imbibed one Spirit, who first inspired, and still preserves, the life of God in our souls.
