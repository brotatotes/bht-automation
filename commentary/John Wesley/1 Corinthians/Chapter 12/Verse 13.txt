<p>For by that one Spirit, which we received in baptism, we are all united in one body.</p>
<p><em>Whether Jews or gentiles</em> — Who are at the greatest distance from each other by nature.</p>
<p><em>Whether slaves or freemen</em> — Who are at the greatest distance by law and custom.</p>
<p><em>We have all drank of one Spirit</em> — In that cup, received by faith, we all imbibed one Spirit, who first inspired, and still preserves, the life of God in our souls.</p>
