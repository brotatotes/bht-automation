<p><em>Ye were heathens</em> — Therefore, whatever gifts ye have received, it is from the free grace of God.</p>
<p><em>Carried away</em> — By a blind credulity.</p>
<p><em>After dumb idols</em> — The blind to the dumb; idols of wood and stone, unable to speak themselves, and much more to open your mouths, as God has done.</p>
<p><em>As ye were led</em> — By the subtlety of your priests.</p>
