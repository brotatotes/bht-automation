Ye were heathens — Therefore, whatever gifts ye have received, it is from the free grace of God.Carried away — By a blind credulity.After dumb idols — The blind to the dumb; idols of wood and stone, unable to speak themselves, and much more to open your mouths, as God has done.As ye were led — By the subtlety of your priests.
