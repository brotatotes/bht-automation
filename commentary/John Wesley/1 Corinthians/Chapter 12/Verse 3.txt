<p><em>Therefore</em> — Since the heathen idols cannot speak themselves, much less give spiritual gifts to others, these must necessarily be among Christians only.</p>
<p><em>As no one speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed</em> — That is, as none who does this, (which all the Jews and heathens did,) speaketh by the Spirit of God - Is actuated by that Spirit, so as to speak with tongues, heal diseases, or cast out devils.</p>
<p><em>So no one can say, Jesus is the Lord</em> — None can receive him as such; for, in the scripture language, to say, or to believe, implies an experimental assurance.</p>
<p><em>But by the Holy Ghost</em> — The sum is, None have the Holy Spirit but Christians: all Christians have this Spirit.</p>
