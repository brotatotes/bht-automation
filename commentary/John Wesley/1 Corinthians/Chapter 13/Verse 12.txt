<p><em>Now we see</em> — Even the things that surround us. But by means of a glass - Or mirror, which reflects only their imperfect forms, in a dim, faint, obscure manner; so that our thoughts about them are puzzling and intricate, and everything is a kind of riddle to us.</p>
<p><em>But then</em> — We shall see, not a faint reflection, but the objects themselves.</p>
<p><em>Face to face</em> — Distinctly.</p>
<p><em>Now I know in part</em> — Even when God himself reveals things to me, great part of them is still kept under the veil.</p>
<p><em>But then I shall know even as also I am known</em> — In a clear, full, comprehensive manner; in some measure like God, who penetrates the centre of every object, and sees at one glance through my soul and all things.</p>
