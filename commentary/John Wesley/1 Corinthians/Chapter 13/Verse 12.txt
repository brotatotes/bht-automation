Now we see — Even the things that surround us. But by means of a glass - Or mirror, which reflects only their imperfect forms, in a dim, faint, obscure manner; so that our thoughts about them are puzzling and intricate, and everything is a kind of riddle to us.But then — We shall see, not a faint reflection, but the objects themselves.Face to face — Distinctly.Now I know in part — Even when God himself reveals things to me, great part of them is still kept under the veil.But then I shall know even as also I am known — In a clear, full, comprehensive manner; in some measure like God, who penetrates the centre of every object, and sees at one glance through my soul and all things.
