<p><em>And though I have the gift of prophecy</em> — Of foretelling future events.</p>
<p><em>And understand all the mysteries</em> — Both of God's word and providence.</p>
<p><em>And all knowledge</em> — Of things divine and human, that ever any mortal attained to. And though I have the highest degree of miracle working faith, and have not this love, I am nothing.</p>
