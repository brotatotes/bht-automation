<p><em>And though I</em> — Deliberately, piece by piece. Give all my goods to feed the poor, yea, though I deliver up my body to be burned - Rather than I would renounce my religion.</p>
<p><em>And have not the love</em> — Hereafter described.</p>
<p><em>It profiteth me nothing</em> — Without this, whatever I speak, whatever I have, whatever I know, whatever I do, whatever I suffer, is nothing.</p>
