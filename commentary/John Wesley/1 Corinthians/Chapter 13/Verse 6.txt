<p><em>Rejoiceth not in iniquity</em> — Yea, weeps at either the sin or folly of even an enemy; takes no pleasure in hearing or in repeating it, but desires it may be forgotten for ever.</p>
<p><em>But rejoiceth in the truth</em> — Bringing forth its proper fruit, holiness of heart and life. Good in general is its glory and joy, wherever diffused in all the world.</p>
