Love never faileth — It accompanies to, and adorns us in, eternity; it prepares us for, and constitutes, heaven.But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail — When all things are fulfilled, and God is all in all.Whether there be tongues, they shall cease — One language shall prevail among all the inhabitants of heaven, and the low and imperfect languages of earth be forgotten. The knowledge likewise which we now so eagerly pursue, shall then vanish away - As starlight is lost in that of the midday sun, so our present knowledge in the light of eternity.
