<p><em>If I pray in an unknown tongue</em> — The apostle, as he did at1Corinthians14:6, transfers it to himself.</p>
<p><em>My spirit prayeth</em> — By the power of the Spirit I understand the words myself.</p>
<p><em>But my understanding is unfruitful</em> — The knowledge I have is no benefit to others.</p>
