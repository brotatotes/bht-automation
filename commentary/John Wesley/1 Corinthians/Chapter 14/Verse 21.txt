It is written in the Law — The word here, as frequently, means the Old Testament.In foreign tongues will I speak to this people — And so he did. He spake terribly to them by the Babylonians, when they had set at nought what he had spoken by the prophets, who used their own language. These words received a farther accomplishment on the day of pentecost. Isaiah 28:11.
