Let your women be silent in the churches — Unless they are under an extraordinary impulse of the Spirit. For, in other cases, it is not permitted them to speak - By way of teaching in public assemblies.But to be in subjection — To the man whose proper office it is to lead and to instruct the congregation. Genesis 3:16.
