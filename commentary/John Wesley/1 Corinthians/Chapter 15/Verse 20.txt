<p><em>But now</em> — St. Paul declares that Christians "have hope," not "in this life only." His proof of the resurrection lies in a narrow compass, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:12-19">1 Corinthians 15:12-19</span>. Almost all the rest of the chapter is taken up in illustrating, vindicating, and applying it. The proof is short, but solid and convincing, that which arose from Christ's resurrection. Now this not only proved a resurrection possible, but, as it proved him to be a divine teacher, proved the certainty of a general resurrection, which he so expressly taught.</p>
<p><em>The first fruit of them that slept</em> — The earnest, pledge, and insurance of their resurrection who slept in him: even of all the righteous. It is of the resurrection of these, and these only, that the apostle speaks throughout the chapter.</p>
