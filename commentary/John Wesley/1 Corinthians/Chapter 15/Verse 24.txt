<p><em>Then</em> — After the resurrection and the general judgment.</p>
<p><em>Cometh the end</em> — Of the world; the grand period of all those wonderful scenes that have appeared for so many succeeding generations. When he shall have delivered up the kingdom to the Father, and he (the Father) shall have abolished all adverse rule, authority, and power - Not that the Father will then begin to reign without the Son, nor will the Son then cease to reign. For the divine reign both of the Father and Son is from everlasting to everlasting. But this is spoken of the Son's mediatorial kingdom, which will then be delivered up, and of the immediate kingdom or reign of the Father, which will then commence. Till then the Son transacts the business which the Father hath given him, for those who are his, and by them as well as by the angels, with the Father, and against their enemies. So far as the Father gave the kingdom to the Son, the Son shall deliver it up to the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:3">John 13:3</span>. Nor does the Father cease to reign, when he gives it to the Son; neither the Son, when he delivers it to the Father: but the glory which he had before the world began, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:8">Hebrews 1:8</span>, will remain even after this is delivered up. Nor will he cease to be a king even in his human nature, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:33">Luke 1:33</span>. If the citizens of the new Jerusalem" shall reign for ever," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+22:5">Revelation 22:5</span>, how much more shall he?</p>
