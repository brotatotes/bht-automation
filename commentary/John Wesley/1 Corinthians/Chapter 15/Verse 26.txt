<p><em>The last enemy that is destroyed is death</em> â€” Namely, after Satan, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>, and sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:56">1 Corinthians 15:56</span>, are destroyed. In the same order they prevailed. Satan brought in sin, and sin brought forth death. And Christ, when he of old engaged with these enemies, first conquered Satan, then sin, in his death; and, lastly, death, in his resurrection. In the same order he delivers all the faithful from them, yea, and destroys these enemies themselves. Death he so destroys that it shall be no more; sin and Satan, so that they shall no more hurt his people.</p>
