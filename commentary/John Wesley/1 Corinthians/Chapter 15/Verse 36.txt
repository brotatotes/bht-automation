<p>To the inquiry concerning the manner of rising, and the quality of the bodies that rise, the Apostle answers first by a similitude, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:36-42">1 Corinthians 15:36-42</span>, and then plainly and directly, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:42,43">1 Corinthians 15:42,43</span>. That which thou sowest, is not quickened into new life and verdure, except it die - Undergo a dissolution of its parts, a change analogous to death. Thus St. Paul inverts the objection; as if he had said, Death is so far from hindering life, that it necessarily goes before it.</p>
