So also is the resurrection of the dead — So great is the difference between the body which fell, and that which rises.It is sown — A beautiful word; committed, as seed, to the ground.In corruption — Just ready to putrefy, and, by various degrees of corruption and decay, to return to the dust from whence it came.It is raised in incorruption — Utterly incapable of either dissolution or decay.
