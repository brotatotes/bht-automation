<p><em>So also is the resurrection of the dead</em> — So great is the difference between the body which fell, and that which rises.</p>
<p><em>It is sown</em> — A beautiful word; committed, as seed, to the ground.</p>
<p><em>In corruption</em> — Just ready to putrefy, and, by various degrees of corruption and decay, to return to the dust from whence it came.</p>
<p><em>It is raised in incorruption</em> — Utterly incapable of either dissolution or decay.</p>
