<p><em>A mystery</em> — A truth hitherto unknown; and not yet fully known to any of the sons of men.</p>
<p><em>We</em> — Christians. The Apostle considers them all as one, in their succeeding generations.</p>
<p><em>Shall not all die</em> — Suffer a separation of soul and body.</p>
<p><em>But we shall all</em> — Who do not die, be changed - So that this animal body shall become spiritual.</p>
