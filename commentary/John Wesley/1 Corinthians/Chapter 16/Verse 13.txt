<p>To conclude.</p>
<p><em>Watch ye</em> — Against all your seen and unseen enemies.</p>
<p><em>Stand fast in the faith</em> — Seeing and trusting him that is invisible.</p>
<p><em>Acquit yourselves like men</em> — With courage and patience.</p>
<p><em>Be strong</em> — To do and suffer all his will.</p>
