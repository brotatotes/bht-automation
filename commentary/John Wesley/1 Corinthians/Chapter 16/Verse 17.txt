<p><em>I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaiacus</em> — Who were now returned to Corinth but the joy which their arrival had occasioned remained still in his heart.</p>
<p><em>They have supplied what was wanting on your part</em> — They have performed the offices of love, which you could not, by reason of your absence.</p>
