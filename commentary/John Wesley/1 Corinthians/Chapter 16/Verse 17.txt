I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaiacus — Who were now returned to Corinth but the joy which their arrival had occasioned remained still in his heart.They have supplied what was wanting on your part — They have performed the offices of love, which you could not, by reason of your absence.
