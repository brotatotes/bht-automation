<p><em>But God hath revealed</em> — Yea, and "freely given," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:12">1 Corinthians 2:12</span>.</p>
<p><em>Them to us</em> — Even inconceivable peace, and joy unspeakable.</p>
<p><em>By his Spirit</em> — Who intimately and fully knows them.</p>
<p><em>For the Spirit searcheth even the deep things of God</em> — Be they ever so hidden and mysterious; the depths both of his nature and his kingdom.</p>
