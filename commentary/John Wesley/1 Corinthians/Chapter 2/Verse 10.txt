But God hath revealed — Yea, and "freely given," 1 Corinthians 2:12.Them to us — Even inconceivable peace, and joy unspeakable.By his Spirit — Who intimately and fully knows them.For the Spirit searcheth even the deep things of God — Be they ever so hidden and mysterious; the depths both of his nature and his kingdom.
