<p><em>But the natural man</em> — That is, every man who hath not the Spirit; who has no other way of obtaining knowledge, but by his senses and natural understanding.</p>
<p><em>Receiveth not</em> — Does not understand or conceive.</p>
<p><em>The things of the Spirit</em> — The things revealed by the Spirit of God, whether relating to his nature or his kingdom.</p>
<p><em>For they are foolishness to him</em> — He is so far from understanding, that he utterly despises, them Neither can he know them - As he has not the will, so neither has he the power.</p>
<p><em>Because they are spiritually discerned</em> — They can only be discerned by the aid of that Spirit, and by those spiritual senses, which he has not.</p>
