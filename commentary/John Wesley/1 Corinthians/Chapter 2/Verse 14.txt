But the natural man — That is, every man who hath not the Spirit; who has no other way of obtaining knowledge, but by his senses and natural understanding.Receiveth not — Does not understand or conceive.The things of the Spirit — The things revealed by the Spirit of God, whether relating to his nature or his kingdom.For they are foolishness to him — He is so far from understanding, that he utterly despises, them Neither can he know them - As he has not the will, so neither has he the power.Because they are spiritually discerned — They can only be discerned by the aid of that Spirit, and by those spiritual senses, which he has not.
