<p><em>And I was with you</em> — At my first entrance.</p>
<p><em>In weakness</em> — Of body, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span> And in fear - Lest I should offend any.</p>
<p><em>And in much trembling</em> — The emotion of my mind affecting my very body.</p>
