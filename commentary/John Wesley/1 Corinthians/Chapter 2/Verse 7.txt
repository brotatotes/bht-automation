<p>But we speak the mysterious wisdom of God, which was hidden for many ages from all the world, and is still hidden even from "babes in Christ;" much more from all unbelievers.</p>
<p><em>Which God ordained before the world</em> — So far is this from coming to nought, like worldly wisdom.</p>
<p><em>For our glory</em> — Arising from the glory of our Lord, and then to be revealed when all worldly glory vanishes.</p>
