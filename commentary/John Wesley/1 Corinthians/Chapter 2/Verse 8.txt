<p><em>Had they known it</em> — That wisdom.</p>
<p><em>They would not have crucified</em> — Punished as a slave.</p>
<p><em>The Lord of glory</em> — The giving Christ this august title, peculiar to the great Jehovah, plainly shows him to be the supreme God. In like manner the Father is styled, "the Father of glory," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span>; and the Holy Ghost, "the Spirit of glory," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:14">1 Peter 4:14</span>. The application of this title to all the three, shows that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are "the God of glory;" as the only true God is called, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ps+29:3">Psalm 29:3</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:2">Acts 7:2</span>.</p>
