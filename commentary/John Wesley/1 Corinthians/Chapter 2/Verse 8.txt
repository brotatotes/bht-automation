Had they known it — That wisdom.They would not have crucified — Punished as a slave.The Lord of glory — The giving Christ this august title, peculiar to the great Jehovah, plainly shows him to be the supreme God. In like manner the Father is styled, "the Father of glory," Ephesians 1:17; and the Holy Ghost, "the Spirit of glory," 1 Peter 4:14. The application of this title to all the three, shows that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are "the God of glory;" as the only true God is called, Psalm 29:3, and Acts 7:2.
