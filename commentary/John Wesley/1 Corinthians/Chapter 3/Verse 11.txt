<p><em>Can no man lay than what is laid</em> — In the counsels of divine wisdom, in the promises and prophecies of the Old Testament, in the preaching of the apostles, St. Paul in particular.</p>
<p><em>Which is Jesus Christ</em> — Who, in his person and offices, is the firm, immovable Rock of Ages, every way sufficient to bear all the weight that God himself, or the sinner, when he believes, can lay upon him.</p>
