<p><em>Whether Paul or Apollos, or Cephas</em> — We are all equally yours, to serve you for Christ's sake.</p>
<p><em>Or the world</em> — This leap from Peter to the world greatly enlarges the thought, and argues a kind of impatience of enumerating the rest. Peter and every one in the whole world, however excellent in gifts, or grace, or office, are also your servants for Christ's sake.</p>
<p><em>Or life, or death</em> — These, with all their various circumstances, are disposed as will be most for your advantage.</p>
<p><em>Or things present</em> — On earth.</p>
<p><em>Or things to come</em> — In heaven. Contend, therefore, no more about these little things; but be ye united in love, as ye are in blessings.</p>
