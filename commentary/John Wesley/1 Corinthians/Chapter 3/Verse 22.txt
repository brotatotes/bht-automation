Whether Paul or Apollos, or Cephas — We are all equally yours, to serve you for Christ's sake.Or the world — This leap from Peter to the world greatly enlarges the thought, and argues a kind of impatience of enumerating the rest. Peter and every one in the whole world, however excellent in gifts, or grace, or office, are also your servants for Christ's sake.Or life, or death — These, with all their various circumstances, are disposed as will be most for your advantage.Or things present — On earth.Or things to come — In heaven. Contend, therefore, no more about these little things; but be ye united in love, as ye are in blessings.
