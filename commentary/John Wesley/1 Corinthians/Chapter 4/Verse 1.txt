Let a man account us, as servants of Christ — The original word properly signifies such servants as laboured at the oar in rowing vessels; and, accordingly, intimates the pains which every faithful minister takes in his Lord's work. O God, where are these ministers to be found? Lord, thou knowest.And stewards of the mysteries of God — Dispenseth of the mysterious truths of the gospel.
