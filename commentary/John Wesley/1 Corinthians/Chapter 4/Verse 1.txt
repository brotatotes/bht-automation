<p><em>Let a man account us, as servants of Christ</em> — The original word properly signifies such servants as laboured at the oar in rowing vessels; and, accordingly, intimates the pains which every faithful minister takes in his Lord's work. O God, where are these ministers to be found? Lord, thou knowest.</p>
<p><em>And stewards of the mysteries of God</em> — Dispenseth of the mysterious truths of the gospel.</p>
