We are fools, in the account of the world, for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ - Though ye are Christians, ye think yourselves wise; and ye have found means to make the world think you so too.We are weak — In presence, in infirmities, in sufferings.But ye are strong — In just opposite circumstances.
