<p>We are fools, in the account of the world, for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ - Though ye are Christians, ye think yourselves wise; and ye have found means to make the world think you so too.</p>
<p><em>We are weak</em> — In presence, in infirmities, in sufferings.</p>
<p><em>But ye are strong</em> — In just opposite circumstances.</p>
