<p><em>Therefore judge nothing before the time</em> — Appointed for judging all men. Until the Lord come, who, in order to pass a righteous judgment, which otherwise would be impossible, will both bring to light the things which are now covered with impenetrable darkness, and manifest the most secret springs of action, the principles and intentions of every heart.</p>
<p><em>And then shall every one</em> — Every faithful steward, have praise of God.</p>
