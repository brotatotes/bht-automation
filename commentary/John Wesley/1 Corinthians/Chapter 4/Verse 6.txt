<p><em>These things</em> — Mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:10">1 Corinthians 1:10</span>, etc. I have by a very obvious figure transferred to myself and Apollos - And Cephas, instead of naming those particular preachers at Corinth, to whom ye are so fondly attached.</p>
<p><em>That ye may learn by us</em> — From what has been said concerning us, who, however eminent we are, are mere instruments in God's hand. Not to think of any man above what is here written - Or above what scripture warrants1Corinthians3:7</p>
