Now ye are full — The Corinthians abounded with spiritual gifts; and so did the apostles: but the apostles, by continual want and sufferings, were kept from self - complacency. The Corinthians suffering nothing, and having plenty of all things, were pleased with and applauded themselves; and they were like children who, being raised in the world, disregard their poor parents. Now ye are full, says the apostle, in a beautiful gradation, ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings - A proverbial expression, denoting the most splendid and plentiful circumstances.Without any thought of us. And I would ye did reign — In the best sense: I would ye had attained the height of holiness.That we might reign with you — Having no more sorrow on your account, but sharing in your happiness.
