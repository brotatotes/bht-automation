<p><em>To deliver such an one</em> — This was the highest degree of punishment in the Christian church; and we may observe, the passing this sentence was the act of the apostle, not of the Corinthians.</p>
<p><em>To Satan</em> — Who was usually permitted, in such cases, to inflict pain or sickness on the offender.</p>
<p><em>For the destruction</em> — Though slowly and gradually.</p>
<p><em>Of the flesh</em> — Unless prevented by speedy repentance.</p>
