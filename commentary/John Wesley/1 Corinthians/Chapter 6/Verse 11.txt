<p><em>And such were some of you: but ye are washed</em> — From those gross abominations; nay, and ye are inwardly sanctified; not before, but in consequence of, your being justified in the name - That is, by the merits, of the Lord Jesus, through which your sins are forgiven.</p>
<p><em>And by the Spirit of our God</em> — By whom ye are thus washed and sanctified.</p>
