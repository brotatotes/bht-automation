And such were some of you: but ye are washed — From those gross abominations; nay, and ye are inwardly sanctified; not before, but in consequence of, your being justified in the name - That is, by the merits, of the Lord Jesus, through which your sins are forgiven.And by the Spirit of our God — By whom ye are thus washed and sanctified.
