<p><em>All things</em> — Which are lawful for you.</p>
<p><em>Are lawful for me, but all things are not always expedient</em> — Particularly when anything would offend my weak brother; or when it would enslave my own soul. For though all things are lawful for me, yet I will not be brought under the power of any - So as to be uneasy when I abstain from it; for, if so, then I am under the power of it.</p>
