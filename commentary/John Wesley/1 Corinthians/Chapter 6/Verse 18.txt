<p><em>Flee fornication</em> — All unlawful commerce with women, with speed, with abhorrence, with all your might. Every sin that a man commits against his neighbour terminates upon an object out of himself, and does not so immediately pollute his body, though it does his soul.</p>
<p><em>But he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body</em> — Pollutes, dishonours, and degrades it to a level with brute beasts.</p>
