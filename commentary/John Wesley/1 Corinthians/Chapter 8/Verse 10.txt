<p><em>For if any one see thee who hast knowledge</em> — Whom he believes to have more knowledge than himself, and who really hast this knowledge, that an idol is nothing-sitting down to an entertainment in an idol temple. The heathens frequently made entertainments in their temples, on what hath been sacrificed to their idols.</p>
<p><em>Will not the conscience of him that is weak</em> — Scrupulous.</p>
<p><em>Be encouraged</em> — By thy example.</p>
<p><em>To eat</em> — Though with a doubting conscience.</p>
