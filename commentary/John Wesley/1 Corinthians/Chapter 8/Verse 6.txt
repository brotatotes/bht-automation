Yet to us — Christians.There is but one God — This is exclusive, not of the One Lord, as if he were an inferior deity; but only of the idols to which the One God is opposed.From whom are all things — By creation, providence, and grace.And we for him — The end of all we are, have, and do.And one Lord — Equally the object of divine worship.By whom are all things — Created, sustained, and governed.And we by him — Have access to the Father, and all spiritual blessings.
