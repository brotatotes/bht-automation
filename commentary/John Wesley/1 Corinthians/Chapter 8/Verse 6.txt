<p><em>Yet to us</em> — Christians.</p>
<p><em>There is but one God</em> — This is exclusive, not of the One Lord, as if he were an inferior deity; but only of the idols to which the One God is opposed.</p>
<p><em>From whom are all things</em> — By creation, providence, and grace.</p>
<p><em>And we for him</em> — The end of all we are, have, and do.</p>
<p><em>And one Lord</em> — Equally the object of divine worship.</p>
<p><em>By whom are all things</em> — Created, sustained, and governed.</p>
<p><em>And we by him</em> — Have access to the Father, and all spiritual blessings.</p>
