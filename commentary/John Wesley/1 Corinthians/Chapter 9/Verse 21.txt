<p><em>To them that are without the law</em> — The heathens.</p>
<p><em>As without the law</em> — Neglecting its ceremonies.</p>
<p><em>Being not without the law to God</em> — But as much as ever under its moral precepts.</p>
<p><em>Under the law to Christ</em> — And in this sense all Christians will be under the law for ever.</p>
