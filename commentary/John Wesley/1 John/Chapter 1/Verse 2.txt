<p><em>For the life</em> — The living Word.</p>
<p><em>Was manifested</em> — In the flesh, to our very senses.</p>
<p><em>And we testify and declare</em> — We testify by declaring, by preaching, and writing, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3,4">1 John 1:3,4</span>. Preaching lays the foundation, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5-10">1 John 1:5-10</span>: writing builds there on.</p>
<p><em>To you</em> — Who have not seen.</p>
<p><em>The eternal life</em> — Which always was, and afterward appeared to us. This is mentioned in the beginning of the epistle. In the end of it is mentioned the same eternal life, which we shall always enjoy.</p>
