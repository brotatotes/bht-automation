That which we have seen and heard — Of him and from him.Declare we to you — For this end.That ye also may have fellowship with us — May enjoy the same fellowship which we enjoy.And truly our fellowship — Whereby he is in us and we in him.Is with the Father and with the son — Of the Holy Ghost he speaks afterwards.
