<p><em>That which we have seen and heard</em> — Of him and from him.</p>
<p><em>Declare we to you</em> — For this end.</p>
<p><em>That ye also may have fellowship with us</em> — May enjoy the same fellowship which we enjoy.</p>
<p><em>And truly our fellowship</em> — Whereby he is in us and we in him.</p>
<p><em>Is with the Father and with the son</em> — Of the Holy Ghost he speaks afterwards.</p>
