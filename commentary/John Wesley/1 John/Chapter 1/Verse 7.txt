<p><em>But if we walk in the light</em> — In all holiness. As God is (a deeper word than walk, and more worthy of God) in the light, then we may truly say, we have fellowship one with another - We who have seen, and you who have not seen, do alike enjoy that fellowship with God. The imitation of God being the only sure proof of our having fellowship with him.</p>
<p><em>And the blood of Jesus Christ his Son</em> — With the grace purchased thereby.</p>
<p><em>Cleanseth us from all sin</em> — Both original and actual, taking away all the guilt and all the power.</p>
