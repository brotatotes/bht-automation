<p><em>He that loveth his brother</em> — For Christ's sake.</p>
<p><em>Abideth in the light</em> — Of God.</p>
<p><em>And there is no occasion of stumbling in him</em> — Whereas he that hates his brother is an occasion of stumbling to himself. He stumbles against himself, and against all things within and without; while he that loves his brother, has a free, disencumbered journey.</p>
