He that loveth his brother — For Christ's sake.Abideth in the light — Of God.And there is no occasion of stumbling in him — Whereas he that hates his brother is an occasion of stumbling to himself. He stumbles against himself, and against all things within and without; while he that loves his brother, has a free, disencumbered journey.
