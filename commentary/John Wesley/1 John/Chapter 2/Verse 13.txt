<p>The address to spiritual fathers, young men, and little children is first proposed in this verse, wherein he says, I write to you, fathers: I write to you, young men: I write to you, little children: and then enlarged upon; in doing which he says, "I have written to you, fathers," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:14">1 John 2:14</span>. "I have written to you, young men," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:14-17">1 John 2:14-17</span>. "I have written to you, little children," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18-27">1 John 2:18-27</span>. Having finished his address to each, he returns to all together, whom he again terms, (as1John2:12,) "beloved children." Fathers, ye have known him that is from the beginning - We have known the eternal God, in a manner wherein no other, even true believers, know him.</p>
<p><em>Young men, ye have overcome the wicked one</em> — In many battles, by the power of faith.</p>
<p><em>Little children, ye have known the Father</em> — As your Father, though ye have not yet overcome, by the Spirit witnessing with your Spirit, that ye are the children of God."</p>
