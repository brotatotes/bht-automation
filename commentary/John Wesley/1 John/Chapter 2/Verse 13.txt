The address to spiritual fathers, young men, and little children is first proposed in this verse, wherein he says, I write to you, fathers: I write to you, young men: I write to you, little children: and then enlarged upon; in doing which he says, "I have written to you, fathers," 1 John 2:14. "I have written to you, young men," 1 John 2:14-17. "I have written to you, little children," 1 John 2:18-27. Having finished his address to each, he returns to all together, whom he again terms, (as1John2:12,) "beloved children." Fathers, ye have known him that is from the beginning - We have known the eternal God, in a manner wherein no other, even true believers, know him.Young men, ye have overcome the wicked one — In many battles, by the power of faith.Little children, ye have known the Father — As your Father, though ye have not yet overcome, by the Spirit witnessing with your Spirit, that ye are the children of God."
