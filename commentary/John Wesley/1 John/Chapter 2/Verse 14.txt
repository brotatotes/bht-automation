<p><em>I have written to you, fathers</em> — As if he had said, Observe well what I but now wrote. He speaks very briefly and modestly to these, who needed not much to be said to them, as having that deep acquaintance with God which comprises all necessary knowledge.</p>
<p><em>Young men, ye are strong</em> — In faith.</p>
<p><em>And the word of God abideth in you</em> — Deeply rooted in your hearts, whereby ye have often foiled your great adversary.</p>
