<p><em>The desire of the flesh</em> — Of the pleasure of the outward senses, whether of the taste, smell, or touch.</p>
<p><em>The desire of the eye</em> — Of the pleasures of imagination, to which the eye chiefly is subservient; of that internal sense whereby we relish whatever is grand, new, or beautiful.</p>
<p><em>The pride of life</em> — All that pomp in clothes, houses, furniture, equipage, manner of living, which generally procure honour from the bulk of mankind, and so gratify pride and vanity. It therefore directly includes the desire of praise, and, remotely, covetousness. All these desires are not from God, but from the prince of this world.</p>
