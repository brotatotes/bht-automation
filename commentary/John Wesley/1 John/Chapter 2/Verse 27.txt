But this does not exclude our need of being taught by them who partake of the same anointing.Of all things — Which it is necessary for you to know.And is no lie — Like that which antichrist teaches.Ye shall abide in him — This is added both by way of comfort and of exhortation. The whole discourse, from verse18 to this, 1 John 2:18-27 is peculiarly adapted to little children.
