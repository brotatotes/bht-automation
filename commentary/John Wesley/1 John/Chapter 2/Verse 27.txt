<p><em>Of all things</em> — Which it is necessary for you to know.</p>
<p><em>And is no lie</em> — Like that which antichrist teaches.</p>
<p><em>Ye shall abide in him</em> — This is added both by way of comfort and of exhortation. The whole discourse, from verse18 to this, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18-27">1 John 2:18-27</span> is peculiarly adapted to little children.</p>
