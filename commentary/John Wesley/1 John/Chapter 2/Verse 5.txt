But whoso keepeth his word — His commandments.Verily in him the love of God — Reconciled to us through Christ.Is perfected — Is perfectly known.Hereby — By our keeping his word.We know that we are in him — So is the tree known by its fruits. To "know him," to be "in him," to "abide in him," are nearly synonymous terms; only with a gradation,-knowledge, communion, constancy.
