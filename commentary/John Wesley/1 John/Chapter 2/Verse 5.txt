<p><em>But whoso keepeth his word</em> — His commandments.</p>
<p><em>Verily in him the love of God</em> — Reconciled to us through Christ.</p>
<p><em>Is perfected</em> — Is perfectly known.</p>
<p><em>Hereby</em> — By our keeping his word.</p>
<p><em>We know that we are in him</em> — So is the tree known by its fruits. To "know him," to be "in him," to "abide in him," are nearly synonymous terms; only with a gradation,-knowledge, communion, constancy.</p>
