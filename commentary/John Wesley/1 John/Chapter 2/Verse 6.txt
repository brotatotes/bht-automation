<p><em>He that saith he abideth in him</em> — which implies a durable state; a constant, lasting knowledge of, and communion with, him.</p>
<p><em>Ought himself</em> — Otherwise they are vain words.</p>
<p><em>So to walk, even as he walked</em> — In the world. As he, are words that frequently occur in this epistle. Believers having their hearts full of him, easily supply his name.</p>
