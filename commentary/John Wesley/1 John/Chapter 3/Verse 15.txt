He, I say, abideth in spiritual death, is void of the life of God. For whosoever hateth his brother, and there is no medium between loving and hating him, is, in God's account, a murderer: every degree of hatred being a degree of the same temper which moved Cain to murder his brother.And no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him â€” But every loving believer hath. For love is the beginning of eternal life. It is the same, in substance, with glory.
