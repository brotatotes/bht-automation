But whoso hath this world's good — Worldly substance, far less valuable than life.And seeth his brother have need — The very sight of want knocks at the door of the spectator's heart.And shutteth up — Whether asked or not.His bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him — Certainly not at all, however he may talk, 1 John 3:18, of loving God.
