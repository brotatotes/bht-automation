And hereby we know — We have a farther proof by this real, operative love.That we are of the truth — That we have true faith, that we are true children of God.And shall assure our hearts before him — Shall enjoy the assurance of his favour, and the "testimony of a good conscience toward God." The heart, in St. John's language, is the conscience. The word conscience is not found in his writings.
