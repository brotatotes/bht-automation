<p><em>And hereby we know</em> — We have a farther proof by this real, operative love.</p>
<p><em>That we are of the truth</em> — That we have true faith, that we are true children of God.</p>
<p><em>And shall assure our hearts before him</em> — Shall enjoy the assurance of his favour, and the "testimony of a good conscience toward God." The heart, in St. John's language, is the conscience. The word conscience is not found in his writings.</p>
