It doth not yet appear — Even to ourselves.What we shall be — It is something ineffable, which will raise the children of God to be, in a manner, as God himself. But we know, in general, that when he, the Son of God, shall appear, we shall be like him - The glory of God penetrating our inmost substance.For we shall see him as he is — Manifestly, without a veil. And that sight will transform us into the same likeness.
