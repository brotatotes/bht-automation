<p><em>If our heart condemn us not</em> — If our conscience, duly enlightened by the word and Spirit of God, and comparing all our thoughts, words, and works with that word, pronounce that they agree therewith.</p>
<p><em>Then have we confidence toward God</em> — Not only our consciousness of his favour continues and increases, but we have a full persuasion, that whatsoever we ask we shall receive of him.</p>
