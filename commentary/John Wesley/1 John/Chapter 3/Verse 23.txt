<p><em>And this is his commandment</em> — All his commandments in one word.</p>
<p><em>That we should believe and love</em> — in the manner and degree which he hath taught. This is the greatest and most important command that ever issued from the throne of glory. If this be neglected, no other can be kept: if this be observed, all others are easy.</p>
