<p><em>And ye know that he</em> — Christ.</p>
<p><em>Was manifested</em> — That he came into the world for this very purpose.</p>
<p><em>To take away our sins</em> — To destroy them all, root and branch, and leave none remaining.</p>
<p><em>And in him is no sin</em> — So that he could not suffer on his own account, but to make us as himself.</p>
