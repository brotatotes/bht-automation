<p><em>Believe not every spirit</em> — Whereby any teacher is actuated.</p>
<p><em>But try the spirits</em> — By the rule which follows. We are to try all spirits by the written word: "To the law and to the testimony!" If any man speak not according to these, the spirit which actuates him is not of God.</p>
