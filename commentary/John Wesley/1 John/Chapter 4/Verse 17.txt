<p><em>Hereby</em> — That is, by this communion with God.</p>
<p><em>Is our love made perfect; that we may</em> — That is, so that we shall have boldness in the day of judgment - When all the stout-hearted shall tremble.</p>
<p><em>Because as he</em> — Christ.</p>
<p><em>Is</em> — All love.</p>
<p><em>So are we</em> — Who are fathers in Christ, even in this world.</p>
