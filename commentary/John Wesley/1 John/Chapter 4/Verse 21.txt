<p><em>And this commandment have we from him</em> — Both God and Christ.</p>
<p><em>That he who loveth God love his brother</em> — Every one, whatever his opinions or mode of worship be, purely because he is the child, and bears the image, of God. Bigotry is properly the want of this pure and universal love. A bigot only loves those who embrace his opinions, and receive his way of worship; and he loves them for that, and not for Christ's sake.</p>
