<p>Yet this gives us no encouragement to sin: on the contrary, it is an indisputable truth, he that is born of God - That sees and loves God.</p>
<p><em>Sinneth not</em> — So long as that loving faith abides in him, he neither speaks nor does anything which God hath forbidden.</p>
<p><em>He keepeth himself</em> — Watching unto prayer. And, while he does this, the wicked one toucheth him not - So as to hurt him.</p>
