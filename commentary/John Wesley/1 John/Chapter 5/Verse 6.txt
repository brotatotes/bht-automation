<p><em>This is he</em> — St. John here shows the immovable foundation of that faith that Jesus is the Son of God; not only the testimony of man, but the firm, indubitable testimony of God.</p>
<p><em>Who came</em> — Jesus is he of whom it was promised that he should come; and who accordingly, is come. And this the Spirit, and the water, and the blood testify.</p>
<p><em>Even Jesus</em> — Who, coming by water and blood, is by this very thing demonstrated to be the Christ.</p>
<p><em>Not by the water only</em> — Wherein he was baptized.</p>
<p><em>But by the water and the blood</em> — Which he shed when he had finished the work his Father had given him to do. He not only undertook at his baptism "to fulfil all righteousness," but on the cross accomplished what he had undertaken; in token whereof, when all was finished, blood and water came out of his side. And it is the Spirit who likewise testifieth - Of Jesus Christ, namely, by Moses and all the prophets, by John the Baptist, by all the apostles, and in all the writings of the New Testament. And against his testimony there can be no exception, because the Spirit is truth - The very God of truth.</p>
