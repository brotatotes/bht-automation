<p><em>Wherefore</em> — Having such encouragement.</p>
<p><em>Gird up the loins of your mind</em> — As persons in the eastern countries were wont, in travelling or running, to gird up their long garments, so gather ye up all your thoughts and affections, and keep your mind always disencumbered and prepared to run the race which is set before you.</p>
<p><em>Be watchful</em> — As servants that wait for their Lord.</p>
<p><em>And hope to the end</em> — Maintain a full expectation of all the grace - The blessings flowing from the free favour of God. Which shall be brought to you at the final revelation of Jesus Christ - And which are now brought to you by the revelation of Christ in you.</p>
