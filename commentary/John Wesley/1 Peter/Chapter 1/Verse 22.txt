<p>Having purified your souls by obeying the truth through the Spirit, who bestows upon you freely, both obedience and purity of heart, and unfeigned love of the brethren, go on to still higher degrees of love.</p>
<p><em>Love one another fervently</em> â€” With the most strong and tender affection; and yet with a pure heart - Pure from any spot of unholy desire or inordinate passion.</p>
