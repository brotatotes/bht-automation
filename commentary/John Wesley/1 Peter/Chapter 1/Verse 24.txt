All flesh — Every human creature is transient and withering as grass. And all the glory of it - His wisdom, strength, wealth, righteousness.As the flower — The most short-lived part of it.The grass — That is, man.The flower — That is, his glory.Is fallen off — As it were, while we are speaking. Isaiah 40:6, etc.
