<p><em>All flesh</em> — Every human creature is transient and withering as grass. And all the glory of it - His wisdom, strength, wealth, righteousness.</p>
<p><em>As the flower</em> — The most short-lived part of it.</p>
<p><em>The grass</em> — That is, man.</p>
<p><em>The flower</em> — That is, his glory.</p>
<p><em>Is fallen off</em> — As it were, while we are speaking. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:6">Isaiah 40:6</span>, etc.</p>
