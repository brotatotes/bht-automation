<p><em>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</em> — His Father, with respect to his divine nature; his God, with respect to his human.</p>
<p><em>Who hath regenerated us to a living hope</em> — An hope which implies true spiritual life, which revives the heart, and makes the soul lively and vigorous.</p>
<p><em>By the resurrection of Christ</em> — Which is not only a pledge of ours, but a part of the purchase-price. It has also a close connexion with our rising from spiritual death, that as he liveth, so shall we live with him. He was acknowledged to be the Christ, but usually called Jesus till his resurrection; then he was also called Christ.</p>
