To an inheritance — For if we are sons, then heirs.Incorruptible — Not like earthly treasures.Undefiled — Pure and holy, incapable of being itself defiled, or of being enjoyed by any polluted soul.And that fadeth not away — That never decays in its value, sweetness, or beauty, like all the enjoyments of this world, like the garlands of leaves or flowers, with which the ancient conquerors were wont to be crowned.Reserved in heaven for you — Who "by patient continuance in welldoing, seek for glory and honour and immortality."
