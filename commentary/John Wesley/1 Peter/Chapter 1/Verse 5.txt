Who are kept — The inheritance is reserved; the heirs are kept for it.By the power of God — Which worketh all in all, which guards us against all our enemies.Through faith — Through which alone salvation is both received and retained.Ready to be revealed — That revelation is made in the last day. It was more and more ready to be revealed, ever since Christ came.
