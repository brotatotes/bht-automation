<p><em>Who are kept</em> — The inheritance is reserved; the heirs are kept for it.</p>
<p><em>By the power of God</em> — Which worketh all in all, which guards us against all our enemies.</p>
<p><em>Through faith</em> — Through which alone salvation is both received and retained.</p>
<p><em>Ready to be revealed</em> — That revelation is made in the last day. It was more and more ready to be revealed, ever since Christ came.</p>
