That the trial of your faith — That is, your faith which is tried.Which is much more precious than gold — For gold, though it bear the fire, yet will perish with the world.May be found — Though it doth not yet appear.Unto praise — From God himself.And honour — From men and angels.And glory — Assigned by the great Judge.
