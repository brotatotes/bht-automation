<p><em>That the trial of your faith</em> — That is, your faith which is tried.</p>
<p><em>Which is much more precious than gold</em> — For gold, though it bear the fire, yet will perish with the world.</p>
<p><em>May be found</em> — Though it doth not yet appear.</p>
<p><em>Unto praise</em> — From God himself.</p>
<p><em>And honour</em> — From men and angels.</p>
<p><em>And glory</em> — Assigned by the great Judge.</p>
