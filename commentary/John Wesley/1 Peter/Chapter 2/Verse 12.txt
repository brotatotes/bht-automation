<p><em>Honest</em> — Not barely unblamable, but virtuous in every respect. But our language sinks under the force, beauty, and copiousness of the original expressions.</p>
<p><em>That they by your good works which they shall behold</em> — See with their own eyes.</p>
<p><em>May glorify God</em> — By owning his grace in you, and following your example.</p>
<p><em>In the day of visitation</em> — The time when he shall give them fresh offers of his mercy.</p>
