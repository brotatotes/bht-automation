Honest — Not barely unblamable, but virtuous in every respect. But our language sinks under the force, beauty, and copiousness of the original expressions.That they by your good works which they shall behold — See with their own eyes.May glorify God — By owning his grace in you, and following your example.In the day of visitation — The time when he shall give them fresh offers of his mercy.
