Desire — Always, as earnestly as new born babes do, 1 Peter 1:3.The milk of the word — That word of God which nourishes the soul as milk does the body, and which is sincere, pure from all guile, so that none are deceived who cleave to it.That you may grow thereby — In faith, love, holiness, unto the full stature of Christ.
