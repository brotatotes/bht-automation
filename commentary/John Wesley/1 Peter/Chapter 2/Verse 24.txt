Who himself bore our sins — That is, the punishment due to them. In his afflicted, torn, dying body on the tree - The cross, whereon chiefly slaves or servants were wont to suffer.That we being dead to sin — Wholly delivered both from the guilt and power of it: indeed, without an atonement first made for the guilt, we could never have been delivered from the power.Might live to righteousness — Which is one only. The sins we had committed, and he bore, were manifold.
