<p><em>To whom coming</em> — By faith.</p>
<p><em>As unto a living stone</em> — Living from eternity; alive from the dead. There is a wonderful beauty and energy in these expressions, which describe Christ as a spiritual foundation, solid, firm, durable; and believers as a building erected upon it, in preference to that temple which the Jews accounted their highest glory. And St. Peter speaking of him thus, shows he did not judge himself, but Christ, to be the rock on which the church was built.</p>
<p><em>Rejected indeed by men</em> — Even at this day, not only by Jews, Turks, heathens, infidels; but by all Christians, so called, who live in sin, or who hope to be saved by their own works.</p>
<p><em>But chosen of God</em> — From all eternity, to be the foundation of his church.</p>
<p><em>And precious</em> — In himself, in the sight of God, and in the eyes of all believers.</p>
