Ye — Believers.As living stones — Alive to God through him.Are built up — In union with each other.A spiritual house — Being spiritual yourselves, and an habitation of God through the Spirit.An holy priesthood — Consecrated to God, and "holy as he is holy." To offer up - Your souls and bodies, with all your thoughts, words, and actions, as spiritual sacrifices to God.
