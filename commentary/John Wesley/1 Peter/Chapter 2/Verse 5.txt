<p><em>Ye</em> — Believers.</p>
<p><em>As living stones</em> — Alive to God through him.</p>
<p><em>Are built up</em> — In union with each other.</p>
<p><em>A spiritual house</em> — Being spiritual yourselves, and an habitation of God through the Spirit.</p>
<p><em>An holy priesthood</em> — Consecrated to God, and "holy as he is holy." To offer up - Your souls and bodies, with all your thoughts, words, and actions, as spiritual sacrifices to God.</p>
