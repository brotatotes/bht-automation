<p><em>But ye</em> — Who believe in Christ Are - In a higher sense than ever the Jews were. A chosen or elect race, a royal priesthood - "Kings and priests unto God," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+1:6">Revelation 1:6</span>. As princes, ye have power with God, and victory over sin, the world, and the devil: as priests, ye are consecrated to God, for offering spiritual sacrifices. Ye Christians are as one holy nation, under Christ your King.</p>
<p><em>A purchased people</em> — Who are his peculiar property.</p>
<p><em>That ye may show forth</em> — By your whole behaviour, to all mankind.</p>
<p><em>The virtues</em> — The excellent glory, the mercy, wisdom, and power of him, Christ, who hath called you out of the darkness of ignorance, error, sin, and misery.</p>
