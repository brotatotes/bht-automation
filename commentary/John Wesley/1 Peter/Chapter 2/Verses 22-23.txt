In all these instances the example of Christ is peculiarly adapted to the state of servants, who easily slide either into sin or guile, reviling their fellowservants, or threatening them, the natural result of anger without power.He committed himself to him that judgeth righteously â€” The only solid ground of patience in affliction. Isaiah 53:4,6,7,9.
