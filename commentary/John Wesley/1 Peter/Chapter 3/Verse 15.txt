<p><em>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts</em> — Have an holy fear, and a full trust in his wise providence.</p>
<p><em>The hope</em> — Of eternal life.</p>
<p><em>With meekness</em> — For anger would hurt your cause as well as your soul.</p>
<p><em>And fear</em> — A filial fear of offending God, and a jealousy over yourselves, lest ye speak amiss.</p>
