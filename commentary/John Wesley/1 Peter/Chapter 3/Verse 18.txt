<p><em>For</em> — This is undoubtedly best, whereby we are most conformed to Christ. Now Christ suffered once - To suffer no more.</p>
<p><em>For sins</em> — Not his own, but ours.</p>
<p><em>The just for the unjust</em> — The word signifies, not only them who have wronged their neighbours, but those who have transgressed any of the commands of God; as the preceding word, just, denotes a person who has fulfilled, not barely social duties, but all kind of righteousness.</p>
<p><em>That he might bring us to God</em> — Now to his gracious favour, hereafter to his blissful presence, by the same steps of suffering and of glory.</p>
<p><em>Being put to death in the flesh</em> — As man.</p>
<p><em>But raised to life by the Spirit</em> — Both by his own divine power, and by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
