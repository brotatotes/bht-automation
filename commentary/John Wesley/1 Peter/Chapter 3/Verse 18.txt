For — This is undoubtedly best, whereby we are most conformed to Christ. Now Christ suffered once - To suffer no more.For sins — Not his own, but ours.The just for the unjust — The word signifies, not only them who have wronged their neighbours, but those who have transgressed any of the commands of God; as the preceding word, just, denotes a person who has fulfilled, not barely social duties, but all kind of righteousness.That he might bring us to God — Now to his gracious favour, hereafter to his blissful presence, by the same steps of suffering and of glory.Being put to death in the flesh — As man.But raised to life by the Spirit — Both by his own divine power, and by the power of the Holy Ghost.
