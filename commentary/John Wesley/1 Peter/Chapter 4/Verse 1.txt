<p><em>Arm yourselves with the same mind</em> — Which will be armour of proof against all your enemies.</p>
<p><em>For he that hath suffered in the flesh</em> — That hath so suffered as to he thereby made inwardly and truly conformable to the sufferings of Christ.</p>
<p><em>Hath ceased from sin</em> — Is delivered from it.</p>
