<p><em>As every one hath received a gift</em> — Spiritual or temporal, ordinary or extraordinary, although the latter seems primarily intended.</p>
<p><em>So minister it one to another</em> — Employ it for the common good.</p>
<p><em>As good stewards of the manifold grace of God</em> — The talents wherewith his free love has intrusted you.</p>
