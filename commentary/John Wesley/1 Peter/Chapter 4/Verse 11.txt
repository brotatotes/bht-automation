If any man speak, let him — In his whole conversation, public and private.Speak as the oracles of God — Let all his words be according to this pattern, both as to matter and manner, more especially in public. By this mark we may always know who are, so far, the true or false prophets. The oracles of God teach that men should repent, believe, obey. He that treats of faith and leaves out repentance, or does not enjoin practical holiness to believers, does not speak as the oracles of God: he does not preach Christ, let him think as highly of himself as he will.If any man minister — Serve his brother in love, whether in spintuals or temporals.Let him minister as of the ability which God giveth — That is, humbly and diligently, ascribing all his power to God, and using it with his might.Whose is the glory — of his wisdom, which teaches us to speak.And the might — Which enables us to act.
