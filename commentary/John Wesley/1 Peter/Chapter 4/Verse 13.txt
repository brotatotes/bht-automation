<p><em>But as ye partake of the sufferings of Christ</em> â€” <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:1">1 Peter 4:1</span>, while ye suffer for his sake, rejoice in hope of more abundant glory. For the measure of glory answers the measure of suffering; and much more abundantly.</p>
