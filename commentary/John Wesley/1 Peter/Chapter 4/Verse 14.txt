If ye are reproached for Christ — Reproaches and cruel mockings were always one part of their sufferings.The Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you — The same Spirit which was upon Christ, Luke 4:18. He is here termed, the Spirit of glory, conquering all reproach and shame, and the Spirit of God, whose Son, Jesus Christ is.On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified — That is, while they are blaspheming Christ, you glorify him in the midst of your sufferings, 1 Peter 4:16.
