<p><em>If ye are reproached for Christ</em> — Reproaches and cruel mockings were always one part of their sufferings.</p>
<p><em>The Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you</em> — The same Spirit which was upon Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:18">Luke 4:18</span>. He is here termed, the Spirit of glory, conquering all reproach and shame, and the Spirit of God, whose Son, Jesus Christ is.</p>
<p><em>On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified</em> — That is, while they are blaspheming Christ, you glorify him in the midst of your sufferings, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:16">1 Peter 4:16</span>.</p>
