If the righteous scarcely be saved — Escape with the utmost difficulty.Where shall the ungodly — The man who knows not God. And the open sinner appear - In that day of vengeance. The salvation here primarily spoken of is of a temporal nature. But we may apply the words to eternal things, and then they are still more awful. Proverbs 11:31.
