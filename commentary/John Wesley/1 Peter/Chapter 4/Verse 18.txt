<p><em>If the righteous scarcely be saved</em> — Escape with the utmost difficulty.</p>
<p><em>Where shall the ungodly</em> — The man who knows not God. And the open sinner appear - In that day of vengeance. The salvation here primarily spoken of is of a temporal nature. But we may apply the words to eternal things, and then they are still more awful. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="pr+11:31">Proverbs 11:31</span>.</p>
