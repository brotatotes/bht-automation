Let them that suffer according to the will of God — Both for a good cause, and in a right spirit.Commit to him their souls — (Whatever becomes of the body) as a sacred depositum.In well doing — Be this your care, to do and suffer well: He will take care of the rest.As unto a faithful Creator — In whose truth, love, and power, ye may safely trust.
