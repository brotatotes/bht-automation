<p><em>Let them that suffer according to the will of God</em> — Both for a good cause, and in a right spirit.</p>
<p><em>Commit to him their souls</em> — (Whatever becomes of the body) as a sacred depositum.</p>
<p><em>In well doing</em> — Be this your care, to do and suffer well: He will take care of the rest.</p>
<p><em>As unto a faithful Creator</em> — In whose truth, love, and power, ye may safely trust.</p>
