<p><em>For to this end was the gospel preached</em> — Ever since it was given to Adam.</p>
<p><em>To them that are now dead</em> — In their several generations.</p>
<p><em>That they might be judged</em> — That though they were judged. In the flesh according to the manner of men - With rash, unrighteous judgment. They might live according to the will and word of God, in the Spirit; the soul renewed after his image.</p>
