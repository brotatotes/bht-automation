For to this end was the gospel preached — Ever since it was given to Adam.To them that are now dead — In their several generations.That they might be judged — That though they were judged. In the flesh according to the manner of men - With rash, unrighteous judgment. They might live according to the will and word of God, in the Spirit; the soul renewed after his image.
