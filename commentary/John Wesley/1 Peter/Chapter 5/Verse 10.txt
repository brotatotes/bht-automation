Now the God of all grace — By which alone the whole work is begun, continued, and finished in your soul.After ye have suffered a while — A very little while compared with eternity.Himself — Ye have only to watch and resist the devil: the rest God will perform.Perfect — That no defect may remain.Stablish — That nothing may overthrow you.Strengthen — That ye may conquer all adverse power.And settle you — As an house upon a rock. So the apostle, being converted, does now "strengthen his brethren."
