<p><em>Now the God of all grace</em> — By which alone the whole work is begun, continued, and finished in your soul.</p>
<p><em>After ye have suffered a while</em> — A very little while compared with eternity.</p>
<p><em>Himself</em> — Ye have only to watch and resist the devil: the rest God will perform.</p>
<p><em>Perfect</em> — That no defect may remain.</p>
<p><em>Stablish</em> — That nothing may overthrow you.</p>
<p><em>Strengthen</em> — That ye may conquer all adverse power.</p>
<p><em>And settle you</em> — As an house upon a rock. So the apostle, being converted, does now "strengthen his brethren."</p>
