<p><em>Ye younger, be subject to the elder</em> — In years.</p>
<p><em>And be all</em> — Elder or younger.</p>
<p><em>Subject to each other</em> — Let every one be ready, upon all occasions, to give up his own will. Be clothed with humility-Bind it on, (so the word signifies,) so that no force may be able to tear it from you. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:6">James 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:34">Proverbs 3:34</span></p>
