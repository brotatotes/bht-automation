Ye younger, be subject to the elder — In years.And be all — Elder or younger.Subject to each other — Let every one be ready, upon all occasions, to give up his own will. Be clothed with humility-Bind it on, (so the word signifies,) so that no force may be able to tear it from you. James 4:6; Proverbs 3:34
