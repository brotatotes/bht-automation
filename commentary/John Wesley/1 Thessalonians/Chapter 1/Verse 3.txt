<p><em>Remembering in the sight of God</em> — That is, praising him for it.</p>
<p><em>Your work of faith</em> — Your active, ever-working faith.</p>
<p><em>And labour of love</em> — Love continually labouring for the bodies or souls of men. They who do not thus labour, do not love. Faith works, love labours, hope patiently suffers all things.</p>
