And may the God of peace sanctify you — By the peace he works in you, which is a great means of sanctification.Wholly — The word signifies wholly and perfectly; every part and all that concerns you; all that is of or about you.And may the whole of you, the spirit and the soul and the body — Just before he said you; now he denominates them from their spiritual state.The spirit — Galatians 6:8; wishing that it may be preserved whole and entire: then from their natural state, the soul and the body; (for these two make up the whole nature of man, Matthew 10:28;) wishing it may be preserved blameless till the coming of Christ. To explain this a little further: of the three here mentioned, only the two last are the natural constituent parts of man. The first is adventitious, and the supernatural gift of God, to be found in Christians only. That man cannot possibly consist of three parts, appears hence: The soul is either matter or not matter: there is no medium. But if it is matter, it is part of the body: if not matter, it coincides with the Spirit.
