<p><em>A blasphemer</em> — Of Christ.</p>
<p><em>A persecutor</em> — Of his church.</p>
<p><em>A reviler</em> — Of his doctrine and people.</p>
<p><em>But I obtained mercy</em> — He does not say, because I was unconditionally elected; but because I did it in ignorance. Not that his ignorance took away his sin; but it left him capable of mercy; which he would hardly have been, had he acted thus contrary to his own conviction.</p>
