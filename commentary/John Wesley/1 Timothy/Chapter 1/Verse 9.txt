The law doth not lie against a righteous man — Doth not strike or condemn him.But against the lawless and disobedient — They who despise the authority of the lawgiver violate the first commandment, which is the foundation of the law, and the ground of all obedience.Against the ungodly and sinners — Who break the second commandment, worshipping idols, or not worshipping the true God.The unholy and profane — Who break the third commandment by taking his name in vain.
