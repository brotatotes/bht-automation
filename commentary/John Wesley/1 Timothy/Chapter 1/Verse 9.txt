<p><em>The law doth not lie against a righteous man</em> — Doth not strike or condemn him.</p>
<p><em>But against the lawless and disobedient</em> — They who despise the authority of the lawgiver violate the first commandment, which is the foundation of the law, and the ground of all obedience.</p>
<p><em>Against the ungodly and sinners</em> — Who break the second commandment, worshipping idols, or not worshipping the true God.</p>
<p><em>The unholy and profane</em> — Who break the third commandment by taking his name in vain.</p>
