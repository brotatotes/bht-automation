<p><em>For all that are in authority</em> — Seeing even the lowest country magistrates frequently do much good or much harm. God supports the power of magistracy for the sake of his own people, when, in the present state of men, it could not otherwise be kept up in any nation whatever.</p>
<p><em>Godliness</em> — Inward religion; the true worship of God.</p>
<p><em>Honesty</em> — A comprehensive word taking in the whole duty we owe to our neighbour.</p>
