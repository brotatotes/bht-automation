<p><em>For</em> — The fourth verse is proved by the fifth; the first, by the fourth.</p>
<p><em>There is one God</em> — And they who have not him, through the one Mediator, have no God.</p>
<p><em>One mediator also</em> — We could not rejoice that there is a God, were there not a mediator also; one who stands between God and men, to reconcile man to God, and to transact the whole affair of our salvation. This excludes all other mediators, as saints and angels, whom the Papists set up and idolatrously worship as such: just as the heathens of old set up many mediators, to pacify their superior gods.</p>
<p><em>The man</em> — Therefore all men are to apply to this mediator, "who gave himself for all."</p>
