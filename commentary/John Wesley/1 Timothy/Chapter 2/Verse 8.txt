<p><em>I will</em> — A word strongly expressing his apostolical authority.</p>
<p><em>Therefore</em> — This particle connects the eighth with the first verse.</p>
<p><em>That men pray in every place</em> — Public and private. Wherever men are, there prayer should be.</p>
<p><em>Lifting up holy hands</em> — Pure from all known sin.</p>
<p><em>Without wrath</em> — In any kind, against any creature. And every temper or motion of our soul that is not according to love is wrath. And doubting - Which is contrary to faith. And wrath, or unholy actions, or want of faith in him we call upon, are the three grand hinderances of God's hearing our petitions. Christianity consists of faith and love, embracing truth and grace: therefore the sum of our wishes should be, to pray, and live, and die, without any wrath or doubt.</p>
