<p><em>With sobriety</em> — Which, in St. Paul's sense, is the virtue which governs our whole life according to true wisdom.</p>
<p><em>Not with curled hair, not with gold</em> — Worn by way of ornament.</p>
<p><em>Not with pearls</em> — Jewels of any kind: a part is put for the whole.</p>
<p><em>Not with costly raiment</em> — These four are expressly forbidden by name to all women (here is no exception) professing godliness, and no art of man can reconcile with the Christian profession the wilful violation of an express command.</p>
