<p><em>But the Spirit saith</em> — By St. Paul himself to the Thessalonians, and probably by other contemporary prophets.</p>
<p><em>Expressly</em> — As concerning a thing of great moment, and soon to be fulfilled.</p>
<p><em>That in the latter times</em> — These extend from our Lord's ascension till his coming to judgment.</p>
<p><em>Some</em> — Yea, many, and by degrees the far greater part.</p>
<p><em>Will depart from the faith</em> — The doctrine once delivered to the saints.</p>
<p><em>Giving heed to seducing spirits</em> — Who inspire false prophets.</p>
