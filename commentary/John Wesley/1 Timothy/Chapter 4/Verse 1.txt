But the Spirit saith — By St. Paul himself to the Thessalonians, and probably by other contemporary prophets.Expressly — As concerning a thing of great moment, and soon to be fulfilled.That in the latter times — These extend from our Lord's ascension till his coming to judgment.Some — Yea, many, and by degrees the far greater part.Will depart from the faith — The doctrine once delivered to the saints.Giving heed to seducing spirits — Who inspire false prophets.
