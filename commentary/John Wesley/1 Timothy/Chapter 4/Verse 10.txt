Therefore — Animated by this promise.We both labour and suffer reproach — We regard neither pleasure, ease, nor honour.Because we trust — For this very thing the world will hate us.In the living God — Who will give us the life he has promised.Who is the Saviour of all men — Preserving them in this life, and willing to save them eternally.But especially — In a more eminent manner.Of them that believe — And so are saved everlastingly.
