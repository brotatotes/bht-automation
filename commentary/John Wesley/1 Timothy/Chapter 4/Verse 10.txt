<p><em>Therefore</em> — Animated by this promise.</p>
<p><em>We both labour and suffer reproach</em> — We regard neither pleasure, ease, nor honour.</p>
<p><em>Because we trust</em> — For this very thing the world will hate us.</p>
<p><em>In the living God</em> — Who will give us the life he has promised.</p>
<p><em>Who is the Saviour of all men</em> — Preserving them in this life, and willing to save them eternally.</p>
<p><em>But especially</em> — In a more eminent manner.</p>
<p><em>Of them that believe</em> — And so are saved everlastingly.</p>
