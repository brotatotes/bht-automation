Fight the good fight of faith — Not about words.Lay hold on eternal life — Just before thee.Thou hast confessed the good confession — Perhaps at his baptism: so likewise, 1 Timothy 6:13; but with a remarkable variation of the expression.Thou hast confessed the good confession before many witnesses — To which they all assented. He witnessed the good confession; but Pilate did not assent to it.
