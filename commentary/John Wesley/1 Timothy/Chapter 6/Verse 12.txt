<p><em>Fight the good fight of faith</em> — Not about words.</p>
<p><em>Lay hold on eternal life</em> — Just before thee.</p>
<p><em>Thou hast confessed the good confession</em> — Perhaps at his baptism: so likewise, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:13">1 Timothy 6:13</span>; but with a remarkable variation of the expression.</p>
<p><em>Thou hast confessed the good confession before many witnesses</em> — To which they all assented. He witnessed the good confession; but Pilate did not assent to it.</p>
