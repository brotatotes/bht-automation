What follows seems to be a kind of a postscript.Charge the rich in this world — Rich in such beggarly riches as this world affords.Not to be highminded — O who regards this! Not to think better of themselves for their money, or anything it can purchase.Neither to trust in uncertain riches — Which they may lose in an hour; either for happiness or defence.But in the living God — All the rest is dead clay.Who giveth us — As it were holding them out to us in his hand.All things — Which we have.Richly — Freely, abundantly.To enjoy — As his gift, in him and for him. When we use them thus, we do indeed enjoy all things. Where else is there any notice taken of the rich, in all the apostolic writings, save to denounce woes and vengeance upon them?
