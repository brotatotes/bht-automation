<p><em>Let them not despise them</em> — Pay them the less honour or obedience.</p>
<p><em>Because they are brethren</em> — And in that respect on a level with them. They that live in a religious community know the danger of this; and that greater grace is requisite to bear with the faults of a brother, than of an infidel, or man of the world.</p>
<p><em>But rather do them service</em> — Serve them so much the more diligently. Because they are joint partakers of the great benefit - Salvation.</p>
<p><em>These things</em> — Paul, the aged, gives young Timotheus a charge to dwell upon practical holiness. Less experienced teachers are apt to neglect the superstructure, whilst they lay the foundation; but of so great importance did St. Paul see it to enforce obedience to Christ, as well as to preach faith in his blood, that, after strongly urging the life of faith on professors, he even adds another charge for the strict observance of it.</p>
