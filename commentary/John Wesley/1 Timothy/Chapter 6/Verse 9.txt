<p><em>They that desire to be rich</em> — To have more than these; for then they would be so far rich; and the very desire banishes content, and exposes them to ruin.</p>
<p><em>Fall-plunge</em> — A sad gradation! Into temptation - Miserable food for the soul! And a snare - Or trap. Dreadful "covering!" And into many foolish and hurtful desires - Which are sown and fed by having more than we need. Then farewell all hope of content! What then remains, but destruction for the body, and perdition for the soul?</p>
