For I am the more emboldened to look for this, because I am conscious of my integrity; seeing this is our rejoicing - Even in the deepest adversity.The testimony of our conscience — Whatever others think of us.That in simplicity — Having one end in view, aiming singly at the glory of God.And godly sincerity — Without any tincture of guile, dissimulation, or disguise.Not with carnal wisdom, but by the grace of God — Not by natural, but divine, wisdom.We have had our conversation in the world — In the whole world; in every circumstance.
