<p>For I am the more emboldened to look for this, because I am conscious of my integrity; seeing this is our rejoicing - Even in the deepest adversity.</p>
<p><em>The testimony of our conscience</em> — Whatever others think of us.</p>
<p><em>That in simplicity</em> — Having one end in view, aiming singly at the glory of God.</p>
<p><em>And godly sincerity</em> — Without any tincture of guile, dissimulation, or disguise.</p>
<p><em>Not with carnal wisdom, but by the grace of God</em> — Not by natural, but divine, wisdom.</p>
<p><em>We have had our conversation in the world</em> — In the whole world; in every circumstance.</p>
