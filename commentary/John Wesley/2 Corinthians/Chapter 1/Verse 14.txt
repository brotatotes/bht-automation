<p><em>Ye have acknowledged us in part</em> — Though not so fully as ye will do.</p>
<p><em>That we are you rejoicing</em> — That ye rejoice in having known us.</p>
<p><em>As ye also are ours</em> — As we also rejoice in the success of our labours among you; and we trust shall rejoice therein in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
