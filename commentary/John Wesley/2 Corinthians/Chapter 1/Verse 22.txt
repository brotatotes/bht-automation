Who also hath sealed us — Stamping his image on our hearts, thus marking and sealing us as his own property.And given us the earnest of his Spirit — There is a difference between an earnest and a pledge. A pledge is to be restored when the debt is paid; but an earnest is not taken away, but completed. Such an earnest is the Spirit. The first fruits of it we have Romans 8:23; and we wait for all the fulness.
