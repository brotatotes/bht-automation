<p><em>Not that we have dominion over your faith</em> — This is the prerogative of God alone.</p>
<p><em>But are helpers of your joy</em> — And faith from which it springs.</p>
<p><em>For by faith ye have stood</em> — To this day. We see the light in which ministers should always consider themselves, and in which they are to be considered by others. Not as having dominion over the faith of their people, and having a right to dictate by their own authority what they shall believe, or what they shall do; but as helpers of their joy, by helping them forward in faith and holiness. In this view, how amiable does their office appear! and how friendly to the happiness of mankind! How far, then, are they from true benevolence, who would expose it to ridicule and contempt!</p>
