<p><em>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</em> — A solemn and beautiful introduction, highly suitable to the apostolical spirit.</p>
<p><em>The Father of mercies, and God of all comfort</em> — Mercies are the fountain of comfort; comfort is the outward expression of mercy. God shows mercy in the affliction itself. He gives comfort both in and after the affliction. Therefore is he termed, the God of all comfort. Blessed be this God!</p>
