And whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation — For your present comfort, your present and future salvation.Or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort — That we may be the better able to comfort you.Which is effectual in the patient enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer — Through the efficacy of which you patiently endure the same kind of sufferings with us.
