Destroying all vain reasonings, and every high thing which exalteth itself - As a wall or rampart.Against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought — Or, rather, faculty of the mind.Into captivity to the obedience of Christ — Those evil reasonings are destroyed. The mind itself, being overcome and taken captive, lays down all authority of its own, and entirely gives itself up to perform, for the time to come, to Christ its conqueror the obedience of faith.
