<p><em>Being in readiness to avenge all disobedience</em> — Not only by spiritual censure, but miraculous punishments.</p>
<p><em>When your obedience is fulfilled</em> — When the sound part of you have given proof of your obedience, so that I am in no danger of punishing the innocent with the guilty.</p>
