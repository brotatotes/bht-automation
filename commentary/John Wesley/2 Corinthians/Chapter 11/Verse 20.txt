<p><em>For ye suffer</em> — Not only the folly, but the gross abuses, of those false apostles.</p>
<p><em>If a man enslave you</em> — Lord it over you in the most arbitrary manner.</p>
<p><em>If he devour you</em> — By his exorbitant demands; not - withstanding his boast of not being burdensome.</p>
<p><em>If he take from you</em> — By open violence.</p>
<p><em>If he exalt himself</em> — By the most unbounded self-commendation.</p>
<p><em>If he smite you on the face</em> — (A very possible case,) under pretence of divine zeal.</p>
