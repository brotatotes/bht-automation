For ye suffer — Not only the folly, but the gross abuses, of those false apostles.If a man enslave you — Lord it over you in the most arbitrary manner.If he devour you — By his exorbitant demands; not - withstanding his boast of not being burdensome.If he take from you — By open violence.If he exalt himself — By the most unbounded self-commendation.If he smite you on the face — (A very possible case,) under pretence of divine zeal.
