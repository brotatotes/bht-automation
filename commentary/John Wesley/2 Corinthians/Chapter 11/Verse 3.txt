<p><em>But I fear</em> — Love is full of these fears.</p>
<p><em>Lest as the serpent</em> — A most apposite comparison.</p>
<p><em>Deceived Eve</em> — Simple, ignorant of evil.</p>
<p><em>By his subtilty</em> — Which is in the highest degree dangerous to such a disposition.</p>
<p><em>So your minds</em> — We might therefore be tempted, even if there were no sin in us.</p>
<p><em>Might be corrupted</em> — Losing their virginal purity.</p>
<p><em>From the simplicity that is in Christ</em> — That simplicity which is lovingly intent on him alone, seeking no other person or thing.</p>
