But I fear — Love is full of these fears.Lest as the serpent — A most apposite comparison.Deceived Eve — Simple, ignorant of evil.By his subtilty — Which is in the highest degree dangerous to such a disposition.So your minds — We might therefore be tempted, even if there were no sin in us.Might be corrupted — Losing their virginal purity.From the simplicity that is in Christ — That simplicity which is lovingly intent on him alone, seeking no other person or thing.
