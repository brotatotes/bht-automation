<p><em>I spoiled other churches</em> — I, as it were, took the spoils of them: it is a military term. Taking wages (or pay, another military word) of them - When I came to you at first.</p>
<p><em>And when I was present with you, and wanted</em> — My work not quite supplying my necessities.</p>
<p><em>I was chargeable to no man</em> — Of Corinth.</p>
