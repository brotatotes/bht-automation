<p><em>I knew a man in Christ</em> — That is, a Christian. It is plain from2Corinthians12:6,7, that he means himself, though in modesty he speaks as of a third person.</p>
<p><em>Whether in the body or out of the body I know not</em> — It is equally possible with God to present distant things to the imagination in the body, as if the soul were absent from it, and present with them; or to transport both soul and body for what time he pleases to heaven; or to transport the soul only thither for a season, and in the mean time to preserve the body fit for its re-entrance. But since the apostle himself did not know whether his soul was in the body, or whether one or both were actually in heaven, it would be vain curiosity for us to attempt determining it.</p>
<p><em>The third heaven</em> — Where God is; far above the aerial and the starry heaven. Some suppose it was here the apostle was let into the mystery of the future state of the church; and received his orders to turn from the Jews and go to the gentiles.</p>
