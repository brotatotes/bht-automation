<p><em>The grace</em> — Or favour.</p>
<p><em>Of our Lord Jesus Christ</em> — By which alone we can come to the Father.</p>
<p><em>And the love of God</em> — Manifested to you, and abiding in you.</p>
<p><em>And the communion</em> — Or fellowship.</p>
<p><em>Of the Holy Ghost</em> — In all his gifts and graces. It is with great reason that this comprehensive and instructive blessing is pronounced at the close of our solemn assemblies; and it is a very indecent thing to see so many quitting them, or getting into postures of remove, before this short sentence can be ended. How often have we heard this awful benediction pronounced! Let us study it more and more, that we may value it proportionably; that we may either deliver or receive it with a becoming reverence, with eyes and hearts lifted up to God, "who giveth the blessing out of Sion, and life for evermore."</p>
