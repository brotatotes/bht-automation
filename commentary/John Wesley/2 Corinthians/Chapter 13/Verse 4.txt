He was crucified through weakness — Through the impotence of human nature.We also are weak with him — We appear weak and despicable by partaking of the same sufferings for his sake.But we shall live with him — Being raised from the dead.By the power of God in you — By that divine energy which is now in every believer, 2 Corinthians 13:5.
