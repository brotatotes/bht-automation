<p><em>I pray God that ye may do no evil</em> — To give me occasion of showing my apostolical power. I do not desire to appear approved - By miraculously punishing you.</p>
<p><em>But that ye may do that which is good, though we should be as reprobates</em> — Having no occasion to give that proof of our apostleship.</p>
