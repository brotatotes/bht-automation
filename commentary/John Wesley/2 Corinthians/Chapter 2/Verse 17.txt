<p><em>For we are not as many, who adulterate the word of God</em> — Like those vintners (so the Greek word implies) who mix their wines with baser liquors.</p>
<p><em>But as of sincerity</em> — Without any mixture.</p>
<p><em>But as from God</em> — This rises higher still; transmitting his pure word, not our own.</p>
<p><em>In the sight of God</em> — Whom we regard as always present, and noting every word of our tongue.</p>
<p><em>Speak we</em> — The tongue is ours, but the power is God's.</p>
<p><em>In Christ</em> — Words which he gives, approves, and blesses.</p>
