For we are not as many, who adulterate the word of God — Like those vintners (so the Greek word implies) who mix their wines with baser liquors.But as of sincerity — Without any mixture.But as from God — This rises higher still; transmitting his pure word, not our own.In the sight of God — Whom we regard as always present, and noting every word of our tongue.Speak we — The tongue is ours, but the power is God's.In Christ — Words which he gives, approves, and blesses.
