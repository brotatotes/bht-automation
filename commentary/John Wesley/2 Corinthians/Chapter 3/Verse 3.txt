Manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ — Which he has formed and published to the world.Ministered by us — Whom he has used herein as his instruments, therefore ye are our letter also.Written not in tables of stone — Like the ten commandments. But in the tender, living tables of their hearts - God having taken away the hearts of stone and given them hearts of flesh.
