<p><em>Manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ</em> — Which he has formed and published to the world.</p>
<p><em>Ministered by us</em> — Whom he has used herein as his instruments, therefore ye are our letter also.</p>
<p><em>Written not in tables of stone</em> — Like the ten commandments. But in the tender, living tables of their hearts - God having taken away the hearts of stone and given them hearts of flesh.</p>
