<p><em>We also speak</em> — We preach the gospel, even in the midst of affliction and death, because we believe that God will raise us up from the dead, and will present us, ministers, with you, all his members, "faultless before his presence with exceeding joy." <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ps+116:10">Psalm 116:10</span>.</p>
