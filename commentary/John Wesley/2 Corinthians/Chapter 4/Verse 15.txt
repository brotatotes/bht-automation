<p><em>For all things</em> — Whether adverse or prosperous.</p>
<p><em>Are for your sakes</em> — For the profit of all that believe, as well as all that preach.</p>
<p><em>That the overflowing grace</em> — Which continues you alive both in soul and body. Might abound yet more through the thanksgiving of many - For thanksgiving invites more: abundant grace.</p>
