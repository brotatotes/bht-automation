<p><em>But have renounced</em> — Set at open defiance.</p>
<p><em>The hidden things of shame</em> — All things which men need to hide, or to be ashamed of.</p>
<p><em>Not walking in craftiness</em> — Using no disguise, subtlety, guile. Nor privily corrupting the pure word of God - By any additions or alterations, or by attempting to accommodate it to the taste of the hearers.</p>
