But have renounced — Set at open defiance.The hidden things of shame — All things which men need to hide, or to be ashamed of.Not walking in craftiness — Using no disguise, subtlety, guile. Nor privily corrupting the pure word of God - By any additions or alterations, or by attempting to accommodate it to the taste of the hearers.
