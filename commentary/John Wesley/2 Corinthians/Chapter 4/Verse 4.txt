<p><em>The God of this world</em> — What a sublime and horrible description of Satan! He is indeed the god of all that believe not, and works in them with inconceivable energy.</p>
<p><em>Hath blinded</em> — Not only veiled, the eye of their understanding.</p>
<p><em>Illumination</em> — Is properly the reflection or propagation of light, from those who are already enlightened, to others.</p>
<p><em>Who is the image of God</em> — Hence also we may understand how great is the glory of Christ. He that sees the Son, sees the Father in the face of Christ. The Son exactly exhibits the Father to us.</p>
