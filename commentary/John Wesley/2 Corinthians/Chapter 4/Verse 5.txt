For — The fault is not in us, neither in the doctrine they hear from us.We preach not ourselves — As able either to enlighten, or pardon, or sanctify you.But Jesus Christ — As your only wisdom, righteousness, sanctification.And ourselves your servants — Ready to do the meanest offices.For Jesus' sake — Not for honour, interest, or pleasure.
