<p><em>For</em> — The fault is not in us, neither in the doctrine they hear from us.</p>
<p><em>We preach not ourselves</em> — As able either to enlighten, or pardon, or sanctify you.</p>
<p><em>But Jesus Christ</em> — As your only wisdom, righteousness, sanctification.</p>
<p><em>And ourselves your servants</em> — Ready to do the meanest offices.</p>
<p><em>For Jesus' sake</em> — Not for honour, interest, or pleasure.</p>
