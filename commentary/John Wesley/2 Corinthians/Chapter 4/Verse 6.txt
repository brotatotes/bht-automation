For God hath shined in our hearts — The hearts of all those whom the god of this world no longer blinds. God who is himself our light; not only the author of light, but also the fountain of it.To enlighten us with the knowledge of the glory of God — Of his glorious love, and of his glorious image.In the face of Jesus Christ — Which reflects his glory in another manner than the face of Moses did.
