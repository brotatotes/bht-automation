<p><em>For God hath shined in our hearts</em> — The hearts of all those whom the god of this world no longer blinds. God who is himself our light; not only the author of light, but also the fountain of it.</p>
<p><em>To enlighten us with the knowledge of the glory of God</em> — Of his glorious love, and of his glorious image.</p>
<p><em>In the face of Jesus Christ</em> — Which reflects his glory in another manner than the face of Moses did.</p>
