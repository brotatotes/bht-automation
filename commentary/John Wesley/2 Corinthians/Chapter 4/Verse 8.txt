<p>We are troubled, etc.-The four articles in this verse respect inward, the four in the next outward, afflictions. In each clause the former part shows the "earthen vessels;" the latter, "the excellence of the power." Not crushed - Not swallowed up in care and anxiety.</p>
<p><em>Perplexed</em> — What course to take, but never despairing of his power and love to carry us through.</p>
