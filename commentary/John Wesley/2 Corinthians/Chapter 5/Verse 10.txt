<p><em>For we all</em> — Apostles as well as other men, whether now present in the body, or absent from it.</p>
<p><em>Must appear</em> — Openly, without covering, where all hidden things will be revealed; probably the sins, even of the faithful, which were forgiven long before. For many of their good works, as their repentance, their revenge against sin, cannot other wise appear. But this will be done at their own desire, without grief, and without shame.</p>
<p><em>According to what he hath done in the body, whether good or evil</em> — In the body he did either good or evil; in the body he is recompensed accordingly.</p>
