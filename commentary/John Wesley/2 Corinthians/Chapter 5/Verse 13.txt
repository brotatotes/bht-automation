For if we are transported beyond ourselves — Or at least, appear so to others, treated of, 2 Corinthians 5:15-21, speaking or writing with uncommon vehemence.It is to God — He understands (if men do not) the emotion which himself inspires.If we be sober — Treated of, 2 Corinthians 6:1-10. If I proceed in a more calm, sedate manner.It is for your sakes — Even good men bear this, rather than the other method, in their teachers. But these must obey God, whoever is offended by it.
