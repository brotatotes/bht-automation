<p><em>And that he died for all</em> — That all might be saved.</p>
<p><em>That they who live</em> — That all who live upon the earth.</p>
<p><em>Should not henceforth</em> — From the moment they know him.</p>
<p><em>Live unto themselves</em> — Seek their own honour, profit, pleasure.</p>
<p><em>But unto him</em> — In all righteousness and true holiness.</p>
