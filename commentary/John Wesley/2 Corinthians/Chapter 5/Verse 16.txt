<p><em>So that we from this time</em> — That we knew the love of Christ.</p>
<p><em>Know no one</em> — Neither ourselves, nor you, neither the rest of the apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:6">Galatians 2:6</span>, nor any other person.</p>
<p><em>After the flesh</em> — According to his former state, country, descent, nobility, riches, power, wisdom. We fear not the great. We regard not the rich or wise. We account not the least less than ourselves. We consider all, only in order to save all. Who is he that thus knows no one after the flesh? ln what land do these Christians live? Yea, if we have known even Christ after the flesh - So as to love him barely with a natural love, so as to glory in having conversed with him on earth, so as to expect only temporal benefits from him.</p>
