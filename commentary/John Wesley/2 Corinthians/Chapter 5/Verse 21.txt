<p><em>He made him a sin offering, who knew no sin</em> — A commendation peculiar to Christ.</p>
<p><em>For us</em> — Who knew no righteousness, who were inwardly and outwardly nothing but sin; who must have been consumed by the divine justice, had not this atonement been made for our sins.</p>
<p><em>That we might be made the righteousness of God through him</em> — Might through him be invested with that righteousness, first imputed to us, then implanted in us, which is in every sense the righteousness of God.</p>
