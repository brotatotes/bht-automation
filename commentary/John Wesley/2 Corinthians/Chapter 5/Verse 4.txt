We groan being burdened — The apostle speaks with exact propriety. A burden naturally expresses groans. And we are here burdened with numberless afflictions, infirmities, temptations.Not that we would be unclothed — Not that we desire to remain without a body. Faith does not understand that philosophical contempt of what the wise Creator has given.But clothed upon — With the glorious, immortal, incorruptible, spiritual body.That what is mortal — This present mortal body.May be swallowed up of life — Covered with that which lives for ever.
