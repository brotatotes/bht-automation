<p><em>We groan being burdened</em> — The apostle speaks with exact propriety. A burden naturally expresses groans. And we are here burdened with numberless afflictions, infirmities, temptations.</p>
<p><em>Not that we would be unclothed</em> — Not that we desire to remain without a body. Faith does not understand that philosophical contempt of what the wise Creator has given.</p>
<p><em>But clothed upon</em> — With the glorious, immortal, incorruptible, spiritual body.</p>
<p><em>That what is mortal</em> — This present mortal body.</p>
<p><em>May be swallowed up of life</em> — Covered with that which lives for ever.</p>
