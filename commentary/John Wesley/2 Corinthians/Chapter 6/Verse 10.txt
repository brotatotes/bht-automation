<p><em>As sorrowing</em> — For our own manifold imperfections, and for the sins and sufferings of our brethren.</p>
<p><em>Yet always rejoicing</em> — In present peace, love, power, and a sure hope of future glory.</p>
<p><em>As having nothing, yet possessing all things</em> — For all things are ours, if we are Christ's. What a magnificence of thought is this!</p>
