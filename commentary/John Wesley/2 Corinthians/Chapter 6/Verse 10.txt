As sorrowing — For our own manifold imperfections, and for the sins and sufferings of our brethren.Yet always rejoicing — In present peace, love, power, and a sure hope of future glory.As having nothing, yet possessing all things — For all things are ours, if we are Christ's. What a magnificence of thought is this!
