<p><em>What agreement hath the temple of God with idols</em> — If God would not endure idols in any part of the land wherein he dwelt, how much less, under his own roof! He does not say, with the temple of idols, for idols do not dwell in their worshippers.</p>
<p><em>As God hath said</em> — To his ancient church, and in them to all the Israel of God.</p>
<p><em>I will dwell in them, and walk in them</em> — The former signifying his perpetual presence; the latter, his operation.</p>
<p><em>And I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people</em> — The sum of the whole gospel covenant. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="le+26:11">Leviticus 26:11</span>, etc.</p>
