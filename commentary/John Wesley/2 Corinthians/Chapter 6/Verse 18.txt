<p><em>And ye shall be to me for sons and for daughters, saith the Lord Almighty</em> â€” The promise made to Solomon, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1ch+28:6">1 Chronicles 28:6</span>, is here applied to all believers; as the promise made particularly to Joshua is applied to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:5">Hebrews 13:5</span>. Who can express the worth, who can conceive the dignity, of this divine adoption? Yet it belongs to all who believe the gospel, who have faith in Christ. They have access to the Almighty; such free and welcome access, as a beloved child to an indulgent father. To him they may fly for aid in every difficulty, and from him obtain a supply in all their wants. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+43:6">Isaiah 43:6</span>.</p>
