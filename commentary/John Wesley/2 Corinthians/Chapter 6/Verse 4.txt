<p><em>But approving ourselves as the ministers of God</em> — Such as his ministers ought to be.</p>
<p><em>In much patience</em> — Shown, 1.</p>
<p><em>In afflictions, necessities, distresses</em> — All which are general terms2.</p>
<p><em>In stripes, imprisonments, tumults</em> — Which are particular sorts of affliction, necessity, distress3.</p>
<p><em>In labours, watchings, fastings</em> — Voluntarily endured. All these are expressed in the plural number, to denote a variety of them. In afflictions, several ways to escape may appear, though none without difficulty in necessities, one only, and that a difficult one; in distresses, none at all appears.</p>
