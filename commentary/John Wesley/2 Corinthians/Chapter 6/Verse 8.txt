By honour and dishonour — When we are present.By evil report and good report — When we are absent. Who could bear honour and good report, were it not balanced by dishonour? As deceivers - Artful, designing men. So the world represents all true ministers of Christ.Yet true — Upright, sincere, in the sight of God.
