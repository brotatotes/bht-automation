<p><em>By honour and dishonour</em> — When we are present.</p>
<p><em>By evil report and good report</em> — When we are absent. Who could bear honour and good report, were it not balanced by dishonour? As deceivers - Artful, designing men. So the world represents all true ministers of Christ.</p>
<p><em>Yet true</em> — Upright, sincere, in the sight of God.</p>
