How great diligence it wrought in you — Shown in all the following particulars.Yea, clearing of yourselves — Some had been more, some less, faulty; whence arose these various affections. Hence their apologizing and indignation, with respect to themselves; their fear and desire, with respect to the apostle; their zeal and revenge, with respect to the offender, yea, and themselves also.Clearing of yourselves — From either sharing in, or approving of, his sin.Indignation — That ye had not immediately corrected the offender.Fear — Of God's displeasure, or lest I should come with a rod.Vehement desire — To see me again.Zeal — For the glory of God, and the soul of that sinner.Yea, revenge — Ye took a kind of holy revenge upon yourselves, being scarce able to forgive yourselves.In all things ye — As a church.Have approved yourselves to be pure — That is, free from blame, since ye received my letter.
