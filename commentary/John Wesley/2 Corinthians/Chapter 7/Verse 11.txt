<p><em>How great diligence it wrought in you</em> — Shown in all the following particulars.</p>
<p><em>Yea, clearing of yourselves</em> — Some had been more, some less, faulty; whence arose these various affections. Hence their apologizing and indignation, with respect to themselves; their fear and desire, with respect to the apostle; their zeal and revenge, with respect to the offender, yea, and themselves also.</p>
<p><em>Clearing of yourselves</em> — From either sharing in, or approving of, his sin.</p>
<p><em>Indignation</em> — That ye had not immediately corrected the offender.</p>
<p><em>Fear</em> — Of God's displeasure, or lest I should come with a rod.</p>
<p><em>Vehement desire</em> — To see me again.</p>
<p><em>Zeal</em> — For the glory of God, and the soul of that sinner.</p>
<p><em>Yea, revenge</em> — Ye took a kind of holy revenge upon yourselves, being scarce able to forgive yourselves.</p>
<p><em>In all things ye</em> — As a church.</p>
<p><em>Have approved yourselves to be pure</em> — That is, free from blame, since ye received my letter.</p>
