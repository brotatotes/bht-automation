<p><em>A man</em> — Every believer.</p>
<p><em>Is accepted</em> — With God.</p>
<p><em>According to what he hath</em> — And the same rule holds universally. Whoever acknowledges himself to be a vile, guilty sinner, and, in consequence of this acknowledgment, flies for refuge to the wounds of a crucified Saviour, and relies on his merits alone for salvation, may in every circumstance of life apply this indulgent declaration to himself.</p>
