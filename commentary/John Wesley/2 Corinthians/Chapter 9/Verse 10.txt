And he who supplieth seed — Opportunity and ability to help others.And bread — All things needful for your own souls and bodies. Will continually supply you with that seed, yea, multiply it to you more and more.And increase the fruits of your righteousness — The happy effects of your love to God and man. Isaiah 55:10
