<p><em>And he who supplieth seed</em> — Opportunity and ability to help others.</p>
<p><em>And bread</em> — All things needful for your own souls and bodies. Will continually supply you with that seed, yea, multiply it to you more and more.</p>
<p><em>And increase the fruits of your righteousness</em> — The happy effects of your love to God and man. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:10">Isaiah 55:10</span></p>
