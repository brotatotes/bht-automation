How remarkable are these words! Each is loaded with matter and increases all the way it goes.All grace — Every kind of blessing.That ye may abound to every good work — God gives us everything, that we may do good therewith, and so receive more blessings. All things in this life, even rewards, are, to the faithful, seeds in order to a future harvest. Proverbs 22:9
