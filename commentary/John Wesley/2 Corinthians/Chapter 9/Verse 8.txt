<p>How remarkable are these words! Each is loaded with matter and increases all the way it goes.</p>
<p><em>All grace</em> — Every kind of blessing.</p>
<p><em>That ye may abound to every good work</em> — God gives us everything, that we may do good therewith, and so receive more blessings. All things in this life, even rewards, are, to the faithful, seeds in order to a future harvest. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="pr+22:9">Proverbs 22:9</span></p>
