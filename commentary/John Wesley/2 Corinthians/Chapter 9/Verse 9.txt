<p><em>He hath scattered abroad</em> — (A generous word.) With a full hand, without any anxious thought which way each grain falls.</p>
<p><em>His righteousness</em> — His beneficence, with the blessed effects of it.</p>
<p><em>Remaineth for ever</em> — Unexhausted, God still renewing his store. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ps+112:9">Psalm 112:9</span></p>
