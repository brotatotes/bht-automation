<p><em>The elder</em> — An appellation suited to a familiar letter, but upon a weighty subject.</p>
<p><em>To the elect</em> — That is, Christian. Kuria is undoubtedly a proper name, both here and in2John1:5; for it was not then usual to apply the title of lady to any but the Roman empress; neither would such a manner of speaking have been suitable to the simplicity and dignity of the apostle.</p>
<p><em>Whom</em> — Both her and her children.</p>
<p><em>I love in the truth</em> — With unfeigned and holy love.</p>
