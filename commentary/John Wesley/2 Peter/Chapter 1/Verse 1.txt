<p><em>To them that have obtained</em> — Not by their own works, but by the free grace of God.</p>
<p><em>Like precious faith with us</em> — The apostles. The faith of those who have not seen, being equally precious with that of those who saw our Lord in the flesh.</p>
<p><em>Through the righteousness</em> — Both active and passive.</p>
<p><em>Of our God and Saviour</em> — It is this alone by which the justice of God is satisfied, and for the sake of which he gives this precious faith.</p>
