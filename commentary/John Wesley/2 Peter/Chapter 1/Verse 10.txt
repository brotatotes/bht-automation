<p><em>Wherefore</em> — Considering the miserable state of these apostates.</p>
<p><em>Brethren</em> — St. Peter nowhere uses this appellation in either of his epistles, but in this important exhortation.</p>
<p><em>Be the more diligent</em> — By courage, knowledge, temperance, etc.</p>
<p><em>To make your calling and election firm</em> — God hath called you by his word and his Spirit; he hath elected you, separated you from the world, through sanctification of the Spirit. O cast not away these inestimable benefits! If ye are thus diligent to make your election firm, ye shall never finally fall.</p>
