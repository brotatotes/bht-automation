<p><em>While we made known to you the power and coming</em> — That is, the powerful coming of Christ in glory. But if what they advanced of Christ was not true, if it was of their own invention, then to impose such a lie on the world as it was, in the very nature of things, above all human power to defend, and to do this at the expense of life and all things only to enrage the whole world, Jews and gentiles, against them, was no cunning, but was the greatest folly that men could have been guilty of.</p>
<p><em>But were eyewitnesses of his majesty</em> — At his transfiguration, which was a specimen of his glory at the last day.</p>
