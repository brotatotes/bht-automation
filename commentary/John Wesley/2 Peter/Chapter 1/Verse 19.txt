<p><em>And we</em> — St. Peter here speaks in the name of all Christians.</p>
<p><em>Have the word of prophecy</em> — The words of Moses, Isaiah, and all the prophets, are one and the same word, every way consistent with itself. St. Peter does not cite any particular passage, but speaks of their entire testimony.</p>
<p><em>More confirmed</em> — By that display of his glorious majesty. To which word ye do well that ye take heed, as to a lamp which shone in a dark place - Wherein there was neither light nor window. Such anciently was the whole world, except that little spot where this lamp shone.</p>
<p><em>Till the day should dawn</em> — Till the full light of the gospel should break through the darkness. As is the difference between the light of a lamp and that of the day, such is that between the light of the Old Testament and of the New.</p>
<p><em>And the morning star</em> — Jesus Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+22:16">Revelation 22:16</span>.</p>
<p><em>Arise in your hearts</em> — Be revealed in you.</p>
