<p><em>For these being really in you</em> — Added to your faith.</p>
<p><em>And abounding</em> — Increasing more and more, otherwise we fall short.</p>
<p><em>Make you neither slothful nor unfruitful</em> — Do not suffer you to be faint in your mind, or without fruit in your lives. If there is less faithfulness, less care and watchfulness, since we were pardoned, than there was before, and less diligence, less outward obedience, than when we were seeking remission of sin, we are both slothful and unfruitful in the knowledge of Christ, that is, in the faith, which then cannot work by love.</p>
