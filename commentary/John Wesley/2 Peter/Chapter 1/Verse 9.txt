<p><em>But he that wanteth these</em> — That does not add them to his faith.</p>
<p><em>Is blind</em> — The eyes of his understanding are again closed. He cannot see God, or his pardoning love. He has lost the evidence of things not seen.</p>
<p><em>Not able to see afar off</em> — Literally, purblind. He has lost sight of the precious promises: perfect love and heaven are equally out of his sight. Nay, he cannot now see what himself once enjoyed. Having, as it were, forgot the purification from his former sins - Scarce knowing what he himself then felt, when his sins were forgiven.</p>
