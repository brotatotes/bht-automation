But there were false prophets also — As well as true.Among the people — Of Israel. Those that spake even the truth, when God had not sent them; and also those that were truly sent of him, and yet corrupted or softened their message, were false prophets.As there shall be false — As well as true.Teachers among you, who will privately briny in — Into the church.Destructive heresies — They first, by denying the Lord, introduced destructive heresies, that is, divisions; or they occasioned first these divisions, and then were given up to a reprobate mind, even to deny the Lord that bought them. Either the heresies are the effect of denying the Lord, or the denying the Lord was the consequence of the heresies.Even denying — Both by their doctrine and their works.The Lord that bought them — With his own blood. Yet these very men perish everlastingly. Therefore Christ bought even them that perish.
