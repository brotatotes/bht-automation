For if after they — Who are thus ensnared.Have escaped the pollutions of the world — The sins which pollute all who know not God.Through the knowledge of Christ — That is, through faith in him, 2 Peter 1:3.They are again entangled therein, and overcome, their last state is worse than the first — More inexcusable, and causing a greater damnation.
