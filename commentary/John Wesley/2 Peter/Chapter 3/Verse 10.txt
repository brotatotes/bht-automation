<p><em>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief</em> — Suddenly, unexpectedly.</p>
<p><em>In which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise</em> — Surprisingly expressed by the very sound of the original word.</p>
<p><em>The elements shall melt with fervent heat</em> — The elements seem to mean, the sun, moon, and stars; not the four, commonly so called; for air and water cannot melt, and the earth is mentioned immediately after. The earth and all the works - Whether of nature or art.</p>
<p><em>That are therein shall be burned up</em> — And has not God already abundantly provided for this? 1. By the stores of subterranean fire which are so frequently bursting out at Aetna, Vesuvius, Hecla, and many other burning mountains2. By the ethereal (vulgarly called electrical) fire, diffused through the whole globe; which, if the secret chain that now binds it up were loosed, would immediately dissolve the whole frame of nature3. By comets, one of which, if it touch the earth in its course toward the sun, must needs strike it into that abyss of fire; if in its return from the sun, when it is heated, as a great man computes, two thousand times hotter than a red-hot cannonball, it must destroy all vegetables and animals long before their contact, and soon after burn it up.</p>
