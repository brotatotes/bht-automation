<p><em>Seeing then that all these things are dissolved</em> — To the eye of faith it appears as done already.</p>
<p><em>All these things</em> — Mentioned before; all that are included in that scriptural expression, "the heavens and the earth;" that is, the universe. On the fourth day God made the stars, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:16">Genesis 1:16</span>, which will be dissolved together with the earth. They are deceived, therefore, who restrain either the history of the creation, or this description of the destruction, of the world to the earth and lower heavens; imagining the stars to be more ancient than the earth, and to survive it. Both the dissolution and renovation are ascribed, not to the one heaven which surrounds the earth, but to the heavens in general, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:10,13">2 Peter 3:10,13</span>, without any restriction or limitation.</p>
<p><em>What persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation</em> — With men.</p>
<p><em>And godliness</em> — Toward your Creator.</p>
