<p><em>As also in all his epistles</em> — St. Peter wrote this a little before his own and St. Paul's martyrdom. St. Paul therefore had now written all his epistles; and even from this expression we may learn that St. Peter had read them all, perhaps sent to him by St. Paul himself. Nor was he at all disgusted by what St. Paul had written concerning him in the Epistle to the Galatians.</p>
<p><em>Speaking of these things</em> — Namely, of the coming of our Lord, delayed through his longsuffering, and of the circumstances preceding and accompanying it. Which things the unlearned - They who are not taught of God.</p>
<p><em>And the unstable</em> — Wavering, double-minded, unsettled men.</p>
<p><em>Wrest</em> — As though Christ would not come.</p>
<p><em>As they do also the other scriptures</em> — Therefore St Paul's writings were now part of the scriptures.</p>
<p><em>To their own destruction</em> — But that some use the scriptures ill, is no reason why others should not use them at all.</p>
