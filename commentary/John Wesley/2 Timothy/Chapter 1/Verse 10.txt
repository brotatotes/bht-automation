<p><em>By the appearing of our Saviour</em> — This implies his whole abode upon earth.</p>
<p><em>Who hath abolished death</em> — Taken away its sting, and turned it into a blessing.</p>
<p><em>And hath brought life and immortality to light</em> — Hath clearly revealed by the gospel that immortal life which he hath purchased for us.</p>
