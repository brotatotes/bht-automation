And let nothing discourage thee, for God hath not given us - That is, the spirit which God hath given us Christians, is not the spirit of fear - Or cowardice.But of power — Banishing fear.And love and sobriety — These animate us in our duties to God, our brethren, and ourselves. Power and sobriety are two good extremes. Love is between, the tie and temperament of both; preventing the two bad extremes of fearfulness and rashness. More is said concerning power, 1 Timothy 1:8; concerning love, 2 Timothy 2:14, etc.; concerning sobriety, 2 Timothy 3:1, etc.
