<p><em>Therefore be not thou ashamed</em> — When fear is banished, evil shame also flees away.</p>
<p><em>Of the testimony of our Lord</em> — The gospel, and of testifying the truth of it to all men.</p>
<p><em>Nor of me</em> — The cause of the servants of God doing his work, cannot be separated from the cause of God himself.</p>
<p><em>But be thou partaker of the afflictions</em> — Which I endure for the gospel's sake.</p>
<p><em>According to the power of God</em> — This which overcomes all things is nervously described in the two next verses.</p>
