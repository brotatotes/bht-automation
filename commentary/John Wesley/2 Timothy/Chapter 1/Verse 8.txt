Therefore be not thou ashamed — When fear is banished, evil shame also flees away.Of the testimony of our Lord — The gospel, and of testifying the truth of it to all men.Nor of me — The cause of the servants of God doing his work, cannot be separated from the cause of God himself.But be thou partaker of the afflictions — Which I endure for the gospel's sake.According to the power of God — This which overcomes all things is nervously described in the two next verses.
