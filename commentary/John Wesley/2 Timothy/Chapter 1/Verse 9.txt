<p><em>Who hath saved us</em> — By faith. The love of the Father, the grace of our Saviour, and the whole economy of salvation, are here admirably described.</p>
<p><em>Having called us with an holy calling</em> — Which is all from God, and claims us all for God.</p>
<p><em>According to his own purpose and grace</em> — That is, his own gracious purpose.</p>
<p><em>Which was given us</em> — Fixed for our advantage, before the world began.</p>
