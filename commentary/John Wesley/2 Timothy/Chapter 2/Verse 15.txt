<p><em>A workman that needeth not to be ashamed</em> — Either of unfaithfulness or unskilfulness.</p>
<p><em>Rightly dividing the word of truth</em> — Duly explaining and applying the whole scripture, so as to give each hearer his due portion. But they that give one part of the gospel to all (the promises and comforts to unawakened, hardened, scoffing men) have real need to be ashamed.</p>
