<p><em>But the foundation of God</em> — His truth and faithfulness.</p>
<p><em>Standeth fast</em> — Can never be overthrown; being as it were sealed with a seal, which has an inscription on each side: on the one, The Lord knoweth those that are his; on the other, Let every one who nameth the name of the Lord, as his Lord, depart from iniquity. Indeed, they only are his who depart from iniquity. To all others he will say, "I know you not." <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:22,23">Matthew 7:22,23</span></p>
