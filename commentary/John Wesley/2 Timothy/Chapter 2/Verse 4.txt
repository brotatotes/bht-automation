No man that warreth entangleth himself — Any more than is unavoidable.In the affairs of this life — With worldly business or cares.That — Minding war only, he may please his captain.

According to the former, no soldier was to engage in any civil employment; according to the latter, none could be crowned as conqueror, who did not keep strictly to the rules of the game.
