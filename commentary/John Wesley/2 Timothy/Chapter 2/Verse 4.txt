<p><em>No man that warreth entangleth himself</em> — Any more than is unavoidable.</p>
<p><em>In the affairs of this life</em> — With worldly business or cares.</p>
<p><em>That</em> — Minding war only, he may please his captain. In this and the next verse there is a plain allusion to the Roman law of arms, and to that of the Grecian games. According to the former, no soldier was to engage in any civil employment; according to the latter, none could be crowned as conqueror, who did not keep strictly to the rules of the game.</p>
