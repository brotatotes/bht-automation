<p><em>All that are resolved to live godly</em> — Therefore count the cost. Art thou resolved? In Christ - Out of Christ there is no godliness.</p>
<p><em>Shall suffer persecution</em> — More or less. There is no exception. Either the truth of scripture fails, or those that think they are religious, and are not persecuted, in some shape or other, on that very account, deceive themselves.</p>
