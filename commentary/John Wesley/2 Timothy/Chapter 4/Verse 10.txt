<p><em>Demas</em> â€” Once my fellowlabourer, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:24">Philemon 1:24</span>. Hath forsaken me. Crescens, probably a preacher also, is gone, with my consent, to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia, having now left Crete. These either went with him to Rome, or visited him there.</p>
