<p><em>For they will heap up teachers</em> — Therefore thou hast need of "all longsuffering." According to their own desires - Smooth as they can wish.</p>
<p><em>Having itching ears</em> — Fond of novelty and variety, which the number of new teachers, as well as their empty, soft, or philosophical discourses, pleased. Such teachers, and such hearers, seldom are much concerned with what is strict or to the purpose.</p>
<p><em>Heap to themselves</em> — Not enduring sound doctrine, they will reject the sound preachers, and gather together all that suit their own taste. Probably they send out one another as teachers, and so are never at a loss for numbers.</p>
