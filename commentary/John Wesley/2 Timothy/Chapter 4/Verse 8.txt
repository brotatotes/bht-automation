<p>The crown of that righteousness - Which God has imputed to me and wrought in me.</p>
<p><em>Will render to all</em> — This increases the joy of Paul, and encourages Timotheus. Many of these St. Paul himself had gained.</p>
<p><em>That have loved his appearing</em> — Which only a real Christian can do. I say a real Christian, to comply with the mode of the times: else they would not understand, although the word Christian necessarily implies whatsoever is holy, as God is holy. Strictly speaking, to join real or sincere to a word of so complete an import, is grievously to debase its noble signification, and is like adding long to eternity or wide to immensity.</p>
