<p><em>I wrote to the church</em> — Probably that to which they came.</p>
<p><em>But Diotrephes</em> — Perhaps the pastor of it.</p>
<p><em>Who loveth to have the preeminence among them</em> — To govern all things according to his own will.</p>
<p><em>Receiveth us not</em> — Neither them nor me. So did the mystery of iniquity already work!</p>
