<p><em>I perceive of a truth</em> — More clearly than ever, from such a concurrence of circumstances.</p>
<p><em>That God is not a respecter of persons</em> — Is not partial in his love. The words mean, in a particular sense, that he does not confine his love to one nation; in a general, that he is loving to every man, and willeth all men should be saved.</p>
