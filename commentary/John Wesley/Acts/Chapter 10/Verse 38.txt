<p><em>How God anointed Jesus</em> â€” Particularly at his baptism, thereby inaugurating him to his office: with the Holy Ghost and with power - It is worthy our remark, that frequently when the Holy Ghost is mentioned there is added a word particularly adapted to the present circumstance. So the deacons were to be full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:3">Acts 6:3</span>. Barnabas was full of the Holy Ghost and faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:24">Acts 11:24</span>. The disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:52">Acts 13:52</span>. And here, where his mighty works are mentioned, Christ himself is said to be anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power. For God was with him-He speaks sparingly here of the majesty of Christ, as considering the state of his hearers.</p>
