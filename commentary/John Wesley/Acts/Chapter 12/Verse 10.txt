<p><em>The first and second ward</em> — At each of which doubtless was a guard of soldiers.</p>
<p><em>The gate opened of its own accord</em> — Without either Peter or the angel touching it.</p>
<p><em>And they went on through one street</em> — That Peter might know which way to go.</p>
<p><em>And the angel departed from him</em> — Being himself sufficient for what remained to be done.</p>
