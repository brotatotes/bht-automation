O full of all guile — As a false prophet, and all mischief - As a magician.Thou son of the devil — A title well suited to a magician; and one who not only was himself unrighteous, but laboured to keep others from all goodness.Wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? — Even now thou hast heard the truth of the Gospel.
