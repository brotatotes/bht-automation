<p><em>O full of all guile</em> — As a false prophet, and all mischief - As a magician.</p>
<p><em>Thou son of the devil</em> — A title well suited to a magician; and one who not only was himself unrighteous, but laboured to keep others from all goodness.</p>
<p><em>Wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</em> — Even now thou hast heard the truth of the Gospel.</p>
