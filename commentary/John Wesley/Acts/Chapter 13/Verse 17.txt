<p><em>The God</em> — By such a commemoration of God's favours to their fathers, at once their minds were conciliated to the speaker, they were convinced of their duty to God, and invited to believe his promise, and the accomplishment of it. The six verses, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:17-22">Acts 13:17-22</span>, contain the whole sum of the Old Testament.</p>
<p><em>Of this people</em> — Paul here chiefly addresses himself to those whom he styles, Ye that fear God: he speaks of Israel first; and <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:26">Acts 13:26</span>, speaks more directly to the Israelites themselves.</p>
<p><em>Chose</em> — And this exalted the people; not any merit or goodness of their own, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="eze+20:5">Ezekiel 20:5</span>.</p>
<p><em>Our fathers</em> — Abraham and his posterity. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:2">Isaiah 1:2</span>.</p>
