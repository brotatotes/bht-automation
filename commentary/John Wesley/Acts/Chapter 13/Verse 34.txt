<p><em>No more to return to corruption</em> — That is, to die no more.</p>
<p><em>I will give you the sure mercies of David</em> — The blessings promised to David in Christ. These are sure, certain, firm, solid, to every true believer in him. And hence the resurrection of Christ necessarily follows; for without this, those blessings could not be given. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:3">Isaiah 55:3</span>.</p>
