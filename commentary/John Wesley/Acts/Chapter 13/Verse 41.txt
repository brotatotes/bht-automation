<p><em>I work a work which ye will in nowise believe</em> â€” This was originally spoken to those, who would not believe that God would ever deliver them from the power of the Chaldeans. But it is applicable to any who will not believe the promises, or the works of God. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="hab+1:5">Habakkuk 1:5</span>.</p>
