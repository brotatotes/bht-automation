But Paul departed â€” Held on his intended course: being recommended by the brethren to the grace of God - We do not find that Barnabas stayed for this. O how mighty is the grace of God! which in the midst of the world, in the midst of sin, among so many snares of Satan, and in spite of the incredible weakness and depravity of nature, yet overcomes all opposition, sanctifies, sustains, and preserves us to the end! It appears not only that Paul and Barnabas were afterward thoroughly reconciled, 1 Corinthians 9:6; Galatians 2:9; but also that John was again admitted by St. Paul as a companion in his labours, Colossians 4:10; Philemon 1:24; 2 Timothy 4:11.
