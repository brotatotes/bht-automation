<p><em>We sought to go into Macedonia</em> â€” This is the first place in which St. Luke intimates his attendance on the apostle. And here he does it only in an oblique manner. Nor does he throughout the history once mention his own name, or any one thing which he did or said for the service of Christianity; though Paul speaks of him in the most honourable terms, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="col+4:14">Colossians 4:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:11">2 Timothy 4:11</span>; and probably as the brother whose praise in the Gospel went through all the Churches, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:18">2 Corinthians 8:18</span>. The same remark may be made on the rest of the sacred historians, who every one of them show the like amiable modesty.</p>
