<p><em>He hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world</em> — How fitly does he speak this, in their supreme court of justice? By the man - So he speaks, suiting himself to the capacity of his hearers.</p>
<p><em>Whereof he hath given assurance to all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead</em> — God raising Jesus demonstrated hereby, that he was to be the glorious Judge of all. We are by no means to imagine that this was all which the apostle intended to have said, but the indolence of some of his hearers and the petulancy of others cut him short.</p>
