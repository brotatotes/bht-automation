<p><em>And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia</em> — Silas seems to have stayed a considerable time at Berea: but Timotheus had come to the apostle while he was at Athens, and been sent by him to comfort and confirm the Church at Thessalonica, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:1-5">1 Thessalonians 3:1-5</span>. But now at length both Silas and Timotheus came to the apostle at Corinth.</p>
<p><em>Paul was pressed in spirit</em> — The more probably from what Silas and Timotheus related. Every Christian ought diligently to observe any such pressure in his own spirit, and if it agree with Scripture, to follow it: if he does not he will feel great heaviness.</p>
