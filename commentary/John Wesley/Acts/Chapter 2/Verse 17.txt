<p>The times of the Messiah are frequently called the last days, the Gospel being the last dispensation of Divine grace.</p>
<p><em>I will pour out of my Spirit</em> — Not on the day of pentecost only, upon all flesh - On persons of every age, sex, and rank.</p>
<p><em>And your young men shall see visions</em> — In young men the outward sense, are most vigorous, and the bodily strength is entire, whereby they are best qualified to sustain the shock which usually attends the visions of God. In old men the internal senses are most vigorous, suited to divine dreams. Not that the old are wholly excluded from the former, nor the young from the latter.</p>
