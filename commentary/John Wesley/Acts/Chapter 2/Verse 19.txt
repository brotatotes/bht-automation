<p><em>And I will show prodigies in heaven above, and signs on earth beneath</em> — Great revelations of grace are usually attended with great judgments on those who reject it.</p>
<p><em>In heaven</em> — Treated of, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:20">Acts 2:20</span>.</p>
<p><em>On earth</em> — Described in this verse. Such signs were those mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22">Acts 2:22</span>, before the passion of Christ; which are so mentioned as to include also those at the very time of the passion and resurrection, at the destruction of Jerusalem, and at the end of the world. Terrible indeed were those prodigies in particular which preceded the destruction of Jerusalem: such as the flaming sword hanging over the city, and the fiery comet pointing down upon it for a year; the light that shone upon the temple and the altar in the night, as if it had been noon-day; the opening of the great and heavy gate of the temple without hands; the voice heard from the most holy place, Let us depart hence; the admonition of Jesus the son of Ananus, crying for seven years together, Wo, wo, wo; the vision of contending armies in the air, and of entrenchments thrown up against a city there represented; the terrible thunders and lightnings, and dreadful earthquakes, which every one considered as portending some great evil: all which, through the singular providence of God, are particularly recorded by Josephus.</p>
<p><em>Blood</em> — War and slaughter.</p>
<p><em>Fire</em> — Burnings of houses and towns, involving all in clouds of smoke.</p>
