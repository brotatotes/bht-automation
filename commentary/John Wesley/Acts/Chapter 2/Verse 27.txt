<p><em>Thou wilt not leave my soul in hades</em> â€” The invisible world. But it does not appear, that ever our Lord went into hell. His soul, when it was separated from the body, did not go thither, but to paradise, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:43">Luke 23:43</span>. The meaning is, Thou wilt not leave my soul in its separate state, nor suffer my body to be corrupted.</p>
