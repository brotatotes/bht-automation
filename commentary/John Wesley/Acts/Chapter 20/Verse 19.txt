<p><em>Serving</em> â€” See the picture of a faithful servant! The Lord - Whose the church is, with all humility, and with tears, and trials - These are the concomicants of it. The service itself is described more particularly in the following verse. This humility he recommends to the Ephesians themselves, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:2">Ephesians 4:2</span>. His tears are mentioned again, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:31">Acts 20:31</span>, as also2Corinthians2:4; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="php+3:18">Philippians 3:18</span>. These passages laid together supply us with the genuine character of St. Paul. Holy tears, from those who seldom weep on account of natural occurrences, are no mean specimen of the efficacy and proof of the truth of Christianity. Yet joy is well consistent therewith, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:24">Acts 20:24</span>. The same person may be sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.</p>
