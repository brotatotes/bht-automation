<p><em>I have showed you</em> — Bishops, by my example, all things - And this among the rest; that thus labouring - So far as the labours of your office allow you time; ye ought to help the weak - Those who are disabled by sickness, or any bodily infirmity, from maintaining themselves by their own labour.</p>
<p><em>And to remember</em> — Effectually, so as to follow it; the word which he himself said - Without doubt his disciples remembered many of his words which are not recorded.</p>
<p><em>It is happier to give</em> — To imitate God, and have him, as it were, indebted to us.</p>
