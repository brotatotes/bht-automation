<p><em>We came to Cesarea</em> — So called from a stately temple which Herod the Great dedicated there to Augustus Cesar. It was the place where the Roman governor of Judea generally resided and kept his court.</p>
<p><em>The evangelist, who was one of the seven deacons</em> — An evangelist is a preacher of the Gospel to those who had never heard it, as Philip had done to the Samaritans, to the Ethiopian eunuch, and to all the towns from Azotus to Cesarea, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:5,26,40">Acts 8:5,26,40</span>. It is not unlikely he spent the following years preaching in Tyre and Sidon, and the other heathen cities in the neighbourhood of Galilee, his house being at Cesarea, a convenient situation for that purpose.</p>
<p><em>We abode with him</em> — We lodged at his house during our stay at Cesarea.</p>
