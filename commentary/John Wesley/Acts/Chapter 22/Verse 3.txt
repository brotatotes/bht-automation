<p><em>I am verily</em> — This defence answers all that is objected, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:28">Acts 21:28</span>. As there, so here also mention is made of the person of Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:3">Acts 22:3</span>, of the people and the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:3,5,12">Acts 22:3,5,12</span>; of the temple, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17">Acts 22:17</span>; of teaching all men, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:15-17,21">Acts 22:15-17,21</span>; and of the truth of his doctrine, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:6">Acts 22:6</span>. But he speaks closely and nervously, in few words, because the time was short.</p>
<p><em>But brought up at the feet of Gamaliel</em> — The scholars usually sat on low seats, or upon mats on the floor, at the feet of their masters, whose seats were raised to a considerable height.</p>
<p><em>Accurately instructed</em> — The learned education which Paul had received was once no doubt the matter of his boasting and confidence. Unsanctified learning made his bonds strong, and furnished him with numerous arguments against the Gospel. Yet when the grace of God had changed his heart, and turned his accomplishments into another channel, he was the fitter instrument to serve God's wise and merciful purposes, in the defence and propagation of Christianity.</p>
