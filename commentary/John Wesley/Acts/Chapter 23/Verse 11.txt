<p><em>And the night following, the Lord Jesus</em> — What Paul had before purposed in spirit, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:21">Acts 19:21</span>, God now in due time confirms. Another declaration to the same effect is made by an angel of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:23">Acts 27:23</span>. And from the23d chapter the sum of this book turns on the testimony of Paul to the Romans. How would the defenders of St. Peter's supremacy triumph, could they find out half as much ascribed to him! Be of good courage, Paul - As he laboured under singular distresses and persecutions, so he was favoured with extraordinary assurances of the Divine assistance.</p>
<p><em>Thou must testify</em> — Particular promises are usually given when all things appear desperate.</p>
<p><em>At Rome also</em> — Danger is nothing in the eyes of God: all hinderances farther his work. A promise of what is afar off, implies all that necessarily lies between. Paul shall testify at Rome: therefore he shall come to Rome; therefore he shall escape the Jews, the sea, the viper.</p>
