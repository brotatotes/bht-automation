<p><em>I was not aware, brethren, that it was the high priest</em> â€” He seems to mean, I did not advert to it, in the prophetic transport of my mind: but he does not add, that his not adverting to it proceeded from the power of the Spirit coming upon him; as knowing they were not able to bear it. This answer admirably shows the situation of mind he was then in, partly with regard to the bystanders, whom he thus softens, adding also the title of brethren, and justifying their reproof by the prohibition of Moses; partly with regard to himself, who, after that singular transport subsided, was again under the direction of the general command. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:28">Exodus 22:28</span>.</p>
