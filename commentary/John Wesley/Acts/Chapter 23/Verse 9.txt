<p><em>And the scribes of the Pharisees' side arising</em> — Every sect contains both learned and unlearned. The former used to be the mouth of the party.</p>
<p><em>If a spirit</em> — St. Paul in his speech from the stairs had affirmed, that Jesus, whom they knew to have been dead, was alive, and that he had spoken to him from heaven, and again in a vision. So they add nothing, only they construe it in their own way, putting an angel or spirit for Jesus.</p>
