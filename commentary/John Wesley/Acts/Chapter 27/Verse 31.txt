Unless these mariners abide in the ship â€” Without them ye know not how to manage her, ye cannot be saved - He does not say we. That they would not have regarded.

We may learn hence, to use the most proper means for security and success, even while we depend on Divine Providence, and wait for the accomplishment of God's own promise.

To expect the accomplishment of any promise, without exerting these, is at best vain and dangerous presumption, if all pretence of relying upon it be not profane hypocrisy.
