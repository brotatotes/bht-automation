<p><em>Be converted</em> — Be turned from sin and Satan unto God. See <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:20">Acts 26:20</span>. But this term, so common in modern writings, very rarely occurs in Scripture: perhaps not once in the sense we now use it, for an entire change from vice to holiness.</p>
<p><em>That the times of refreshing</em> — Wherein God largely bestows his refreshing grace, may come - To you also. To others they will assuredly come, whether ye repent or no.</p>
