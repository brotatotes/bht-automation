<p><em>For neither was there any one among them that wanted</em> — We may observe, this is added as the proof that great grace was upon them all. And it was the immediate, necessary consequence of it: yea, and must be to the end of the world. In all ages and nations, the same cause, the same degree of grace, could not but in like circumstances produce the same effect.</p>
<p><em>For whosoever were possessors of houses and lands sold them</em> — Not that there was any particular command for this; but there was great grace and great love: of which this was the natural fruit.</p>
