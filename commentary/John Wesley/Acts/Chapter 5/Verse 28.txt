<p><em>Did not we strictly command you, not to teach?</em> — See the poor cunning of the enemies of the Gospel. They make laws and interdicts at their pleasure, which those who obey God cannot but break; and then take occasion thereby to censure and punish the innocent, as guilty.</p>
<p><em>Ye would bring the blood of this man upon us</em> — An artful and invidious word. The apostles did not desire to accuse any man. They simply declared the naked truth.</p>
