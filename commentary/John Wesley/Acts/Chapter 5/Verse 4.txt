But it was in his own choice to be a Christian or not: and consequently either to sell his land, or keep it.</p>
<p><em>And when it was sold, was it not in thy power?</em> — For it does not appear that he professed himself a Christian when he sold it.</p>
<p><em>Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart?</em> — So profanely to dissemble on so solemn an occasion? Thou hast not lied to men only, but to God also. Hence the Godhead of the Holy Ghost evidently appears: since lying to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:3">Acts 5:3</span>, is lying to God.</p>
