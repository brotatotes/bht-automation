While it remained, did it not remain thine? — It is true, whosoever among the Christians (not one excepted) had houses or lands, sold them, and laid the price at the feet of the apostles. But it was in his own choice to be a Christian or not: and consequently either to sell his land, or keep it.And when it was sold, was it not in thy power? — For it does not appear that he professed himself a Christian when he sold it.Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart? — So profanely to dissemble on so solemn an occasion? Thou hast not lied to men only, but to God also. Hence the Godhead of the Holy Ghost evidently appears: since lying to him, Acts 5:3, is lying to God.
