<p><em>Ye stiff necked</em> — Not bowing the neck to God's yoke; and uncircumcised in heart - So they showed themselves, verse54; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:54">Acts 7:54</span> and ears - As they showed, verse57. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:57">Acts 7:57</span> So far were they from receiving the word of God into their hearts, that they would not hear it even with their ears.</p>
<p><em>Ye</em> — And your fathers, always - As often as ever ye are called, resist the Holy Ghost - Testifying by the prophets of Jesus, and the whole truth. This is the sum of what he had shown at large. </p>
