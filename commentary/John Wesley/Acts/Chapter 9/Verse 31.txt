<p><em>Then the Church</em> — The whole body of Christian believers, had peace - Their bitterest persecutor being converted.</p>
<p><em>And being built up</em> — In holy, loving faith, continually increasing, and walking in - That is, speaking and acting only from this principle, the fear of God and the comfort of the Holy Ghost - An excellent mixture of inward and outward peace, tempered with filial fear.</p>
