<p><em>In whom we have redemption</em> â€” This is treated of from the middle of <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>. The voluntary passion of our Lord appeased the Father's wrath, obtained pardon and acceptance for us, and, consequently, dissolved the dominion and power which Satan had over us through our sins. So that forgiveness is the beginning of redemption, as the resurrection is the completion of it.</p>
