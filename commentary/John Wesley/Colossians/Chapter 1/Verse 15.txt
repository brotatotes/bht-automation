Who is — By describing the glory of Christ, and his pre-eminence over the highest angels, the apostle here lays a foundation for the reproof of all worshippers of angels.The image of the invisible God — Whom none can represent, but his only begotten Son; in his divine nature the invisible image, in his human the visible image, of the Father.The first begotten of every creature — That is, begotten before every creature; subsisting before all worlds, before all time, from all eternity.
