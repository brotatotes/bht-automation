<p><em>And you that were alienated, and enemies</em> — Actual alienation of affection makes habitual enmity.</p>
<p><em>In your mind</em> — Both your understanding and your affections.</p>
<p><em>By wicked works</em> — Which continually feed and increase inward alienation from, and enmity to, God.</p>
<p><em>He hath now reconciled</em> — From the moment ye believed.</p>
