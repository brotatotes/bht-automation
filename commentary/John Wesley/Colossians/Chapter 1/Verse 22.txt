<p><em>By the body of his flesh</em> — So distinguished from his body, the church. The body here denotes his entire manhood.</p>
<p><em>Through death</em> — Whereby he purchased the reconciliation which we receive by faith.</p>
<p><em>To present you</em> — The very end of that reconciliation.</p>
<p><em>Holy</em> — Toward God.</p>
<p><em>Spotless</em> — In yourselves.</p>
<p><em>Unreprovable</em> — As to your neighbour.</p>
