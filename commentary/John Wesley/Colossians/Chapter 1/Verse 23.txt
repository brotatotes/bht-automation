<p><em>If ye continue in the faith</em> — Otherwise, ye will lose all the blessings which ye have already begun to enjoy.</p>
<p><em>And be not removed from the hope of the gospel</em> — The glorious hope of perfect love.</p>
<p><em>Which is preached</em> — Is already begun to be preached to every creature under heaven.</p>
