<p><em>We pray for you</em> — This was mentioned in general, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="col+1:3">Colossians 1:3</span>, but now more particularly.</p>
<p><em>That ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will</em> — Of his revealed will.</p>
<p><em>In all wisdom</em> — With all the wisdom from above.</p>
<p><em>And spiritual understanding</em> — To discern by that light whatever agrees with, or differs from, his will.</p>
