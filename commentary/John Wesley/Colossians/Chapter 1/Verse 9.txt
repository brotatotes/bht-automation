We pray for you — This was mentioned in general, Colossians 1:3, but now more particularly.That ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will — Of his revealed will.In all wisdom — With all the wisdom from above.And spiritual understanding — To discern by that light whatever agrees with, or differs from, his will.
