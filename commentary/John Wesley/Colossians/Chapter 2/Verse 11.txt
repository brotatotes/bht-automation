By whom also ye have been circumcised — Ye have received the spiritual blessings typified of old by circumcision.With a circumcision not performed with hands — By an inward, spiritual operation. In putting off, not a little skin, but the whole body of the sins of the flesh - All the sins of your evil nature.By the circumcision of Christ — By that spiritual circumcision which Christ works in your heart.
