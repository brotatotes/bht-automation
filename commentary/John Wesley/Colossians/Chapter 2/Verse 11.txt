<p><em>By whom also ye have been circumcised</em> — Ye have received the spiritual blessings typified of old by circumcision.</p>
<p><em>With a circumcision not performed with hands</em> — By an inward, spiritual operation. In putting off, not a little skin, but the whole body of the sins of the flesh - All the sins of your evil nature.</p>
<p><em>By the circumcision of Christ</em> — By that spiritual circumcision which Christ works in your heart.</p>
