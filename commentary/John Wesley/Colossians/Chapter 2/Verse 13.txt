<p><em>And you who were dead</em> — Doubly dead to God, not only wallowing in trespasses, outward sins, but also in the uncircumcision of your flesh - A beautiful expression for original sin, the inbred corruption of your nature, your uncircumcised heart and affections.</p>
<p><em>Hath he</em> — God the Father.</p>
<p><em>Quickened together with him</em> — Making you partakers of the power of his resurrection. It is evident the apostle thus far speaks, not of justification, but of sanctification only.</p>
