<p><em>Through philosophy and empty deceit</em> — That is, through the empty deceit of philosophy blended with Christianity. This the apostle condemns, 1. Because it was empty and deceitful, promising happiness, but giving none2. Because it was grounded, not on solid reason, but the traditions of men, Zeno, Epicurus, and the rest. And, 3. Because it was so shallow and superficial, not advancing beyond the knowledge of sensible things; no, not beyond the first rudiments of them9, For in him dwelleth - Inhabiteth, continually abideth, all the fulness of the Godhead. Believers are "filled with all the fulness of God," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:19">Ephesians 3:19</span>. But in Christ dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead; the most full Godhead; not only divine powers, but divine nature, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="col+1:19">Colossians 1:19</span>.</p>
<p><em>Bodily</em> — Personally, really, substantially. The very substance of God, if one might so speak, dwells in Christ in the most full sense.</p>
