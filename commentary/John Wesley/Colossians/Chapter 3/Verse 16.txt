<p><em>Let the word of Christ</em> — So the apostle calls the whole scripture, and thereby asserts the divinity of his Master.</p>
<p><em>Dwell</em> — Not make a short stay, or an occasional visit, but take up its stated residence.</p>
<p><em>Richly</em> — In the largest measure, and with the greatest efficacy; so as to fill and govern the whole soul.</p>
