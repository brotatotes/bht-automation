And say to Archippus — One of the pastors of that church.Take heed — It is the duty of the flock to try them that say they are apostles to reject the false, and to warn, as well as to receive, the real.The ministry — Not a lordship, but a service; a laborious and painful work; an obligation to do and suffer all things; to be the least, and the servant, of all.In the Lord — Christ by whom, and for whose sake, we receive the various gifts of the Holy Spirit.
