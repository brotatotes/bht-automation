<p><em>And say to Archippus</em> — One of the pastors of that church.</p>
<p><em>Take heed</em> — It is the duty of the flock to try them that say they are apostles to reject the false, and to warn, as well as to receive, the real.</p>
<p><em>The ministry</em> — Not a lordship, but a service; a laborious and painful work; an obligation to do and suffer all things; to be the least, and the servant, of all.</p>
<p><em>In the Lord</em> — Christ by whom, and for whose sake, we receive the various gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>
