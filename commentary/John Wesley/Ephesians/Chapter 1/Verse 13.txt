<p><em>Likewise believed, after ye had heard the gospel</em> — Which God made the means of your salvation; in whom after ye had believed - Probably some time after their first believing.</p>

A full impression of the image of God on their souls2. A full assurance of receiving all the promises, whether relating to time or eternity.</p>
