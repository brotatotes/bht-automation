Who, thus sealing us, is an earnest - Both a pledge and a foretaste of our inheritance.Till the redemption of the purchased possession — Till the church, which he has purchased with his own blood, shall be fully delivered from all sin and sorrow, and advanced to everlasting glory.To the praise of his glory — Of his glorious wisdom, power, and mercy.
