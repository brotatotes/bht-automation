<p>Who, thus sealing us, is an earnest - Both a pledge and a foretaste of our inheritance.</p>
<p><em>Till the redemption of the purchased possession</em> — Till the church, which he has purchased with his own blood, shall be fully delivered from all sin and sorrow, and advanced to everlasting glory.</p>
<p><em>To the praise of his glory</em> — Of his glorious wisdom, power, and mercy.</p>
