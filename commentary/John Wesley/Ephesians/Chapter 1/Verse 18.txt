<p><em>That ye may know what is the hope of his calling</em> — That ye may experimentally and delightfully know what are the blessings which God has called you to hope for by his word and his Spirit.</p>
<p><em>And what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints</em> — What an immense treasure of blessedness he hath provided as an inheritance for holy souls.</p>
