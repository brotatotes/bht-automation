<p><em>Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion</em> — That is, God hath invested him with uncontrollable authority over all demons in hell, all angels in heaven, and all the princes and potentates on earth.</p>
<p><em>And every name that is named</em> — We know the king is above all, though we cannot name all the officers of his court. So we know that Christ is above all, though we are not able to name all his subjects.</p>
<p><em>Not only in this world, but also in that which is to come</em> — The world to come is so styled, not because it does not yet exist, but because it is not yet visible. Principalities and powers are named now; but those also who are not even named in this world, but shall be revealed in the world to come, are all subject to Christ.</p>
