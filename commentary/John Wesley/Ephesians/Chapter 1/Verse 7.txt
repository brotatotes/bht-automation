<p><em>By whom we</em> — Who believe.</p>
<p><em>Have</em> — From the moment we believe.</p>
<p><em>Redemption</em> — From the guilt and power of sin.</p>
<p><em>Through his blood</em> — Through what he hath done and suffered for us.</p>
<p><em>According to the riches of his grace</em> — According to the abundant overflowings of his free mercy and favour.</p>
