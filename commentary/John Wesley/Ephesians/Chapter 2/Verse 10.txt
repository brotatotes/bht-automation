For we are his workmanship — Which proves both that salvation is by faith, and that faith is the gift of God.Created unto good works — That afterwards we might give ourselves to them.Which God had before preprepared — The occasions of them: so we must still ascribe the whole to God.That we might walk in them — Though not be justified by them.
