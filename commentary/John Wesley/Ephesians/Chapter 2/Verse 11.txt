<p><em>Wherefore remember</em> — Such a remembrance strengthens faith, and increases gratitude.</p>
<p><em>That ye being formerly gentiles in the flesh</em> — Neither circumcised in body nor in spirit. Who were accordingly called the uncircumcision - By way of reproach.</p>
<p><em>By that which is called the circumcision</em> — By those who call themselves the circumcised, and think this a proof that they are the people of God; and who indeed have that outward circumcision which is performed by hands in the flesh.</p>
