Were at that time without Christ — Having no faith in, or knowledge of, him.Being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel — Both as to their temporal privileges and spiritual blessings.And strangers to the covenants of promise — The great promise in both the Jewish and Christian covenant was the Messiah.Having no hope — Because they had no promise whereon to ground their hope. And being without God - Wholly ignorant of the true God, and so in effect atheists. Such in truth are, more or less, all men, in all ages, till they know God by the teaching of his own Spirit.In the world — The wide, vain world, wherein ye wandered up and down, unholy and unhappy.
