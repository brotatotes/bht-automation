<p><em>He who hath made both</em> — Jews and gentiles, one church. The apostle describes, 1. The conjunction of the gentiles with Israel, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:14,15">Ephesians 2:14,15</span>. And, 2. The conjunction of both with God, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15-18">Ephesians 2:15-18</span>. Each description is subdivided into two parts. And the former part of the one, concerning abolishing the enmity, answers the former part of the other; the latter part of the one, concerning the evangelical decrees, the latter part of the other.</p>
<p><em>And hath broken down the middle wall of partition</em> — Alluding to that wall of old, which separated the court of Israel from the court of the gentiles. Such a wall was the ceremonial law, which Christ had now taken away.</p>
