<p><em>And he came</em> — After his resurrection.</p>
<p><em>And preached peace</em> — By his ministers and his Spirit.</p>
<p><em>To you</em> — Gentiles.</p>
<p><em>That were afar off</em> — At the utmost distance from God.</p>
<p><em>And to them that were nigh</em> — To the Jews, who were comparatively nigh, being his visible church.</p>
