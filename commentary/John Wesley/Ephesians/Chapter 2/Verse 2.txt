According to the course of this world — The word translated course properly means a long series of times, wherein one corrupt age follows another.According to the prince of the power of the air — The effect of which power all may perceive, though all do not understand the cause of it: a power unspeakably penetrating and widely diffused; but yet, as to its baneful influences, beneath the orb of believers. The evil spirits are united under one head, the seat of whose dominion is in the air. Here he sometimes raises storms, sometimes makes visionary representations, and is continually roving to and fro.The spirit that now worketh — With mighty power; and so he did, and doth in all ages.In the sons of disobedience — In all who do not believe and obey the gospel.
