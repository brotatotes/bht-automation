<p><em>Among whom we</em> — Jews.</p>
<p><em>Also, formerly had our conversation: doing the will of the flesh</em> — In gross, brutal sins.</p>
<p><em>And of the mind</em> — By spiritual, diabolical wickedness. In the former clause, flesh denotes the whole evil nature; in the latter, the body opposed to the soul.</p>
<p><em>And were by nature</em> — That is, in our natural state.</p>
<p><em>Children of wrath</em> — Having the wrath of God abiding on us, even as the gentiles. This expression, by nature, occurs also, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:8">Galatians 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14">Romans 2:14</span>; and thrice in the eleventh chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:24">Romans 11:24</span> But in none of these places does it signify, by custom, or practice, or customary practice, as a late writer affirms. Nor can it mean so here For this would make the apostle guilty of gross tautology, their customary sinning having been expressed already, in the former part of the verse. But all these passages agree in expressing what belongs to the nature of the persons spoken of.</p>
