<p><em>And hath raised us up together</em> — Both Jews and gentiles already in spirit; and ere long our bodies too will be raised.</p>
<p><em>And made us all sit together in heavenly places</em> — This is spoken by way of anticipation. Believers are not yet possessed of their seats in heaven; but each of them has a place prepared for him.</p>
