<p><em>That being rooted and grounded</em> — That is, deeply fixed and firmly established, in love. Ye may comprehend - So far as an human mind is capable.</p>
<p><em>What is the breadth of the love of Christ</em> — Embracing all mankind.</p>
<p><em>And length</em> — From everlasting to everlasting.</p>
<p><em>And depth</em> — Not to be fathomed by any creature.</p>
<p><em>And height</em> — Not to be reached by any enemy.</p>
