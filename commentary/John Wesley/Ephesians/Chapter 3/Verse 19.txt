<p><em>And to know</em> — But the apostle corrects himself, and immediately observes, it cannot be fully known. This only we know, that the love of Christ surpasses all knowledge. That ye may be filled - Which is the sum of all.</p>
<p><em>With all the fulness of God</em> — With all his light, love, wisdom, holiness, power, and glory. A perfection far beyond a bare freedom from sin.</p>
