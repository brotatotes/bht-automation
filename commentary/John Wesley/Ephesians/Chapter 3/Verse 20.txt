<p><em>Now to him</em> — This doxology is admirably adapted to strengthen our faith, that we may not stagger at the great things the apostle has been praying for, as if they were too much for God to give, or for us to expect from him.</p>
<p><em>That is able</em> — Here is a most beautiful gradation. When he has given us exceeding, yea, abundant blessings, still we may ask for more. And he is able to do it. But we may think of more than we have asked. He is able to do this also. Yea, and above all this.</p>
<p><em>Above all we ask</em> — Above all we can think. Nay, exceedingly, abundantly above all that we can either ask or think.</p>
