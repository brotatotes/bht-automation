<p><em>Till we all</em> — And every one of us.</p>
<p><em>Come to the unity of the faith, and knowledge of the Son of God</em> — To both an exact agreement in the Christian doctrine, and an experimental knowledge of Christ as the Son of God.</p>
<p><em>To a perfect man</em> — To a state of spiritual manhood both in understanding and strength.</p>
<p><em>To the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ</em> — To that maturity of age and spiritual stature wherein we shall be filled with Christ, so that he will be all in all.</p>
