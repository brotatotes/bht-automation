<p><em>Fluctuating to and fro</em> — From within, even when there is no wind.</p>
<p><em>And carried about with every wind</em> — From without; when we are assaulted by others, who are unstable as the wind.</p>
<p><em>By the sleight of men</em> — By their "cogging the dice;" so the original word implies.</p>
