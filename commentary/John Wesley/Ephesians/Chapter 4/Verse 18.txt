<p><em>Having their understanding darkened, through the ignorance that is in them</em> — So that they are totally void of the light of God, neither have they any knowledge of his will.</p>
<p><em>Being alienated from the life of God</em> — Utter strangers to the divine, the spiritual life.</p>
<p><em>Through the hardness of their hearts</em> — Callous and senseless. And where there is no sense, there can be no life.</p>
