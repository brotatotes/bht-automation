<p><em>Be ye angry, and sin not</em> — That is, if ye are angry, take heed ye sin not. Anger at sin is not evil; but we should feel only pity to the sinner. If we are angry at the person, as well as the fault, we sin. And how hardly do we avoid it.</p>
<p><em>Let not the sun go down upon your wrath</em> — Reprove your brother, and be reconciled immediately. Lose not one day. A clear, express command. Reader, do you keep it?</p>
