<p><em>But that which is good</em> — Profitable to the speaker and hearers.</p>
<p><em>To the use of edifying</em> — To forward them in repentance, faith, or holiness.</p>
<p><em>That it may minister grace</em> — Be a means of conveying more grace into their hearts. Hence we learn, what discourse is corrupt, as it were stinking in the nostrils of God; namely, all that is not profitable, not edifying, not apt to minister grace to the hearers.</p>
