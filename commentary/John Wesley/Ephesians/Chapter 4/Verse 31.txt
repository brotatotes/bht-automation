Let all bitterness — The height of settled anger, opposite to kindness, verse32.And wrath — Lasting displeasure toward the ignorant, and them that are out of the way, opposite to tenderheartedness.And anger — The very first risings of disgust at those that injure you, opposite to forgiving one another.And clamour — Or bawling. "I am not angry," says one; "but it is my way to speak so." Then unlearn that way: it is the way to hell.And evil speaking — Be it in ever so mild and soft a tone, or with ever such professions of kindness. Here is a beautiful retrogradation, beginning with the highest, and descending to the lowest, degree of the want of love.
