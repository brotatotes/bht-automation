<p><em>Let all bitterness</em> — The height of settled anger, opposite to kindness, verse32.</p>

<p><em>And anger</em> — The very first risings of disgust at those that injure you, opposite to forgiving one another.</p>
<p><em>And clamour</em> — Or bawling. "I am not angry," says one; "but it is my way to speak so." Then unlearn that way: it is the way to hell.</p>
<p><em>And evil speaking</em> — Be it in ever so mild and soft a tone, or with ever such professions of kindness. Here is a beautiful retrogradation, beginning with the highest, and descending to the lowest, degree of the want of love.</p>
