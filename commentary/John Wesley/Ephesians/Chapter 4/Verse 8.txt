<p><em>Wherefore he saith</em> â€” That is, in reference to which God saith by David, Having ascended on high, he led captivity captive - He triumphed over all his enemies, Satan, sin, and death, which had before enslaved all the world: alluding to the custom of ancient conquerors, who led those they had conquered in chains after them. And, as they also used to give donatives to the people, at their return from victory, so he gave gifts to men - Both the ordinary and extraordinary gifts of the Spirit. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:18">Psalm 68:18</span>.</p>
