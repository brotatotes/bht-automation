<p><em>Wherefore he</em> — God.</p>
<p><em>Saith</em> — In the general tenor of his word, to all who are still in darkness.</p>
<p><em>Awake thou that steepest</em> — In ignorance of God and thyself; in stupid insensibility.</p>
<p><em>And arise from the dead</em> — From the death of sin.</p>
<p><em>And Christ shall give thee light</em> — Knowledge, holiness, happiness.</p>
