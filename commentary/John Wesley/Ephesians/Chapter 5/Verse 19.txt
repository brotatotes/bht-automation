Speaking to each other — By the Spirit. In the Psalm - Of David.And hymns — Of praise.And spiritual songs — On any divine subject. By there being no inspired songs, peculiarly adapted to the Christian dispensation, as there were to the Jewish, it is evident that the promise of the Holy Ghost to believers, in the last days, was by his larger effusion to supply the lack of it.Singing with your hearts — As well as your voice.To the Lord — Jesus, who searcheth the heart.
