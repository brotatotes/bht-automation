<p>In the following directions concerning relative duties, the inferiors are all along placed before the superiors, because the general proposition is concerning submission; and inferiors ought to do their duty, whatever their superiors do.</p>
<p><em>Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands</em> — Unless where God forbids. Otherwise, in all indifferent things, the will of the husband is a law to the wife.</p>
<p><em>As unto the Lord</em> — The obedience a wife pays to her husband is at the same time paid to Christ himself; he being head of the wife, as Christ is head of the church.</p>
