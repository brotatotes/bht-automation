<p><em>Nor foolish talking</em> — Tittle tattle, talking of nothing, the weather, fashions, meat and drink.</p>
<p><em>Or jesting</em> — The word properly means, wittiness, facetiousness, esteemed by the heathens an half-virtue. But how frequently even this quenches the Spirit, those who are tender of conscience know.</p>
<p><em>Which are not convenient</em> — For a Christian; as neither increasing his faith nor holiness.</p>
