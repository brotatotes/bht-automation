For our wrestling is not only, not chiefly, against flesh and blood - Weak men, or fleshly appetites.But against principalities, against powers — The mighty princes of all the infernal legions. And great is their power, and that likewise of those legions whom they command.Against the rulers of the world — Perhaps these principalities and powers remain mostly in the citadel of their kingdom of darkness. But there are other evil spirits who range abroad, to whom the provinces of the world are committed.Of the darkness — This is chiefly spiritual darkness.Of this age — Which prevails during the present state of things.Against wicked spirits — Who continually oppose faith, love, holiness, either by force or fraud; and labour to infuse unbelief, pride, idolatry malice, envy, anger, hatred.In heavenly places — Which were once their abode, and which they still aspire to, as far as they are permitted.
