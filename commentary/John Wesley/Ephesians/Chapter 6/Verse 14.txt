<p><em>Having your loins girt about</em> — That ye may be ready for every motion.</p>
<p><em>With truth</em> — Not only with the truths of the gospel, but with "truth in the inward parts;" for without this all our knowledge of divine truth will prove but a poor girdle "in the evil day." So our Lord is described, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:5">Isaiah 11:5</span>. And as a girded man is always ready to go on, so this seems to intimate an obedient heart, a ready will. Our Lord adds to the loins girded, the lights burning, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:35">Luke 12:35</span>; showing that watching and ready obedience are the inseparable companions of faith and love.</p>
<p><em>And having on the breastplate of righteousness</em> — The righteousness of a spotless purity, in which Christ will present us faultless before God, through the merit of his own blood. With this breastplate our Lord is described, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:17">Isaiah 59:17</span>. In the breast is the seat of conscience, which is guarded by righteousness. No armour for the back is mentioned. We are always to face our enemies.</p>
