<p><em>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel</em> â€” Let this be always ready to direct and confirm you in every step. This part of the armour, for the feet, is needful, considering what a journey we have to go; what a race to run. Our feet must be so shod, that our footsteps slip not. To order our life and conversation aright, we are prepared by the gospel blessing, the peace and love of God ruling in the heart, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="col+3:14,15">Colossians 3:14,15</span>. By this only can we tread the rough ways, surmount our difficulties, and hold out to the end.</p>
