<p><em>Praying always</em> — At all times, and on every occasion, in midst of all employments, inwardly praying without ceasing.</p>
<p><em>By the Spirit</em> — Through the influence of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><em>With all prayer</em> — With all sort of prayer, public, private, mental, vocal. Some are careful in respect of one kind of prayer, and negligent in others. If we would have the petitions we ask, let us use all. Some there are who use only mental prayer or ejaculations, and think they are in a state of grace, and use a way of worship, far superior to any other: but such only fancy themselves to be above what is really above them; it requiring far more grace to be enabled to pour out a fervent and continued prayer, than to offer up mental aspirations.</p>
<p><em>And supplication</em> — Repeating and urging our prayer, as Christ did in the garden.</p>
<p><em>And watching</em> — Inwardly attending on God, to know his will, to gain power to do it, and to attain to the blessings we desire.</p>
<p><em>With all perseverance</em> — Continuing to the end in this holy exercise.</p>
<p><em>And supplication for all the saints</em> — Wrestling in fervent, continued intercession for others, especially for the faithful, that they may do all the will of God, and be steadfast to the end. Perhaps we receive few answers to prayer, because we do not intercede enough for others.</p>
