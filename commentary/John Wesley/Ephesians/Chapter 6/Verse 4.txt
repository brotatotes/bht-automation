And, ye fathers — Mothers are included; but fathers are named, as being more apt to be stern and severe.Provoke not your children to wrath — Do not needlessly fret or exasperate them.But bring them up — With all tenderness and mildness.In the instruction and discipline of the Lord — Both in Christian knowledge and practice.
