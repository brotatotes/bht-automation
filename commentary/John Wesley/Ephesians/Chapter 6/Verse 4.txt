<p><em>And, ye fathers</em> — Mothers are included; but fathers are named, as being more apt to be stern and severe.</p>
<p><em>Provoke not your children to wrath</em> — Do not needlessly fret or exasperate them.</p>
<p><em>But bring them up</em> — With all tenderness and mildness.</p>
<p><em>In the instruction and discipline of the Lord</em> — Both in Christian knowledge and practice.</p>
