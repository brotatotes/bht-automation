<p><em>For neither did I receive it</em> — At once.</p>
<p><em>Nor was I taught it</em> — Slowly and gradually, by any man.</p>
<p><em>But by the revelation of Jesus Christ</em> — Our Lord revealed to him at first, his resurrection, ascension, and the calling of the gentiles, and his own apostleship; and told him then, there were other things for which he would appear to him.</p>
