But when it pleased God — He ascribes nothing to his own merits, endeavours, or sincerity.Who separated me from my mother's womb — Set me apart for an apostle, as he did Jeremiah for a prophet. Jeremiah 1:5. Such an unconditional predestination as this may consist, both with God's justice and mercy.And called me by his grace — By his free and almighty love, to be both a Christian and an apostle.
