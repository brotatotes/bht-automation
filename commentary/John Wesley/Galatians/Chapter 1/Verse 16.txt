To reveal his Son in me — By the powerful operation of his Spirit, 2 Corinthians 4:6; as well as to me, by the heavenly vision.That I might preach him to others — Which I should have been ill qualified to do, had I not first known him myself.I did not confer with flesh and blood — Being fully satisfied of the divine will, and determined to obey, I took no counsel with any man, neither with my own reason or inclinations, which might have raised numberless objections.
