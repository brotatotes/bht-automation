But — The argument here comes to the height. Paul reproves Peter himself. So far was he from receiving his doctrine from man, or from being inferior to the chief of the apostles.When Peter — Afterwards, Came to Antioch - Then the chief of all the Gentile churches.I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed — For fear of man, Galatians 2:12; for dissimulation, Galatians 2:13; and for not walking uprightly. Galatians 2:14.
