For I through the law — Applied by the Spirit to my heart, and deeply convincing me of my utter sinfulness and helplessness.Am dead to the law — To all hope of justification from it.That I may live to God — Not continue in sin. For this very end am I, in this sense, freed from the law, that I may be freed from sin.
