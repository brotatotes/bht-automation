I went up — Not by any command from them, but by an express revelation from God.And laid before them — The chief of the church in Jerusalem.The gospel which I preach among the gentiles — Acts 15:4, touching justification by faith alone; not that they might confirm me therein, but that I might remove prejudice from them. Yet not publicly at first, but severally to those of eminence - Speaking to them one by one.Lest I should run, or should have run, in vain — Lest I should lose the fruit either of my present or past labours. For they might have greatly hindered this, had they not been fully satisfied both of his mission and doctrine. The word run beautifully expresses the swift progress of the gospel.
