<p>The Apostle goes on to describe how he is freed from sin; how far he is from continuing therein.</p>
<p><em>I am crucified with Christ</em> — Made conformable to his death; "the body of sin is destroyed." <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>.</p>
<p><em>And I</em> — As to my corrupt nature.</p>
<p><em>Live no longer</em> — Being dead to sin.</p>
<p><em>But Christ liveth in me</em> — Is a fountain of life in my inmost soul, from which all my tempers, words, and actions flow.</p>
<p><em>And the life that I now live in the flesh</em> — Even in this mortal body, I live by faith in the Son of God - I derive every moment from that supernatural principle; from a divine evidence and conviction, that "he loved me, and delivered up himself for me."</p>
