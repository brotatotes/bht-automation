The Apostle goes on to describe how he is freed from sin; how far he is from continuing therein.I am crucified with Christ — Made conformable to his death; "the body of sin is destroyed." Romans 6:6.And I — As to my corrupt nature.Live no longer — Being dead to sin.But Christ liveth in me — Is a fountain of life in my inmost soul, from which all my tempers, words, and actions flow.And the life that I now live in the flesh — Even in this mortal body, I live by faith in the Son of God - I derive every moment from that supernatural principle; from a divine evidence and conviction, that "he loved me, and delivered up himself for me."
