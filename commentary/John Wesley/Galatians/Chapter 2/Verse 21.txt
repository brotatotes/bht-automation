Meantime I do not make void - In seeking to be justified by my own works.The grace of God — The free love of God in Christ Jesus. But they do, who seek justification by the law.For if righteousness is by the law — If men might be justified by their obedience to the law, moral or ceremonial.Then Christ died in vain — Without any necessity for it, since men might have been saved without his death; might by their own obedience have been both discharged from condemnation, and entitled to eternal life.
