<p>Meantime I do not make void - In seeking to be justified by my own works.</p>
<p><em>The grace of God</em> — The free love of God in Christ Jesus. But they do, who seek justification by the law.</p>
<p><em>For if righteousness is by the law</em> — If men might be justified by their obedience to the law, moral or ceremonial.</p>
<p><em>Then Christ died in vain</em> — Without any necessity for it, since men might have been saved without his death; might by their own obedience have been both discharged from condemnation, and entitled to eternal life.</p>
