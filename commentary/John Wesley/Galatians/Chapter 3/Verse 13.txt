Christ — Christ alone. The abruptness of the sentence shows an holy indignation at those who reject so great a blessing.Hath redeemed us — Whether Jews or gentiles, at an high price.From the curse of the law — The curse of God, which the law denounces against all transgressors of it.Being made a curse for us — Taking the curse upon himself, that we might be delivered from it, willingly submitting to that death which the law pronounces peculiarly accursed. Deuteronomy 21:23.
