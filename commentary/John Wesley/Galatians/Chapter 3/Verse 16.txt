<p><em>Now the promises were made to Abraham and his seed</em> — Several promises were made to Abraham; but the chief of all, and which was several times repeated, was that of the blessing through Christ.</p>
<p><em>He</em> — That is, God.</p>
<p><em>Saith not, And to seeds, as of many</em> — As if the promise were made to several kinds of seed.</p>
<p><em>But as of one</em> — That is, one kind of seed, one posterity, one kind of sons. And to all these the blessing belonged by promise.</p>
<p><em>Which is Christ</em> — including all that believe in him. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:18">Genesis 22:18</span>.</p>
