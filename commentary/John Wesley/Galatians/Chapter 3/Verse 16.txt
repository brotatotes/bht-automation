Now the promises were made to Abraham and his seed — Several promises were made to Abraham; but the chief of all, and which was several times repeated, was that of the blessing through Christ.He — That is, God.Saith not, And to seeds, as of many — As if the promise were made to several kinds of seed.But as of one — That is, one kind of seed, one posterity, one kind of sons. And to all these the blessing belonged by promise.Which is Christ — including all that believe in him. Genesis 22:18.
