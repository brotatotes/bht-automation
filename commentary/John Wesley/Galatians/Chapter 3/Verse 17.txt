<p><em>And this I say</em> — What I mean is this.</p>
<p><em>The covenant which was before confirmed of God</em> — By the promise itself, by the repetition of it, and by a solemn oath, concerning the blessing all nations.</p>
<p><em>Through Christ, the law which was four hundred and thirty years after</em> — Counting from the time when the promise was first made to Abraham, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:2,3">Genesis 12:2,3</span>.</p>
<p><em>Doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of no effect</em> — With regard to all nations, if only the Jewish were to receive it; yea, with regard to them also, if it was by works, so as to supersede it, and introduce another way of obtaining the blessing.</p>
