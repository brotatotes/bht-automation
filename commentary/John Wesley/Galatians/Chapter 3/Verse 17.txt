And this I say — What I mean is this.The covenant which was before confirmed of God — By the promise itself, by the repetition of it, and by a solemn oath, concerning the blessing all nations.Through Christ, the law which was four hundred and thirty years after — Counting from the time when the promise was first made to Abraham, Genesis 12:2,3.Doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of no effect — With regard to all nations, if only the Jewish were to receive it; yea, with regard to them also, if it was by works, so as to supersede it, and introduce another way of obtaining the blessing.
