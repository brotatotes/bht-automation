Have ye suffered — Both from the zealous Jews and from the heathens.So many things — For adhering to the gospel.In vain — So as to lose all the blessings which ye might have obtained, by enduring to the end.If it be yet in vain — As if he had said, I hope better things, even that ye will endure to the end.
