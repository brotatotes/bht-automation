<p><em>Have ye suffered</em> — Both from the zealous Jews and from the heathens.</p>
<p><em>So many things</em> — For adhering to the gospel.</p>
<p><em>In vain</em> — So as to lose all the blessings which ye might have obtained, by enduring to the end.</p>
<p><em>If it be yet in vain</em> — As if he had said, I hope better things, even that ye will endure to the end.</p>
