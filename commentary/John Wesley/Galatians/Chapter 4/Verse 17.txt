<p><em>They</em> — The judaizing teachers who are come among you.</p>
<p><em>Zealously affect you</em> — Express an extraordinary regard for you.</p>
<p><em>But not well</em> — Their zeal is not according to knowledge; neither have they a single eye to your spiritual advantage.</p>
<p><em>Yea, they would exclude you</em> — From me and from the blessings of the gospel.</p>
<p><em>That ye might affect</em> — Love and esteem them.</p>
