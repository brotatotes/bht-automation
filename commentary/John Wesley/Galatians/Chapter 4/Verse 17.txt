They — The judaizing teachers who are come among you.Zealously affect you — Express an extraordinary regard for you.But not well — Their zeal is not according to knowledge; neither have they a single eye to your spiritual advantage.Yea, they would exclude you — From me and from the blessings of the gospel.That ye might affect — Love and esteem them.
