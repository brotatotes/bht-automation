For it is written — Those words in the primary sense promise a flourishing state to Judea, after its desolation by the Chaldeans.Rejoice. thou barren, that bearest not — Ye heathen nations, who, like a barren woman, were destitute, for many ages, of a seed to serve the Lord. Break forth and cry aloud for joy, thou that, in former time, travailedst not: for the desolate hath many more children than she that hath an husband - For ye that were so long utterly desolate shall at length bear more children than the Jewish church, which was of old espoused to God. Isaiah 54:1.
