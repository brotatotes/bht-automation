<p><em>So we</em> — The church of God.</p>
<p><em>When we were children</em> — In our minority, under the legal dispensation.</p>
<p><em>Were in bondage</em> — In a kind of servile state.</p>
<p><em>Under the elements of the world</em> — Under the typical observances of the law, which were like the first elements of grammar, the A B C of children; and were of so gross a nature, as hardly to carry our thoughts beyond this world.</p>
