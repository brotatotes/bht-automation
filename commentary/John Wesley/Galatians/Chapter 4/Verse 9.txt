<p><em>But now being known of God</em> — As his beloved children.</p>
<p><em>How turn ye back to the weak and poor elements</em> — Weak, utterly unable to purge your conscience from guilt, or to give that filial confidence in God.</p>
<p><em>Poor</em> — incapable of enriching the soul with such holiness and happiness as ye are heirs to.</p>
<p><em>Ye desire to be again in bondage</em> — Though of another kind; now to these elements, as before to those idols.</p>
