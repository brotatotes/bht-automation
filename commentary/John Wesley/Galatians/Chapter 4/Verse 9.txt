But now being known of God — As his beloved children.How turn ye back to the weak and poor elements — Weak, utterly unable to purge your conscience from guilt, or to give that filial confidence in God.Poor — incapable of enriching the soul with such holiness and happiness as ye are heirs to.Ye desire to be again in bondage — Though of another kind; now to these elements, as before to those idols.
