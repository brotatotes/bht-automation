<p><em>Ye have been called to liberty</em> — From sin and misery, as well as from the ceremonial law.</p>
<p><em>Only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh</em> — Take not occasion from hence to gratify corrupt nature.</p>
<p><em>But by love serve one another</em> — And hereby show that Christ has made you free.</p>
