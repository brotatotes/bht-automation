<p><em>For the flesh desireth against the Spirit</em> — Nature desires what is quite contrary to the Spirit of God.</p>
<p><em>But the Spirit against the flesh-</em> — But the Holy Spirit on his part opposes your evil nature.</p>
<p><em>These are contrary to each other</em> — The flesh and the Spirit; there can be no agreement between them.</p>
<p><em>That ye may not do the things which ye would-</em> — That, being thus strengthened by the Spirit, ye may not fulfil the desire of the flesh, as otherwise ye would do.</p>
