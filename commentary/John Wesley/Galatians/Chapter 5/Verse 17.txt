For the flesh desireth against the Spirit — Nature desires what is quite contrary to the Spirit of God.But the Spirit against the flesh- — But the Holy Spirit on his part opposes your evil nature.These are contrary to each other — The flesh and the Spirit; there can be no agreement between them.That ye may not do the things which ye would- — That, being thus strengthened by the Spirit, ye may not fulfil the desire of the flesh, as otherwise ye would do.
