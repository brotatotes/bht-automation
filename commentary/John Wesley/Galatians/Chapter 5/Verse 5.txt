<p><em>For we</em> — Who believe in Christ, Who are under the gospel dispensation.</p>
<p><em>Through the Spirit</em> — Without any of those carnal ordinances.</p>
<p><em>Wait for</em> — in sure confidence of attaining.</p>
<p><em>The hope of righteousness</em> — The righteousness we hope for, and full reward of it. This righteousness we receive of God through faith; and by faith we shall obtain the reward.</p>
