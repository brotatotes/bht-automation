<p><em>For in Christ Jesus</em> — According to the institution which he hath established, according to the tenor of the Christian covenant.</p>
<p><em>Neither circumcision</em> — With the most punctual observance of the law.</p>
<p><em>Nor uncircumcision</em> — With the most exact heathen morality.</p>
<p><em>Availeth anything</em> — Toward present justification or eternal salvation.</p>
<p><em>But faith</em> — Alone; even that faith which worketh by love - All inward and outward holiness.</p>
