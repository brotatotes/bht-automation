For in Christ Jesus — According to the institution which he hath established, according to the tenor of the Christian covenant.Neither circumcision — With the most punctual observance of the law.Nor uncircumcision — With the most exact heathen morality.Availeth anything — Toward present justification or eternal salvation.But faith — Alone; even that faith which worketh by love - All inward and outward holiness.
