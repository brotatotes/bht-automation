<p><em>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in any fault</em> — By surprise, ignorance, or stress of temptation.</p>
<p><em>Ye who are spiritual</em> — Who continue to live and walk by the Spirit.</p>
<p><em>Restore such an one</em> — By reproof, instruction, or exhortation. Every one who can, ought to help herein; only in the spirit of meekness - This is essential to a spiritual man; and in this lies the whole force of the cure.</p>
<p><em>Considering thyself</em> — The plural is beautifully changed into the singular. Let each take heed to himself.</p>
<p><em>Lest thou also be tempted</em> — Temptation easily and swiftly passes from one to another; especially if a man endeavours to cure another without preserving his own meekness.</p>
