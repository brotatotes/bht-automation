Brethren, if a man be overtaken in any fault — By surprise, ignorance, or stress of temptation.Ye who are spiritual — Who continue to live and walk by the Spirit.Restore such an one — By reproof, instruction, or exhortation. Every one who can, ought to help herein; only in the spirit of meekness - This is essential to a spiritual man; and in this lies the whole force of the cure.Considering thyself — The plural is beautifully changed into the singular. Let each take heed to himself.Lest thou also be tempted — Temptation easily and swiftly passes from one to another; especially if a man endeavours to cure another without preserving his own meekness.
