<p><em>Therefore as we have opportunity</em> — At whatever time or place, and in whatever manner we can. The opportunity in general is our lifetime; but there are also many particular opportunities. Satan is quickened in doing hurt, by the shortness of the time, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+12:12">Revelation 12:12</span>. By the same consideration let us be quickened in doing good.</p>
<p><em>Let us do good</em> — In every possible kind, and in every possible degree.</p>
<p><em>Unto all men</em> — Neighbours or strangers, good or evil, friends or enemies. But especially to them who are of the household of faith. For all believers are but one family.</p>
