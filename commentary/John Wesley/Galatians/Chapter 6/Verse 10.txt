Therefore as we have opportunity — At whatever time or place, and in whatever manner we can. The opportunity in general is our lifetime; but there are also many particular opportunities. Satan is quickened in doing hurt, by the shortness of the time, Revelation 12:12. By the same consideration let us be quickened in doing good.Let us do good — In every possible kind, and in every possible degree.Unto all men — Neighbours or strangers, good or evil, friends or enemies. But especially to them who are of the household of faith. For all believers are but one family.
