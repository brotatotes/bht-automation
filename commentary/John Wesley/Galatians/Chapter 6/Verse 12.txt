As many as desire to make a fair appearance in the flesh — To preserve a fair character.These constrain you — Both by their example and importunity.To be circumcised — Not so much from a principle of conscience, as lest they should suffer persecution - From the unbelieving Jews.For the cross of Christ — For maintaining that faith in a crucified Saviour is alone sufficient for justification.
