<p><em>As many as desire to make a fair appearance in the flesh</em> — To preserve a fair character.</p>
<p><em>These constrain you</em> — Both by their example and importunity.</p>
<p><em>To be circumcised</em> — Not so much from a principle of conscience, as lest they should suffer persecution - From the unbelieving Jews.</p>
<p><em>For the cross of Christ</em> — For maintaining that faith in a crucified Saviour is alone sufficient for justification.</p>
