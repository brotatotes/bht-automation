But God forbid that I should glory — Should boast of anything I have, am, or do; or rely on anything for my acceptance with God, but what Christ hath done and suffered for me. By means of which the world is crucified to me - All the things and persons in it are to me as nothing.And I unto the world — I am dead to all worldly pursuits, cares, desires, and enjoyments.
