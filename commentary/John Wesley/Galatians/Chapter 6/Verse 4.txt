<p><em>But let every man try his own work</em> — Narrowly examine all he is, and all he doeth.</p>
<p><em>And then he shall have rejoicing in himself</em> — He will find in himself matter of rejoicing, if his works are right before God.</p>
<p><em>And not in another</em> — Not in glorying over others.</p>
