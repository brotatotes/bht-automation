For he that now soweth to the flesh — That follows the desires of corrupt nature. Shall hereafter of the flesh - Out of this very seed.Reap corruption — Death everlasting.But he that soweth to the Spirit — That follows his guidance in all his tempers and conversation.Shall of the Spirit — By the free grace and power of God, reap life everlasting.
