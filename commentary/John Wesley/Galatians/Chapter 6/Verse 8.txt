<p><em>For he that now soweth to the flesh</em> — That follows the desires of corrupt nature. Shall hereafter of the flesh - Out of this very seed.</p>
<p><em>Reap corruption</em> — Death everlasting.</p>
<p><em>But he that soweth to the Spirit</em> — That follows his guidance in all his tempers and conversation.</p>
<p><em>Shall of the Spirit</em> — By the free grace and power of God, reap life everlasting.</p>
