<p><em>God, who at sundry times</em> — The creation was revealed in the time of Adam; the last judgment, in the time of Enoch: and so at various times, and in various degrees, more explicit knowledge was given.</p>
<p><em>In divers manners</em> — In visions, in dreams, and by revelations of various kinds. Both these are opposed to the one entire and perfect revelation which he has made to us by Jesus Christ. The very number of the prophets showed that they prophesied only "in part." Of old - There were no prophets for a large tract of time before Christ came, that the great Prophet might be the more earnestly expected.</p>
<p><em>Spake</em> — A part is put for the whole; implying every kind of divine communication.</p>
<p><em>By the prophets</em> — The mention of whom is a virtual declaration that the apostle received the whole Old Testament, and was not about to advance any doctrine in contradiction to it.</p>
<p><em>Hath in these last times</em> — Intimating that no other revelation is to be expected.</p>
<p><em>Spoken</em> — All things, and in the most perfect manner.</p>
<p><em>By his Son</em> — Alone. The Son spake by the apostles. The majesty of the Son of God is proposed, 1. Absolutely, by the very name of Son, verse1, and by three glorious predicates,-"whom he hath appointed," "by whom he made," who "sat down;" whereby he is described from the beginning to the consummation of all things, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2,3">Hebrews 1:2,3</span>2. Comparatively to angels, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4">Hebrews 1:4</span>. The proof of this proposition immediately follows: the name of Son being proved, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5">Hebrews 1:5</span>; his being "heir of all things," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:6-9">Hebrews 1:6-9</span>; his making the worlds, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:10-12">Hebrews 1:10-12</span>his sitting at God's right hand, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:13">Hebrews 1:13</span>, etc.</p>
