<p><em>Whom he hath appointed heir of all things</em> — After the name of Son, his inheritance is mentioned. God appointed him the heir long before he made the worlds, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:11">Ephesians 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="pr+8:22">Proverbs 8:22</span>, etc. The Son is the firstborn, born before all things: the heir is a term relating to the creation which followed, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:6">Hebrews 1:6</span>.</p>
<p><em>By whom he also made the worlds</em> — Therefore the Son was before all worlds. His glory reaches from everlasting to everlasting, though God spake by him to us only "in these last days."</p>
