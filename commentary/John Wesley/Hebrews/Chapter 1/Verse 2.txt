Whom he hath appointed heir of all things — After the name of Son, his inheritance is mentioned. God appointed him the heir long before he made the worlds, Ephesians 3:11; Proverbs 8:22, etc. The Son is the firstborn, born before all things: the heir is a term relating to the creation which followed, Hebrews 1:6.By whom he also made the worlds — Therefore the Son was before all worlds. His glory reaches from everlasting to everlasting, though God spake by him to us only "in these last days."
