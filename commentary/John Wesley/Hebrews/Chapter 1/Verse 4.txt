<p>This verse has two clauses, the latter of which is treated of, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5">Hebrews 1:5</span>; the former, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:13">Hebrews 1:13</span>. Such transpositions are also found in the other epistles of St. Paul, but in none so frequently as in this. The Jewish doctors were peculiarly fond of this figure, and used it much in all their writings. The apostle therefore, becoming all things to all men, here follows the same method. All the inspired writers were readier in all the figures of speech than the most experienced orators.</p>
<p><em>Being</em> — By his exaltation, after he had been lower than them, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>.</p>
<p><em>So much higher than the angels</em> — It was extremely proper to observe this, because the Jews gloried in their law, as it was delivered by the ministration of angels. How much more may we glory in the gospel, which was given, not by the ministry of angels, but of the very Son of God! As he hath by inheritance a more excellent name - Because he is the Son of God, he inherits that name, in right whereof he inherits all things His inheriting that name is more ancient than all worlds; his inheriting all things, as ancient as all things.</p>
<p><em>Than they</em> — This denotes an immense pre-eminence. The angels do not inherit all things, but are themselves a portion of the Son's inheritance, whom they worship as their Lord.</p>
