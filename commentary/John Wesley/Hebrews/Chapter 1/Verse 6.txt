And again — That is, in another scripture.He — God.Saith, when he bringeth in his first-begotten — This appellation includes that of Son, together with the rights of primogeniture, which the first-begotten Son of God enjoys, in a manner not communicable to any creature.Into the world — Namely, at his incarnation.He saith, Let all the angels of God worship him — So much higher was he, when in his lowest estate, than the highest angel. Psalm 97:7.
