<p><em>And again</em> — That is, in another scripture.</p>
<p><em>He</em> — God.</p>
<p><em>Saith, when he bringeth in his first-begotten</em> — This appellation includes that of Son, together with the rights of primogeniture, which the first-begotten Son of God enjoys, in a manner not communicable to any creature.</p>
<p><em>Into the world</em> — Namely, at his incarnation.</p>
<p><em>He saith, Let all the angels of God worship him</em> — So much higher was he, when in his lowest estate, than the highest angel. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ps+97:7">Psalm 97:7</span>.</p>
