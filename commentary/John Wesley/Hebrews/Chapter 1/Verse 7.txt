Who maketh his angels — This implies, they are only creatures, whereas the Son is eternal, Hebrews 1:8; and the Creator himself, Hebrews 1:10.Spirits and a flame of fire — Which intimates not only their office, but also their nature; which is excellent indeed, the metaphor being taken from the most swift, subtle, and efficacious things on earth; but nevertheless infinitely below the majesty of the Son. Psalm 104:4.
