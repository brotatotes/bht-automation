<p><em>Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity</em> — Thou art infinitely pure and holy.</p>
<p><em>Therefore God</em> — Who, as thou art Mediator, is thy God. Hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness - With the Holy Ghost, the fountain of joy.</p>
<p><em>Above thy fellows</em> — Above all the children of men.</p>
