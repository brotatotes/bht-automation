<p><em>By a living way</em> — The way of faith, whereby we live indeed.</p>
<p><em>Which he hath consecrated</em> — Prepared, dedicated, and established for us.</p>
<p><em>Through the veil, that is, his flesh</em> — As by rending the veil in the temple, the holy of holies became visible and accessible; so by wounding the body of Christ, the God of heaven was manifested, and the way to heaven opened.</p>
