By a living way — The way of faith, whereby we live indeed.Which he hath consecrated — Prepared, dedicated, and established for us.Through the veil, that is, his flesh — As by rending the veil in the temple, the holy of holies became visible and accessible; so by wounding the body of Christ, the God of heaven was manifested, and the way to heaven opened.
