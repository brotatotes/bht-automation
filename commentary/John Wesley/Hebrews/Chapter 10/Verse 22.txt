<p><em>Let us draw near</em> — To God.</p>
<p><em>With a true heart</em> — In godly sincerity.</p>
<p><em>Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience</em> — So as to condemn us no longer And our bodies washed with pure water - All our conversation spotless and holy, which is far more acceptable to God than all the legal sprinklings and washings.</p>
