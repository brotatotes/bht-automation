<p><em>Not forsaking the assembling ourselves</em> — In public or private worship.</p>
<p><em>As the manner of some is</em> — Either through fear of persecution, or from a vain imagination that they were above external ordinances.</p>
<p><em>But exhorting one another</em> — To faith, love, and good works.</p>
<p><em>And so much the more, as ye see the day approaching</em> — The great day is ever in your eye.</p>
