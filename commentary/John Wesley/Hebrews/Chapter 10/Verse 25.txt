Not forsaking the assembling ourselves — In public or private worship.As the manner of some is — Either through fear of persecution, or from a vain imagination that they were above external ordinances.But exhorting one another — To faith, love, and good works.And so much the more, as ye see the day approaching — The great day is ever in your eye.
