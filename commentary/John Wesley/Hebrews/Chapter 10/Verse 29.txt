And counted the blood wherewith the better covenant was established, an unholy, a common, worthless thing. By which he hath been sanctified - Therefore Christ died for him also, and he was at least justified once.</p>
<p><em>And done despite to the Spirit of grace</em> — By rejecting all his motions.</p>
