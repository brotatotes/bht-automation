<p><em>Now the just</em> — The justified person.</p>
<p><em>Shall live</em> — In God's favour, a spiritual and holy life.</p>
<p><em>By faith</em> — As long as he retains that gift of God.</p>
<p><em>But if he draw back</em> — If he make shipwreck of his faith My soul hath no pleasure in him - That is, I abhor him; I cast him off. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:3">Habakkuk 2:3</span>, etc.</p>
