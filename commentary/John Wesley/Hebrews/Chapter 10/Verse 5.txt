It is said, into the world, not into the tabernacle, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:1">Hebrews 9:1</span>; because all the world is interested in his sacrifice.</p>
<p><em>A body hast thou prepared for me</em> — That I may offer up myself. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:6">Psalm 40:6</span>,etc.</p>
