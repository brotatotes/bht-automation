<p><em>By it the elders</em> — Our forefathers. This chapter is a kind of summary of the Old Testament, in which the apostle comprises the designs, labours, sojournings, expectations, temptations, martyrdoms of the ancients. The former of them had a long exercise of their patience; the latter suffered shorter but sharper trials.</p>
<p><em>Obtained a good testimony</em> — A most comprehensive word. God gave a testimony, not only of them but to them: and they received his testimony as if it had been the things themselves of which he testified, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:4,5,39">Hebrews 11:4,5,39</span>. Hence they also gave testimony to others, and others testified of them.</p>
