The reproach of Christ — That which he bore for believing in the Messiah to come, and acting accordingly.For he looked off — From all those perishing treasures, and beyond all those temporal hardships Unto the recompence of reward - Not to an inheritance in Canaan; he had no warrant from God to look for this, nor did he ever attain it; but what his believing ancestors looked for,-a future state of happiness in heaven.
