<p><em>The reproach of Christ</em> — That which he bore for believing in the Messiah to come, and acting accordingly.</p>
<p><em>For he looked off</em> — From all those perishing treasures, and beyond all those temporal hardships Unto the recompence of reward - Not to an inheritance in Canaan; he had no warrant from God to look for this, nor did he ever attain it; but what his believing ancestors looked for,-a future state of happiness in heaven.</p>
