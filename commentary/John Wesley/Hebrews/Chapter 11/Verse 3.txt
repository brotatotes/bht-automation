By faith we understand that the worlds — Heaven and earth and all things in them, visible and invisible.Where made — Formed, fashioned, and finished.By the word — The sole command of God, without any instrument or preceding matter. And as creation is the foundation and specimen of the whole divine economy, so faith in the creation is the foundation and specimen of all faith.So that things which are seen — As the sun, earth, stars.Were made of things which do not appear — Out of the dark, unapparent chaos, Genesis 1:2. And this very chaos was created by the divine power; for before it was thus created it had no existence in nature.
