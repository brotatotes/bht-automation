Women — Naturally weak.Received their dead — Children.Others were tortured — From those who acted great things the apostle rises higher, to those who showed the power of faith by suffering.Not accepting deliverance — On sinful terms.That they might obtain a better resurrection — An higher reward, seeing the greater their sufferings the greater would be their glory1Kings17:22; 2 Kings 4:35
