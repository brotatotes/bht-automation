<p><em>By faith</em> — In the future Redeemer.</p>
<p><em>Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice</em> — The firstlings of his flock, implying both a confession of what his own sins deserved, and a desire of sharing in the great atonement.</p>
<p><em>Than Cain</em> — Whose offering testified no such faith, but a bare acknowledgment of God the Creator. By which faith he obtained both righteousness and a testimony of it: God testifying - Visibly that his gifts were accepted; probably by sending fire from heaven to consume his sacrifice, a token that justice seized on the sacrifice instead of the sinner who offered it.</p>
<p><em>And by it</em> — By this faith.</p>
<p><em>Being dead, he yet speaketh</em> — That a sinner is accepted only through faith in the great sacrifice.</p>
