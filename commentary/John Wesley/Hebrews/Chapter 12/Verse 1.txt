<p><em>Wherefore, being encompassed with a cloud</em> — A great multitude, tending upward with a holy swiftness.</p>
<p><em>Of witnesses</em> — Of the power of faith.</p>
<p><em>Let us lay aside every weight</em> — As all who run a race take care to do. Let us throw off whatever weighs us down, or damps the vigour of our Soul.</p>
<p><em>And the sin which easily besetteth us</em> — As doth the sin of our constitution, the sin of our education, the sin of our profession.</p>
