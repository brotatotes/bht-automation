Wherefore, being encompassed with a cloud — A great multitude, tending upward with a holy swiftness.Of witnesses — Of the power of faith.Let us lay aside every weight — As all who run a race take care to do. Let us throw off whatever weighs us down, or damps the vigour of our Soul.And the sin which easily besetteth us — As doth the sin of our constitution, the sin of our education, the sin of our profession.
