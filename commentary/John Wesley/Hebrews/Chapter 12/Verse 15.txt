<p><em>Looking diligently, lest any one</em> — If he do not lift up the hands that hang down.</p>
<p><em>Fall from the grace of God: lest any root of bitterness</em> — Of envy, anger, suspicion.</p>
<p><em>Springing up</em> — Destroy the sweet peace; lest any, not following after holiness, fall into fornication or profaneness. In general, any corruption, either in doctrine or practice, is a root of bitterness, and may pollute many.</p>
