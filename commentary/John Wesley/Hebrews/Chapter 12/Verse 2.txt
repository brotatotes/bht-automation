Looking — From all other things.To Jesus — As the wounded Israelites to the brazen serpent. Our crucified Lord was prefigured by the lifting up of this; our guilt, by the stings of the fiery serpents; and our faith, by their looking up to the miraculous remedy.The author and finisher of our faith — Who begins it in us, carries it on, and perfects it.Who for the joy that was set before him — Patiently and willingly endured the cross, with all the pains annexed thereto.And is set down — Where there is fulness of joy.
