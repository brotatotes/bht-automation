<p><em>Looking</em> — From all other things.</p>
<p><em>To Jesus</em> — As the wounded Israelites to the brazen serpent. Our crucified Lord was prefigured by the lifting up of this; our guilt, by the stings of the fiery serpents; and our faith, by their looking up to the miraculous remedy.</p>
<p><em>The author and finisher of our faith</em> — Who begins it in us, carries it on, and perfects it.</p>
<p><em>Who for the joy that was set before him</em> — Patiently and willingly endured the cross, with all the pains annexed thereto.</p>
<p><em>And is set down</em> — Where there is fulness of joy.</p>
