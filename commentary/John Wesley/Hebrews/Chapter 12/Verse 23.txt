It is observable, that in this beautiful gradation, these first-born are placed nearer to God than the angels. See James 1:18.And to God the Judge of all — Propitious to you, adverse to your enemies.And to the spirits — The separate souls.Of just men — It seems to mean, of New Testament believers.

These are now made perfect in an higher sense than any who are still alive. Accordingly, St. Paul, while yet on earth, denies that he was thus made perfect, Philippians 3:12.
