To Jesus, the mediator — Through whom they had been perfected.And to the blood of sprinkling — To all the virtue of his precious blood shed for you, whereby ye are sprinkled from an evil conscience. This blood of sprinkling was the foundation of our Lord's mediatorial office. Here the gradation is at the highest point.Which speaketh better things than that of Abel — Which cried for vengeance.
