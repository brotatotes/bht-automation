<p><em>Refuse not</em> — By unbelief.</p>
<p><em>Him that speaketh</em> — And whose speaking even now is a prelude to the final scene. The same voice which spake both by the law and in the gospel, when heard from heaven, will shake heaven and earth.</p>
<p><em>For if they escaped not</em> — His vengeance.</p>
<p><em>Much more shall not we</em> — Those of us who turn from him that speaketh from heaven - That is, who came from heaven to speak to us.</p>
