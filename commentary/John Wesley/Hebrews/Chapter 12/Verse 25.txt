Refuse not — By unbelief.Him that speaketh — And whose speaking even now is a prelude to the final scene. The same voice which spake both by the law and in the gospel, when heard from heaven, will shake heaven and earth.For if they escaped not — His vengeance.Much more shall not we — Those of us who turn from him that speaketh from heaven - That is, who came from heaven to speak to us.
