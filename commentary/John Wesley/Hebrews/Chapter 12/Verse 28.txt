<p><em>Therefore let us, receiving</em> — By willing and joyful faith.</p>
<p><em>A kingdom</em> — More glorious than the present heaven and earth.</p>
<p><em>Hold fast the grace, whereby we may serve God</em> — In every thought, word, and work.</p>
<p><em>With reverence</em> — Literally, with shame. Arising from a deep consciousness of our own unworthiness.</p>
<p><em>And godly fear</em> — A tender, jealous fear of offending, arising from a sense of the gracious majesty of God.</p>
