Therefore let us, receiving — By willing and joyful faith.A kingdom — More glorious than the present heaven and earth.Hold fast the grace, whereby we may serve God — In every thought, word, and work.With reverence — Literally, with shame. Arising from a deep consciousness of our own unworthiness.And godly fear — A tender, jealous fear of offending, arising from a sense of the gracious majesty of God.
