And yet ye seem already to have forgotten the exhortation - Wherein God speaketh to you with the utmost tenderness.Despise not thou the chastening of the Lord — Do not slight or make little of it; do not impute any affliction to chance or second causes but see and revere the hand of God in it.Neither faint when thou art rebuked of him — But endure it patiently and fruitfully. Proverbs 3:11, etc.
