<p>And yet ye seem already to have forgotten the exhortation - Wherein God speaketh to you with the utmost tenderness.</p>
<p><em>Despise not thou the chastening of the Lord</em> — Do not slight or make little of it; do not impute any affliction to chance or second causes but see and revere the hand of God in it.</p>
<p><em>Neither faint when thou art rebuked of him</em> — But endure it patiently and fruitfully. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:11">Proverbs 3:11</span>, etc.</p>
