Wherefore Jesus also — Exactly answering those typical sin - offerings.Suffered without the gate — Of Jerusalem, which answered to the old camp of Israel.That he might sanctify — Reconcile and consecrate to God.The people — Who believe in him.By his own blood — Not those shadowy sacrifices, which are now of no farther use.
