<p><em>Wherefore Jesus also</em> — Exactly answering those typical sin - offerings.</p>
<p><em>Suffered without the gate</em> — Of Jerusalem, which answered to the old camp of Israel.</p>
<p><em>That he might sanctify</em> — Reconcile and consecrate to God.</p>
<p><em>The people</em> — Who believe in him.</p>
<p><em>By his own blood</em> — Not those shadowy sacrifices, which are now of no farther use.</p>
