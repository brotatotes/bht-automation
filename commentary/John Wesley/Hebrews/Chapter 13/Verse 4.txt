Marriage is honourable in, or for all sorts of men, clergy as well as laity: though the Romanists teach otherwise.And the bed undefiled — Consistent with the highest purity; though many spiritual writers, so called, say it is only licensed whoredom.But whoremongers and adulterers God will judge — Though they frequently escape the sentence of men.
