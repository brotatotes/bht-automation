Be not carried about with various doctrines — Which differ from that one faith in our one unchangeable Lord.Strange — To the ears and hearts of all that abide in him.For it is good — It is both honourable before God and pleasant and profitable That the heart be stablished with grace - Springing from faith in Christ.Not with meats — Jewish ceremonies, which indeed can never stablish the heart.
