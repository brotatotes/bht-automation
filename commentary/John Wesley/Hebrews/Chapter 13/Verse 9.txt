<p><em>Be not carried about with various doctrines</em> — Which differ from that one faith in our one unchangeable Lord.</p>
<p><em>Strange</em> — To the ears and hearts of all that abide in him.</p>
<p><em>For it is good</em> — It is both honourable before God and pleasant and profitable That the heart be stablished with grace - Springing from faith in Christ.</p>
<p><em>Not with meats</em> — Jewish ceremonies, which indeed can never stablish the heart.</p>
