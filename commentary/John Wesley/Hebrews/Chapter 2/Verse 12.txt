I will declare thy name to my brethren — Christ declares the name of God, gracious and merciful, plenteous in goodness and truth, to all who believe, that they also may praise him.In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee — As the precentor of the choir. This he did literally, in the midst of his apostles, on the night before his passion. And as it means, in a more general sense, setting forth the praise of God, he has done it in the church by his word and his Spirit; he still does, and will do it throughout all generations. Psalm 22:22.
