And again — As one that has communion with his brethren in sufferings, as well as in nature, he says, I will put my trust in him - To carry me through them all.And again — With a like acknowledgment of his near relation to them, as younger brethren, who were yet but in their childhood, he presents all believers to God, saying, Behold I and the children whom thou hast given me. Isaiah 8:17,18
