<p><em>What is man</em> — To the vast expanse of heaven, to the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained! This psalm seems to have been composed by David, in a clear, moonshiny, and starlight night, while he was contemplating the wonderful fabric of heaven; because in his magnificent description of its luminaries, he takes no notice of the sun, the most glorious of them all. The words here cited concerning dominion were doubtless in some sense applicable to Adam; although in their complete and highest sense, they belong to none but the second Adam.</p>
<p><em>Or the son of man, that thou visitest him</em> — The sense rises: we are mindful of him that is absent; but to visit, denotes the care of a present God. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:4">Psalm 8:4</span>.</p>
