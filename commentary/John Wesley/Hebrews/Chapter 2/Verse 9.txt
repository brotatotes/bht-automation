It is done only with regard to Jesus, God-Man, who is now crowned with glory and honour - As a reward for his having suffered death.He was made a little lower than the angels — Who cannot either suffer or die.That by the grace of God, he might taste death — An expression denoting both the reality of his death, and the shortness of its continuance.For every man — That ever was or will be born into the world.
