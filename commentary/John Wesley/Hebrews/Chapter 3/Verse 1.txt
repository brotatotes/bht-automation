<p><em>The heavenly calling</em> — God calls from heaven, and to heaven, by the gospel.</p>
<p><em>Consider the Apostle</em> — The messenger of God, who pleads the cause of God with us.</p>
<p><em>And High Priest</em> — Who pleads our cause with God. Both are contained in the one word Mediator. He compares Christ, as an Apostle, with Moses; as a Priest, with Aaron. Both these offices, which Moses and Aaron severally bore, he bears together, and far more eminently.</p>
<p><em>Of our profession</em> — The religion we profess.</p>
