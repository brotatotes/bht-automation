<p><em>Wherefore</em> — To speak after the manner of men.</p>
<p><em>I was grieved</em> — Displeased, offended with that generation, and said, They always err in their hearts - They are led astray by their stubborn will and vile affections.</p>
<p><em>And</em> — For this reason, because wickedness has blinded their understanding.</p>
<p><em>They have not known my ways</em> — By which I would have led them like a flock.</p>
<p><em>Into my rest</em> — In the promised land.</p>
