Wherefore — To speak after the manner of men.I was grieved — Displeased, offended with that generation, and said, They always err in their hearts - They are led astray by their stubborn will and vile affections.And — For this reason, because wickedness has blinded their understanding.They have not known my ways — By which I would have led them like a flock.Into my rest — In the promised land.
