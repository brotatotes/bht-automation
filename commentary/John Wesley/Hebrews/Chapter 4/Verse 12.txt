<p><em>For the word of God</em> — Preached, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:2">Hebrews 4:2</span>, and armed with threatenings, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:3">Hebrews 4:3</span>.</p>
<p><em>Is living and powerful</em> — Attended with the power of the living God, and conveying either life or death to the hearers.</p>
<p><em>Sharper than any two-edged sword</em> — Penetrating the heart more than this does the body.</p>
<p><em>Piercing</em> — Quite through, and laying open.</p>
<p><em>The soul and spirit, joints and marrow</em> — The inmost recesses of the mind, which the apostle beautifully and strongly expresses by this heap of figurative words.</p>
<p><em>And is a discerner</em> — Not only of the thoughts, but also of the intentions.</p>
