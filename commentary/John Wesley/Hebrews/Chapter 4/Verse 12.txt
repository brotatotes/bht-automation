For the word of God — Preached, Hebrews 4:2, and armed with threatenings, Hebrews 4:3.Is living and powerful — Attended with the power of the living God, and conveying either life or death to the hearers.Sharper than any two-edged sword — Penetrating the heart more than this does the body.Piercing — Quite through, and laying open.The soul and spirit, joints and marrow — The inmost recesses of the mind, which the apostle beautifully and strongly expresses by this heap of figurative words.And is a discerner — Not only of the thoughts, but also of the intentions.
