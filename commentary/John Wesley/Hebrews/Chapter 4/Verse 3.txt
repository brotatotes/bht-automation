<p>For we only that have believed enter into the rest - The proposition is, There remains a rest for us. This is proved, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:3-11">Hebrews 4:3-11</span>, thus: That psalm mentions a rest: yet it does not mean, 1. God's rest from creating; for this was long before the time of Moses. Therefore in his time another rest was expected, of which they who then heard fell short Nor is it, 2. The rest which Israel obtained through Joshua; for the Psalmist wrote after him. Therefore it is, 3. The eternal rest in heaven.</p>
<p><em>As he said</em> — Clearly showing that there is a farther rest than that which followed the finishing of the creation.</p>
<p><em>Though the works were finished</em> — Before: whence it is plain, God did not speak of resting from them.</p>
