<p><em>For every high priest being taken from among men</em> — Is, till he is taken, of the same rank with them.</p>
<p><em>And is appointed</em> — That is, is wont to be appointed.</p>
<p><em>In things pertaining to God</em> — To bring God near to men, and men to God.</p>
<p><em>That he may offer both gifts</em> — Out of things inanimate, and animal sacrifices.</p>
