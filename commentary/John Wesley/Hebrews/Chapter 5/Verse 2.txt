<p><em>Who can have compassion</em> — In proportion to the offence: so the Greek word signifies.</p>
<p><em>On the ignorant</em> — Them that are in error.</p>
<p><em>And the wandering</em> — Them that are in sin.</p>
<p><em>Seeing himself also is compassed with infirmity</em> — Even with sinful infirmity; and so needs the compassion which he shows to others.</p>
