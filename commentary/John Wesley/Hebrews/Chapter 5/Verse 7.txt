<p>The sum of the things treated of in the seventh and following chapters is contained, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7-10">Hebrews 5:7-10</span>; and in this sum is admirably comprised the process of his passion, with its inmost causes, in the very terms used by the evangelists.</p>
<p><em>Who in the days of his flesh</em> — Those two days, in particular, wherein his sufferings were at the height.</p>
<p><em>Having offered up prayers and supplications</em> — Thrice.</p>
<p><em>With strong crying and tears</em> — In the garden.</p>
<p><em>To him that was able to save him from death</em> — Which yet he endured, in obedience to the will of his Father. And being heard in that which he particularly feared - When the cup was offered him first, there was set before him that horrible image of a painful, shameful, accursed death, which moved him to pray conditionally against it: for, if he had desired it, his heavenly Father would have sent him more than twelve legions of angels to have delivered him. But what he most exceedingly feared was the weight of infinite justice; the being "bruised" and "put to grief" by the hand of God himself. Compared with this, everything else was a mere nothing; and yet, so greatly did he ever thirst to be obedient to the righteous will of his Father, and to "lay down" even "his life for the sheep," that he vehemently longed to be baptized with this baptism, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:50">Luke 12:50</span>. Indeed, his human nature needed the support of Omnipotence; and for this he sent up strong crying and tears: but, throughout his whole life, he showed that it was not the sufferings he was to undergo, but the dishonour that sin had done to so holy a God, that grieved his spotless soul. The consideration of its being the will of God tempered his fear, and afterwards swallowed it up; and he was heard not so that the cup should pass away, but so that he drank it without any fear.</p>
