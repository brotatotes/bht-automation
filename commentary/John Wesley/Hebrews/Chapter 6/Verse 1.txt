Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ — That is, saying no more of them for the present.Let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works — From open sins, the very first thing to be insisted on.And faith in God — The very next point. So St. Paul in his very first sermon at Lystra, Acts 14:15, "Turn from those vanities unto the living God." And when they believed, they were to be baptized with the baptism, not of the Jews, or of John, but of Christ. The next thing was, to lay hands upon them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: after which they were more fully instructed, touching the resurrection, and the general judgment; called eternal, because the sentence then pronounced is irreversible, and the effects of it remain for ever.
