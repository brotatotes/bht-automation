<p><em>It is impossible for those who were once enlightened</em> — With the light of the glorious love of God in Christ.</p>
<p><em>And have tasted the heavenly gift</em> — Remission of sins, sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.</p>
<p><em>And been made partakers of the Holy Ghost</em> — Of the witness and the fruit of he Spirit.</p>
