<p><em>And have fallen away</em> — Here is not a supposition, but a plain relation of fact. The apostle here describes the case of those who have cast away both the power and the form of godliness; who have lost both their faith, hope, and love, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:10">Hebrews 6:10</span>, etc., and that wilfully, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:26">Hebrews 10:26</span>. Of these wilful total apostates he declares, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance. (though they were renewed once,) either to the foundation, or anything built thereon.</p>
<p><em>Seeing they crucify the Son of God afresh</em> — They use him with the utmost indignity.</p>
<p><em>And put him to an open shame</em> — Causing his glorious name to be blasphemed.</p>
