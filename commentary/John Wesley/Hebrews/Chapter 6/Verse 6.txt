And have fallen away — Here is not a supposition, but a plain relation of fact. The apostle here describes the case of those who have cast away both the power and the form of godliness; who have lost both their faith, hope, and love, Hebrews 6:10, etc., and that wilfully, Hebrews 10:26. Of these wilful total apostates he declares, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance. (though they were renewed once,) either to the foundation, or anything built thereon.Seeing they crucify the Son of God afresh — They use him with the utmost indignity.And put him to an open shame — Causing his glorious name to be blasphemed.
