<p>The apostle now demonstrates that the Levitical priesthood must yield to the priesthood of Christ, because Melchisedec, after whose order he is a priest, 1. Is opposed to Aaron, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:11-14">Hebrews 7:11-14</span>2. Hath no end of life, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:15-19">Hebrews 7:15-19</span>, but "remaineth a priest continually." If now perfection were by the Levitical priesthood - If this perfectly answered all God's designs and man's wants For under it the people received the law - Whence some might infer, that perfection was by that priesthood.</p>
<p><em>What farther need was there, that another priest</em> â€” Of a new order, should be set up? From this single consideration it is plain, that both the priesthood and the law, which were inseparably connected, were now to give way to a better priesthood and more excellent dispensation.</p>
