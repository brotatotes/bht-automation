<p><em>Who is made</em> — A priest.</p>
<p><em>Not after the law of a carnal commandment</em> — Not according to the Mosaic law, which consisted chiefly of commandments that were carnal, compared to the spirituality of the gospel.</p>
<p><em>But after the power of an endless life</em> — Which he has in himself, as the eternal Son of God.</p>
