For the law — Taken by itself, separate from the gospel.Made nothing perfect — Could not perfect its votaries, either in faith or love, in happiness or holiness.But the bringing in of a better hope — Of the gospel dispensation, which gives us a better ground of confidence, does.By which we draw nigh to God — Yea, so nigh as to be one spirit with him. And this is true perfection.
