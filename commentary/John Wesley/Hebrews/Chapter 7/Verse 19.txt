<p><em>For the law</em> — Taken by itself, separate from the gospel.</p>
<p><em>Made nothing perfect</em> — Could not perfect its votaries, either in faith or love, in happiness or holiness.</p>
<p><em>But the bringing in of a better hope</em> — Of the gospel dispensation, which gives us a better ground of confidence, does.</p>
<p><em>By which we draw nigh to God</em> — Yea, so nigh as to be one spirit with him. And this is true perfection.</p>
