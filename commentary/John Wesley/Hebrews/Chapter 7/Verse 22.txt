<p><em>Of so much better a covenant</em> — Unchangeable, eternal.</p>
<p><em>Was Jesus made a surety</em> — Or mediator. The word covenant frequently occurs in the remaining part of this epistle. The original word means either a covenant or a last will and testament. St. Paul takes it sometimes in the former, sometimes in the latter, sense; sometimes he includes both.</p>
