<p><em>Wherefore he is able to save to the uttermost</em> — From all the guilt, power, root, and consequence of sin.</p>
<p><em>Them who come</em> — By faith.</p>
<p><em>To God through him</em> — As their priest.</p>
<p><em>Seeing he ever liveth to make intercession</em> — That is, he ever lives and intercedes. He died once; he intercedes perpetually.</p>
