<p><em>For such an high priest suited us</em> — Unholy, mischievous, defiled sinners: a blessed paradox! Holy - With respect to God.</p>
<p><em>Harmless</em> — With respect to men.</p>
<p><em>Undefiled</em> — With any sin in himself.</p>
<p><em>Separated from sinners</em> — As well as free from sin. And so he was when he left the world.</p>
<p><em>And made</em> — Even in his human nature.</p>
<p><em>Higher than the heavens</em> — And all their inhabitants.</p>
