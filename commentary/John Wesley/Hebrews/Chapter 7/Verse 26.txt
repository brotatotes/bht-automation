For such an high priest suited us — Unholy, mischievous, defiled sinners: a blessed paradox! Holy - With respect to God.Harmless — With respect to men.Undefiled — With any sin in himself.Separated from sinners — As well as free from sin. And so he was when he left the world.And made — Even in his human nature.Higher than the heavens — And all their inhabitants.
