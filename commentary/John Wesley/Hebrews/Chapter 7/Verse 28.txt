The law maketh men high priests that have infirmity — That are both weak, mortal, and sinful.But the oath which was since the law — Namely, in the time of David.Maketh the son, who is consecrated for ever — Who being now free, both from sin and death, from natural and moral infirmity, remaineth a priest for ever.
