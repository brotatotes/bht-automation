<p><em>The law maketh men high priests that have infirmity</em> — That are both weak, mortal, and sinful.</p>
<p><em>But the oath which was since the law</em> — Namely, in the time of David.</p>
<p><em>Maketh the son, who is consecrated for ever</em> — Who being now free, both from sin and death, from natural and moral infirmity, remaineth a priest for ever.</p>
