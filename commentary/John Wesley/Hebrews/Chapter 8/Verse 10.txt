This is the covenant I will make after those days — After the Mosaic dispensation is abolished.I will put my laws in their minds — I will open their eyes, and enlighten their understanding, to see the true, full, spiritual meaning thereof.And write them on their hearts — So that they shall inwardly experience whatever I have commanded.And I will be to them a God — Their all-sufficient portion, and exceeding great reward.And they shall be to me a people — My treasure, my beloved, loving, and obedient children.
