<p><em>This is the covenant I will make after those days</em> — After the Mosaic dispensation is abolished.</p>
<p><em>I will put my laws in their minds</em> — I will open their eyes, and enlighten their understanding, to see the true, full, spiritual meaning thereof.</p>
<p><em>And write them on their hearts</em> — So that they shall inwardly experience whatever I have commanded.</p>
<p><em>And I will be to them a God</em> — Their all-sufficient portion, and exceeding great reward.</p>
<p><em>And they shall be to me a people</em> — My treasure, my beloved, loving, and obedient children.</p>
