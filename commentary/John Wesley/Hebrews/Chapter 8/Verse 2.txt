A minister — Who represents his own sacrifice, as the high priest did the blood of those sacrifices once a year.Of the sanctuary — Heaven, typified by the holy of holies.And of the true tabernacle — Perhaps his human nature, of which the old tabernacle was a type.Which the Lord hath fixed — Forever.Not man — As Moses fixed the tabernacle.
