<p><em>A minister</em> — Who represents his own sacrifice, as the high priest did the blood of those sacrifices once a year.</p>
<p><em>Of the sanctuary</em> — Heaven, typified by the holy of holies.</p>
<p><em>And of the true tabernacle</em> — Perhaps his human nature, of which the old tabernacle was a type.</p>
<p><em>Which the Lord hath fixed</em> — Forever.</p>
<p><em>Not man</em> — As Moses fixed the tabernacle.</p>
