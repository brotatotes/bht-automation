<p><em>Who serve</em> — The temple, which was not yet destroyed.</p>
<p><em>After the pattern and shadow of heavenly things</em> — Of spiritual, evangelical worship, and of everlasting glory.</p>
<p><em>The pattern</em> — Somewhat like the strokes pencilled out upon a piece of fine linen, which exhibit the figures of leaves and flowers, but have not yet received their splendid colours and curious shades.</p>
<p><em>And shadow</em> — Or shadowy representation, which gives you some dim and imperfect idea of the body, but not the fine features, not the distinguishing air; none of those living graces which adorn the real person. Yet both the pattern and shadow lead our minds to something nobler than themselves: the pattern, to that holiness and glory which complete it; the shadow, to that which occasions it. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:40">Exodus 25:40</span>.</p>
