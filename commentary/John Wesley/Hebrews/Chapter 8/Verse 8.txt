It is new in many respects, though not as to the substance of it: 1. Being ratified by the death of Christ2. Freed from those burdensome rites and ceremonies3. Containing a more full and clear account of spiritual religion4. Attended with larger influences of the Spirit5. Extended to all men. And, 6. Never to be abolished. Jeremiah 31:31, etc.
