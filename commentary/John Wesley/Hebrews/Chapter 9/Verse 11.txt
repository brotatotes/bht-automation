<p><em>An high priest of good things to come</em> — Described, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span>. Entered through a greater, that is, a more noble, and perfect tabernacle - Namely, his own body.</p>
<p><em>Not of this creation</em> — Not framed by man, as that tabernacle was.</p>
