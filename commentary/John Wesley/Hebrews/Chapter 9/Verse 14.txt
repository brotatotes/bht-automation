<p><em>How much more shall the blood of Christ.</em> — The merit of all his sufferings.</p>
<p><em>Who through the eternal Spirit</em> — The work of redemption being the work of the whole Trinity. Neither is the Second Person alone concerned even in the amazing condescension that was needful to complete it. The Father delivers up the kingdom to the Son; and the Holy Ghost becomes the gift of the Messiah, being, as it were, sent according to his good pleasure.</p>
<p><em>Offered himself</em> — Infinitely more precious than any created victim, and that without spot to God.</p>
<p><em>Purge our conscience</em> — Our inmost soul.</p>
<p><em>From dead works</em> — From all the inward and outward works of the devil, which spring from spiritual death in the soul, and lead to death everlasting.</p>
<p><em>To serve the living God</em> — In the life of faith, in perfect love and spotless holiness.</p>
