Therefore — That is, it plainly appears from what has been said.It was necessary — According to the appointment of God. That the tabernacle and all its utensils, which were patterns, shadowy representations, of things in heaven, should be purified by these - Sacrifices and sprinklings.But the heavenly things themselves — Our heaven-born spirits: what more this may mean we know not yet.By better sacrifices than these — That is, by a better sacrifice, which is here opposed to all the legal sacrifices, and is expressed plurally, because it includes the signification of them all, and is of so much more eminent virtue.
