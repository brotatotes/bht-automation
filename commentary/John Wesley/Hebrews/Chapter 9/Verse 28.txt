<p><em>Christ having once died to bear the sins</em> — The punishment due to them.</p>
<p><em>Of many</em> — Even as many as are born into the world.</p>
<p><em>Will appear the second time</em> — When he comes to judgment.</p>
<p><em>Without sin</em> — Not as he did before, bearing on himself the sins of many, but to bestow everlasting salvation.</p>
