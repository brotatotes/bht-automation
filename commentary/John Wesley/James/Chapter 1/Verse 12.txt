<p><em>Happy is the man that endureth temptation</em> — Trials of various kinds.</p>
<p><em>He shall receive the crown</em> — That fadeth not away.</p>
<p><em>Which the Lord hath promised to them that love him</em> — And his enduring proves his love. For it is love only that "endureth all things."</p>
