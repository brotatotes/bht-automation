<p><em>Every man is tempted, when</em> — In the beginning of the temptation.</p>
<p><em>He is drawn away</em> — Drawn out of God, his strong refuge.</p>
<p><em>By his own desire</em> — We are therefore to look for the cause of every sin, in, not out of ourselves. Even the injections of the devil cannot hurt before we make them our own. And every one has desires arising from his own constitution, tempers, habits, and way of life.</p>
<p><em>And enticed</em> — In the progress of the temptation, catching at the bait: so the original word signifies.</p>
