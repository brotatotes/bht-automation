<p>No evil, but every good gift - Whatever tends to holiness.</p>
<p><em>And every perfect gift</em> — Whatever tends to glory.</p>
<p><em>Descendeth from the Father of lights</em> — The appellation of Father is here used with peculiar propriety. It follows, "he begat us." He is the Father of all light, material or spiritual, in the kingdom of grace and of glory.</p>
<p><em>With whom is no variableness</em> — No change in his understanding.</p>
<p><em>Or shadow of turning</em> — in his will. He infallibly discerns all good and evil; and invariably loves one, and hates the other. There is, in both the Greek words, a metaphor taken from the stars, particularly proper where the Father of lights is mentioned. Both are applicable to any celestial body, which has a daily vicissitude of day and night, and sometimes longer days, sometimes longer nights. In God is nothing of this kind. He is mere light. If there Is any such vicissitude, it is in ourselves, not in him.</p>
