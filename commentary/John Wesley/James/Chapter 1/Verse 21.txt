<p><em>Therefore laying aside</em> — As a dirty garment.</p>
<p><em>All the filthiness and superfluity of wickedness</em> — For however specious or necessary it may appear to worldly wisdom, all wickedness is both vile, hateful, contemptible, and really superfluous. Every reasonable end may be effectually answered without any kind or degree of it. Lay this, every known sin, aside, or all your hearing is vain.</p>
<p><em>With meekness</em> — Constant evenness and serenity of mind.</p>
<p><em>Receive</em> — Into your ears, your heart, your life.</p>
<p><em>The word</em> — Of the gospel.</p>
<p><em>Ingrafted</em> — In believers, by regeneration, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:18">James 1:18</span> and by habit, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:14">Hebrews 5:14</span>.</p>
<p><em>Which is able to save your souls</em> — The hope of salvation nourishes meekness.</p>
