<p>The only true religion in the sight of God, is this, to visit - With counsel, comfort, and relief.</p>
<p><em>The fatherless and widows</em> — Those who need it most.</p>
<p><em>In their affliction</em> — In their most helpless and hopeless state.</p>
<p><em>And to keep himself unspotted from the world</em> — From the maxims, tempers, and customs of it. But this cannot be done, till we have given our hearts to God, and love our neighbour as ourselves.</p>
