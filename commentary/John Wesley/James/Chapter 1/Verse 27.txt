The only true religion in the sight of God, is this, to visit - With counsel, comfort, and relief.The fatherless and widows — Those who need it most.In their affliction — In their most helpless and hopeless state.And to keep himself unspotted from the world — From the maxims, tempers, and customs of it. But this cannot be done, till we have given our hearts to God, and love our neighbour as ourselves.
