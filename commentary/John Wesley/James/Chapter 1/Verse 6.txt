But let him ask in faith — A firm confidence in God. St. James also both begins and ends with faith, James 5:15; the hinderances of which he removes in the middle part of his epistle.He that doubteth is like a wave of the sea — Yea, such are all who have not asked and obtained wisdom.Driven with the wind — From without.And tossed — From within, by his own unstableness.
