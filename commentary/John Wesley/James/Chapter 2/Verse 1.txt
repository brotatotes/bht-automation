<p><em>My brethren</em> — The equality of Christians, intimated by this name, is the ground of the admonition. Hold not the faith of our common Lord, the Lord of glory - Of which glory all who believe in him partake.</p>
<p><em>With respect of persons</em> — That is, honour none merely for being rich; despise none merely for being poor.</p>
