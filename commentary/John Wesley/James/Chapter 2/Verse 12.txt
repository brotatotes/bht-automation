<p><em>So speak and act</em> — In all things.</p>
<p><em>As they that shall be judged</em> — Without respect of persons.</p>
<p><em>By the law of liberty</em> — The gospel; the law of universal love, which alone is perfect freedom. For their transgressions of this, both in word and deed, the wicked shall be condemned; and according to their works, done in obedience to this, the righteous will be rewarded.</p>
