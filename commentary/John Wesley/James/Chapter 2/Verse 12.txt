So speak and act — In all things.As they that shall be judged — Without respect of persons.By the law of liberty — The gospel; the law of universal love, which alone is perfect freedom. For their transgressions of this, both in word and deed, the wicked shall be condemned; and according to their works, done in obedience to this, the righteous will be rewarded.
