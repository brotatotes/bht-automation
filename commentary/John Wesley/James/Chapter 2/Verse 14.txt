<p>From <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:22">James 1:22</span>, the apostle has been enforcing Christian practice. He now applies to those who neglect this, under the pretence of faith. St. Paul had taught that "a man is justified by faith without the works of the law." This some began already to wrest to their own destruction. Wherefore St. James, purposely repeating ( <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:21,23,25">James 2:21,23,25</span>) the same phrases, testimonies, and examples, which St. Paul had used, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3">Romans 4:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:17,31">Hebrews 11:17,31</span>, refutes not the doctrine of St. Paul, but the error of those who abused it. There is, therefore, no contradiction between the apostles: they both delivered the truth of God, but in a different manner, as having to do with different kinds of men. On another occasion St. James himself pleaded the cause of faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:13-21">Acts 15:13-21</span>; and St. Paul himself strenuously pleads for works, particularly in his latter epistles. This verse is a summary of what follows. What profiteth it? is enlarged on, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:15-17">James 2:15-17</span>; though a man say, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:18,19">James 2:18,19</span> can that faith save him? <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:20">James 2:20</span>. It is not, though he have faith; but, though he say he have faith. Here, therefore, true, living faith is meant: but in other parts of the argument the apostle speaks of a dead, imaginary faith. He does not, therefore, teach that true faith can, but that it cannot, subsist without works: nor does he oppose faith to works; but that empty name of faith, to real faith working by love. Can that faith "which is without works" save him? No more than it can profit his neighbour.</p>
