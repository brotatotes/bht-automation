<p><em>Was not Abraham justified by works</em> â€” St. Paul says he was justified by faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:2">Romans 4:2</span>, etc.: yet St. James does not contradict him; for he does not speak of the same justification. St. Paul speaks of that which Abraham received many years before Isaac was born, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:6">Genesis 15:6</span>. St. James, of that which he did not receive till he had offered up Isaac on the altar. He was justified, therefore, in St. Paul's sense, (that is, accounted righteous,) by faith, antecedent to his works. He was justified in St. James's sense, (that is, made righteous,) by works, consequent to his faith. So that St. James's justification by works is the fruit of St Paul's justification by faith.</p>
