Ye see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only â€” St. Paul, on the other band, declares, "A man is justified by faith," and not by works, Romans 3:28. And yet there is no contradiction between the apostles: because, 1. They do not speak of the same faith: St. Paul speaking of living faith; St. James here, of dead faith2. They do not speak of the same works: St. Paul speaking of works antecedent to faith; St. James, of works subsequent to it.
