<p><em>Be not many teachers</em> — Let no more of you take this upon you than God thrusts out; seeing it is so hard not to offend in speaking much.</p>
<p><em>Knowing that we</em> — That all who thrust themselves into the office.</p>
<p><em>Shall receive greater condemnation</em> — For more offences. St. James here, as in several of the following verses, by a common figure of speech, includes himself: we shall receive, - we offend,-we put bits,-we curse - None of which, as common sense shows, are to be interpreted either of him or of the other apostles.</p>
