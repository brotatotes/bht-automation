Be not many teachers — Let no more of you take this upon you than God thrusts out; seeing it is so hard not to offend in speaking much.Knowing that we — That all who thrust themselves into the office.Shall receive greater condemnation — For more offences. St. James here, as in several of the following verses, by a common figure of speech, includes himself: we shall receive, - we offend,-we put bits,-we curse - None of which, as common sense shows, are to be interpreted either of him or of the other apostles.
