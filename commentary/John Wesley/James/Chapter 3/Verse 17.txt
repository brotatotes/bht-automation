<p><em>But the wisdom from above is first pure</em> — From all that is earthly, natural, devilish.</p>
<p><em>Then peaceable</em> — True peace attending purity, it is quiet, inoffensive.</p>
<p><em>Gentle</em> — Soft, mild, yielding, not rigid.</p>
<p><em>Easy to he entreated</em> — To be persuaded, or convinced; not stubborn, sour, or morose.</p>
<p><em>Full of good fruits</em> — Both in the heart and in the life, two of which are immediately specified.</p>
<p><em>Without partiality</em> — Loving all, without respect of persons; embracing all good things, rejecting all evil.</p>
<p><em>And without dissimulation</em> — Frank, open.</p>
