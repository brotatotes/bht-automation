But the wisdom from above is first pure — From all that is earthly, natural, devilish.Then peaceable — True peace attending purity, it is quiet, inoffensive.Gentle — Soft, mild, yielding, not rigid.Easy to he entreated — To be persuaded, or convinced; not stubborn, sour, or morose.Full of good fruits — Both in the heart and in the life, two of which are immediately specified.Without partiality — Loving all, without respect of persons; embracing all good things, rejecting all evil.And without dissimulation — Frank, open.
