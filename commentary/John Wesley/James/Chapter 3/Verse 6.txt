<p><em>A world of iniquity</em> — Containing an immense quantity of all manner of wickedness.</p>
<p><em>It defileth</em> — As fire by its smoke.</p>
<p><em>The whole body</em> — The whole man.</p>
<p><em>And setteth on fire the course of nature</em> — All the passions, every wheel of his soul.</p>
