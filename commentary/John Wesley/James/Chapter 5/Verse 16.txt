<p><em>Confess your faults</em> — Whether ye are sick or in health.</p>
<p><em>To one another</em> — He does not say, to the elders: this may, or may not, be done; for it is nowhere commanded. We may confess them to any who can pray in faith: he will then know how to pray for us, and be more stirred up so to do.</p>
<p><em>And pray one for another, that ye may be healed</em> — Of all your spiritual diseases.</p>
