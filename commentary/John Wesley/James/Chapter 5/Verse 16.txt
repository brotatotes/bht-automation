Confess your faults — Whether ye are sick or in health.To one another — He does not say, to the elders: this may, or may not, be done; for it is nowhere commanded. We may confess them to any who can pray in faith: he will then know how to pray for us, and be more stirred up so to do.And pray one for another, that ye may be healed — Of all your spiritual diseases.
