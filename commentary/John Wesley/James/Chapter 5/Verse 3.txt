The canker of them — Your perishing stores and motheaten garments.Will be a testimony against you — Of your having buried those talents in the earth, instead of improving them according to your Lord's will.And will eat your flesh as fire — Will occasion you as great torment as if fire were consuming your flesh.Ye have laid up treasure in the last days — When it is too late; when you have no time to enjoy them.
