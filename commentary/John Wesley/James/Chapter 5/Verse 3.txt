<p><em>The canker of them</em> — Your perishing stores and motheaten garments.</p>
<p><em>Will be a testimony against you</em> — Of your having buried those talents in the earth, instead of improving them according to your Lord's will.</p>
<p><em>And will eat your flesh as fire</em> — Will occasion you as great torment as if fire were consuming your flesh.</p>
<p><em>Ye have laid up treasure in the last days</em> — When it is too late; when you have no time to enjoy them.</p>
