<p><em>In the beginning</em> — (Referring to <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:1">Genesis 1:1</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="pr+8:23">Proverbs 8:23</span>.) When all things began to be made by the Word: in the beginning of heaven and earth, and this whole frame of created beings, the Word existed, without any beginning. He was when all things began to be, whatsoever had a beginning.</p>
<p><em>The Word</em> — So termed <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ps+33:6">Psalm 33:6</span>, and frequently by the seventy, and in the Chaldee paraphrase. So that St. John did not borrow this expression from Philo, or any heathen writer. He was not yet named Jesus, or Christ. He is the Word whom the Father begat or spoke from eternity; by whom the Father speaking, maketh all things; who speaketh the Father to us. We have, in <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>, both a real description of the Word, and the reason why he is so called. He is the only begotten Son of the Father, who is in the bosom of the Father, and hath declared him. And the Word was with God - Therefore distinct from God the Father. The word rendered with, denotes a perpetual tendency as it were of the Son to the Father, in unity of essence. He was with God alone; because nothing beside God had then any being.</p>
<p><em>And the Word was God</em> — Supreme, eternal, independent. There was no creature, in respect of which he could be styled God in a relative sense. Therefore he is styled so in the absolute sense. The Godhead of the Messiah being clearly revealed in the Old Testament, ( <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:7">Jeremiah 23:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ho+1:6">Hosea 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ps+23:1">Psalm 23:1</span>,) the other evangelists aim at this, to prove that Jesus, a true man, was the Messiah. But when, at length, some from hence began to doubt of his Godhead, then St. John expressly asserted it, and wrote in this book as it were a supplement to the Gospels, as in the Revelation to the prophets.</p>
