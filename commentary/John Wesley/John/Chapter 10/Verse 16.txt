<p><em>I have also other sheep</em> — Which he foreknew; which are not of this fold - Not of the Jewish Church or nation, but Gentiles.</p>
<p><em>I must bring them likewise</em> — Into my Church, the general assembly of those whose names are written in heaven.</p>
<p><em>And there shall be one flock</em> — (Not one fold, a plain false print) no corrupt or divided flocks remaining.</p>
<p><em>And one shepherd</em> — Who laid down his life for the sheep, and will leave no hireling among them. The unity both of the flock and the shepherd shall he completed in its season. The shepherd shall bring all into one flock: and the whole flock shall hear the one shepherd.</p>
