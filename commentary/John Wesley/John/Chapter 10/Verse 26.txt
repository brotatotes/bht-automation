Ye do not believe, because ye are not of my sheep â€” Because ye do not, will not follow me: because ye are proud, unholy, lovers of praise, lovers of the world, lovers of pleasure, not of God27,28, 29. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, etc.-Our Lord still alludes to the discourse he had before this festival. As if he had said, My sheep are they who, 1. Hear my voice by faith; 2. Are known (that is, approved) by me, as loving me; and3. Follow me, keep my commandments, with a believing, loving heart. And to those who, 1. Truly believe (observe three promises annexed to three conditions) I give eternal life. He does not say, I will, but I give. For he that believeth hath everlasting life. Those whom, 2. I know truly to love me, shall never perish, provided they abide in my love3. Those who follow me, neither men nor devils can pluck out of my hand. My Father who hath, by an unchangeable decree, given me all that believe, love, and obey, is greater than all in heaven or earth, and none is able to pluck them out of his hand.
