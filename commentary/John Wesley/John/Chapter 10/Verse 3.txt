<p><em>To him the door keeper openeth</em> — Christ is considered as the shepherd, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>. As the door in the first and following verses. And as it is not unworthy of Christ to be styled the door, by which both the sheep and the true pastor enter, so neither is it unworthy of God the Father to be styled the door keeper. See <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:27">Acts 14:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="col+4:3">Colossians 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+3:8">Revelation 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:14">Acts 16:14</span>.</p>
<p><em>And the sheep hear his voice</em> — The circumstances that follow, exactly agree with the customs of the ancient eastern shepherds. They called their sheep by name, went before them and the sheep followed them. So real Christians hear, listen to, understand, and obey the voice of the shepherd whom Christ hath sent. And he counteth them his own, dearer than any friend or brother: calleth, advises, directs each by name, and leadeth them out, in the paths of righteousness, beside the waters of comfort.</p>
