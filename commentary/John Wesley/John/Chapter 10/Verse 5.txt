<p><em>They will not follow a stranger</em> — One whom Christ hath not sent, who doth not answer the preceding description. Him they will not follow - And who can constrain them to it? But will flee from him - As from the plague.</p>
<p><em>For they know not the voice of strangers</em> — They cannot relish it; it is harsh and grating to them. They find nothing of God therein.</p>
