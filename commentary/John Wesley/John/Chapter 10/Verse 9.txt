<p><em>If any one</em> — As a sheep, enter in by me - Through faith, he shall be safe - From the wolf, and from those murdering shepherds.</p>
<p><em>And shall go in and out</em> — Shall continually attend on the shepherds whom I have sent; and shall find pasture - Food for his soul in all circumstances.</p>
