Are there not twelve hours in the day? — The Jews always divided the space from sunrise to sunset, were the days longer or shorter, into twelve parts: so that the hours of their day were all the year the same in number, though much shorter in winter than in summer.If any man walk in the day he stumbleth not — As if he had said, So there is such a space, a determined time, which God has allotted me. During that time I stumble not, amidst all the snares that are laid for me.Because he seeth the light of this world — And so I see the light of God surrounding me.
