<p><em>Are there not twelve hours in the day?</em> — The Jews always divided the space from sunrise to sunset, were the days longer or shorter, into twelve parts: so that the hours of their day were all the year the same in number, though much shorter in winter than in summer.</p>
<p><em>If any man walk in the day he stumbleth not</em> — As if he had said, So there is such a space, a determined time, which God has allotted me. During that time I stumble not, amidst all the snares that are laid for me.</p>
<p><em>Because he seeth the light of this world</em> — And so I see the light of God surrounding me.</p>
