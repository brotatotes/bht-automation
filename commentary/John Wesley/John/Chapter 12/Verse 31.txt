<p><em>Now</em> — This moment. And from this moment Christ thirsted more than ever, till his baptism was accomplished.</p>
<p><em>Is the judgment of this world</em> — That is, now is the judgment given concerning it, whose it shall be.</p>
<p><em>Now shall the prince of this world</em> — Satan, who had gained possession of it by sin and death, be cast out - That is, judged, condemned, cast out of his possession, and out of the bounds of Christ's kingdom.</p>
