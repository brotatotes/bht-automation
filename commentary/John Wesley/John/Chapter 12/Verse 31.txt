Now — This moment. And from this moment Christ thirsted more than ever, till his baptism was accomplished.Is the judgment of this world — That is, now is the judgment given concerning it, whose it shall be.Now shall the prince of this world — Satan, who had gained possession of it by sin and death, be cast out - That is, judged, condemned, cast out of his possession, and out of the bounds of Christ's kingdom.
