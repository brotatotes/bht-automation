<p><em>Lifted up from the earth</em> — This is a Hebraism which signifies dying. Death in general is all that is usually imported. But our Lord made use of this phrase, rather than others that were equivalent, because it so well suited the particular manner of his death.</p>
<p><em>I will draw all men</em> — Gentiles as well as Jews. And those who follow my drawings, Satan shall not be able to keep.</p>
