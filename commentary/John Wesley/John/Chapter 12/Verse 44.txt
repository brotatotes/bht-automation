Jesus said with a loud voice — This which follows to the end of the chapter, is with St. John the epilogue of our Lord's public discourses, and a kind of recapitulation of them.Believeth not on me — Not on me alone, but also on him that sent me: because the Father hath sent the Son, and because he and the Father are one.
