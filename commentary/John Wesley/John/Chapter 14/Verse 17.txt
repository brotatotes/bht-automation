The Spirit of truth — Who has, reveals, testifies, and defends the truth as it is in Jesus.Whom the world — All who do not love or fear God, cannot receive, because it seeth him not - Having no spiritual senses, no internal eye to discern him; nor consequently knoweth him.He shall be in you — As a constant guest. Your bodies and souls shall be temples of the Holy Ghost dwelling in you.
