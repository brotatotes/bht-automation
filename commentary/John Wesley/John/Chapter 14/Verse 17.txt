<p><em>The Spirit of truth</em> — Who has, reveals, testifies, and defends the truth as it is in Jesus.</p>
<p><em>Whom the world</em> — All who do not love or fear God, cannot receive, because it seeth him not - Having no spiritual senses, no internal eye to discern him; nor consequently knoweth him.</p>
<p><em>He shall be in you</em> — As a constant guest. Your bodies and souls shall be temples of the Holy Ghost dwelling in you.</p>
