<p><em>But ye see me</em> — That is, ye shall certainly see me.</p>
<p><em>Because I live, ye shall live also</em> — Because I am the living One in my Divine nature, and shall rise again in my human nature, and live for ever in heaven: therefore ye shall live the life of faith and love on earth, and hereafter the life of glory.</p>
