<p><em>Jesus answered</em> — Because ye love and obey me, and they do not, therefore I will reveal myself to you, and not to them.</p>
<p><em>My Father will love him</em> — The more any man loves and obeys, the more God will love him.</p>
<p><em>And we will come to him, and make our abode with him</em> — Which implies such a large manifestation of the Divine presence and love, that the former in justification is as nothing in comparison of it.</p>
