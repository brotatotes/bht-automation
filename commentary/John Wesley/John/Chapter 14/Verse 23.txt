Jesus answered — Because ye love and obey me, and they do not, therefore I will reveal myself to you, and not to them.My Father will love him — The more any man loves and obeys, the more God will love him.And we will come to him, and make our abode with him — Which implies such a large manifestation of the Divine presence and love, that the former in justification is as nothing in comparison of it.
