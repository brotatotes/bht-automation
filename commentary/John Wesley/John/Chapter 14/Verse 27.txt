<p><em>Peace I leave with you</em> — Peace in general; peace with God and with your own consciences.</p>
<p><em>My peace</em> — In particular; that peace which I enjoy, and which I create, I give - At this instant.</p>
<p><em>Not as the world giveth</em> — Unsatisfying unsettled, transient; but filling the soul with constant, even tranquillity. Lord, evermore give us this peace! How serenely may we pass through the most turbulent scenes of life, when all is quiet and harmonious within! Thou hast made peace through the blood of thy cross. May we give all diligence to preserve the inestimable gift inviolate, till it issue in everlasting peace!</p>
