<p><em>Every one that beareth fruit, he purifieth</em> — by obeying the truth, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22">1 Peter 1:22</span>; and by inward or outward sufferings, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:10,11">Hebrews 12:10,11</span>. So purity and fruitfulness help each other.</p>
<p><em>That it may bear more fruit</em> — For this is one of the noblest rewards God can bestow on former acts of obedience, to make us yet more holy, and fit for farther and more eminent service.</p>
