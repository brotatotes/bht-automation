Every one that beareth fruit, he purifieth — by obeying the truth, 1 Peter 1:22; and by inward or outward sufferings, Hebrews 12:10,11. So purity and fruitfulness help each other.That it may bear more fruit — For this is one of the noblest rewards God can bestow on former acts of obedience, to make us yet more holy, and fit for farther and more eminent service.
