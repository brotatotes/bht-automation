<p><em>When the Comforter is come, whom I will send from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me</em> â€” The Spirit's coming, and being sent by our Lord from the Father, to testify of him, are personal characters, and plainly distinguish him from the Father and the Son; and his title as the Spirit of truth, together with his proceeding from the Father, can agree to none but a Divine person. And that he proceeds from the Son, as well as from the Father, may be fairly argued from his being called the Spirit of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:11">1 Peter 1:11</span>; and from his being here said to be sent by Christ from the Father, as well as sent by the Father in his name.</p>
