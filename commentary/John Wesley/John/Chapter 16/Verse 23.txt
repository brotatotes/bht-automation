<p><em>Ye shall not question me about any thing</em> — Which you do not now understand. You will not need to inquire of me; for you will know all things clearly.</p>
<p><em>Whatsoever ye shall ask</em> — Knowledge, love, or any thing else, he will give it - Our Lord here gives us a charte blanche. Believer, write down what thou wilt. He had said, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:13">John 14:13</span>, I will do it, where the discourse was of glorifying the Father through the Son. Here, speaking of the love of the Father to believers, he saith, He will give it.</p>
