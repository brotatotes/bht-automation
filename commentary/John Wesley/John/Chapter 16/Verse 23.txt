Ye shall not question me about any thing — Which you do not now understand. You will not need to inquire of me; for you will know all things clearly.Whatsoever ye shall ask — Knowledge, love, or any thing else, he will give it - Our Lord here gives us a charte blanche. Believer, write down what thou wilt. He had said, John 14:13, I will do it, where the discourse was of glorifying the Father through the Son. Here, speaking of the love of the Father to believers, he saith, He will give it.
