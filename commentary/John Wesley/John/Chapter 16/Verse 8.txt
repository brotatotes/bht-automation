<p><em>He</em> â€” Observe his twofold office; toward the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:8">John 16:8</span>, etc.; toward believers, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:12">John 16:12</span>, etc.: will convince - All of the world - Who do not obstinately resist, by your preaching and miracles, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment - He who is convinced of sin either accepts the righteousness of Christ, or is judged with Satan.
