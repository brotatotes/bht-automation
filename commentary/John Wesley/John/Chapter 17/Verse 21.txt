<p><em>As thou art in me</em> — This also is to be understood in a way of similitude, and not of sameness or equality.</p>
<p><em>That the world may believe</em> — Here Christ prays for the world. Observe the sum of his whole prayer, 1. Receive me into thy own and my glory; 2. Let my apostles share therein; 3. And all other believers: 4. And let all the world believe.</p>
