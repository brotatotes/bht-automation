I have manifested thy name — All thy attributes; and in particular thy paternal relation to believers; to the men whom thou hast given me - The apostles, and so John 17:12.They were thine — By creation, and by descent from Abraham.And thou hast given them me — By giving them faith in what I have spoken. So John 17:9.
