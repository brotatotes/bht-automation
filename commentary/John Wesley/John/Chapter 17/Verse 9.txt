<p><em>I pray not for the world</em> â€” Not in these petitions, which are adapted to the state of believers only. (He prays for the world at <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21,23">John 17:21,23</span>, that they may believe - That they may know God hath sent him.) This no more proves that our Lord did not pray for the world, both before and afterward, than his praying for the apostles alone, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:6-19">John 17:6-19</span>, proves that he did not pray for them also which shall believe through their word, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:20">John 17:20</span>.</p>
