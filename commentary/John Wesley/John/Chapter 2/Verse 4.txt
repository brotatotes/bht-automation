<p><em>Jesus saith to her, Woman</em> — So our Lord speaks also, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:26">John 19:26</span>. It is probable this was the constant appellation which he used to her. He regarded his Father above all, not knowing even his mother after the flesh. What is it to me and thee? A mild reproof of her inordinate concern and untimely interposal.</p>
<p><em>Mine hour is not yet come</em> — The time of my working this miracle, or of my going away. May we not learn hence, if his mother was rebuked for attempting to direct him in the days of his flesh, how absurd it is to address her as if she had a right to command him, on the throne of his glory? Likewise how indecent it is for us to direct his supreme wisdom, as to the time or manner in which he shall appear for us in any of the exigencies of life!</p>
