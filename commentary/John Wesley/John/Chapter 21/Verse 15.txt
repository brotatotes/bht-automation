<p><em>Simon, son of Jonah</em> — The appellation Christ had given him, when be made that glorious confession, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:16">Matthew 16:16</span>, the remembrance of which might make him more deeply sensible of his late denial of him whom he had so confessed.</p>
<p><em>Lovest thou me?</em> — Thrice our Lord asks him, who had denied him thrice: more than these - Thy fellow disciples do? - Peter thought so once, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:33">Matthew 26:33</span>, but he now answers only - I love thee, without adding more than these.</p>
<p><em>Thou knowest</em> — He had now learnt by sad experience that Jesus knew his heart.</p>
<p><em>My lambs</em> — The weakest and tenderest of the flock.</p>
