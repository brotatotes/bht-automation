Yea, and this was the very design of God's love in sending him into the world.Whosoever believeth on him — With that faith which worketh by love, and hold fast the beginning of his confidence steadfast to the end.God so loved the world — That is, all men under heaven; even those that despise his love, and will for that cause finally perish. Otherwise not to believe would be no sin to them. For what should they believe? Ought they to believe that Christ was given for them? Then he was given for them.He gave his only Son — Truly and seriously. And the Son of God gave himself, Galatians 4:4, truly and seriously.
