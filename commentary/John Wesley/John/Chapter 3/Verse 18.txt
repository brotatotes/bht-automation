<p><em>He that believeth on him is not condemned</em> — Is acquitted, is justified before God.</p>
<p><em>The name of the only-begotten Son of God</em> — The name of a person is often put for the person himself. But perhaps it is farther intimated in that expression, that the person spoken of is great and magnificent. And therefore it is generally used to express either God the Father or the Son.</p>
