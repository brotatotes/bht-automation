<p><em>The Son can do nothing of himself</em> â€” This is not his imperfection, but his glory, resulting from his eternal, intimate, indissoluble unity with the Father. Hence it is absolutely impossible, that the Son should judge, will, testify, or teach any thing without the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:30">John 5:30</span>, etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:38">John 6:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:16">John 7:16</span>; or that he should be known or believed on, separately from the Father. And he here defends his doing good every day, without intermission, by the example of his Father, from which he cannot depart: these doth the Son likewise - All these, and only these; seeing he and the Father are one.</p>
