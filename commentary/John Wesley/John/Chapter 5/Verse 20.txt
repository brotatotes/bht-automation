<p><em>The Father showeth him all things that himself doth</em> — A proof of the most intimate unity.</p>
<p><em>And he will show him</em> — By doing them. At the same time (not at different times) the Father showeth and doth, and the Son seeth and doth.</p>
<p><em>Greater works</em> — Jesus oftener terms them works, than signs or wonders, because they were not wonders in his eyes.</p>
<p><em>Ye will marvel</em> — So they did, when he raised Lazarus.</p>
