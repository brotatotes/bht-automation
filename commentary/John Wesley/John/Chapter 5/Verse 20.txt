The Father showeth him all things that himself doth — A proof of the most intimate unity.And he will show him — By doing them. At the same time (not at different times) the Father showeth and doth, and the Son seeth and doth.Greater works — Jesus oftener terms them works, than signs or wonders, because they were not wonders in his eyes.Ye will marvel — So they did, when he raised Lazarus.
