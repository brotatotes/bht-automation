That all men may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father — Either willingly, and so escaping condemnation, by faith: or unwillingly, when feeling the wrath of the Judge. This demonstrates the EQUALITY of the Son with the Father. If our Lord were God only by office or investiture, and not in the unity of the Divine essence, and in all respects equal in Godhead with the Father, he could not be honoured even as, that is, with the same honour that they honoured the Father.He that honoureth not the Son — With the same equal honour, greatly dishonoureth the Father that sent him.
