<p><em>Labour not for the meat which perisheth</em> — For bodily food: not for that only not chiefly: not at all, but in subordination to grace, faith, love, the meat which endureth to everlasting life. Labour, work for this; for everlasting life. So our Lord expressly commands, work for life, as well as from life: from a principle of faith and love.</p>
<p><em>Him hath the Father sealed</em> — By this very miracle, as well as by his whole testimony concerning him. See <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:33">John 3:33</span>. Sealing is a mark of the authenticity of a writing.</p>
