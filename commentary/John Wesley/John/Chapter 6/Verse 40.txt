<p>Here is the sum of the three foregoing verses.</p>
<p><em>This is the will of him that sent me</em> — This is the whole of what I have said: this is the eternal, unchangeable will of God. Every one who truly believeth, shall have everlasting life.</p>
<p><em>Every one that seeth and believeth</em> — The Jews saw, and yet believed not.</p>
<p><em>And I will raise him up</em> — As this is the will of him that sent me, I will perform it effectually.</p>
