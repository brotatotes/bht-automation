Here is the sum of the three foregoing verses.This is the will of him that sent me — This is the whole of what I have said: this is the eternal, unchangeable will of God. Every one who truly believeth, shall have everlasting life.Every one that seeth and believeth — The Jews saw, and yet believed not.And I will raise him up — As this is the will of him that sent me, I will perform it effectually.
