Christ having checked their murmuring, continues what he was saying, John 6:40.No man comes to me, unless my Father draw him â€” No man can believe in Christ, unless God give him power: he draws us first, by good desires. Not by compulsion, not by laying the will under any necessity; but by the strong and sweet, yet still resistible, motions of his heavenly grace.
