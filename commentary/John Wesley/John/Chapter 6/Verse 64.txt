But there are some of you who believe not — And so receive no life by them, because you take them in a gross literal sense.For Jesus knew from the beginning — Of his ministry: who would betray him - Therefore it is plain, God does foresee future contingencies: - "But his foreknowledge causes not the fault, Which had no less proved certain unforeknown."
