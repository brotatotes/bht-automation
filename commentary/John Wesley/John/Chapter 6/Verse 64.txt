<p><em>But there are some of you who believe not</em> — And so receive no life by them, because you take them in a gross literal sense.</p>
<p><em>For Jesus knew from the beginning</em> — Of his ministry: who would betray him - Therefore it is plain, God does foresee future contingencies: - "But his foreknowledge causes not the fault, Which had no less proved certain unforeknown."</p>
