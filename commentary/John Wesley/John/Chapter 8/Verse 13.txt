<p><em>Thou testifiest of thyself; thy testimony is not valid</em> — They retort upon our Lord his own words, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:31">John 5:31</span>; if I testify of myself, my testimony is not valid. He had then added, There is another who testifieth of me. To the same effect he replies here, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:14">John 8:14</span>, Though I testify of myself, yet my testimony is valid; for I am inseparably united to the Father.</p>
<p><em>I know</em> — And from firm and certain knowledge proceeds the most unexceptionable testimony: whence I came, and whither I go - To these two heads may be referred all the doctrine concerning Christ. The former is treated of <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:16">John 8:16</span>, etc., the latter <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:21">John 8:21</span>, etc.</p>
<p><em>For I know whence I came</em> — That is, For I came from God, both as God and as man. And I know it, though ye do not.</p>
