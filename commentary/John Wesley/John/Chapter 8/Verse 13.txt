Thou testifiest of thyself; thy testimony is not valid — They retort upon our Lord his own words, John 5:31; if I testify of myself, my testimony is not valid. He had then added, There is another who testifieth of me. To the same effect he replies here, John 8:14, Though I testify of myself, yet my testimony is valid; for I am inseparably united to the Father.I know — And from firm and certain knowledge proceeds the most unexceptionable testimony: whence I came, and whither I go - To these two heads may be referred all the doctrine concerning Christ. The former is treated of John 8:16, etc., the latter John 8:21, etc.For I know whence I came — That is, For I came from God, both as God and as man. And I know it, though ye do not.
