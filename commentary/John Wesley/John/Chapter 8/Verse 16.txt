<p><em>I am not alone</em> — No more in judging, than in testifying: but I and the Father that sent me - His Father is in him, and he is in the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:10,11">John 14:10,11</span>; and so the Father is no more alone without the Son, than the Son is without the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="pr+8:22,23,30">Proverbs 8:22,23,30</span>. His Father and he are not one and another God, but one God, (though distinct persons,) and so inseparable from each other. And though the Son came from the Father, to assume human nature, and perform his office as the Messiah upon earth, as God is sometimes said to come from heaven, for particular manifestations of himself; yet Christ did not leave the Father, nor the Father leave him, any more than God leaves heaven when he is said to come down to the earth.</p>
