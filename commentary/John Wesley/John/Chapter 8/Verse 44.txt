He was a murderer — In inclination, from the beginning - Of his becoming a devil; and abode not in the truth - Commencing murderer and liar at the same time. And certainly he was a killer of men (as the Greek word properly signifies) from the beginning of the world: for from the very creation he designed and contrived the ruin of men.When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own — For he is the proper parent, and, as it were, creator of it. See the origin not only of lies, but of evil in general!
