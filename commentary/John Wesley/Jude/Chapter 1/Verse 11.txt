<p><em>Woe unto them</em> — Of all the apostles St. Jude alone, and that in this single place, denounces a woe. St. Peter, to the same effect, pronounces them "cursed children." For they have gone in the way of Cain - The murderer.</p>
<p><em>And ran greedily</em> — Literally, have been poured out, like a torrent without banks.</p>
<p><em>After the error of Balaam</em> — The covetous false prophet.</p>
<p><em>And perished in the gainsaying of Korah</em> — Vengeance has overtaken them as it did Korah, rising up against those whom God had sent.</p>
