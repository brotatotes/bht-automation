Woe unto them — Of all the apostles St. Jude alone, and that in this single place, denounces a woe. St. Peter, to the same effect, pronounces them "cursed children." For they have gone in the way of Cain - The murderer.And ran greedily — Literally, have been poured out, like a torrent without banks.After the error of Balaam — The covetous false prophet.And perished in the gainsaying of Korah — Vengeance has overtaken them as it did Korah, rising up against those whom God had sent.
