<p><em>These are spots</em> — Blemishes.</p>
<p><em>In your feasts of love</em> — Anciently observed in all the churches.</p>
<p><em>Feeding themselves without fear</em> — Without any fear of God, or jealousy over themselves.</p>
<p><em>Twice dead</em> — In sin, first by nature, and afterwards by apostasy.</p>
<p><em>Plucked up by the roots</em> — And so incapable of ever reviving.</p>
