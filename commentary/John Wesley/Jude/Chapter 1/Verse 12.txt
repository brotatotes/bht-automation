These are spots — Blemishes.In your feasts of love — Anciently observed in all the churches.Feeding themselves without fear — Without any fear of God, or jealousy over themselves.Twice dead — In sin, first by nature, and afterwards by apostasy.Plucked up by the roots — And so incapable of ever reviving.
