<p>Meantime watch over others, as well as yourselves, and give them such help as their various needs require. For instance, 1. Some, that are wavering in judgment, staggered by others' or by their own evil reasoning, endeavour more deeply to convince of the whole truth as it is in Jesus2. Some snatch, with a swift and strong hand, out of the fire of sin and temptation3. On others show compassion in a milder and gentler way; though still with a jealous fear, lest yourselves be infected with the disease you endeavour to cure. See, therefore, that while you love the sinners, ye retain the utmost abhorrence of their sins, and of any the least degree of, or approach to, them.</p>
