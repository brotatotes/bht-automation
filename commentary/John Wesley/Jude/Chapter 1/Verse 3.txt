<p><em>When I gave all diligence to write to you of the common salvation</em> — Designed for all, and enjoyed by all believers. Here the design of the epistle is expressed; the end of which exactly answers the beginning.</p>
<p><em>It was needful to exhort you to contend earnestly</em> — Yet humbly, meekly, and lovingly; otherwise your contention will only hurt your cause, if not destroy your soul.</p>
<p><em>For the faith</em> — All the fundamental truths.</p>
<p><em>Once delivered</em> — By God, to remain unvaried for ever.</p>
