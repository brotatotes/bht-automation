When I gave all diligence to write to you of the common salvation — Designed for all, and enjoyed by all believers. Here the design of the epistle is expressed; the end of which exactly answers the beginning.It was needful to exhort you to contend earnestly — Yet humbly, meekly, and lovingly; otherwise your contention will only hurt your cause, if not destroy your soul.For the faith — All the fundamental truths.Once delivered — By God, to remain unvaried for ever.
