And the angels, who kept not their first dignity — Once assigned them under the Son of God. But voluntarily left their own habitation - Then properly their own, by the free gift of God.He reserved — Delivered to be kept.In everlasting chains under darkness — O how unlike their own habitation! When these fallen angels came out of the hands of God, they were holy; else God made that which was evil: and being holy, they were beloved of God; else he hated the image of his own spotless purity. But now he loves them no more; they are doomed to endless destruction. (for if he loved them still, he would love what is sinful:) and both his former love, and his present righteous and eternal displeasure towards the same work of his own hands, are because he changeth not; because he invariably loveth righteousness, and hateth iniquity2Peter2:4.
