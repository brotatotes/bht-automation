<p><em>I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God</em> â€” Seven angels thus stand before God, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+7:2">Revelation 7:2</span>; who seem the highest of all. There seems to be a remarkable gradation in the words, enhancing the guilt of Zacharias's unbelief. As if he had said, I am Gabriel, a holy angel of God: yea, one of the highest order. Not only so, but am now peculiarly sent from God; and that with a message to thee in particular. Nay, and to show thee glad tidings, such as ought to be received with the greatest joy and readiness.</p>
