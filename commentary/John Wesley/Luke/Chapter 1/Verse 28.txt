<p><em>Hail, thou highly favoured; the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women</em> â€” Hail is the salutation used by our Lord to the women after his resurrection: thou art highly favoured, or hast found favour with God, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:30">Luke 1:30</span>, is no more than was said of Noah, Moses, and David. The Lord is with thee, was said to Gideon, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="jud+6:12">Judges 6:12</span>; and blessed shall she be above women, of Jael, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="jud+5:24">Judges 5:24</span>. This salutation gives no room for any pretence of paying adoration to the virgin; as having no appearance of a prayer, or of worship offered to her.</p>
