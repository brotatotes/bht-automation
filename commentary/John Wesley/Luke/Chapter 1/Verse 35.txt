<p><em>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee</em> — The power of God was put forth by the Holy Ghost, as the immediate Divine agent in this work: and so he exerted the power of the Highest as his own power, who together with the Father and the Son is the most high God.</p>
<p><em>Therefore also</em> — Not only as he is God from eternity, but on this account likewise he shall be called the Son of God.</p>
