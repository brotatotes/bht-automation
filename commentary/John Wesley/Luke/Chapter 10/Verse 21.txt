Lord of heaven and earth — In both of which thy kingdom stands, and that of Satan is destroyed.That thou hast hid these things — He rejoiced not in the destruction of the wise and prudent, but in the display of the riches of God's grace to others, in such a manner as reserves to Him the entire glory of our salvation, and hides pride from man. Matthew 11:25.
