Sell what ye have â€” This is a direction, not given to all the multitude: (much less is it a standing rule for all Christians:) neither to the apostles; for they had nothing to sell, having left all before: but to his other disciples, (mentioned Luke 12:22, and Acts 1:15,) especially to the seventy, that they might be free from all worldly entanglements. Matthew 6:19.
