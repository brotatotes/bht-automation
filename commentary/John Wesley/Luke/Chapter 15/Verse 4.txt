Leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness — Where they used to feed: all uncultivated ground, like our commons, was by the Jews termed wilderness or desert.And go after — In recovering a lost soul, God as it were labours. May we not learn hence, that to let them alone who are in sin, is both unchristian and inhuman! Matthew 18:12.
