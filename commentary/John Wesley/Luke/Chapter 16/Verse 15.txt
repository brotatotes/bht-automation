<p><em>And he said to them, Ye are they who justify yourselves before men</em> — The sense of the whole passage is, that pride, wherewith you justify yourselves, feeds covetousness, derides the Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:14">Luke 16:14</span>, and destroys the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:18">Luke 16:18</span>. All which is illustrated by a terrible example.</p>
<p><em>Ye justify yourselves before men</em> — Ye think yourselves righteous, and persuade others to think you so.</p>
