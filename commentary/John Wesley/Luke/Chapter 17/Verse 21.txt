Neither shall they say, Lo here, or lo there — This shall not be the language of those who are, or shall be sent by me, to declare the coming of my kingdom.For behold the kingdom of God is within or among you — Look not for it in distant times or remote places: it is now in the midst of you: it is come: it is present in the soul of every true believer: it is a spiritual kingdom, an internal principle. Wherever it exists, it exists in the heart.
