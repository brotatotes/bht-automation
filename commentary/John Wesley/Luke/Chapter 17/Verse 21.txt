<p><em>Neither shall they say, Lo here, or lo there</em> — This shall not be the language of those who are, or shall be sent by me, to declare the coming of my kingdom.</p>
<p><em>For behold the kingdom of God is within or among you</em> — Look not for it in distant times or remote places: it is now in the midst of you: it is come: it is present in the soul of every true believer: it is a spiritual kingdom, an internal principle. Wherever it exists, it exists in the heart.</p>
