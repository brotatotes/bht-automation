<p><em>I fast twice in the week</em> — So did all the strict Pharisees: every Monday and Thursday.</p>
<p><em>I give tithes of all that I possess</em> — Many of them gave one full tenth of their income in tithes, and another tenth in alms. the sum of this plea is, I do no harm: I use all the means of grace: I do all the good I can.</p>
