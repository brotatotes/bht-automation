<p><em>They shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive</em> — Eleven hundred thousand perished in the siege of Jerusalem, and above ninety thousand were sold for slaves. So terribly was this prophecy fulfilled! And Jerusalem shall be trodden by the Gentiles - That is, inhabited. So it was indeed. The land was sold, and no Jew suffered even to come within sight of Jerusalem. The very foundations of the city were ploughed up, and a heathen temple built where the temple of God had stood.</p>
<p><em>The times of the Gentiles</em> — That is, the times limited for their treading the city; which shall terminate in the full conversion of the Gentiles.</p>
