<p><em>Watch ye therefore</em> — This is the general conclusion of all that precedes.</p>
<p><em>That ye may be counted worthy</em> — This word sometimes signifies an honour conferred on a person, as when the apostles are said to be counted worthy to suffer shame for Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:41">Acts 5:41</span>. Sometimes meet or becoming: as when John the Baptist exhorts, to bring fruits worthy of repentance, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:8">Luke 3:8</span>. And so to be counted worthy to escape, is to have the honour of it, and to be fitted or prepared for it.</p>
<p><em>To stand</em> — With joy and triumph: not to fall before him as his enemies.</p>
