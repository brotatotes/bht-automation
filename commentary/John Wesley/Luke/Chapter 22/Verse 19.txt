<p><em>And he took bread</em> — Namely, some time after, when supper was ended, wherein they had eaten the paschal lamb.</p>
<p><em>This is my body</em> — As he had just now celebrated the paschal supper, which was called the passover, so in like figurative language, he calls this bread his body. And this circumstance of itself was sufficient to prevent any mistake, as if this bread was his real body, any more than the paschal lamb was really the passover.</p>
