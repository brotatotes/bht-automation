<p><em>The hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table</em> â€” It is evident Christ spake these words before he instituted the Lord's Supper: for all the other evangelists mention the sop, immediately after receiving which he went out: <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:30">John 13:30</span>. Nor did he return any more, till he came into the garden to betray his Master. Now this could not be dipped or given, but while the meat was on the table. But this was all removed before that bread and cup were brought.</p>
