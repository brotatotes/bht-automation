The Lord hath appeared to Simon â€” Before he was seen of the twelve apostles, 1 Corinthians 15:5. He had, in his wonderful condescension and grace, taken an opportunity on the former part of that day (though where, or in what manner, is not recorded) to show himself to Peter, that he might early relieve his distresses and fears, on account of having so shamefully denied his Master.
