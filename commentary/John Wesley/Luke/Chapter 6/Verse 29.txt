To him that smiteth thee on the cheek — Taketh away thy cloak - These seem to be proverbial expressions, to signify an invasion of the tenderest points of honour and property.Offer the other — Forbid not thy coat - That is, rather yield to his repeating the affront or injury, than gratify resentment in righting your self; in any method not becoming Christian love. Matthew 5:39.
