<p>See thou say nothing to any man|-But our blessed Lord gives no such charge to us. If he has made us clean from our leprosy of sin, we are not commanded to conceal it. On the contrary, it is our duty to publish it abroad, both for the honour of our Benefactor, and that others who are sick of sin may be encouraged to ask and hope for the same benefit.</p>
<p><em>But go, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses commanded for a testimony to them</em> â€” The priests seeing him, pronouncing him clean, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="le+13:17,23,28,37">Leviticus 13:17,23,28,37</span>, and accordingly allowing him to offer as Moses commanded, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="le+14:2,7">Leviticus 14:2,7</span>, was such a proof against them, that they durst never say the leper was not cleansed; which out of envy or malice against our Saviour they might have been ready to say, upon his presenting himself to be viewed, according to the law, if by the cleansed person's talking much about his cure, the account of it had reached their ears before he came in person. This is one great reason why our Lord commanded this man to say nothing.</p>
