They were in the way to Jerusalem, and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed â€” At his courage and intrepidity, considering the treatment which he had himself told them he should meet with there: and as they followed, they were afraid - Both for him and themselves: nevertheless he judged it best to prepare them, by telling them more particularly what was to ensue. Matthew 20:17; Luke 18:31.
