<p><em>The Lord our God is one Lord</em> â€” This is the foundation of the first commandment, yea, of all the commandments. The Lord our God, the Lord, the God of all men, is one God, essentially, though three persons. From this unity of God it follows, that we owe all our love to him alone. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="de+6:4">Deuteronomy 6:4</span>.</p>
