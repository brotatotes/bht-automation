<p><em>This night</em> â€” The Jews in reckoning their days began with the evening, according to the Mosaic computation, which called the evening and the morning the first day, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:5">Genesis 1:5</span>. And so that which after sunset is here called this night is, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:30">Mark 14:30</span>, called to-day. The expression there is peculiarly significant. Verily I say to thee, that thou thyself, confident as thou art, to-day, even within four and twenty hours; yea, this night, or ever the sun be risen, nay, before the cock crow twice, before three in the morning, wilt deny me thrice. Our Lord doubtless spoke so determinately, as knowing a cock would crow once before the usual time of cock crowing. By <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:35">Mark 13:35</span>, it appears, that the third watch of the night, ending at three in the morning, was commonly styled the cock crowing. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:7">Zechariah 13:7</span>.</p>
