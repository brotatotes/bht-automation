Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature â€” Our Lord speaks without any limitation or restriction. If therefore every creature in every age hath not heard it, either those who should have preached, or those who should have heard it, or both, made void the counsel of God herein. Matthew 28:19.
