<p><em>And these signs shall follow them that believe</em> — An eminent author sub-joins, "That believe with that very faith mentioned in the preceding verse." (Though it is certain that a man may work miracles, and not have saving faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:22,23">Matthew 7:22,23</span>.) "It was not one faith by which St. Paul was saved, another by which he wrought miracles. Even at this day in every believer faith has a latent miraculous power; (every effect of prayer being really miraculous;) although in many, both because of their own littleness of faith, and because the world is unworthy, that power is not exerted. Miracles, in the beginning, were helps to faith; now also they are the object of it. At Leonberg, in the memory of our fathers, a cripple that could hardly move with crutches, while the dean was preaching on this very text, was in a moment made whole." Shall follow - The word and faith must go before.</p>
<p><em>In my name</em> — By my authority committed to them. Raising the dead is not mentioned. So our Lord performed even more than he promised.</p>
