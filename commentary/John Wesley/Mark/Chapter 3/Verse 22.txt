<p>The scribes and Pharisees, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:22">Matthew 12:22</span>; who had come down from Jerusalem - Purposely on the devil's errand. And not without success. For the common people now began to drink in the poison, from these learned, good, honourable men! He hath Beelzebub - at command, is in league with him: And by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils - How easily may a man of learning elude the strongest proof of a work of God! How readily can he account for every incident without ever taking God into the question. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:24">Matthew 12:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:15">Luke 11:15</span>.</p>
