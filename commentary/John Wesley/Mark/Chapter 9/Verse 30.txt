They passed through Galilee — Though not through the cities, but by them, in the most private ways.He was not willing that any should know it: for he taught his disciples — He wanted to be alone with them some time, in order to instruct them fully concerning his sufferings.The Son of man is delivered — It is as sure as if it were done already. Matthew 17:22; Luke 9:44.
