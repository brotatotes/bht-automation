<p><em>Where their worm</em> â€” That gnaweth the soul, (pride, self will, desire, malice, envy, shame, sorrow, despair,) dieth not - No more than the soul itself: and the fire (either material, or infinitely worse!) that tormenteth the body, is not quenched for ever. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:24">Isaiah 66:24</span>.</p>
