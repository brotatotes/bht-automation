<p><em>They shall call his name Emmanuel</em> — To be called, only means, according to the Hebrew manner of speaking, that the person spoken of shall really and effectually be what he is called, and actually fulfil that title. Thus, Unto us a child is born - and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Prince of Peace - That is, he shall be all these, though not so much nominally, as really, and in effect. And thus was he called Emmanuel; which was no common name of Christ, but points out his nature and office; as he is God incarnate, and dwells by his Spirit in the hearts of his people. It is observable, the words in Isaiah are, Thou (namely, his mother) shalt call; but here, They - that is, all his people, shall call - shall acknowledge him to be Emmanuel, God with us.</p>
<p><em>Which being interpreted</em> — This is a clear proof that St. Matthew wrote his Gospel in Greek, and not in Hebrew. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+7:14">Isaiah 7:14</span>.</p>
