<p><em>He knew her not, till after she had brought forth</em> â€” It cannot be inferred from hence, that he knew her afterward: no more than it can be inferred from that expression, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="2sa+6:23">2 Samuel 6:23</span>, Michal had no child till the day of her death, that she had children afterward. Nor do the words that follow, the first-born son, alter the case. For there are abundance of places, wherein the term first born is used, though there were no subsequent children. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:7">Luke 2:7</span>.</p>
