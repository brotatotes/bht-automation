<p><em>He that findeth his life shall lose it</em> â€” He that saves his life by denying me, shall lose it eternally; and he that loseth his life by confessing me, shall save it eternally. And as you shall be thus rewarded, so in proportion shall they who entertain you for my sake. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:25">Matthew 16:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:25">John 12:25</span>.</p>
