These twelve Jesus sent forth — Herein exercising his supreme authority, as God over all. None but God can give men authority to preach his word.Go not — Their commission was thus confined now, because the calling of the Gentiles was deferred till after the more plentiful effusion of the Holy Ghost on the day of pentecost.Enter not — Not to preach; but they might to buy what they wanted, John 4:9.
