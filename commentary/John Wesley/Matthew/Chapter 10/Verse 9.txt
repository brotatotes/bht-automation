Provide not â€” The stress seems to lie on this word: they might use what they had ready; but they might not stay a moment to provide any thing more, neither take any thought about it. Nor indeed were they to take any thing with them, more than was strictly necessary1. Lest it should retard them2. Because they were to learn hereby to trust to God in all future exigencies.
