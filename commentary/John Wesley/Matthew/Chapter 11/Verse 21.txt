<p><em>Wo to thee, Chorazin</em> — That is, miserable art thou. For these are not curses or imprecations, as has been commonly supposed; but a solemn, compassionate declaration of the misery they were bringing on themselves. Chorazin and Bethsaida were cities of Galilee, standing by the lake Gennesareth. Tyre and Sidon were cities of Phenicia, lying on the sea shore. The inhabitants of them were heathens. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:13">Luke 10:13</span>22,24.</p>
<p><em>Moreover I say unto you</em> — Beside the general denunciation of wo to those stubborn unbelievers, the degree of their misery will be greater than even that of Tyre and Sidon, yea, of Sodom.</p>
