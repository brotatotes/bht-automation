<p><em>Take my yoke upon you</em> — Believe in me: receive me as your prophet, priest, and king.</p>
<p><em>For I am meek and lowly in heart</em> — Meek toward all men, lowly toward God: and ye shall find rest - Whoever therefore does not find rest of soul, is not meek and lowly. The fault is not in the yoke of Christ: but in thee, who hast not taken it upon thee. Nor is it possible for any one to be discontented, but through want of meekness or lowliness.</p>
