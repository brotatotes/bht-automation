<p><em>Either make the tree good and its fruit good: or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt</em> — That is, you must allow, they are both good, or both bad. - For if the fruit is good, so is the tree; if the fruit is evil, so is the tree also.</p>
<p><em>For the tree is known by its fruit</em> — As if he had said, Ye may therefore know me by my fruits. By my converting sinners to God, you may know that God hath sent me. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:16">Matthew 7:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:43">Luke 6:43</span>.</p>
