Either make the tree good and its fruit good: or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt — That is, you must allow, they are both good, or both bad. - For if the fruit is good, so is the tree; if the fruit is evil, so is the tree also.For the tree is known by its fruit — As if he had said, Ye may therefore know me by my fruits. By my converting sinners to God, you may know that God hath sent me. Matthew 7:16; Luke 6:43.
