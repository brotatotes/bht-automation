<p>Ye may perhaps think, God does not so much regard your words.</p>
<p><em>But I say to you</em> — That not for blasphemous and profane words only, but for every idle word which men shall speak - For want of seriousness or caution; for every discourse which is not conducive to the glory of God, they shall give account in the day of judgment.</p>
