<p><em>Three days and three nights</em> â€” It was customary with the eastern nations to reckon any part of a natural day of twenty-four hours, for the whole day. Accordingly they used to say a thing was done after three or seven days, if it was done on the third or seventh day, from that which was last mentioned. Instances of this may be seen, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1ki+20:29">1 Kings 20:29</span>; and in many other places. And as the Hebrews had no word to express a natural day, they used night and day, or day and night for it. So that to say a thing happened after three days and three nights, was with them the very same, as to say, it happened after three days, or on the third day. See <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="es+4:16">Esther 4:16</span>; 5:1; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ge+7:4,12">Genesis 7:4,12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:18">Exodus 24:18</span>; 34:28. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="jon+2:1">Jonah 2:1</span>.</p>
