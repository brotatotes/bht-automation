<p><em>Whosoever hath</em> — That is, improves what he hath, uses the grace given according to the design of the giver; to him shall be given - More and more, in proportion to that improvement.</p>
<p><em>But whosoever hath not</em> — Improves it not, from him shall be taken even what he hath - Here is the grand rule of God's dealing with the children of men: a rule fixed as the pillars of heaven. This is the key to all his providential dispensations; as will appear to men and angels in that day. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:29">Matthew 25:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:25">Mark 4:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:18">Luke 8:18</span>; 19:26.</p>
