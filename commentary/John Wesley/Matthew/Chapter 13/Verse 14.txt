<p><em>Hearing ye will hear, but in nowise understand</em> â€” That is, Ye will surely hear. All possible means will be given you: yet they will profit you nothing; because your heart is sensual, stupid, and insensible; your spiritual senses are shut up; yea, you have closed your eyes against the light; as being unwilling to understand the things of God, and afraid, not desirous that he should heal you. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:9">Isaiah 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:40">John 12:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:26">Acts 28:26</span>.</p>
