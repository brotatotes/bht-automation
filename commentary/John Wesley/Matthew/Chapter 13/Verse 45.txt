<p><em>The kingdom of heaven</em> â€” That is, one who earnestly seeks for it: in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:47">Matthew 13:47</span> it means, the Gospel preached, which is like a net gathering of every kind: just so the Gospel, wherever it is preached, gathers at first both good and bad, who are for a season full of approbation and warm with good desires. But Christian discipline, and strong, close exhortation, begin that separation in this world, which shall be accomplished by the angels of God in the world to come.</p>
