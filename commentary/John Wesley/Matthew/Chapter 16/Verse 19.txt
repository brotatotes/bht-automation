<p><em>I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven</em> â€” Indeed not to him alone, (for they were equally given to all the apostles at the same time, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:21,22,23">John 20:21,22,23</span>;) but to him were first given the keys both of doctrine and discipline. He first, after our Lord's resurrection, exercised the apostleship, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15">Acts 1:15</span>. And he first by preaching opened the kingdom of heaven, both to the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:14">Acts 2:14</span> etc., and to the Gentiles, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:34">Acts 10:34</span> etc. Under the term of binding and loosing are contained all those acts of discipline which Peter and his brethren performed as apostles: and undoubtedly what they thus performed on earth, God confirmed in heaven. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:18">Matthew 18:18</span>.</p>
