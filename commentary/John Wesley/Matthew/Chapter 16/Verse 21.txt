<p><em>From that time Jesus began to tell his disciples, that he must suffer many things</em> — Perhaps this expression, began, always implied his entering on a set and solemn discourse. Hitherto he had mainly taught them only one point, That he was the Christ. From this time he taught them another, That Christ must through sufferings and death enter into his glory.</p>
<p><em>From the elders</em> — The most honourable and experienced men; the chief priests - Accounted the most religious; and the scribes - The most learned body of men in the nation. Would not one have expected, that these should have been the very first to receive him? But not many wise, not many noble were called.</p>
<p><em>Favour thyself</em> — The advice of the world, the flesh, and the devil, to every one of our Lord's followers. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:31">Mark 8:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:22">Luke 9:22</span>.</p>
