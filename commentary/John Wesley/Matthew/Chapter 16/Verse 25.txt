<p><em>Whosoever will save his life</em> â€” At the expense of his conscience: whosoever, in the very highest instance, that of life itself, will not renounce himself, shall be lost eternally. But can any man hope he should be able thus to renounce himself, if he cannot do it in the smallest instances? And whosoever will lose his life shall find it - What he loses on earth he shall find in heaven. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:39">Matthew 10:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:35">Mark 8:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:24">Luke 9:24</span>; 17:33; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:25">John 12:25</span>.</p>
