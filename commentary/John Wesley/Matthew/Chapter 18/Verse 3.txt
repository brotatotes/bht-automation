<p><em>Except ye be converted</em> — The first step toward entering into the kingdom of grace, is to become as little children: lowly in heart, knowing yourselves utterly ignorant and helpless, and hanging wholly on your Father who is in heaven, for a supply of all your wants. We may farther assert, (though it is doubtful whether this text implies so much,) except ye be turned from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God:, except ye be entirely, inwardly changed, renewed in the image of God, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of glory. Thus must every man be converted in this life, or he can never enter into life eternal.</p>
<p><em>Ye shall in no wise enter</em> — So far from being great in it. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:14">Matthew 19:14</span>5,6. And all who are in this sense little children are unspeakably dear to me. Therefore help them all you can, as if it were myself in person, and see that ye offend them not; that is, that ye turn them not out of the right way, neither hinder them in it. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:40">Matthew 10:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:16">Luke 10:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:20">John 13:20</span>.</p>
