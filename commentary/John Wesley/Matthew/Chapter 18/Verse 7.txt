<p><em>Wo to the world because of offences</em> — That is, unspeakable misery will be in the world through them; for it must needs be that offences come - Such is the nature of things, and such the weakness, folly, and wickedness of mankind, that it cannot be but they will come; but wo to that man - That is, miserable is that man, by whom the offence cometh. Offences are, all things whereby any one is turned out of, or hindered in the way of God8,9.</p>
<p><em>If thy hand, foot, eye, cause thee to offend</em> — If the most dear enjoyment, the most beloved and useful person, turn thee out of, or hinder thee in the way Is not this a hard saying? Yes; if thou take counsel with flesh and blood. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29">Matthew 5:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:43">Mark 9:43</span>.</p>
