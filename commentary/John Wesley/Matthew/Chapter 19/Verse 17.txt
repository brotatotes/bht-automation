<p><em>Why callest thou me good</em> — Whom thou supposest to be only a man.</p>
<p><em>There is none good</em> — Supremely, originally, essentially, but God.</p>
<p><em>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments</em> — From a principle of loving faith. Believe, and thence love and obey. And this undoubtedly is the way to eternal life. Our Lord therefore does not answer ironically, which had been utterly beneath his character, but gives a plain, direct, serious answer to a serious question.</p>
