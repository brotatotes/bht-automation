<p><em>If thou desirest to be perfect</em> — That is, to be a real Christian: Sell what thou hast - He who reads the heart saw his bosom sin was love of the world; and knew he could not be saved from this, but by literally renouncing it. To him therefore he gave this particular direction, which he never designed for a general rule. For him that was necessary to salvation: to us it is not. To sell all was an absolute duty to him; to many of us it would be ali absolute sin.</p>
<p><em>The young man went away</em> — Not being willing to have salvation at so high a price.</p>
