<p><em>In the renovation</em> â€” In the final renovation of all things: Ye shall sit - In the beginning of the judgment they shall stand, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span>. Then being absolved, they shall sit with the Judge, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:2">1 Corinthians 6:2</span>: On twelve thrones - So our Lord promised, without expressing any condition: yet as absolute as the words are, it is certain there is a condition implied, as in many scriptures, where none is expressed. In consequence of this, those twelve did not sit on those twelve thrones: for the throne of Judas another took, so that he never sat thereon.</p>
