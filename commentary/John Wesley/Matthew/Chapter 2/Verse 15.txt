That it might be fulfilled — That is, whereby was fulfilled. The original word frequently signifies, not the design of an action, but barely the consequence or event of it.Which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet — on another occasion: Out of Egypt have I called my Son - which was now fulfilled as it were anew; Christ being in a far higher sense the Son of God than Israel, of whom the words were originally spoken. Hosea 11:1.
