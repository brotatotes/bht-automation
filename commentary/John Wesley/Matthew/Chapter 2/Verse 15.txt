<p><em>That it might be fulfilled</em> — That is, whereby was fulfilled. The original word frequently signifies, not the design of an action, but barely the consequence or event of it.</p>
<p><em>Which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet</em> — on another occasion: Out of Egypt have I called my Son - which was now fulfilled as it were anew; Christ being in a far higher sense the Son of God than Israel, of whom the words were originally spoken. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ho+11:1">Hosea 11:1</span>.</p>
