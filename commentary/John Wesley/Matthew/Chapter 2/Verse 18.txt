<p><em>Rachel weeping for her children</em> — The Benjamites, who inhabited Rama, sprung from her. She was buried near this place; and is here beautifully represented risen, as it were out of her grave, and bewailing her lost children.</p>
<p><em>Because they are not</em> — that is, are dead. The preservation of Jesus from this destruction, may be considered as a figure of God's care over his children in their greatest danger. God does not often, as he easily could, cut off their persecutors at a stroke. But he provides a hiding place for his people, and by methods not less effectual, though less pompous, preserves them from being swept away, even when the enemy comes in like a flood. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:15">Jeremiah 31:15</span>.</p>
