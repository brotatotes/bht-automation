<p><em>Thou hast made them equal to us</em> â€” So St. Peter expressly, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:9">Acts 15:9</span>. God-hath put no difference between us (Jews) and them, (Gentiles,) purifying their hearts by faith. And those who were equally holy here, whenever they were called, will be equally happy hereafter.</p>
