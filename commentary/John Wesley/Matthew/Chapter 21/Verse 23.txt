<p><em>When he was come into the temple, the chief priests came</em> — Who thought he violated their right: and the elders of the people - Probably, members of the sanhedrim, to whom that title most properly belonged: which is the more probable, as they were the persons under whose cognizance the late action of Christ, in purging the temple, would naturally fall. These, with the chief priests, seem purposely to have appeared in a considerable company, to give the more weight to what they said, and if need were, to bear a united testimony against him.</p>
<p><em>As he was teaching</em> — Which also they supposed he had no authority to do, being neither priest, nor Levite, nor scribe. Some of the priests (though not as priests) and all the scribes were authorized teachers.</p>
<p><em>By what authority dost thou these things</em> — Publicly teach the people! And drive out those who had our commission to traffic in the outer court? <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:1">Luke 20:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:27">Mark 11:27</span>.</p>
