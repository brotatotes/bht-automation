<p><em>John came in a way of righteousness</em> — Walking in it, as well as teaching it.</p>
<p><em>The publicans and harlots</em> — The most notorious sinners were reformed, though at first they said, I will not. And ye seeing the amazing change which was wrought in them, though at first ye said, I go, sir, repented not afterward - Were no more convinced than before. O how is this scripture fulfilled at this day!</p>
