<p><em>A certain householder planted a vineyard</em> â€” God planted the Church in Canaan; and hedged it round about - First with the law, then with his peculiar providence: and digged a wine press - Perhaps it may mean Jerusalem: and built a tower - The temple: and went into a far country - That is, left the keepers of his vineyard, in some measure, to behave as they should see good. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:1">Mark 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:9">Luke 20:9</span>.</p>
