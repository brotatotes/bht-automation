The builders — The scribes and priests, whose office it was to build up the Church.Is become the head of the corner — Or the chief corner stone: he is become the foundation of the Church, on which the whole building rests, and is the principal corner stone, for uniting the Gentiles to it, as the chief corner stone of a house supports and links its two sides together. Psalm 118:22.
