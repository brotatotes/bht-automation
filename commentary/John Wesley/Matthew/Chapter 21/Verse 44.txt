<p><em>Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken</em> — Stumblers at Christ shall even then receive much hurt. He is said to fall on this stone, who hears the Gospel and does not believe.</p>
<p><em>But on whomsoever it shall fall</em> — In vengeance, it will utterly destroy him. It will fall on every unbeliever, when Christ cometh in the clouds of heaven. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:18">Luke 20:18</span>.</p>
