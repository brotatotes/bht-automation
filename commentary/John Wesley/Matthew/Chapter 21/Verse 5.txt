<p><em>The daughter of Sion</em> — That is, the inhabitants of Jerusalem: the first words of the passage are cited from <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+62:11">Isaiah 62:11</span>; the rest from <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:9">Zechariah 9:9</span>. The ancient Jewish doctors were wont to apply these prophecies to the Messiah.</p>
<p><em>On an ass</em> — The Prince of Peace did not take a horse, a warlike animal. But he will ride on that by and by, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+19:11">Revelation 19:11</span>. In the patriarchal ages, illustrious persons thought it no disgrace to make use of this animal: but it by no means appears, that this opinion prevailed, or this custom continued, till the reign of Tiberias. Was it a mean attitude wherein our Lord then appeared? Mean even to contempt! I grant it: I glory in it: it is for the comfort of my soul for the honour of his humility, and for the utter confusion of all worldly pomp and grandeur.</p>
