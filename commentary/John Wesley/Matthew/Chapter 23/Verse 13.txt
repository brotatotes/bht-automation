<p><em>Wo to you</em> — Our Lord pronounced eight blessings upon the mount: he pronounces eight woes here; not as imprecations, but solemn, compassionate declarations of the misery, which these stubborn sinners were bringing upon themselves.</p>
<p><em>Ye go not in</em> — For ye are not poor in spirit; and ye hinder those that would be so.</p>
