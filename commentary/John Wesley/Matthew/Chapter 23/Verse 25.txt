<p><em>Full of rapine and intemperance</em> â€” The censure is double (taking intemperance in the vulgar sense.) These miserable men procured unjustly what they used intemperately.

But intemperance in the full sense takes in not only all kinds of outward intemperance, particularly in eating and drinking, but all intemperate or immoderate desires, whether of honour, gain, or sensual pleasure.</p>
