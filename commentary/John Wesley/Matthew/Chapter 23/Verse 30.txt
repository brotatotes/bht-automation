We would not have been partakers — So ye make fair professions, as did your fathers. 31.Wherefore ye testify against yourselves — By your smooth words as well as devilish actions: that ye are the genuine sons of them who killed the prophets of their own times, while they professed the utmost veneration for those of past ages. From the3d to the30th verse Matthew 23:3-30 is exposed every thing that commonly passes in the world for religion, whereby the pretenders to it keep both themselves and others from entering into the kingdom of God; from attaining, or even seeking after those tempers, in which alone true Christianity consists. As, 1. Punctuality in attending on public and private prayer, verse4-14. Matthew 23:4-142. Zeal to make proselytes to our opinion or communion, though they have less of the spirit of religion than before, verse15. Matthew 23:153. A superstitious reverence for consecrated places or things, without any for Him to whom they are consecrated, verse16-22. Matthew 23:16-224. A scrupulous exactness in little observances, though with the neglect of justice, mercy, and faith, verse23,24. Matthew 23:23,245. A nice cautiousness to cleanse the outward behaviour, but without any regard to inward purity, verse25,26. Matthew 23:25,266. A specious face of virtue and piety, covering the deepest hypocrisy and villany, verse27,28. Matthew 23:27,287. A professed veneration for all good men, except those among whom they live.
