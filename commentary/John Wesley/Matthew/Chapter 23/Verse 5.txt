<p><em>Their phylacteries</em> — The Jews, understanding those words literally, It shall he as a token upon thy hand, and as frontlets between thine eyes, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:16">Exodus 13:16</span>. And thou shalt bind these words for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="de+6:8">Deuteronomy 6:8</span>; used to wear little scrolls of paper or parchment, bound on their wrist and foreheads, on which several texts of Scripture were writ. These they supposed, as a kind of charm, would preserve them from danger. And hence they seem to have been called phylacteries, or preservatives.</p>
<p><em>The fringes of their garments</em> — Which God had enjoined them to wear, to remind them of doing all the commandments, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="nu+15:38">Numbers 15:38</span>. These, as well as their phylacteries, the Pharisees affected to wear broader and larger than other men. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:38">Mark 12:38</span>8,9,10. The Jewish rabbis were also called father and master, by their several disciples, whom they required, 1. To believe implicitly what they affirmed, without asking any farther reason; 2. To obey implicitly what they enjoined, without seeking farther authority. Our Lord, therefore, by forbidding us either to give or receive the title of rabbi, master, or father, forbids us either to receive any such reverence, or to pay any such to any but God.</p>
