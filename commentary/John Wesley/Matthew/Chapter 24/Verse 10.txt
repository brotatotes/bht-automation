<p><em>Then shall many he offended</em> — So as utterly to make shipwreck of faith and a pure conscience. But hold ye fast faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:11">Matthew 24:11</span>. in spite of false prophets: love, even when iniquity and offences abound, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:12">Matthew 24:12</span>. And hope, unto the end, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:13">Matthew 24:13</span>. He that does so, shall be snatched out of the burning.</p>
<p><em>The love of many will wax cold</em> — The generality of those who love God will (like the Church at Ephesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+2:4">Revelation 2:4</span>,) leave their first love.</p>
