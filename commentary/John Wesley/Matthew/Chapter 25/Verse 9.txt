<p><em>But the wise answered, Lest there be not enough for us and you!</em> — Beginning the sentence with a beautiful abruptness; such as showed their surprise at the state of those poor wretches, who had so long received them, as well as their own souls.</p>
<p><em>Lest there be not enough</em> — It is sure there is not; for no man has more than holiness enough for himself.</p>
<p><em>Go ye rather to them that sell</em> — Without money and without price: that is, to God, to Christ.</p>
<p><em>And buy</em> — If ye can. O no! The time is past and returns no more!</p>
