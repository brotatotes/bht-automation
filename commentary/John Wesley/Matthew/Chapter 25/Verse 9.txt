But the wise answered, Lest there be not enough for us and you! — Beginning the sentence with a beautiful abruptness; such as showed their surprise at the state of those poor wretches, who had so long received them, as well as their own souls.Lest there be not enough — It is sure there is not; for no man has more than holiness enough for himself.Go ye rather to them that sell — Without money and without price: that is, to God, to Christ.And buy — If ye can. O no! The time is past and returns no more!
