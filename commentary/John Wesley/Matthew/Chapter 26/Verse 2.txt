<p><em>After two days is the passover</em> â€” The manner wherein this was celebrated gives much light to several circumstances that follow. The master of the family began the feast with a cup of wine, which having solemnly blessed, he divided among the guests, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:17">Luke 22:17</span>. Then the supper began with the unleavened bread and bitter herbs; which when they had all tasted, one of the young persons present, according to <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:26">Exodus 12:26</span>, asked the reason of the solemnity. This introduced the showing forth, or declaration of it: in allusion to which we read of showing forth the Lord's death, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:26">1 Corinthians 11:26</span>. Then the master rose up and took another cup, before the lamb was tasted. After supper, he took a thin loaf or cake, which he broke and divided to all at the table, and likewise the cup, usually called the cup of thanksgiving, of which he drank first, and then all the guests. It was this bread and this cup which our Lord consecrated to be a standing memorial of his death.</p>
