<p><em>Jesus took the bread</em> â€” the bread or cake, which the master of the family used to divide among them, after they had eaten the passover. The custom our Lord now transferred to a nobler use. This bread is, that is, signifies or represents my body, according to the style of the sacred writers. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ge+40:12">Genesis 40:12</span>, The three branches are three days. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:24">Galatians 4:24</span>, St. Paul speaking of Sarah and Hagar, says, These are the two covenants. Thus in the grand type of our Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:11">Exodus 12:11</span>, God says of the paschal lamb, This is the Lord's passover. Now Christ substituting the holy communion for the passover, follows the style of the Old Testament, and uses the same expressions the Jews were wont to use in celebrating the passover.</p>
