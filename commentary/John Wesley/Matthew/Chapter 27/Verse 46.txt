<p><em>About the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice</em> — Our Lord's great agony probably continued these three whole hours, at the conclusion of which be thus cried out, while he suffered from God himself what was unutterable.</p>
<p><em>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</em> — Our Lord hereby at once expresses his trust in God, and a most distressing sense of his letting loose the powers of darkness upon him, withdrawing the comfortable discoveries of his presence, and filling his soul with a terrible sense of the wrath due to the sins which he was bearing. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:1">Psalm 22:1</span>.</p>
