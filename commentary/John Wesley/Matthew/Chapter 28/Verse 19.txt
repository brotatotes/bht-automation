<p><em>Disciple all nations</em> â€” Make them my disciples. This includes the whole design of Christ's commission. Baptizing and teaching are the two great branches of that general design. And these were to be determined by the circumstances of things; which made it necessary in baptizing adult Jews or heathens, to teach them before they were baptized; in discipling their children, to baptize them before they were taught; as the Jewish children in all ages were first circumcised, and after taught to do all God had commanded them. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15">Mark 16:15</span>.</p>
