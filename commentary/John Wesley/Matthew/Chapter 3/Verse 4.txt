John had his raiment of camels' hair — Coarse and rough, suiting his character and doctrine.A leathern girdle — Like Elijah, in whose spirit and power he came.His food was locusts and wild honey — Locusts are ranked among clean meats, Leviticus 11:22. But these were not always to be had. So in default of those, he fed on wild honey.
