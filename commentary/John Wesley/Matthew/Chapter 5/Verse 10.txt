<p><em>For righteousness' sake</em> â€” That is, because they have, or follow after, the righteousness here described. He that is truly a righteous man, he that mourns, and he that is pure in heart, yea, all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:12">2 Timothy 3:12</span>. The world will always say, Away with such fellows from the earth. They are made to reprove our thoughts. They are grievous to us even to behold. Their lives are not like other men's; their ways are of another fashion.</p>
