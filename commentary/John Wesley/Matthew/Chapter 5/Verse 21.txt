<p><em>Ye have heard</em> — From the scribes reciting the law; Thou shalt do no murder - And they interpreted this, as all the other commandments, barely of the outward act.</p>
<p><em>The judgement</em> — The Jews had in every city a court of twenty-three men, who could sentence a criminal to be strangled. But the sanhedrim only (the great council which sat at Jerusalem, consisting of seventy-two men,) could sentence to the more terrible death of stoning. That was called the judgment, this the council. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:13">Exodus 20:13</span>.</p>
