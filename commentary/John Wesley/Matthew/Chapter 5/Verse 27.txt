Thou shalt not commit adultery â€” And this, as well as the sixth commandment, the scribes and Pharisees interpreted barely of the outward act. Exodus 20:1429,30. If a person as dear as a right eye, or as useful as a right hand, cause thee thus to offend, though but in heart. Perhaps here may be an instance of a kind of transposition which is frequently found in the sacred writings: so that the29th verse may refer to27,28; and the30th to verse21,22. Matthew 5:29,27,28,30,21,22As if he had said, Part with any thing, however dear to you, or otherwise useful, if you cannot avoid sin while you keep it. Even cut off your right hand, if you are of so passionate a temper, that you cannot otherwise be restrained from hurting your brother. Pull out your eyes, if you can no otherwise be restrained from lusting after women. Matthew 18:8; Mark 9:43.
