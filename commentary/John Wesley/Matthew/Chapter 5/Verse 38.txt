Ye have heard — Our Lord proceeds to enforce such meekness and love on those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake (which he pursues to the end of the chapter) as were utterly unknown to the scribes and Pharisees.It hath been said — In the law, as a direction to judges, in ease of violent and barbarous assaults.An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth — And this has been interpreted, as encouraging bitter and rigorous revenge. Deuteronomy 19:21.
