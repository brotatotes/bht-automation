<p><em>Bless them that curse you</em> â€” Speak all the good you can to and of them, who speak all evil to and of you. Repay love in thought, word, and deed, to those who hate you, and show it both in word and deed. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:27,35">Luke 6:27,35</span>.</p>
