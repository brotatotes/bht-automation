<p><em>Lay not up for yourselves</em> — Our Lord here makes a transition from religious to common actions, and warns us of another snare, the love of money, as inconsistent with purity of intention as the love of praise.</p>
<p><em>Where rust and moth consume</em> — Where all things are perishable and transient. He may likewise have a farther view in these words, even to guard us against making any thing on earth our treasure. For then a thing properly becomes our treasure, when we set our affections upon it. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:33">Luke 12:33</span>.</p>
