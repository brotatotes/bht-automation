And if you serve God, you need be careful for nothing.Therefore take not thought — That is, be not anxiously careful. Beware of worldly cares; for these are as inconsistent with the true service of God as worldly desires.Is not the life more than meat? — And if God give the greater gift, will he deny the smaller? Luke 12:22.
