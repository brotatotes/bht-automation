The strait gate — The holiness described in the foregoing chapters. And this is the narrow way.Wide is the gate, and many there are that go in through it — They need not seek for this; they come to it of course.Many go in through it, because strait is the other gate — Therefore they do not care for it; they like a wider gate. Luke 13:24.
