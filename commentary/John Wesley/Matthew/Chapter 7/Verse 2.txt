<p><em>With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you</em> â€” Awful words! So we may, as it were, choose for ourselves, whether God shall be severe or merciful to us. God and man will favour the candid and benevolent: but they must expect judgment without mercy, who have showed no mercy.</p>
