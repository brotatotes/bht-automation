<p><em>Whereby was fulfilled what was spoken by the Prophet Isaiah</em> â€” He spoke it in a more exalted sense. The evangelist here only alludes to those words, as being capable of this lower meaning also. Such instances are frequent in the sacred writings, and are elegancies rather than imperfections. He fulfilled these words in the highest sense, by bearing our sins in his own body on the tree: in a lower sense, by sympathizing with us in our sorrows, and healing us of the diseases which were the fruit of sin. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:4">Isaiah 53:4</span>.</p>
