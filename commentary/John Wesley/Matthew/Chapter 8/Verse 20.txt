<p><em>The Son of man</em> — The expression is borrowed from <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span>, and is the appellation which Christ generally gives himself: which he seems to do out of humility, as having some relation to his mean appearance in this world.</p>
<p><em>Hath not where to lay his head</em> — Therefore do not follow me from any view of temporal advantage.</p>
