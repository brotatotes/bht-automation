<p>See thou tell no man|-Perhaps our Lord only meant here, Not till thou hast showed thyself to the priest-who was appointed to inquire into the case of leprosy. But many others he commanded, absolutely, to tell none of tho miracles he had wrought upon them. And this he seems to have done, chiefly for one or more of these reasons: 1. To prevent the multitude from thronging him, in the manner related <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:45">Mark 1:45</span>2. To fulfil the prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:1">Isaiah 42:1</span>, that he would not be vain or ostentatious. This reason St. Matthew assigns, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:17">Matthew 12:17</span>, etc3. To avoid the being taken by force and made a king, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:15">John 6:15</span>. And, 4. That he might not enrage the chief priests, scribes, and Pharisees, who were the most bitter against him, any more than was unavoidable, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:20,21">Matthew 16:20,21</span>.</p>
<p><em>For a testimony</em> — That I am the Messiah; to them - The priests, who otherwise might have pleaded want of evidence. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="le+14:2">Leviticus 14:2</span>. 5.</p>
<p><em>There came to him a centurion</em> — A captain of a hundred Roman soldiers. Probably he came a little way toward him, and then went back. He thought himself not worthy to come in person, and therefore spoke the words that follow by his messengers. As it is not unusual in all languages, so in the Hebrew it is peculiarly frequent, to ascribe to a person himself the thing which is done, and the words which are spoken by his order. And accordingly St. Matthew relates as said by the centurion himself, what others said by order from him. An instance of the same kind we have in the case of Zebedee's children. From St. Matthew, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:20">Matthew 20:20</span>, we learn it was their mother that spoke those words, which, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:35,37">Mark 10:35,37</span>, themselves are said to speak; because she was only their mouth. Yet from verse13, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:13">Matthew 8:13</span>, Go thy way home, it appears he at length came in person, probably on hearing that Jesus was nearer to his house than he apprehended when he sent the second message by his friends. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:1">Luke 7:1</span>. </p>
