<p><em>Because they were faint</em> — In soul rather than in body.</p>
<p><em>As sheep having no shepherd</em> — And yet they had many teachers; they had scribes in every city. But they had none who cared for their souls, and none that were able, if they had been willing, to have wrought any deliverance. They had no pastors after God's own heart.</p>
