<p><em>Servants</em> — St. Paul, writing familiarly to the Philippians, does not style himself an apostle. And under the common title of servants, he tenderly and modestly joins with himself his son Timotheus, who had come to Philippi not long after St. Paul had received him, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:3,12">Acts 16:3,12</span>.</p>
<p><em>To all the saints</em> — The apostolic epistles were sent more directly to the churches, than to the pastors of them.</p>
<p><em>With the bishops and deacons</em> — The former properly took care of the internal state, the latter, of the externals, of the church, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2-8">1 Timothy 3:2-8</span>; although these were not wholly confined to the one, neither those to the other. The word bishops here includes all the presbyters at Philippi, as well as the ruling presbyters: the names bishop and presbyter, or elder, being promiscuously used in the first ages.</p>
