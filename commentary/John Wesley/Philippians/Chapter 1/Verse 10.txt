<p><em>That ye may try</em> — By that spiritual sense.</p>
<p><em>The things that are excellent</em> — Not only good, but the very best; the superior excellence of which is hardly discerned, but by the adult Christian. That ye may be inwardly sincere - Having a single eye to the very best things, and a pure heart. And outwardly without offence - Holy, unblamable in all things.</p>
