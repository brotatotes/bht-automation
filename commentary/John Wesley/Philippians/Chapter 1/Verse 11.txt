<p><em>Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God</em> â€” Here are three properties of that sincerity which is acceptable to God: 1. It must bear fruits, the fruits of righteousness, all inward and outward holiness, all good tempers, words, and works; and that so abundantly, that we may be filled with them2. The branch and the fruits must derive both their virtue and their very being from the all - supporting, all - supplying root, Jesus Christ3. As all these flow from the grace of Christ, so they must issue in the glory and praise of God.</p>
