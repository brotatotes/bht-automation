<p><em>And this I pray, that your love</em> — Which they had already shown.</p>
<p><em>May abound yet more and more</em> — The fire which burned in the apostle never says, It is enough.</p>
<p><em>In knowledge and in all spiritual sense</em> — Which is the ground of all spiritual knowledge. We must be inwardly sensible of divine peace, joy, love; otherwise, we cannot know what they are.</p>
