And this I pray, that your love — Which they had already shown.May abound yet more and more — The fire which burned in the apostle never says, It is enough.In knowledge and in all spiritual sense — Which is the ground of all spiritual knowledge. We must be inwardly sensible of divine peace, joy, love; otherwise, we cannot know what they are.
