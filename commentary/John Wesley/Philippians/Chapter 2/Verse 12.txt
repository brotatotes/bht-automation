Wherefore — Having proposed Christ's example, he exhorts them to secure the salvation which Christ has purchased.As ye have always — Hitherto.Obeyed — Both God, and me his minister.Now in my absence — When ye have not me to instruct, assist, and direct you.Work out your own salvation — Herein let every man aim at his own things.With fear and trembling — With the utmost care and diligence.
