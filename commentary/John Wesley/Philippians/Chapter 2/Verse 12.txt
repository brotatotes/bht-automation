<p><em>Wherefore</em> — Having proposed Christ's example, he exhorts them to secure the salvation which Christ has purchased.</p>
<p><em>As ye have always</em> — Hitherto.</p>
<p><em>Obeyed</em> — Both God, and me his minister.</p>
<p><em>Now in my absence</em> — When ye have not me to instruct, assist, and direct you.</p>
<p><em>Work out your own salvation</em> — Herein let every man aim at his own things.</p>
<p><em>With fear and trembling</em> — With the utmost care and diligence.</p>
