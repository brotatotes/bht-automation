<p><em>That worketh in you according to his good pleasure</em> — Not for any merit of yours. Yet his influences are not to supersede, but to encourage, our own efforts.</p>
<p><em>Work out your own salvation</em> — Here is our duty.</p>
<p><em>For it is God that worketh in you</em> — Here is our encouragement. And O, what a glorious encouragement, to have the arm of Omnipotence stretched out for our support and our succour!</p>
