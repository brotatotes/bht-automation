That ye may be blameless — Before men.And simple — Before God, aiming at him alone.As the sons of God — The God of love; acting up to your high character.Unrebukable in the midst of a crooked — Guileful, serpentine, and perverse generation - Such as the bulk of mankind always were.Crooked — By a corrupt nature, and yet more perverse by custom and practice.
