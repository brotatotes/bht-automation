<p><em>That ye may be blameless</em> — Before men.</p>
<p><em>And simple</em> — Before God, aiming at him alone.</p>
<p><em>As the sons of God</em> — The God of love; acting up to your high character.</p>
<p><em>Unrebukable in the midst of a crooked</em> — Guileful, serpentine, and perverse generation - Such as the bulk of mankind always were.</p>
<p><em>Crooked</em> — By a corrupt nature, and yet more perverse by custom and practice.</p>
