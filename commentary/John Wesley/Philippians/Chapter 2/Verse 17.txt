<p>Here he begins to treat of the latter clause of <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="php+1:22">Philippians 1:22</span>.</p>
<p><em>Yea, and if I be offered</em> — Literally, If I be poured out.</p>
<p><em>Upon the sacrifice of your faith</em> — The Philippians, as the other converted heathens, were a sacrifice to God through St. Paul's ministry, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:16">Romans 15:16</span>. And as in sacrificing, wine was poured at the foot of the altar, so he was willing that his blood should be poured out. The expression well agrees with that kind of martyrdom by which he was afterwards offered up to God.</p>
