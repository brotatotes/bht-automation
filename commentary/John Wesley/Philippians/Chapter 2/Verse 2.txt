<p><em>Think the same thing</em> — Seeing Christ is your common Head.</p>
<p><em>Having the same love</em> — To God, your common Father.</p>
<p><em>Being of one soul</em> — Animated with the same affections and tempers, as ye have all drank ill to one spirit.</p>
<p><em>Of one mind</em> — Tenderly rejoicing and grieving together.</p>
