<p><em>For all</em> — But Timotheus.</p>
<p><em>Seek their own</em> — Ease, safety, pleasure, or profit. Amazing! In that golden age of the church, could St. Paul throughly approve of one only, among all the labourers that were with him? <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="php+1:14,17">Philippians 1:14,17</span>. And how many do we think can now approve themselves to God? Not the things of Jesus Christ - They who seek these alone, will sadly experience this. They will find few helpers likeminded with themselves, willing naked to follow a naked Master.</p>
