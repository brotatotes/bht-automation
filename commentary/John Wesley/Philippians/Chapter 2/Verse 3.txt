Do nothing through contention — Which is inconsistent with your thinking the same thing.Or vainglory — Desire of praise, which is directly opposite to the love of God.But esteem each the others better than themselves — (For every one knows more evil of himself than he can of another:) Which is a glorious fruit of the Spirit, and an admirable help to your continuing "of one soul."
