He was content to forego the glories of the Creator, and to appear in the form of a creature; nay, to he made in the likeness of the fallen creatures; and not only to share the disgrace, but to suffer the punishment, due to the meanest and vilest among them all.</p>
<p><em>He emptied himself</em> — Of that divine fulness, which he received again at his exaltation. Though he remained full, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>, yet he appeared as if he had been empty; for he veiled his fulness from the sight of men and angels.
