<p><em>And being found in fashion as a man</em> — A common man, without any peculiar excellence or comeliness.</p>
<p><em>He humbled himself</em> — To a still greater depth.</p>
<p><em>Becoming obedient</em> — To God, though equal with him.</p>
<p><em>Even unto death</em> — The greatest instance both of humiliation and obedience.</p>
<p><em>Yea, the death of the cross</em> — Inflicted on few but servants or slaves.</p>
