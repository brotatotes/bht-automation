<p>The knowledge of Christ, mentioned in the eighth verse, is here more largely explained.</p>
<p><em>That I may know him</em> — As my complete Saviour.</p>
<p><em>And the power of his resurrection</em> — Raising me from the death of sin, into all the life of love.</p>
<p><em>And the fellowship of his sufferings</em> — Being crucified with him.</p>
<p><em>And made conformable to his death</em> — So as to be dead to all things here below.</p>
