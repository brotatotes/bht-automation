<p><em>Forgetting the things that are behind</em> — Even that part of the race which is already run.</p>
<p><em>And reaching forth unto</em> — Literally, stretched out over the things that are before - Pursuing with the whole bent and vigour of my soul, perfect holiness and eternal glory.</p>
<p><em>In Christ Jesus</em> — The author and finisher of every good thing.</p>
