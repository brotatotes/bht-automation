For we — Christians. Are the only true circumcision - The people now in covenant with God.Who worship God in spirit — Not barely in the letter, but with the spiritual worship of inward holiness.And glory in Christ Jesus — As the only cause of all our blessings.And have no confidence in the flesh — In any outward advantage or prerogative.
