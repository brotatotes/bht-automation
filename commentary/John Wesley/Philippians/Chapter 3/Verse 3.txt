<p><em>For we</em> — Christians. Are the only true circumcision - The people now in covenant with God.</p>
<p><em>Who worship God in spirit</em> — Not barely in the letter, but with the spiritual worship of inward holiness.</p>
<p><em>And glory in Christ Jesus</em> — As the only cause of all our blessings.</p>
<p><em>And have no confidence in the flesh</em> — In any outward advantage or prerogative.</p>
