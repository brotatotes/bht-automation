<p><em>I rejoiced greatly</em> — St. Paul was no Stoic: he had strong passions, but all devoted to God.</p>
<p><em>That your care of me hath flourished again</em> — As a tree blossoms after the winter.</p>
<p><em>Ye wanted opportunity</em> — Either ye had not plenty yourselves, or you wanted a proper messenger.</p>
