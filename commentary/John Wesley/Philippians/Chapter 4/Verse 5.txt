Let your gentleness — Yieldingness, sweetness of temper, the result of joy in the Lord.Be known — By your whole behaviour.To all men — Good and bad, gentle and froward. Those of the roughest tempers are good natured to some, from natural sympathy and various motives; a Christian, to all.The Lord — The judge, the rewarder, the avenger.Is at hand — Standeth at the door.
