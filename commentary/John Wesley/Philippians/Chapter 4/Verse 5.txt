<p><em>Let your gentleness</em> — Yieldingness, sweetness of temper, the result of joy in the Lord.</p>
<p><em>Be known</em> — By your whole behaviour.</p>
<p><em>To all men</em> — Good and bad, gentle and froward. Those of the roughest tempers are good natured to some, from natural sympathy and various motives; a Christian, to all.</p>
<p><em>The Lord</em> — The judge, the rewarder, the avenger.</p>
<p><em>Is at hand</em> — Standeth at the door.</p>
