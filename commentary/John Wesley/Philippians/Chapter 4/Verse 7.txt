And the peace of God — That calm, heavenly repose, that tranquility of spirit, which God only can give.Which surpasseth all understanding — Which none can comprehend, save he that receiveth it.Shall keep — Shall guard, as a garrison does a city.Your hearts — Your affections.Your minds — Your understandings, and all the various workings of them; through the Spirit and power of Christ Jesus, in the knowledge and love of God. Without a guard set on these likewise, the purity and vigour of our affections cannot long be preserved.
