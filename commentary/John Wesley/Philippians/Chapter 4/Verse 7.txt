<p><em>And the peace of God</em> — That calm, heavenly repose, that tranquility of spirit, which God only can give.</p>
<p><em>Which surpasseth all understanding</em> — Which none can comprehend, save he that receiveth it.</p>
<p><em>Shall keep</em> — Shall guard, as a garrison does a city.</p>
<p><em>Your hearts</em> — Your affections.</p>
<p><em>Your minds</em> — Your understandings, and all the various workings of them; through the Spirit and power of Christ Jesus, in the knowledge and love of God. Without a guard set on these likewise, the purity and vigour of our affections cannot long be preserved.</p>
