<p><em>Finally</em> — To sum up all.</p>
<p><em>Whatsoever things are true</em> — Here are eight particulars placed in two fourfold rows; the former containing their duty; the latter, the commendation of it. The first word in the former row answers the first in the latter; the second word, the second and so on.</p>
<p><em>True</em> — In speech.</p>
<p><em>Honest</em> — In action.</p>
<p><em>Just</em> — With regard to others.</p>
<p><em>Pure</em> — With regard to yourselves.</p>
<p><em>Lovely</em> — And what more lovely than truth? Of good report - As is honesty, even where it is not practised.</p>
<p><em>If there be any virtue</em> — And all virtues are contained in justice.</p>
<p><em>If there be any praise</em> — In those things which relate rather to ourselves than to our neighbour.</p>
<p><em>Think on these things</em> — That ye may both practise them yourselves, and recommend them to others.</p>
