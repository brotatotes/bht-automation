Finally — To sum up all.Whatsoever things are true — Here are eight particulars placed in two fourfold rows; the former containing their duty; the latter, the commendation of it. The first word in the former row answers the first in the latter; the second word, the second and so on.True — In speech.Honest — In action.Just — With regard to others.Pure — With regard to yourselves.Lovely — And what more lovely than truth? Of good report - As is honesty, even where it is not practised.If there be any virtue — And all virtues are contained in justice.If there be any praise — In those things which relate rather to ourselves than to our neighbour.Think on these things — That ye may both practise them yourselves, and recommend them to others.
