<p><em>The things which ye have learned</em> — As catechumens.</p>
<p><em>And received</em> — By continual instructions.</p>
<p><em>And heard and seen</em> — In my life and conversation.</p>
<p><em>These do, and the God of peace shall be with you</em> — Not only the peace of God, but God himself, the fountain of peace.</p>
