<p><em>I was in the Spirit</em> — That is, in a trance, a prophetic vision; so overwhelmed with the power, and filled with the light, of the Holy Spirit, as to be insensible of outward things, and wholly taken up with spiritual and divine. What follows is one single, connected vision, which St. John saw in one day; and therefore he that would understand it should carry his thought straight on through the whole, without interruption. The other prophetic books are collections of distinct prophecies, given upon various occasions: but here is one single treatise, whereof all the parts exactly depend on each other. Chapter iv1Revelation4:1 is connected with chapter i19; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+1:19">Revelation 1:19</span> and what is delivered in the fourth chapter goes on directly to the twenty-second.</p>
<p><em>On the Lord's day</em> — On this our Lord rose from the dead: on this the ancients believed he will come to judgment. It was, therefore, with the utmost propriety that St. John on this day both saw and described his coming.</p>
<p><em>And I heard behind me</em> — St. John had his face to the east: our Lord, likewise, in this appearance looked eastward toward Asia, whither the apostle was to write.</p>
<p><em>A great voice, as of a trumpet</em> — Which was peculiarly proper to proclaim the coming of the great King, and his victory over all his enemies.</p>
