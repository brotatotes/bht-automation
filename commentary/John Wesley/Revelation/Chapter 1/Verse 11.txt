<p><em>Saying, What thou seest</em> — And hearest. He both saw and heard. This command extends to the whole book. All the books of the New Testament were written by the will of God; but none were so expressly commanded to be written.</p>
<p><em>In a book</em> — So all the Revelation is but one book: nor did the letter to the angel of each church belong to him or his church only; but the whole book was sent to them all.</p>
<p><em>To the churches</em> — Hereafter named; and through them to all churches, in all ages and nations.</p>
<p><em>To Ephesus</em> — Mr. Thomas Smith, who in the year1671travelled through all these cities, observes, that from Ephesus to Smyrna is forty-six English miles; from Smyrna to Pergamos, sixty-four; from Pergamos to Thyatira, forty-eight; from Thyatira to Sardis, thirty-three; from Sardis to Philadelphia, twenty-seven; from Philadelphia to Laodicea, about forty-two miles.</p>
