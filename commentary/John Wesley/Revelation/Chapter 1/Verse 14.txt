His head and his hair - That is, the hair of his head, not his whole head.Were white as white wool — Like the Ancient of Days, represented in Daniel's vision, Daniel 7:9. Wool is commonly supposed to be an emblem of eternity.As snow — Betokening his spotless purity.And his eyes as a flame of fire — Piercing through all things; a token of his omniscience.
