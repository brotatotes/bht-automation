<p><em>And his feet like fine brass</em> — Denoting his stability and strength.</p>
<p><em>As if they burned in a furnace</em> — As if having been melted and refined, they were still red hot.</p>
<p><em>And his voice</em> — To the comfort of his friends, and the terror of his enemies.</p>
<p><em>As the voice of many waters</em> — Roaring aloud, and bearing down all before them.</p>
