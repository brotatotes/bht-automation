And his feet like fine brass — Denoting his stability and strength.As if they burned in a furnace — As if having been melted and refined, they were still red hot.And his voice — To the comfort of his friends, and the terror of his enemies.As the voice of many waters — Roaring aloud, and bearing down all before them.
