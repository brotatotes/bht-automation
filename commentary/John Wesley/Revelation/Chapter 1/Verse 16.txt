And he had in his right hand seven stars — In token of his favour and powerful protection.And out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword — Signifying his justice and righteous anger, continually pointed against his enemies as a sword; sharp, to stab; two-edged, to hew.And his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength — Without any mist or cloud.
