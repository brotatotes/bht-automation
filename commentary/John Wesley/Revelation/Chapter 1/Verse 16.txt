<p><em>And he had in his right hand seven stars</em> — In token of his favour and powerful protection.</p>
<p><em>And out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword</em> — Signifying his justice and righteous anger, continually pointed against his enemies as a sword; sharp, to stab; two-edged, to hew.</p>
<p><em>And his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength</em> — Without any mist or cloud.</p>
