To him that loveth us, and, out of that free, abundant love, hath washed us from the guilt and power of our sins with his own blood, and hath made us kings - Partakers of his present, and heirs of his eternal, kingdom.And priests unto his God and Father — To whom we continually offer ourselves, an holy, living sacrifice.To him be the glory — For his love and redemption.And the might — Whereby he governs all things.
