<p><em>Behold</em> — In this and the next verse is the proposition, and the summary of the whole book.</p>
<p><em>He cometh</em> — Jesus Christ. Throughout this book, whenever it is said, He cometh, it means his glorious coming. The preparation for this began at the destruction of Jerusalem, and more particularly at the time of writing this book; and goes on, without any interruption, till that grand event is accomplished. Therefore it is never said in this book, He will come; but, He cometh. And yet it is not said, He cometh again: for when he came before, it was not like himself, but in "the form of a servant." But his appearing in glory is properly his coming; namely, in a manner worthy of the Son of God.</p>
<p><em>And every eye</em> — Of the Jews in particular.</p>
<p><em>Shall see him</em> — But with what different emotions, according as they had received or rejected him.</p>
<p><em>And they who have pierced him</em> — They, above all, who pierced his hands, or feet, or side. Thomas saw the print of these wounds even after his resurrection; and the same, undoubtedly, will be seen by all, when he cometh in the clouds of heaven.</p>
<p><em>And all the tribes of the earth</em> — The word tribes, in the Revelation, always means the Israelites: but where another word, such as nations or people, is joined with it, it implies likewise (as here) all the rest of mankind.</p>
<p><em>Shall wail because of him</em> — For terror and pain, if they did not wail before by true repentance.</p>
<p><em>Yea, Amen</em> — This refers to, every eye shall see him. He that cometh saith, Yea; he that testifies it, Amen. The word translated yea is Greek; Amen is Hebrew: for what is here spoken respects both Jew and gentile.</p>
