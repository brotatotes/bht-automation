And I saw another mighty angel — Another from that "mighty angel," mentioned, Revelation 5:2; yet he was a created angel; for he did not swear by himself, verse6. Revelation 5:6 Clothed with a cloud - In token of his high dignity.And a rainbow upon his head — A lovely token of the divine favour. And yet it is not too glorious for a creature: the woman, Revelation 12:1, is described more glorious still.And his face as the sun — Nor is this too much for a creature: for all the righteous "shall shine forth as the sun," Matthew 13:43.And his feet as pillars of fire — Bright as flame.
