<p><em>And I saw another mighty angel</em> — Another from that "mighty angel," mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+5:2">Revelation 5:2</span>; yet he was a created angel; for he did not swear by himself, verse6. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span> Clothed with a cloud - In token of his high dignity.</p>
<p><em>And a rainbow upon his head</em> — A lovely token of the divine favour. And yet it is not too glorious for a creature: the woman, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+12:1">Revelation 12:1</span>, is described more glorious still.</p>
<p><em>And his face as the sun</em> — Nor is this too much for a creature: for all the righteous "shall shine forth as the sun," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:43">Matthew 13:43</span>.</p>
<p><em>And his feet as pillars of fire</em> — Bright as flame.</p>
