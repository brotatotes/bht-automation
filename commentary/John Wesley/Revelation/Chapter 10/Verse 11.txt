<p><em>Thou must prophesy again</em> — Of the mystery of God; of which the ancient prophets had prophesied before. And he did prophesy, by "measuring the temple," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+11:1">Revelation 11:1</span>; as a prophecy may be delivered either by words or actions.</p>
<p><em>Concerning people, and nations, and tongues, and many kings</em> — The people, nations, and tongues are contemporary; but the kings, being many, succeed one another. These kings are not mentioned for their own sake, but with a view to the "holy city," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+11:2">Revelation 11:2</span>. Here is a reference to the great kingdoms in Spain, England, Italy, etc., which arose from the eighth century; or at least underwent a considerable change, as France and Germany in particular; to the Christian, afterward Turkish, empire in the east; and especially to the various potentates, who have successively reigned at or over Jerusalem, and do now, at least titularly, reign over it.</p>
