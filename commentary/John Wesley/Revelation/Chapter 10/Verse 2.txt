<p><em>And he had in his hand</em> — His left hand: he swore with his right. He stood with his right foot on the sea, toward the west; his left, on the land, toward the east: so that he looked southward. And so St. John (as Patmos lies near Asia) could conveniently take the book out of his left hand. This sealed book was first in the right hand of him that sat on the throne: thence the Lamb took it, and opened the seals. And now this little book, containing the remainder of the other, is given opened, as it was, to St. John. From this place the Revelation speaks more clearly and less figuratively than before.</p>
<p><em>And he set his right foot upon the sea</em> — Out of which the first beast was to come.</p>
<p><em>And his left foot upon the earth</em> — Out of which was to come the second. The sea may betoken Europe; the earth, Asia; the chief theatres of these great things.</p>
