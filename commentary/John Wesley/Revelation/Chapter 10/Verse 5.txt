<p><em>And the angel</em> — This manifestation of things to come under the trumpet of the seventh angel hath a twofold introduction: first, the angel speaks for God, verse7; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+10:7">Revelation 10:7</span> then Christ speaks for himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+11:3">Revelation 11:3</span>. The angel appeals to the prophets of former times; Christ, to his own two witnesses.</p>
<p><em>Whom I saw standing upon the earth and upon the sea, lifted up his right hand toward heaven</em> — As yet the dragon was in heaven. When he is cast thence he brings the third and most dreadful woe on the earth and sea: so that it seems as if there would be no end of calamities. Therefore the angel comprises, in his posture and in his oath, both heaven, sea, and earth, and makes on the part of the eternal God and almighty Creator, a solemn protestation, that he will assert his kingly authority against all his enemies.</p>
<p><em>He lifted up his right hand toward heaven</em> — The angel in Daniel, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="da+12:7">Daniel 12:7</span>, (not improbably the same angel,) lifted up both his hands.</p>
