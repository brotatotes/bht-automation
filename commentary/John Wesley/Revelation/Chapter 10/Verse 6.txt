<p><em>And sware</em> — The six preceding trumpets pass without any such solemnity. It is the trumpet of the seventh angel alone which is confirmed by so high an oath.</p>
<p><em>By him that liveth for ever and ever</em> — Before whom a thousand years are but a day.</p>
<p><em>Who created the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the things that are therein</em> — And, consequently, has the sovereign power over all: therefore, all his enemies, though they rage a while in heaven, on the sea, and on the earth, yet must give place to him.</p>
<p><em>That there shall be no more a time</em> — "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, the mystery of God shall be fulfilled:" that is, a time, a chronos, shall not expire before that mystery is fulfilled. A chronos (1111years) will nearly pass before then, but not quite. The period, then, which we may term a non-chronos (not a whole time) must be a little, and not much, shorter than this. The non-chronos here mentioned seems to begin in the year800, (when Charles the Great instituted in the west a new line of emperors, or of "many kings,") to end in the year1836; and to contain, among other things, the "short time" of the third woe, the "three times and a half" of the woman in the wilderness, and the "duration" of the beast.</p>
