<p><em>But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel</em> — Who sounded not only at the beginning of those days, but from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p><em>The mystery of God shall be fulfilled</em> — It is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+17:17">Revelation 17:17</span>, "The word of God shall be fulfilled." The word of God is fulfilled by the destruction of the beast; the mystery, by the removal of the dragon. But these great events are so near together, that they are here mentioned as one. The beginning of them is in heaven, as soon as the seventh trumpet sounds; the end is on the earth and the sea. So long as the third woe remains on the earth and the sea, the mystery of God is not fulfilled. And the angel's swearing is peculiarly for the comfort of holy men, who are afflicted under that woe. Indeed the wrath of God must be first fulfilled, by the pouring out of the phials: and then comes the joyful fulfilling of the mystery of God.</p>
<p><em>As he hath declared to his servants the prophets</em> — The accomplishment exactly answering the prediction. The ancient prophecies relate partly to that grand period, from the birth of Christ to the destruction of Jerusalem; partly to the time of the seventh angel, wherein they will be fully accomplished. To the seventh trumpet belongs all that occurs from <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span>. And the third woe, which takes place under the same, properly stands, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+12:12">Revelation 12:12</span>; 13:1-18.</p>
