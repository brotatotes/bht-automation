<p>And the temple of God-The inmost part of it. Was opened in heaven - And hereby is opened a new scene of the most momentous things, that we may see how the contents of the seventh trumpet are executed; and, notwithstanding the greatest opposition, (particularly by the third woe,) brought to a glorious conclusion.</p>
<p><em>And the ark of the covenant was seen in his temple</em> — The ark of the covenant which was made by Moses was not in the second temple, being probably burnt with the first temple by the Chaldeans. But here is the heavenly ark of the everlasting covenant, the shadow of which was under the Old Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:4">Hebrews 9:4</span>. The inhabitants of heaven saw the ark before: St. John also saw it now; for a testimony, that what God had promised, should be fulfilled to the uttermost.</p>
<p><em>And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail</em> — The very same there are, and in the same order, when the seventh angel has poured out his phial; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+16:17-21">Revelation 16:17-21</span>: one place answers the other. What the trumpet here denounces in heaven, is there executed by the phial upon earth. First it is shown what will be done; and afterwards it is done.</p>
