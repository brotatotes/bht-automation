<p><em>These are the two olive trees</em> — That is, as Zerubbabel and Joshua, the two olive trees spoken of by Zechariah, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:9">Zechariah 3:9</span>; 4:10, were then the two chosen instruments in God's hand, even so shall these. be in their season. Being themselves full of the unction of the Holy One, they shall continually transmit the same to others also.</p>
<p><em>And the two candlesticks</em> — Burning and shining lights.</p>
<p><em>Standing before the Lord of the earth</em> — Always waiting on God, without the help of man, and asserting his right over the earth and all things therein.</p>
