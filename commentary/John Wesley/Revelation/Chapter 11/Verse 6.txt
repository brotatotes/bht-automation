<p><em>These have power</em> — And they use that power. See verse10. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+11:10">Revelation 11:10</span> To shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophesying - During those "twelve hundred and sixty days." And have power over the waters - In and near Jerusalem.</p>
<p><em>To turn them into blood</em> — As Moses did those in Egypt.</p>
<p><em>And to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will</em> — This is not said of Moses or Elijah, or any mere man besides. And how is it possible to understand this otherwise than of two individual persons?</p>
