And when they shall have finished their testimony — Till then they are invincible.The wild beast — Hereafter to be described.That ascendeth — First out of the sea, Revelation 13:1, and then out of the bottomless pit, Revelation 17:8.Shall make war with them — It is at his last ascent, not out of the sea, but the bottomless pit, that the beast makes war upon the two witnesses. And even hereby is fixed the time of "treading the holy city," and of the "two witnesses." That time ends after the ascent of the beast out of the abyss, and yet before the fulfilling of the mystery.And shall conquer them — The fire no longer proceeding out of their mouth when they have finished their work.And kill them — These will be among the last martyrs, though not the last of all.
