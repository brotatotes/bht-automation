<p><em>And their bodies shall be</em> — Perhaps hanging on a cross.</p>
<p><em>In the street of the great city</em> — Of Jerusalem, a far greater city, than any other in those parts. This is described both spiritually and historically: spiritually, as it is called Sodom <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:9">Isaiah 1:9</span> etc. and Egypt; on account of the same abominations abounding there, at the time of the witnesses, as did once in Egypt and Sodom. Historically: Where also their Lord was crucified - This possibly refers to the very ground where his cross stood. Constantine the Great inclosed this within the walls of the city. Perhaps on that very spot will their bodies be exposed.</p>
