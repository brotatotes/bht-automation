Now is come — Hence it is evident that all this chapter belongs to the trumpet of the seventh angel. In the eleventh chapter, from the fifteenth to the eighteenth verse, are proposed the contents of this extensive trumpet; the execution of which is copiously described in this and the following chapters.The salvation — Of the saints.The might — Whereby the enemy is cast out.The kingdom — Here the majesty of God is shown.And the power of his Christ — Which he will exert against the beast; and when he also is taken away, then will the kingdom be ascribed to Christ himself, Revelation 19:16; 20:4.The accuser of our brethren — So long as they remained on earth. This great voice, therefore, was the voice of men only.Who accused them before our God day and night — Amazing malice of Satan, and patience of God!
