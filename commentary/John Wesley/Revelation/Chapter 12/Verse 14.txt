<p><em>And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place</em> — Eagles are the usual symbols of great potentates. So <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="eze+17:3">Ezekiel 17:3</span>, by "a great eagle', means the king of Babylon. Here the great eagle is the Roman empire; the two wings, the eastern and western branches of it. A place in the wilderness was mentioned in the sixth verse also; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+12:6">Revelation 12:6</span> but it is not the same which is mentioned here. In the text there follow one after the other, 1. The dragon's waiting to devour the child2. The birth of the child, which is caught up to God3. The fleeing of the woman into the wilderness4. The war in heaven, and the casting out of the dragon5. The beginning of the third woe6. The persecution raised by the dragon against the woman7. The woman's flying away upon the eagle's wings. In like manner there follow one after the other, 1. The beginning of the twelve hundred and sixty days2. The beginning of the little time3. The beginning of the time, times, and half a time. This third period partly coincides both with the first and the second. After the beginning of the twelve hundred and sixty days, or rather of the third woe, Christianity was exceedingly propagated, in the midst of various persecutions. About the year948 it was again settled in Denmark; in965, in Poland and Silesia; in980, through all Russia. In997 it was brought into Hungary; into Sweden and Norway, both before and after. Transylvania received it about1000; and, soon after, other parts of Dacia. Now, all the countries in which Christianity was settled between the beginning of the twelve hundred and sixty days, and the imprisonment of the dragon, may be understood by the wilderness, and by her place in particular. This place contained many countries; so that Christianity now reached, in an uninterrupted tract, from the eastern to the western empire; and both the emperors now lent their wings to the woman, and provided a safe abode for her.</p>
<p><em>Where she is fed</em> — By God rather than man; having little human help.</p>
<p><em>For a time, and times, and half a time</em> — The length of the several periods here mentioned seems to be nearly this: - Years1. The non-chronos contains less than......................11112. The little time..........................................8883. The time, times, and half a time.........................7774. The time of the beast....................................666 And comparing the prophecy and history together, they seem to begin and end nearly thus: - 1. The non-chronos extends..............from about800 to18362. The1260 days of the woman...................from847 - 15243. The little time.............................. - 947 - 18364. The time, time, and half..................... - 1058 - 18365. The time of the beast is between the beginning and end of the three times and a half. In the year1058 the empires had a good understanding with each other, and both protected the woman. The bishops of Rome, likewise, particularly Victor II., were duly subordinate to the emperor. We may observe, the twelve hundred and sixty days of the woman, from847 to1524, and the three times and a half, refer to the same wilderness. But in the former part of the twelve hundred and sixty days, before the three times and an half began, namely, from the year847 to1058, she was fed by others, being little able to help herself; whereas, from1058 to1524, she is both fed by others, and has food herself. To this the sciences transplanted into the west from the eastern countries much contributed; the scriptures, in the original tongues, brought into the west of Europe by the Jews and Greeks, much more; and most of all, the Reformation, grounded on those scriptures.</p>
