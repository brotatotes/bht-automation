And behold a great red dragon — His fiery-red colour denoting his disposition.Having seven heads — Implying vast wisdom.And ten horns — Perhaps on the seventh head; emblems of mighty power and strength, which he still retained.And seven diadems on his heads — Not properly crowns, but costly bindings, such as kings anciently wore; for, though fallen, he was a great potentate still, even "the prince of this world."
