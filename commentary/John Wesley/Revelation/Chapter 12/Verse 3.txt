<p><em>And behold a great red dragon</em> — His fiery-red colour denoting his disposition.</p>
<p><em>Having seven heads</em> — Implying vast wisdom.</p>
<p><em>And ten horns</em> — Perhaps on the seventh head; emblems of mighty power and strength, which he still retained.</p>
<p><em>And seven diadems on his heads</em> — Not properly crowns, but costly bindings, such as kings anciently wore; for, though fallen, he was a great potentate still, even "the prince of this world."</p>
