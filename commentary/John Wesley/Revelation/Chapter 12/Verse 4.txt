<p><em>And his tail</em> — His falsehood and subtilty.</p>
<p><em>Draweth</em> — As a train.</p>
<p><em>The third part</em> — A very large number.</p>
<p><em>Of the stars of heaven</em> — The Christians and their teachers, who before sat in heavenly places with Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><em>And casteth them to the earth</em> — Utterly deprives them of all those heavenly blessings. This is properly a part of the description of the dragon, who was not yet himself on earth, but in heaven: consequently, this casting them down was between the beginning of the seventh trumpet and the beginning of the third woe; or between the year847 and the year947; at which time pestilent doctrines, particularly that of the Manichees in the east, drew abundance of people from the truth.</p>
<p><em>And the dragon stood before the woman, that when she had brought forth, he might devour the child</em> — That he might hinder the kingdom of Christ from spreading abroad, as it does under this trumpet.</p>
