<p><em>And she brought forth a man child</em> — Even Christ, considered not in his person, but in his kingdom. In the ninth age, many nations with their princes were added to the Christian church.</p>
<p><em>Who was to rule all nations</em> — When his time is come.</p>
<p><em>And her child</em> — Which was already in heaven, as were the woman and the dragon.</p>
<p><em>Was caught up to God</em> — Taken utterly out of his reach.</p>
