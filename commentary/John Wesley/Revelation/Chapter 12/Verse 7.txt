<p><em>And there was war in heaven</em> â€” Here Satan makes his grand opposition to the kingdom of God; but an end is now put to his accusing the saints before God. The cause goes against him, verses10,11, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+12:10,11">Revelation 12:10,11</span>and Michael executes the sentence. That Michael is a created angel, appears from his not daring, in disputing with Satan, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="jude+9">Jude 9</span>, to bring a railing accusation; but only saying, "The Lord rebuke thee." And this modesty is implied in his very name; for Michael signifies, "Who is like God?" which implies also his deep reverence toward God, and distance from all self-exaltation. Satan would be like God: the very name of Michael asks, "Who is like God?" Not Satan; not the highest archangel. It is he likewise that is afterward employed to seize, bind, and imprison that proud spirit.</p>
