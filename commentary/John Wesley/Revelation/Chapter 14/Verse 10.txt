<p><em>He shall drink</em> — With Babylon, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+16:19">Revelation 16:19</span>.</p>
<p><em>And shall be tormented</em> — With the beast, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10">Revelation 20:10</span>. In all the scripture there is not another so terrible threatening as this. And God by this greater fear arms his servants against the fear of the beast.</p>
<p><em>The wrath of God, which is poured unmixed</em> — Without any mixture of mercy; without hope.</p>
<p><em>Into the cup of his indignation</em> — And is no real anger implied in all this? O what will not even wise men assert, to serve an hypothesis!</p>
