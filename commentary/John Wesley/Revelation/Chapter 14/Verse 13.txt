<p><em>And I heard a voice</em> — This is most seasonably heard when the beast is in his highest power and fury.</p>
<p><em>Out of heaven</em> — Probably from a departed saint.</p>
<p><em>Write</em> — He was at first commanded to write the whole book. Whenever this is repeated it denotes something peculiarly observable.</p>
<p><em>Happy are the dead</em> — From henceforth particularly: 1. Because they escape the approaching calamities: 2. Because they already enjoy so near an approach to glory.</p>
<p><em>Who die in the Lord</em> — In the faith of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p><em>For they rest</em> — No pain, no purgatory follows; but pure, unmixed happiness.</p>
<p><em>From their labours</em> — And the more laborious their life was, the sweeter is their rest. How different this state from that of those, verse11, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+14:11">Revelation 14:11</span> who "have no rest day or night!" Reader, which wilt thou choose? Their works - Each one's peculiar works.</p>
<p><em>Follow</em> — or accompany them; that is, the fruit of their works. Their works do not go before to procure them admittance into the mansions of joy; but they follow them when admitted.</p>
