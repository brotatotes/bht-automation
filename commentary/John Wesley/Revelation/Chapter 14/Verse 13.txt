And I heard a voice — This is most seasonably heard when the beast is in his highest power and fury.Out of heaven — Probably from a departed saint.Write — He was at first commanded to write the whole book. Whenever this is repeated it denotes something peculiarly observable.Happy are the dead — From henceforth particularly: 1. Because they escape the approaching calamities: 2. Because they already enjoy so near an approach to glory.Who die in the Lord — In the faith of the Lord Jesus.For they rest — No pain, no purgatory follows; but pure, unmixed happiness.From their labours — And the more laborious their life was, the sweeter is their rest. How different this state from that of those, verse11, Revelation 14:11 who "have no rest day or night!" Reader, which wilt thou choose?

Their works do not go before to procure them admittance into the mansions of joy; but they follow them when admitted.
