<p>In the following verses, under the emblem of an harvest and a vintage, are signified two general visitations; first, many good men are taken from the earth by the harvest; then many sinners during the vintage. The latter is altogether a penal visitation; the former seems to be altogether gracious. Here is no reference in either to the day of judgment, but to a season which cannot be far off.</p>
<p><em>And I saw a white cloud</em> — An emblem of mercy.</p>
<p><em>And on the cloud sat one like a son of man</em> — An angel in an human shape, sent by Christ, the Lord both of the vintage and of the harvest.</p>
<p><em>Having a golden crown on his head</em> — In token of his high dignity.</p>
<p><em>And a sharp sickle in his hand</em> — The sharper the welcomer to the righteous.</p>
