In the following verses, under the emblem of an harvest and a vintage, are signified two general visitations; first, many good men are taken from the earth by the harvest; then many sinners during the vintage. The latter is altogether a penal visitation; the former seems to be altogether gracious. Here is no reference in either to the day of judgment, but to a season which cannot be far off.And I saw a white cloud — An emblem of mercy.And on the cloud sat one like a son of man — An angel in an human shape, sent by Christ, the Lord both of the vintage and of the harvest.Having a golden crown on his head — In token of his high dignity.And a sharp sickle in his hand — The sharper the welcomer to the righteous.
