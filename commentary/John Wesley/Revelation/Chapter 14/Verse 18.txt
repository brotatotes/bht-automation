And another angel from the altar — Of burnt offering; from whence the martyrs had cried for vengeance.Who had power over fire — As "the angel of the waters," Revelation 16:5, had over water.Cried, saying, Lop off the clusters of the vine of the earth — All the wicked are considered as constituting one body.
