<p><em>And another angel from the altar</em> — Of burnt offering; from whence the martyrs had cried for vengeance.</p>
<p><em>Who had power over fire</em> — As "the angel of the waters," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+16:5">Revelation 16:5</span>, had over water.</p>
<p><em>Cried, saying, Lop off the clusters of the vine of the earth</em> — All the wicked are considered as constituting one body.</p>
