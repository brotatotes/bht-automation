And the winepress was trodden — By the Son of God, Revelation 19:15.Without the city — Jerusalem. They to whom St. John writes, when a man said, "The city," immediately understood this.And blood came out of the winepress, even to the horses' bridles — So deep at its first flowing from the winepress! One thousand six hundred furlongs - So far! at least two hundred miles, through the whole land of Palestine.
