And I saw another angel — A second is mentioned, verse8; a third, verse9. Revelation 14:8,9 These three denote great messengers of God with their assistants; three men who bring messages from God to men. The first exhorts to the fear and worship of God; he second proclaims the fall of Babylon; the third gives warning concerning the beast. Happy are they who make the right use of these divine messages! Flying - Going on swiftly.In the midst of heaven — Breadthways.Having an everlasting gospel — Not the gospel, properly so called; but a gospel, or joyful message, which was to have an influence on all ages.To preach to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people — Both to Jew and gentile, even as far as the authority of the beast had extended.
