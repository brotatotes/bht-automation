<p><em>And I saw another angel</em> — A second is mentioned, verse8; a third, verse9. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8,9">Revelation 14:8,9</span> These three denote great messengers of God with their assistants; three men who bring messages from God to men. The first exhorts to the fear and worship of God; he second proclaims the fall of Babylon; the third gives warning concerning the beast. Happy are they who make the right use of these divine messages! Flying - Going on swiftly.</p>
<p><em>In the midst of heaven</em> — Breadthways.</p>
<p><em>Having an everlasting gospel</em> — Not the gospel, properly so called; but a gospel, or joyful message, which was to have an influence on all ages.</p>
<p><em>To preach to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people</em> — Both to Jew and gentile, even as far as the authority of the beast had extended.</p>
