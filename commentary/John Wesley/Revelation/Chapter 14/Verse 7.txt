<p><em>Fear God and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come</em> — The joyful message is properly this, that the hour of God's judgment is come. And hence is that admonition drawn, Fear God and give glory to him. They who do this will not worship the beast, neither any image or idol whatsoever.</p>
<p><em>And worship him that made</em> — Whereby he is absolutely distinguished from idols of every kind.</p>
<p><em>The heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and fountains of water</em> — And they who worship him shall be delivered when the angels pour out their phials on the earth, sea, fountains of water, on the sun, and in the air.</p>
