<p><em>And a third angel followed</em> — At no great distance of time.</p>
<p><em>Saying, If any one worship the wild beast</em> — This worship consists, partly in an inward submission, a persuasion that all who are subject to Christ must be subject to the beast or they cannot receive the influences of divine grace, or, as their expression is, there is no salvation out of their church; partly in a suitable outward reverence to the beast himself, and consequently to his image.</p>
