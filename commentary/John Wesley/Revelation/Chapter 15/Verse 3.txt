<p><em>And they sing the song of Moses</em> — So called, partly from its near agreement,with the words of that song which he sung after passing the Red Sea, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:11">Exodus 15:11</span>, and of that which he taught the children of Israel a little before his death, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="de+32:3,4">Deuteronomy 32:3,4</span>. But chiefly because Moses was the minister and representative of the Jewish church, as Christ is of the church universal. Therefore it is also termed the sons of the Lamb. It consists of six parts, which answer each other: - 1.Great and wonderful are thy2.For thou only art gracious. works, Lord God Almighty3.Just and true are thy ways, O4.For all the nations shall come King of the nations. and worship before thee5.Who would not fear thee, O6.For thy judgments are made Lord, and glorify thy name? manifest. We know and acknowledge that all thy works in and toward all the creatures are great and wonderful; that thy ways with all the children of men, good and evil, are just and true.</p>
<p><em>For thou only art gracious</em> — And this grace is the spring of all those wonderful works, even of his destroying the enemies of his people. Accordingly in <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ps+136:1-26">Psalm 136:1-26</span>., that clause, "For his mercy endureth for ever," is subjoined to the thanksgiving for his works of vengeance as well as for his delivering the righteous.</p>
<p><em>For all the nations shall come and worship before thee</em> — They shall serve thee as their king with joyful reverence. This is a glorious testimony of the future conversion of all the heathens. The Christians are now a little flock: they who do not worship God, an immense multitude. But all the nations shall come, from all parts of the earth, to worship him and glorify his name. For thy judgments are made manifest - And then the inhabitants of the earth will at length learn to fear him.</p>
