And the temple was filled with smoke — The cloud of glory was the visible manifestation of God's presence in the tabernacle and temple. It was a sign of protection at erecting the tabernacle and at the dedication of the temple. But in the judgment of Korah the glory of the Lord appeared, when he and his companions were swallowed up by the earth. So proper is the emblem of smoke from the glory of God, or from the cloud of glory, to express the execution of judgment, as well as to be a sign of favour. Both proceed from the power of God, and in both he is glorified.And none — Not even of those who ordinarily stood before God.Could go into the temple — That is, into the inmost part of it.Till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled — Which did not take up a long time, like the seven trumpets, but swiftly followed each other.
