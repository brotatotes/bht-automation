<p><em>Out of the mouth of the dragon, the wild beast, and the false prophet</em> — It seems, the dragon fights chiefly against God; the beast, against Christ; the false prophet, against the Spirit of truth; and that the three unclean spirits which come from them, and exactly resemble them, endeavour to blacken the works of creation, of redemption, and of sanctification.</p>
<p><em>The false prophet</em> — So is the second beast frequently named, after the kingdom of the first is darkened; for he can then no longer prevail by main strength, and so works by lies and deceit. Mahomet was first a false prophet, and afterwards a powerful prince: but this beast was first powerful as a prince; afterwards a false prophet, a teacher of lies.</p>
<p><em>Like frogs</em> — Whose abode is in fens, marshes, and other unclean places.</p>
<p><em>To the kings of the whole world</em> — Both Mahometan and pagan.</p>
<p><em>To gather them</em> — To the assistance of their three principals.</p>
