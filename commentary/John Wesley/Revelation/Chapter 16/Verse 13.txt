Out of the mouth of the dragon, the wild beast, and the false prophet — It seems, the dragon fights chiefly against God; the beast, against Christ; the false prophet, against the Spirit of truth; and that the three unclean spirits which come from them, and exactly resemble them, endeavour to blacken the works of creation, of redemption, and of sanctification.The false prophet — So is the second beast frequently named, after the kingdom of the first is darkened; for he can then no longer prevail by main strength, and so works by lies and deceit. Mahomet was first a false prophet, and afterwards a powerful prince: but this beast was first powerful as a prince; afterwards a false prophet, a teacher of lies.Like frogs — Whose abode is in fens, marshes, and other unclean places.To the kings of the whole world — Both Mahometan and pagan.To gather them — To the assistance of their three principals.
