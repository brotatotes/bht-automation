Behold, I come as a thief — Suddenly, unexpectedly. Observe the beautiful abruptness.I — Jesus Christ. Hear him.Happy is he that watcheth. — Looking continually for him that "cometh quickly." And keepeth on his garments - Which men use to put off when they sleep.Lest he walk naked, and they see his shame — Lest he lose the graces which he takes no care to keep, and others see his sin and punishment.
