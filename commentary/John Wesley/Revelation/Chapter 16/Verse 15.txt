<p><em>Behold, I come as a thief</em> — Suddenly, unexpectedly. Observe the beautiful abruptness.</p>
<p><em>I</em> — Jesus Christ. Hear him.</p>
<p><em>Happy is he that watcheth.</em> — Looking continually for him that "cometh quickly." And keepeth on his garments - Which men use to put off when they sleep.</p>
<p><em>Lest he walk naked, and they see his shame</em> — Lest he lose the graces which he takes no care to keep, and others see his sin and punishment.</p>
