And there came one of the seven angels, saying, Come hither — This relation concerning the great whore, and that concerning the wife of the Lamb, Revelation 21:9,10, have the same introduction, in token of the exact opposition between them.I will show thee the judgment of the great whore — Which is now circumstantially described.That sitteth as a queen — In pomp, power, ease, and luxury.Upon many waters — Many people and nations, verse15. Revelation 17:15
