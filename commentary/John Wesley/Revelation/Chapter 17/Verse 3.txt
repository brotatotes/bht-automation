<p><em>And he carried me away</em> — In the vision.</p>
<p><em>Into a wilderness</em> — The campagna di Roma, the country round about Rome, is now a wilderness, compared to what it was once.</p>
<p><em>And I saw a woman</em> — Both the scripture and other writers frequently represent a city under this emblem.</p>
<p><em>Sitting upon a scarlet wild beast</em> — The same which is described in the thirteenth chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1-18">Revelation 13:1-18</span> But he was there described as he carried on his own designs only: here, as he is connected with the whore. There is, indeed, a very close connexion between them; the seven heads of the beast being "seven hills on which the woman sitteth." And yet there is a very remarkable difference between them, - between the papal power and the city of Rome. This woman is the city of Rome, with its buildings and inhabitants; especially the nobles. The beast, which is now scarlet-coloured, (bearing the bloody livery, as well as the person, of the woman,) appears very different from before. Therefore St. John says at first sight, I saw a beast, not the beast, full of names of blasphemy - He had' before "a name of blasphemy upon his head," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>: now he has many. From the time of Hildebrand, the blasphemous titles of the Pope have been abundantly multiplied.</p>
<p><em>Having seven heads</em> — Which reach in a succession from his ascent out of the sea to his being cast into the lake of fire.</p>
<p><em>And ten horns</em> — Which are contemporary with each other, and belong to his last period.</p>
