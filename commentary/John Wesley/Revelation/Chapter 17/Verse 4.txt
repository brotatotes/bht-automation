And the woman was arrayed — With the utmost pomp and magnificence.In purple and scarlet — These were the colours of the imperial habit: the purple, in times of peace; and the scarlet, in times of war.Having in her hand a golden cup — Like the ancient Babylon, Jeremiah 51:7.Full of abominations — The most abominable doctrines as well as practices.
