<p><em>And on her forehead a name written</em> — Whereas the saints have the name of God and the Lamb on their foreheads.</p>
<p><em>Mystery</em> — This very word was inscribed on the front of the Pope's mitre, till some of the Reformers took public notice of it.</p>
<p><em>Babylon the great</em> — Benedict XIII., in his proclamation of the jubilee, A.D1725, explains this sufficiently. His words are, "To this holy city, famous for the memory of so many holy martyrs, run with religious alacrity. Hasten to the place which the Lord hath chose. Ascend to this new Jerusalem, whence the law of the Lord and the light of evangelical truth hath flowed forth into all nations, from the very first beginning of the church: the city most rightfully called 'The Palace,' placed for the pride of all ages, the city of the Lord, the Sion of the Holy One of Israel. This catholic and apostolical Roman church is the head of the world, the mother of all believers, the faithful interpreter of God and mistress of all churches." But God somewhat varies the style.</p>
<p><em>The mother of harlots</em> — The parent, ringleader, patroness, and nourisher of many daughters, that losely copy after her.</p>
<p><em>And abominations</em> — Of every kind, spiritual and fleshly.</p>
<p><em>Of the earth</em> — In all lands. In this respect she is indeed catholic or universal.</p>
