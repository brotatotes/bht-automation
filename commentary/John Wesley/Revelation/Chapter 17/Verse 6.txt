<p><em>And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints</em> — So that Rome may well be called, "The slaughter-house of the martyrs." She hath shed much Christian blood in every age; but at length she is even drunk with it, at the time to which this vision refers.</p>
<p><em>The witnesses of Jesus</em> — The preachers of his word.</p>
<p><em>And I wondered exceedingly</em> — At her cruelty and the patience of God.</p>
