<p>The beast which thou sawest (namely, verse3) <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+17:3">Revelation 17:3</span> was, etc.-This is a very observable and punctual description of the beast, verses8,10, 11. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8,10,11">Revelation 17:8,10,11</span>His whole duration is here divided into three periods, which are expressed in a fourfold manner. I. He, 1. Was; 2And is not; 3. And will ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition. II. He, 1. Was; 2. And is not; 3. And will be again. III. The seven heads are seven hills and seven kings: 1. Five are fallen; 2. One is; 3. The other is not come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space. IV. He, 1. Was; 2. And is not; 3Even he is the eighth, and is one of the seven, and goeth into perdition. The first of these three is described in the thirteenth chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1-18">Revelation 13:1-18</span> This was past when the angel spoke to St. John. The second was then in its course; the third woe to come.</p>
<p><em>And is not</em> — The fifth phial brought darkness upon his kingdom: the woman took this advantage to seat herself upon him. Then it might be said, He is not. Yet shall he afterwards ascend out of the bottomless pit - Arise again with diabolical strength and fury. But he will not reign long: soon after his ascent he goeth into perdition for ever.</p>
