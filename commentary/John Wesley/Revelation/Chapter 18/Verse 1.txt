<p><em>And I saw another angel coming down out of heaven</em> — Termed another, with respect to him who "came down out of heaven," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+10:1">Revelation 10:1</span>.</p>
<p><em>And the earth was enlightened with his glory</em> — To make his coming more conspicuous. If such be the lustre of the servant, what images can display the majesty of the Lord, who has "thousand thousands" of those glorious attendants "ministering to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand standing before him?"</p>
