Amomum — A shrub whose wood is a fine perfume.And beasts — Cows and oxen.And of chariots — a purely Latin word is here inserted in the Greek. This St. John undoubtedly used on purpose, in describing the luxury of Rome.And of bodies — A common term for slaves.And souls of men — For these also are continually bought and sold at Rome. And this of all others is the most gainful merchandise to the Roman traffickers.
