<p><em>Amomum</em> — A shrub whose wood is a fine perfume.</p>
<p><em>And beasts</em> — Cows and oxen.</p>
<p><em>And of chariots</em> — a purely Latin word is here inserted in the Greek. This St. John undoubtedly used on purpose, in describing the luxury of Rome.</p>
<p><em>And of bodies</em> — A common term for slaves.</p>
<p><em>And souls of men</em> — For these also are continually bought and sold at Rome. And this of all others is the most gainful merchandise to the Roman traffickers.</p>
