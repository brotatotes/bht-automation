<p><em>And he cried, Babylon is fallen</em> — This fall was mentioned before, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>; but is now declared at large.</p>
<p><em>And is become an habitation</em> — A free abode.</p>
<p><em>Of devils, and an hold</em> — A prison.</p>
<p><em>Of every unclean spirit</em> — Perhaps confined there where they had once practised all uncleanness, till the judgment of the great day. How many horrid inhabitants hath desolate Babylon! of invisible beings, devils, and unclean spirits; of visible, every unclean beast, every filthy and hateful bird. Suppose, then, Babylon to mean heathen Rome; what have the Romanists gained, seeing from the time of that destruction, which they say is past, these are to be its only inhabitants for ever.</p>
