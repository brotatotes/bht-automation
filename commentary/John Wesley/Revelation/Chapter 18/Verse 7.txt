As much as she hath glorified herself — By pride, and pomp, and arrogant boasting.And lived deliciously — In all kinds of elegance, luxury, and wantonness.So much torment give her — Proportioning the punishment to the sin.Because she saith in her heart — As did ancient Babylon, Isaiah 47:8,9.I sit — Her usual style. Hence those expressions, "The chair, the see of Rome: he sat so many years." As a queen - Over many kings, "mistress of all churches; the supreme; the infallible; the only spouse of Christ; out of which there is no salvation." And am no widow - But the spouse of Christ.And shall see no sorrow — From the death of my children, or any other calamity; for God himself will defend "the church."
