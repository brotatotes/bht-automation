<p><em>As much as she hath glorified herself</em> — By pride, and pomp, and arrogant boasting.</p>
<p><em>And lived deliciously</em> — In all kinds of elegance, luxury, and wantonness.</p>
<p><em>So much torment give her</em> — Proportioning the punishment to the sin.</p>
<p><em>Because she saith in her heart</em> — As did ancient Babylon, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+47:8,9">Isaiah 47:8,9</span>.</p>
<p><em>I sit</em> — Her usual style. Hence those expressions, "The chair, the see of Rome: he sat so many years." As a queen - Over many kings, "mistress of all churches; the supreme; the infallible; the only spouse of Christ; out of which there is no salvation." And am no widow - But the spouse of Christ.</p>
<p><em>And shall see no sorrow</em> — From the death of my children, or any other calamity; for God himself will defend "the church."</p>
