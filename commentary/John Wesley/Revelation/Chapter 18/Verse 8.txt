Therefore — as both the natural and judicial consequence of this proud security Shall her plagues come - The death of her children, with an incapacity of bearing more.Sorrow — of every kind.And famine — In the room of luxurious plenty: the very things from which she imagined herself to be most safe.For strong is the Lord God who judgeth her — Against whom therefore all her strength, great as it is, will not avail.
