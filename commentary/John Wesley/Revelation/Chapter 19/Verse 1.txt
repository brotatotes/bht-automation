I heard a loud voice of a great multitude — Whose blood the great whore had shed.Saying, Hallelujah — This Hebrew word signifies, Praise ye Jah, or Him that is. God named himself to Moses, EHEIEH, that is, I will be, Exodus 3:14; and at the same time, "Jehovah," that is, "He that is, and was, and is to come:" during the trumpet of the seventh angel, he is styled, "He that is and was," Revelation 16:5; and not "He that is to come;" because his long-expected coming is under this trumpet actually present. At length he is styled, "Jah," "He that is;" the past together with the future being swallowed up in the present, the former things being no more mentioned, for the greatness of those that now are. This title is of all others the most peculiar to the everlasting God.The salvation — Is opposed to the destruction which the great whore had brought upon the earth.His power and glory — Appear from the judgment executed on her, and from the setting up his kingdom to endure through all ages.
