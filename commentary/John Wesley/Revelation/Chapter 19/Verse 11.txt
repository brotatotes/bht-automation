And I saw the heaven opened — This is a new and peculiar opening of it, in order to show the magnificent expedition of Christ and his attendants, against his great adversary.And behold a white horse — Many little regarded Christ, when he came meek, "riding upon an ass;" but what will they say, when he goes forth upon his white horse, with the sword of his mouth? White - Such as generals use in solemn triumph.And he that sitteth on him, called Faithful — In performing all his promises.And True — In executing all his threatenings.And in righteousness — With the utmost justice.He judgeth and maketh war — Often the sentence and execution go together.
