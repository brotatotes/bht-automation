<p><em>And I saw the heaven opened</em> — This is a new and peculiar opening of it, in order to show the magnificent expedition of Christ and his attendants, against his great adversary.</p>
<p><em>And behold a white horse</em> — Many little regarded Christ, when he came meek, "riding upon an ass;" but what will they say, when he goes forth upon his white horse, with the sword of his mouth? White - Such as generals use in solemn triumph.</p>
<p><em>And he that sitteth on him, called Faithful</em> — In performing all his promises.</p>
<p><em>And True</em> — In executing all his threatenings.</p>
<p><em>And in righteousness</em> — With the utmost justice.</p>
<p><em>He judgeth and maketh war</em> — Often the sentence and execution go together.</p>
