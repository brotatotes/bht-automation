And his eyes are a flame of fire — They were said to be as or like a flame of fire, before, Revelation 1:14; an emblem of his omniscience.And upon his head are many diadems — For he is king of all nations.And he hath a name written, which none knoweth but himself — As God he is incomprehensible to every creature.
