<p><em>The false prophet, who had wrought the miracles before him</em> — And therefore shared in his punishment; these two ungodly men were cast alive - Without undergoing bodily death.</p>
<p><em>Into the lake of fire</em> — And that before the devil himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10">Revelation 20:10</span>. Here is the last of the beast. After several repeated strokes of omnipotence, he is gone alive into hell. There were two that went alive into heaven; perhaps there are two that go alive into hell. It may be, Enoch and Elijah entered at once into glory, without first waiting in paradise; the beast and the false prophet plunge at once into the extremest degree of torment, without being reserved in chains of darkness till the judgment of the great day. Surely, none but the beast of Rome would have hardened himself thus against the God he pretended to adore, or refused to have repented under such dreadful, repeated visitations! Well is he styled a beast, from his carnal and vile affections; a wild beast, from his savage and cruel spirit! The rest were slain - A like difference is afterwards made between the devil, and Gog and Magog, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+20:9,10">Revelation 20:9,10</span>.</p>
