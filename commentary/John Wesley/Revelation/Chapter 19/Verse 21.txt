<p>Here is a most magnificent description of the overthrow of the beast and his adherents. It has, in particular, one exquisite beauty; that, after exhibiting the two opposite armies, and all the apparatus for a battle, verses11-19; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+19:11-19">Revelation 19:11-19</span> then follows immediately, verse20,19:20 the account of the victory, without one word of an engagement or fighting. Here is the most exact propriety; for what struggle can there be between omnipotence, and the power of all the creation united against it! Every description must have fallen short of this admirable silence.</p>
