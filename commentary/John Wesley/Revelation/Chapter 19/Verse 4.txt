<p><em>And the four and twenty elders, and the four living creatures felt down</em> â€” The living creatures are nearer the throne than the elders. Accordingly they are mentioned before them, with the praise they render to God, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+4:9,10">Revelation 4:9,10</span>; 5:8,14; inasmuch as there the praise moves from the centre to the circumference. But here, when God's judgments are fulfilled, it moves back from the circumference to the centre. Here, therefore, the four and twenty elders are named before the living creatures.</p>
