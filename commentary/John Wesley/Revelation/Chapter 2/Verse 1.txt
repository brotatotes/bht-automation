<p><em>Write</em> — So Christ dictated to him every word.</p>
<p><em>These things saith he who holdeth the seven stars in his right hand</em> — Such is his mighty power!

Who walketh - According to his promise, "I am with you always, even to the end of the world." In the midst of the golden candlesticks - Beholding all their works and thoughts, and ready to "remove the candlestick out of its place," if any, being warned, will not repent. Perhaps here is likewise an allusion to the office of the priests in dressing the lamps, which was to keep them always burning before the Lord.</p>
