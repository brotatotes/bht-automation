<p>The first and last words of this verse are particularly directed to the minister; whence we may gather, that his suffering and the affliction of the church were at the same time, and of the same continuance.</p>
<p><em>Fear none of those things which thou art about to suffer</em> — Probably by means of the false Jews.</p>
<p><em>Behold</em> — This intimates the nearness of the affliction. Perhaps the ten days began on the very day that the Revelation was read at Smyrna, or at least very soon after.</p>
<p><em>The devil</em> — Who sets all persecutors to work; and these more particularly.</p>
<p><em>Is about to cast some of you</em> — Christians at Smyrna; where, in the first ages, the blood of many martyrs was shed.</p>
<p><em>Into prison, that ye may be tried</em> — To your unspeakable advantage, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:12,14">1 Peter 4:12,14</span>.</p>
<p><em>And ye shall have affliction</em> — Either in your own persons, or by sympathizing with your brethren.</p>
<p><em>Ten days</em> — (Literally taken) in the end of Domitian's persecution, which was stopped by the edict of the emperor Nerva.</p>
<p><em>Be thou faithful</em> — Our Lord does not say, "till I come," as in the other letters, but unto death - Signifying that the angel of this church should quickly after seal his testimony with his blood; fifty years before the martyrdom of Polycarp, for whom some have mistaken him.</p>
<p><em>And I will give thee the crown of life</em> — The peculiar reward of them who are faithful unto death.</p>
