The first and last words of this verse are particularly directed to the minister; whence we may gather, that his suffering and the affliction of the church were at the same time, and of the same continuance.Fear none of those things which thou art about to suffer — Probably by means of the false Jews.Behold — This intimates the nearness of the affliction. Perhaps the ten days began on the very day that the Revelation was read at Smyrna, or at least very soon after.The devil — Who sets all persecutors to work; and these more particularly.Is about to cast some of you — Christians at Smyrna; where, in the first ages, the blood of many martyrs was shed.Into prison, that ye may be tried — To your unspeakable advantage, 1 Peter 4:12,14.And ye shall have affliction — Either in your own persons, or by sympathizing with your brethren.Ten days — (Literally taken) in the end of Domitian's persecution, which was stopped by the edict of the emperor Nerva.Be thou faithful — Our Lord does not say, "till I come," as in the other letters, but unto death - Signifying that the angel of this church should quickly after seal his testimony with his blood; fifty years before the martyrdom of Polycarp, for whom some have mistaken him.And I will give thee the crown of life — The peculiar reward of them who are faithful unto death.
