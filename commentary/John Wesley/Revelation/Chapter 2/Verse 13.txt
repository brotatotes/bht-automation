<p><em>Where the throne of Satan is</em> — Pergamos was above measure given to idolatry: so Satan had his throne and full residence there.</p>
<p><em>Thou holdest fast my name</em> — Openly and resolutely confessing me before men.</p>
<p><em>Even in the days wherein Antipas</em> — Martyred under Domitian.</p>
<p><em>Was my faithful witness</em> — Happy is he to whom Jesus, the faithful and true witness, giveth such a testimony!</p>
