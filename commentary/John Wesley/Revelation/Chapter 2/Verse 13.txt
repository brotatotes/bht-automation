Where the throne of Satan is — Pergamos was above measure given to idolatry: so Satan had his throne and full residence there.Thou holdest fast my name — Openly and resolutely confessing me before men.Even in the days wherein Antipas — Martyred under Domitian.Was my faithful witness — Happy is he to whom Jesus, the faithful and true witness, giveth such a testimony!
