<p><em>If not, I come to thee</em> — who wilt not wholly escape when I punish them.</p>
<p><em>And will fight with them</em> — Not with the Nicolaitans, who are mentioned only by the by, but the followers of Balaam.</p>
<p><em>With the sword of my mouth</em> — With my just and fierce displeasure. Balaam himself was first withstood by the angel of the Lord with "his sword drawn," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:23">Numbers 22:23</span>, and afterwards "slain with the sword," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="nu+31:8">Numbers 31:8</span>.</p>
