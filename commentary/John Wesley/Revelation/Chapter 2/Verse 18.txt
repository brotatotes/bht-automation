And to the angel of the church at Thyatira — Where the faithful were but a little flock.These things saith the Son of God — See how great he is, who appeared "like a son of man!" Revelation 1:13.Who hath eyes as a flame of fire — "Searching the reins and the heart," verse23. Revelation 2:23 And feet like fine brass - Denoting his immense strength. Job comprises both these, his wisdom to discern whatever is amiss, and his power to avenge it, in one sentence, Job 42:2, "No thought is hidden from him, and he can do all things."
