I know thy love — How different a character is this from that of the angel of the church at Ephesus! The latter could not bear the wicked, and hated the works of the Nicolaitans; but had left his first love and first works. The former retained his first love, and had more and more works, but did bear the wicked, did not withstand them with becoming vehemence. Mixed characters both; yet the latter, not the former, is reproved for his fall, and commanded to repent.And faith, and thy service, and patience — Love is shown, exercised, and improved by serving God and our neighbour; so is faith by patience and good works.
