<p><em>But thou sufferest that woman Jezebel</em> — who ought not to teach at all, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:12">1 Timothy 2:12</span>.</p>
<p><em>To teach and seduce my servants</em> — At Pergamos were many followers of Balaam; at Thyatira, one grand deceiver. Many of the ancients have delivered, that this was the wife of the pastor himself. Jezebel of old led the people of God to open idolatry. This Jezebel, fitly called by her name, from the resemblance between their works, led them to partake in the idolatry of the heathens. This she seems to have done by first enticing them to fornication, just as Balaam did: whereas at Pergamos they were first enticed to idolatry, and afterwards to fornication.</p>
