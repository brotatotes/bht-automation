<p>It is not possible for any to recover the first love, but by taking these three steps, 1. Remember: 2. Repent: 3.</p>
<p><em>Do the first works. Remember from whence thou art fallen</em> — From what degree of faith, love, holiness, though perhaps insensibly.</p>
<p><em>And repent</em> — Which in the very lowest sense implies a deep and lively conviction of thy fall. Of the seven angels, two, at Ephesus and at Pergamos, were in a mixed state; two, at Sardis and at Laodicea, were greatly corrupted: all these are exhorted to repent; as are the followers of Jezebel at Thyatira: two, at Smyrna and Philadelphia, were in a flourishing state, and are therefore only exhorted to steadfastness. There can be no state, either of any pastor, church, or single person, which has not here suitable instructions. All, whether ministers or hearers, together with their secret or open enemies, in all places and all ages, may draw hence necessary self-knowledge, reproof, commendation, warning, or confirmation. Whether any be as dead as the angel at Sardis, or as much alive as the angel at Philadelphia, this book is sent to him, and the Lord Jesus hath something to say to him therein. For the seven churches with their angels represent the whole Christian church, dispersed throughout the whole world, as it subsists, not, as some have imagined, in one age after another, but in every age. This is a point of deep importance, and always necessary to be remembered: that these seven churches are, as it were, a sample of the whole church of Christ, as it was then, as it is now, and as it will be in all ages.</p>
<p><em>Do the first works</em> — Outwardly and inwardly, or thou canst never regain the first love.</p>
<p><em>But if not</em> — By this word is the warning sharpened to those five churches which are called to repent; for if Ephesus was threatened, how much more shall Sardis and Laodicea be afraid! And according as they obey the call or not, there is a promise or a threatening, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+2:5,16,22">Revelation 2:5,16,22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+3:3,20">Revelation 3:3,20</span>. But even in the threatening the promise is implied, in case of true repentance.</p>
<p><em>I come to thee, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place</em> — I will remove, unless thou repent, the flock now under thy care to another place, where they shall be better taken care of. But from the flourishing state of the church of Ephesus after this, there is reason to believe he did repent.</p>
