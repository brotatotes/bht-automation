I know thy affliction and poverty — A poor prerogative in the eyes of the world! The angel at Philadelphia likewise had in their sight but "a little strength." And yet these two were the most honourable of all in the eyes of the Lord.But thou art rich — In faith and love, of more value than all the kingdoms of the earth.Who say they are Jews — God's own people.And are not — They are not Jews inwardly, not circumcised in heart.But a synagogue of Satan — Who, like them, was a liar and a murderer from the beginning.
