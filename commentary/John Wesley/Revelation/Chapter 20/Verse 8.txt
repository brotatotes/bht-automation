And shall go forth to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth — (That is, in all the earth)-the more diligently, as he hath been so long restrained, and knoweth he hath but a small time.Gog and Magog — Magog, the second son of Japhet, is the father of the innumerable northern nations toward the east. The prince of these nations, of which the bulk of that army will consist, is termed Gog by Ezekiel also, Ezekiel 38:2.

The Revelation speaks of this the more briefly, because it had been so particularly described by Ezekiel.Whose number is as the sand of the sea — Immensely numerous: a proverbial expression.
