<p><em>And shall go forth to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth</em> — (That is, in all the earth)-the more diligently, as he hath been so long restrained, and knoweth he hath but a small time.</p>
<p><em>Gog and Magog</em> — Magog, the second son of Japhet, is the father of the innumerable northern nations toward the east. The prince of these nations, of which the bulk of that army will consist, is termed Gog by Ezekiel also, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="eze+38:2">Ezekiel 38:2</span>. Both Gog and Magog signify high or lifted up; a name well suiting both the prince and people. When that fierce leader of many nations shall appear, then will his own name be known.</p>
<p><em>To gather them</em> — Both Gog and his armies. Of Gog, little more is said, as being soon mingled with the rest in the common slaughter. The Revelation speaks of this the more briefly, because it had been so particularly described by Ezekiel.</p>
<p><em>Whose number is as the sand of the sea</em> — Immensely numerous: a proverbial expression.</p>
