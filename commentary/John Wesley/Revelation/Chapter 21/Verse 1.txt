<p><em>And I saw</em> — So it runs, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+19:11">Revelation 19:11</span>; 20:1,4,11, in a succession. All these several representations follow one another in order: so the vision reaches into eternity.</p>
<p><em>A new heaven and a new earth</em> — After the resurrection and general judgment. St. John is not now describing a flourishing state of the church, but a new and eternal state of all things.</p>
<p><em>For the first heaven and the first earth</em> — Not only the lowest part of heaven, not only the solar system, but the whole ethereal heaven, with all its host, whether of planets or fixed stars, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+34:4">Isaiah 34:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span>. All the former things will be done away, that all may become new, verses4,5; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:10,12">2 Peter 3:10,12</span>.</p>
<p><em>Are passed away</em> — But in the fourth verse it is said, "are gone away." There the stronger word is used; for death, mourning, and sorrow go away all together: the former heaven and earth only pass away, giving place to the new heaven and the new earth.</p>
