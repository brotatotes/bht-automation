<p><em>And he carried me away in the spirit</em> — The same expression as before, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+17:3">Revelation 17:3</span>.</p>
<p><em>And showed me the holy city Jerusalem</em> — The old city is now forgotten, so that this is no longer termed the new, but absolutely Jerusalem. O how did St. John long to enter in! but the time was not yet come. Ezekiel also describes "the holy city," and what pertains thereto, xl.-xlviii. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="eze+40:1">Ezekiel 40:1</span>-Eze but a city quite different from the old Jerusalem, as it was either before or after the Babylonish captivity. The descriptions of the prophet and of the apostle agree in many particulars; but in many more they differ. Ezekiel expressly describes the temple, and the worship of God therein, closely alluding to the Levitical service. But St. John saw no temple, and describes the city far more large, glorious, and heavenly than the prophet. Yet that which he describes is the same city; but as it subsisted soon after the destruction of the beast. This being observed, both the prophecies agree together and one may explain the other.</p>
