And the nations — The whole verse is taken from Isaiah 60:3.Shall walk by the light thereof — Which throws itself outward from the city far and near.And the kings of the earth — Those of them who have a part there.Bring their glory into it — Not their old glory, which is now abolished; but such as becomes the new earth, and receives an immense addition by their entrance into the city.
