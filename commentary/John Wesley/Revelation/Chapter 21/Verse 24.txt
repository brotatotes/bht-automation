<p><em>And the nations</em> — The whole verse is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:3">Isaiah 60:3</span>.</p>
<p><em>Shall walk by the light thereof</em> — Which throws itself outward from the city far and near.</p>
<p><em>And the kings of the earth</em> — Those of them who have a part there.</p>
<p><em>Bring their glory into it</em> — Not their old glory, which is now abolished; but such as becomes the new earth, and receives an immense addition by their entrance into the city.</p>
