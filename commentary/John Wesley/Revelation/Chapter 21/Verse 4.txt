And death shall be no more — This is a full proof that this whole description belongs not to time, but eternity.Neither shall sorrow, or crying, or pain, be any more: for the former things are gone away — Under the former heaven, and upon the former earth, there was death and sorrow, crying and pain; all which occasioned many tears: but now pain and sorrow are fled away, and the saints have everlasting life and joy.
