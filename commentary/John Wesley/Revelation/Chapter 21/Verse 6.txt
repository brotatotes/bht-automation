And he — That sat upon the throne.Said to me, It is done — All that the prophets had spoken; all that was spoken, Revelation 4:1. We read this expression twice in this prophecy: first, Revelation 16:17, at the fulfilling of the wrath of God; and here, at the making all things new.I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end — The latter explains the former: the Everlasting.I will give to him that thirsteth — The Lamb saith the same, Revelation 22:17.
