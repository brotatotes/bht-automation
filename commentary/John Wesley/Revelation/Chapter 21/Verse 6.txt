<p><em>And he</em> — That sat upon the throne.</p>
<p><em>Said to me, It is done</em> — All that the prophets had spoken; all that was spoken, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1">Revelation 4:1</span>. We read this expression twice in this prophecy: first, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+16:17">Revelation 16:17</span>, at the fulfilling of the wrath of God; and here, at the making all things new.</p>
<p><em>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end</em> — The latter explains the former: the Everlasting.</p>
<p><em>I will give to him that thirsteth</em> — The Lamb saith the same, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+22:17">Revelation 22:17</span>.</p>
