<p><em>He that overcometh</em> — Which is more than, "he that thirsteth." Shall inherit these things - Which I have made new.</p>
<p><em>I will be his God, and he shall be my son</em> — Both in the Hebrew and Greek language, in which the scriptures were written, what we translate shall and will are one and the same word. The only difference consists in an English translation, or in the want of knowledge in him that interprets what he does not understand.</p>
