<p><em>I</em> — Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><em>Come quickly</em> — To judge the world.</p>
<p><em>And my reward is with me</em> — The rewards which I assign both to the righteous and the wicked are given at my coming.</p>
<p><em>To give to every man according as his work</em> — His whole inward and outward behaviour shall be.</p>
