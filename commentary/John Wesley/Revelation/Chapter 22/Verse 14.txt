<p><em>Happy are they that do his commandments</em> — His, who saith, I come - He speaks of himself.</p>
<p><em>That they may have right</em> — Through his gracious covenant.</p>
<p><em>To the tree of life</em> — To all the blessings signified by it. When Adam broke his commandment, he was driven from the tree of life. They who keep his commandments" shall eat thereof.</p>
