I Jesus have sent my angel to testify these things — Primarily.To you — The seven angels of the churches; then to those churches - and afterwards to all other churches in succeeding ages.I — as God.Am the root — And source of David's family and kingdom; as man, an descended from his loins. "I am the star out of Jacob," Numbers 24:17; like the bright morning star, who put an end to the night of ignorance, sin, and sorrow, and usher in an eternal day of light, purity, and joy.
