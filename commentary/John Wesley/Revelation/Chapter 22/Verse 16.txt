<p><em>I Jesus have sent my angel to testify these things</em> — Primarily.</p>
<p><em>To you</em> — The seven angels of the churches; then to those churches - and afterwards to all other churches in succeeding ages.</p>
<p><em>I</em> — as God.</p>
<p><em>Am the root</em> — And source of David's family and kingdom; as man, an descended from his loins. "I am the star out of Jacob," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="nu+24:17">Numbers 24:17</span>; like the bright morning star, who put an end to the night of ignorance, sin, and sorrow, and usher in an eternal day of light, purity, and joy.</p>
