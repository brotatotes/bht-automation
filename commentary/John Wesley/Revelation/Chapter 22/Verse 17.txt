The Spirit and the bride — The Spirit of adoption in the bride, in the heart of every true believer.Say — With earnest desire and expectation.Come — And accomplish all the words of this prophecy.And let him that thirsteth, come — Here they also who are farther off are invited.And whosoever will, let him take the water of life — He may partake of my spiritual and unspeakable blessings, as freely as he makes use of the most common refreshments; as freely as he drinks of the running stream.
