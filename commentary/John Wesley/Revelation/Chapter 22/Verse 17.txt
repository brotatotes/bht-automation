<p><em>The Spirit and the bride</em> — The Spirit of adoption in the bride, in the heart of every true believer.</p>
<p><em>Say</em> — With earnest desire and expectation.</p>
<p><em>Come</em> — And accomplish all the words of this prophecy.</p>
<p><em>And let him that thirsteth, come</em> — Here they also who are farther off are invited.</p>
<p><em>And whosoever will, let him take the water of life</em> — He may partake of my spiritual and unspeakable blessings, as freely as he makes use of the most common refreshments; as freely as he drinks of the running stream.</p>
