In the midst of the street — Here is the paradise of God, mentioned, Revelation 2:7.Is the tree of life — Not one tree only, but many.Every month — That is, in inexpressible abundance. The variety, likewise, as well as the abundance of the fruits of the Spirit, may be intimated thereby.And the leaves are for the healing of the nations — For the continuing their health, not the restoring it; for no sickness is there.
