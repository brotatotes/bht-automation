<p><em>In the midst of the street</em> — Here is the paradise of God, mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+2:7">Revelation 2:7</span>.</p>
<p><em>Is the tree of life</em> — Not one tree only, but many.</p>
<p><em>Every month</em> — That is, in inexpressible abundance. The variety, likewise, as well as the abundance of the fruits of the Spirit, may be intimated thereby.</p>
<p><em>And the leaves are for the healing of the nations</em> — For the continuing their health, not the restoring it; for no sickness is there.</p>
