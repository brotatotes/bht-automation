<p><em>He that testifieth these things</em> — Even all that is contained in this book.</p>
<p><em>Saith</em> — For the encouragement of the church in all her afflictions.</p>
<p><em>Yea</em> — Answering the call of the Spirit and the bride.</p>
<p><em>I come quickly</em> — To destroy all her enemies, and establish her in a state of perfect and everlasting happiness. The apostle expresses his earnest desire and hope of this, by answering, Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!</p>
