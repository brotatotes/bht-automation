He that testifieth these things — Even all that is contained in this book.Saith — For the encouragement of the church in all her afflictions.Yea — Answering the call of the Spirit and the bride.I come quickly — To destroy all her enemies, and establish her in a state of perfect and everlasting happiness. The apostle expresses his earnest desire and hope of this, by answering, Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!
