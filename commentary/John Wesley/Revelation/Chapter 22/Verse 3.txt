And there shall be no more curse — But pure life and blessing; every effect of the displeasure of God for sin being now totally removed.But the throne of God and the Lamb shall be in it — That is, the glorious presence and reign of God.And his servants — The highest honour in the universe.Shalt worship him — The noblest employment.
