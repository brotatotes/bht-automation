<p><em>And there shall be no more curse</em> — But pure life and blessing; every effect of the displeasure of God for sin being now totally removed.</p>
<p><em>But the throne of God and the Lamb shall be in it</em> — That is, the glorious presence and reign of God.</p>
<p><em>And his servants</em> — The highest honour in the universe.</p>
<p><em>Shalt worship him</em> — The noblest employment.</p>
