<p><em>And shall see his face</em> — Which was not granted to Moses. They shall have the nearest access to, and thence the highest resemblance of, him. This is the highest expression in the language of scripture to denote the most perfect happiness of the heavenly state, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>.</p>
<p><em>And his name shall be on their foreheads</em> — Each of them shall be openly acknowledged as God's own property, and his glorious nature most visibly shine forth in them.</p>
<p><em>And they shall reign</em> — But who are the subjects of these kings? The other inhabitants of the new earth. For there must needs be an everlasting difference between those who when on earth excelled in virtue, and those comparatively slothful and unprofitable servants, who were just saved as by fire. The kingdom of God is taken by force; but the prize is worth all the labour. Whatever of high, lovely, or excellent is in all the monarchies of the earth is all together not a grain of dust, compared to the glory of the children of God. God "is not ashamed to be called their God, for whom he hath prepared this city." But who shall come up into his holy place? "They who keep his commandments," verse14. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+22:14">Revelation 22:14</span></p>
