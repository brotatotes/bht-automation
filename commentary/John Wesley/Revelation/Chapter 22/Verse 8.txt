I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel â€” The very same words which occur, Revelation 19:10. The reproof of the angel, likewise, See thou do it not|, for I am thy fellowservant, is expressed in the very same terms as before. May it not be the very same incident which is here related again? Is not this far more probable, than that the apostle would commit a fault again, of which he had been so solemnly warned before?
