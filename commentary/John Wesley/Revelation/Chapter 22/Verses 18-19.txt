<p><em>I testify to every one, …</em> — From the fulness of his heart, the apostle utters this testimony, this weighty admonition, not only to the churches of Asia, but to all who should ever hear this book. He that adds, all the plagues shall be added to him; he that takes from it, all the blessings shall be taken from him; and, doubtless, this guilt is incurred by all those who lay hinderances in the way of the faithful, which prevent them from hearing their Lord's "I come," and answering, "Come, Lord Jesus." This may likewise be considered as an awful sanction, given to the whole New Testament; in like manner as Moses guarded the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="de+4:2">Deuteronomy 4:2</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="de+12:32">Deuteronomy 12:32</span>; and as God himself did, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:4">Malachi 4:4</span>, in closing the canon of the Old Testament.</p>
