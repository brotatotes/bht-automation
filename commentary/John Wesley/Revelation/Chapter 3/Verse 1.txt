The seven spirits of God — The Holy Spirit, from whom alone all spiritual life and strength proceed.And the seven stars — which are subordinate to him.Thou hast a name that thou livest — A fair reputation, a goodly outside appearance. But that Spirit seeth through all things, and every empty appearance vanishes before him.
