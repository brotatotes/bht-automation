<p><em>The seven spirits of God</em> — The Holy Spirit, from whom alone all spiritual life and strength proceed.</p>
<p><em>And the seven stars</em> — which are subordinate to him.</p>
<p><em>Thou hast a name that thou livest</em> — A fair reputation, a goodly outside appearance. But that Spirit seeth through all things, and every empty appearance vanishes before him.</p>
