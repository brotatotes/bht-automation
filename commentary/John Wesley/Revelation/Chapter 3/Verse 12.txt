I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God — I will fix him as beautiful, as useful, and as immovable as a pillar in the church of God.And he shall go out no more — But shall be holy and happy for ever.And I will write upon him the name of my God — So that the nature and image of God shall appear visibly upon him.And the name of the city of my God — Giving him a title to dwell in the New Jerusalem. And my new name - A share in that joy which I entered into, after overcoming all my enemies.
