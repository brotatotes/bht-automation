<p><em>I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God</em> — I will fix him as beautiful, as useful, and as immovable as a pillar in the church of God.</p>
<p><em>And he shall go out no more</em> — But shall be holy and happy for ever.</p>
<p><em>And I will write upon him the name of my God</em> — So that the nature and image of God shall appear visibly upon him.</p>
<p><em>And the name of the city of my God</em> — Giving him a title to dwell in the New Jerusalem. And my new name - A share in that joy which I entered into, after overcoming all my enemies.</p>
