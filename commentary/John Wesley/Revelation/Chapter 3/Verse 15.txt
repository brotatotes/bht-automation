<p><em>I know thy works</em> — Thy disposition and behaviour, though thou knowest it not thyself.</p>
<p><em>That thou art neither cold</em> — An utter stranger to the things of God, having no care or thought about them.</p>
<p><em>Nor hot</em> — As boiling water: so ought we to be penetrated and heated by the fire of love.</p>
<p><em>O that thou wert</em> — This wish of our Lord plainly implies that he does not work on us irresistibly, as the fire does on the water which it heats.</p>
<p><em>Cold or hot</em> — Even if thou wert cold, without any thought or profession of religion, there would be more hope of thy recovery.</p>
