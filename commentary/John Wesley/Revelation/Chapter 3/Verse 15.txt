I know thy works — Thy disposition and behaviour, though thou knowest it not thyself.That thou art neither cold — An utter stranger to the things of God, having no care or thought about them.Nor hot — As boiling water: so ought we to be penetrated and heated by the fire of love.O that thou wert — This wish of our Lord plainly implies that he does not work on us irresistibly, as the fire does on the water which it heats.Cold or hot — Even if thou wert cold, without any thought or profession of religion, there would be more hope of thy recovery.
