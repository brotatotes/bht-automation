I counsel thee — who art poor, and blind, and naked.To buy of me — Without money or price.Gold purified in the fire — True, living faith, which is purified in the furnace of affliction.And white raiment — True holiness.And eyesalve — Spiritual illumination; the "unction of the Holy One," which teacheth all things.
