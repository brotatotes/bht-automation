<p><em>I stand at the door, and knock</em> — Even at this instant; while he is speaking this word.</p>
<p><em>If any man open</em> — Willingly receive me.</p>
<p><em>I will sup with him</em> — Refreshing him with my graces and gifts, and delighting myself in what I have given.</p>
<p><em>And he with me</em> — In life everlasting.</p>
