<p><em>They shall walk with me in white</em> — in joy; in perfect holiness; in glory.</p>
<p><em>They are worthy</em> — A few good among many bad are doubly acceptable to God. O how much happier is this worthiness than that mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+16:6">Revelation 16:6</span>.</p>
