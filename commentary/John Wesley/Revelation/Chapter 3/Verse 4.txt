Yet thou hast a few names — That is, persons. But though few, they had not separated themselves from the rest; otherwise, the angel of Sardis would not have had them. Yet it was no virtue of his, that they were unspotted; whereas it was his fault that they were but few.Who have not defiled their garments — Either by spotting themselves, or by partaking of other men's sins.They shall walk with me in white — in joy; in perfect holiness; in glory.They are worthy — A few good among many bad are doubly acceptable to God. O how much happier is this worthiness than that mentioned, Revelation 16:6.
