<p><em>He shall be clothed in white raiment</em> — The colour of victory, joy, and triumph.</p>
<p><em>And I will not blot his name out of the book of life</em> — Like that of the angel of the church at Sardis: but he shall live for ever.</p>
<p><em>I will confess his name</em> — As one of my faithful servants and soldiers.</p>
