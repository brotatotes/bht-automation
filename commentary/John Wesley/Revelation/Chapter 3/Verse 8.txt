<p><em>I have given before thee an opened door</em> — To enter into the joy of thy Lord; and, meantime, to go on unhindered in every good work.</p>
<p><em>Thou hast a little strength</em> — But little outward human strength; a little, poor, mean, despicable company. Yet thou hast kept my word - Both in judgment and practice.</p>
