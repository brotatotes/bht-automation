Revelation 4:9 For thou hast created all things - Creation is the ground of all the works of God: therefore, for this, as well as for his other works, will he be praised to all eternity.And through thy will they were — They began to be. It is to the free, gracious and powerfully-working will of Him who cannot possibly need anything that all things owe their first existence.And are created — That is, continue in being ever since they were created.
