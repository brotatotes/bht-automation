<p><em>And he that sat was in appearance</em> â€” Shone with a visible lustre, like that of sparkling precious stones, such as those which were of old on the high priest's breastplate, and those placed as the foundations of the new Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+21:19,20">Revelation 21:19,20</span>. If there is anything emblematical in the colours of these stones, possibly the jasper, which is transparent and of a glittering white, with an intermixture of beautiful colours, may be a symbol of God's purity, with various other perfections, which shine in all his dispensations. The sardine stone, of a blood-red colour, may be an emblem of his justice, and the vengeance he was about to execute on his enemies. An emerald, being green, may betoken favour to the good; a rainbow, the everlasting covenant. See <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:9">Genesis 9:9</span>. And this being round about the whole breadth of the throne, fixed the distance of those who stood or sat round it.</p>
