<p><em>And out of the throne go forth lightnings</em> — Which affect the sight.</p>
<p><em>Voices</em> — Which affect the hearing.</p>
<p><em>Thunderings</em> — Which cause the whole body to tremble. Weak men account all this terrible; but to the inhabitants of heaven it is a mere source of joy and pleasure, mixed with reverence to the Divine Majesty. Even to the saints on earth these convey light and protection; but to their enemies, terror and destruction.</p>
