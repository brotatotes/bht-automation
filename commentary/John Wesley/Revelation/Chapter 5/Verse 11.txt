And I saw — The many angels.And heard — The voice and the number of them.Round about the elders — So forming the third circle. It is remarkable, that men are represented through this whole vision as nearer to God than any of the angels.And the number of them was — At least two hundred millions, and two millions over. And yet these were but a part of the holy angels. Afterward, Revelation 7:11, St. John heard them all.
