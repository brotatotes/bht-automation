Some think it was Jacob, from whose prophecy the name of Lion is given him, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:9">Genesis 49:9</span>.</p>
<p><em>The Lion of the tribe of Judah</em> — The victorious prince who is, like a lion, able to tear all his enemies in pieces.</p>
<p><em>The root of David</em> — As God, the root and source of David's family, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:1,10">Isaiah 11:1,10</span>.</p>
<p><em>Hath prevailed to open the book</em> — Hath overcome all obstructions, and obtained the honour to disclose the divine counsels.</p>
