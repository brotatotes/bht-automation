<p><em>And I saw</em> — First, Christ in or on the midst of the throne; secondly, the four living creatures making the inner circle round him; and, thirdly, the four and twenty elders making a larger circle round him and them.</p>
<p><em>Standing</em> — He lieth no more; he no more falls on his face; the days of his weakness and mourning are ended. He is now in a posture of readiness to execute all his offices of prophet, priest, and king.</p>
<p><em>As if he had been slain</em> — Doubtless with the prints of the wounds which he once received. And because he was slain, he is worthy to open the book, verse9, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span> to the joy of his own people, and the terror of his enemies.</p>
<p><em>Having seven horns</em> — As a king, the emblem of perfect strength.</p>
<p><em>And seven eyes</em> — The emblem of perfect knowledge and wisdom. By these he accomplishes what is contained in the book, namely, by his almighty and all-wise Spirit. To these seven horns and seven eyes answer the seven seals and the sevenfold song of praise, verse12. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+5:12">Revelation 5:12</span> In Zechariah, likewise, iii9, iv10, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:9">Zechariah 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:10">Zechariah 4:10</span> mention is made of "the seven eyes of the Lord, which go forth over all the earth." Which - Both the horns and the eyes.</p>
<p><em>Are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth</em> — For the effectual working of the Spirit of God goes through the whole creation; and that in the natural, as well as spiritual, world. For could mere matter act or move? Could it gravitate or attract? Just as much as it can think or speak.</p>
