<p><em>And when he took the book, the four living creatures fell down</em> — Now is homage done to the Lamb by every creature. These, together with the elders, make the beginning; and afterward, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+5:14">Revelation 5:14</span>, the conclusion. They are together surrounded with a multitude of angels, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+5:11">Revelation 5:11</span>, and together sing the new song, as they had before praised God together, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+4:8">Revelation 4:8</span>, etc.</p>
<p><em>Having every one</em> — The elders, not the living creatures.</p>
<p><em>An harp</em> — Which was one of the chief instruments used for thanksgiving in the temple service: a fit emblem of the melody of their hearts.</p>
<p><em>And golden phials</em> — Cups or censers.</p>
<p><em>Full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints</em> — Not of the elders themselves, but of the other saints still upon earth, whose prayers were thus emblematically represented in heaven.</p>
