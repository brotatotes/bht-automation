These, together with the elders, make the beginning; and afterward, Revelation 5:14, the conclusion. They are together surrounded with a multitude of angels, Revelation 5:11, and together sing the new song, as they had before praised God together, Revelation 4:8, etc.Having every one — The elders, not the living creatures.An harp — Which was one of the chief instruments used for thanksgiving in the temple service: a fit emblem of the melody of their hearts.And golden phials — Cups or censers.Full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints — Not of the elders themselves, but of the other saints still upon earth, whose prayers were thus emblematically represented in heaven.
