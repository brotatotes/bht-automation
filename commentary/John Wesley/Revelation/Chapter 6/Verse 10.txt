And they cried — This cry did not begin now, but under the first Roman persecution. The Romans themselves had already avenged the martyrs slain by the Jews on that whole nation.How long — They knew their blood would be avenged; but not immediately, as is now shown them.O Lord — The Greek word properly signifies the master of a family: it is therefore beautifully used by these, who are peculiarly of the household of God.Thou Holy One and true — Both the holiness and truth of God require him to execute judgment and vengeance.Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood? — There is no impure affection in heaven: therefore, this desire of theirs is pure and suitable to the will of God. The martyrs are concerned for the praise of their Master, of his holiness and truth: and the praise is given him, Revelation 19:2, where the prayer of the martyrs is changed into a thanksgiving: - Thou holy One and true: "True and right are thy judgments." How long dost thou not judge "He hath judged the great whore, and avenge our blood? and hath avenged the blood of his servants."
