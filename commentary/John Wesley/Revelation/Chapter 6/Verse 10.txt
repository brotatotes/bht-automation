<p><em>And they cried</em> — This cry did not begin now, but under the first Roman persecution. The Romans themselves had already avenged the martyrs slain by the Jews on that whole nation.</p>
<p><em>How long</em> — They knew their blood would be avenged; but not immediately, as is now shown them.</p>
<p><em>O Lord</em> — The Greek word properly signifies the master of a family: it is therefore beautifully used by these, who are peculiarly of the household of God.</p>
<p><em>Thou Holy One and true</em> — Both the holiness and truth of God require him to execute judgment and vengeance.</p>
<p><em>Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood?</em> — There is no impure affection in heaven: therefore, this desire of theirs is pure and suitable to the will of God. The martyrs are concerned for the praise of their Master, of his holiness and truth: and the praise is given him, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+19:2">Revelation 19:2</span>, where the prayer of the martyrs is changed into a thanksgiving: - Thou holy One and true: "True and right are thy judgments." How long dost thou not judge "He hath judged the great whore, and avenge our blood? and hath avenged the blood of his servants."</p>
