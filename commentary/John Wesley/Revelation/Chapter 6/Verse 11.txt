<p><em>And there was given to every one a white robe</em> — An emblem of innocence, joy, and victory, in token of honour and favourable acceptance.</p>
<p><em>And it was said to them</em> — They were told how long. They were not left in that uncertainty.</p>
<p><em>That they should rest</em> — Should cease from crying. They rested from pain before.</p>
<p><em>A time</em> — This word has a peculiar meaning in this book, to denote which, we may retain the original word chronos. Here are two classes of martyrs specified, the former killed under heathen Rome, the latter, under papal Rome. The former are commanded to rest till the latter are added to them. There were many of the former in the days of John: the first fruits of the latter died in the thirteenth century. Now, a time, or chronos, is1111years. This chronos began A. C98, and continued to the year1209; or from Trajan's persecution, to the first crusade against the Waldenses.</p>
<p><em>Till</em> — It is not said, Immediately after this time is expired, vengeance shall be executed; but only, that immediately after this time their brethren and fellowservants will come to them. This event will precede the other; and there will be some space between.</p>
