<p><em>And the heavens departed as a book that is rolled together</em> — When the scripture compares some very great with a little thing, the majesty and omnipotence of God, before whom great things are little, is highly exalted.</p>
<p><em>Every mountain and island</em> — What a mountain is to the land, that an island is to the sea.</p>
