<p><em>And the kings of the earth</em> — They who had been so in their day.</p>
<p><em>And the great men and chief captains</em> — The generals and nobles.</p>
<p><em>Hid themselves</em> — So far as in them lay.</p>
<p><em>In the rocks of the mountains</em> — There are also rocks on the plains; but they were rocks on high, which they besought to fall upon them.</p>
