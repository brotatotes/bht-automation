And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature — Toward the south.Saying, Come. And behold a black horse — A fit emblem of mourning and distress; particularly of black famine, as the ancient poets term it.And he that sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand — When there is great plenty, men scarce think it worth their while to weigh and measure everything, Genesis 41:49. But when there is scarcity, they are obliged to deliver them out by measure and weight, Ezekiel 4:16. Accordingly, these scales signify scarcity. They serve also for a token, that all the fruits of the earth, and consequently the whole heavens, with their courses and influences; that all the seasons of the year, with whatsoever they produce, in nature or states, are subject to Christ. Accordingly his hand is wonderful, not only in wars and victories, but likewise in the whole course of nature.
