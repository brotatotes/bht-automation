And after these things — What follows is a preparation for the seventh seal, which is the weightiest of all. It is connected with the sixth by the particle and; whereas what is added, verse9, Revelation 6:9 stands free and unconnected.I saw four angels — Probably evil ones. They have their employ with the four first trumpets, as have other evil angels with the three last; namely, the angel of the abyss, the four bound in the Euphrates, and Satan himself. These four angels would willingly have brought on all the calamities that follow without delay. But they were restrained till the servants of God were sealed, and till the seven angels were ready to sound: even as the angel of the abyss was not let loose, nor the angels in the Euphrates unbound, neither Satan cast to the earth, till the fifth, sixth, and seventh angels severally sounded.Standing on the four corners of the earth — East, west, south, north. In this order proceed the four first trumpets.Holding the four winds — Which else might have softened the fiery heat, under the first, second, and third trumpet.That the wind should not blow upon the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree — It seems, that these expressions betoken the several quarters of the world; that the earth signifies that to the east of Patmos, Asia, which was nearest to St. John, and where the trumpet of the first angel had its accomplishment. Europe swims in the sea over against this; and is accordingly termed by the prophets, "the islands." The third part, Afric, seems to be meant, Revelation 8:7,8,10, by "the streams of water," or "the trees," which grow plentifully by them.
