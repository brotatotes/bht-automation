And all the angels stood — In waiting.Round about the throne, and the elders and the four living creatures — That is, the living creatures, next the throne; the elders, round these; and the angels, round them both.And they fell on their faces — So do the elders, once only, Revelation 11:16. The heavenly ceremonial has its fixed order and measure.
