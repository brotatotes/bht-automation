<p><em>Amen</em> — With this word all the angels confirm the words of the "great multitude;" but they likewise carry the praise much higher.</p>
<p><em>The blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom, and the thanksgiving, and the honour, and the power, and the strength, be unto our God for ever and ever</em> — Before the Lamb began to open the seven seals, a sevenfold hymn of praise was brought him by many angels, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+5:12">Revelation 5:12</span>. Now he is upon opening the last seal, and the seven angels are going to receive seven trumpets, in order to make the kingdoms of the world subject to God. All the angels give sevenfold praise to God.</p>
