<p><em>My lord</em> — Or, my master; a common term of respect. So Zechariah, likewise, bespeaks the angel, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="zec+1:9">Zechariah 1:9</span>; 4:4; 6:4.</p>
<p><em>Thou knowest</em> — That is, I know not; but thou dost.</p>
<p><em>These are they</em> — Not martyrs; for these are not such a multitude as no man can number. But as all the angels appear here, so do all the souls of the righteous who had lived from the beginning of the world.</p>
<p><em>Who come</em> — He does not say, who did come; but, who come now also: to whom, likewise, pertain all who will come hereafter.</p>
<p><em>Out of great affliction</em> — Of various kinds, wisely and graciously allotted by God to all his children.</p>
<p><em>And have washed their robes</em> — From all guilt.</p>
<p><em>And made them white</em> — In all holiness.</p>
<p><em>By the blood of the Lamb</em> — Which not only cleanses, but adorns us also.</p>
