<p><em>Therefore</em> — Because they came out of great affliction, and have washed their robes in his blood.</p>
<p><em>Are they before the throne</em> — It seems, even nearer than the angels.</p>
<p><em>And serve him day and night</em> — Speaking after the manner of men; that is, continually.</p>
<p><em>In his temple</em> — Which is in heaven.</p>
<p><em>And he shall have his tent over them</em> — Shall spread his glory over them as a covering.</p>
