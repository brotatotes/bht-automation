Therefore — Because they came out of great affliction, and have washed their robes in his blood.Are they before the throne — It seems, even nearer than the angels.And serve him day and night — Speaking after the manner of men; that is, continually.In his temple — Which is in heaven.And he shall have his tent over them — Shall spread his glory over them as a covering.
