<p><em>For the Lamb will feed them</em> — With eternal peace and joy; so that they shall hunger no more.</p>
<p><em>And will lead them to living fountains of water</em> — The comforts of the Holy Ghost; so that they shall thirst no more. Neither shall they suffer or grieve any more; for God "will wipe away all tears from their eyes."</p>
