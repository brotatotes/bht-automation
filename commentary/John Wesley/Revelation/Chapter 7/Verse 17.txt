For the Lamb will feed them — With eternal peace and joy; so that they shall hunger no more.And will lead them to living fountains of water — The comforts of the Holy Ghost; so that they shall thirst no more. Neither shall they suffer or grieve any more; for God "will wipe away all tears from their eyes."
