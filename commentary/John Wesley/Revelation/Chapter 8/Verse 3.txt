<p><em>And</em> — In the second verse, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+7:2">Revelation 7:2</span> the "trumpets were given" to the seven angels; and in the sixth, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="re+7:6">Revelation 7:6</span> they "prepared to sound." But between these, the incense of this angel and the prayers of the saints are mentioned; the interposing of which shows, that the prayers of the saints and the trumpets of the angels go together: and these prayers, with the effects of them, may well be supposed to extend through all the seven.</p>
<p><em>Another angel</em> — Another created angel. Such are all that are here spoken of. In this part of the Revelation, Christ is never termed an angel; but, "the Lamb." Came and stood at the altar - Of burnt-offerings. And there was given him a golden censer-A censer was a cup on a plate or saucer. This was the token and the business of the office. And much incense was given-Incense generally signifies prayer: here it signifies the longing desires of the angels, that the holy counsel of God might be fulfilled. And there was much incense; for as the prayers of all the saints in heaven and earth are here joined together: so are the desires of all the angels which are brought by this angel.</p>
<p><em>That he might place it</em> — It is not said, offer it; for he was discharging the office of an angel, not a priest.</p>
<p><em>With the prayers of all the saints</em> — At the same time; but not for the saints. The angels are fellowservants with the saints, not mediators for them.</p>
