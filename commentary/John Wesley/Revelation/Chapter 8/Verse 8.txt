And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea — By the sea, particularly as it is here opposed to the earth, we may understand the west, or Europe; and chiefly the middle parts of it, the vast Roman empire.

The warlike Goths broke in upon it about the year250: and from that time the irruption of one nation after another never ceased till the very form of the Roman empire, and all but the name, was lost.
