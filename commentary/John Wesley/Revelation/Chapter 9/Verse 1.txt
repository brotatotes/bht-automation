And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star — Far different from that mentioned, Revelation 8:11. This star belongs to the invisible world. The third woe is occasioned by the dragon cast out of heaven; the second takes place at the loosing of the four angels who were bound in the Euphrates. The first is here brought by the angel of the abyss, which is opened by this star, or holy angel.Falling to the earth — Coming swiftly and with great force.And to him was given — when he was come.The key of the bottomless pit — A deep and hideous prison; but different from "the lake of fire."
