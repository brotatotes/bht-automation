<p><em>And there arose a smoke out of the pit</em> — The locusts, who afterwards rise out of it, seem to be, as we shall afterwards see, the Persians; agreeable to which, this smoke is their detestable idolatrous doctrine, and false zeal for it, which now broke out in an uncommon paroxysm.</p>
<p><em>As the smoke of a great furnace</em> — where the clouds of it rise thicker and thicker, spread far and wide, and press one upon another, so that the darkness increases continually.</p>
<p><em>And the sun and the air were darkened</em> — A figurative expression, denoting heavy affliction. This smoke occasioned more and more such darkness over the Jews in Persia.</p>
