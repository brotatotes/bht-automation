And the appearances — This description suits a people neither throughly civilized, nor entirely savage; and such were the Persians of that age.Of the locusts are like horses — With their riders. The Persians excelled in horsemanship.And on their heads are as it were crowns — Turbans.And their faces are as the faces of men — Friendly and agreeable.
