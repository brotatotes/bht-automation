<p>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ-To this introduction the conclusion answers, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:15">Romans 15:15</span>, etc.</p>
<p><em>Called to be an apostle</em> — And made an apostle by that calling. While God calls, he makes what he calls. As the Judaizing teachers disputed his claim to the apostolical office, it is with great propriety that he asserts it in the very entrance of an epistle wherein their principles are entirely overthrown. And various other proper and important thoughts are suggested in this short introduction; particularly the prophecies concerning the gospel, the descent of Jesus from David, the great doctrines of his Godhead and resurrection, the sending the gospel to the gentiles, the privileges of Christians, and the obedience and holiness to which they were obliged in virtue of their profession.</p>
<p><em>Separated</em> — By God, not only from the bulk of other men, from other Jews, from other disciples, but even from other Christian teachers, to be a peculiar instrument of God in spreading the gospel.</p>
