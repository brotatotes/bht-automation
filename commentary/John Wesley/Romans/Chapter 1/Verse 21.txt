Because, knowing God — For the wiser heathens did know that there was one supreme God; yet from low and base considerations they conformed to the idolatry of the vulgar.They did not glorify him as God, neither were thankful — They neither thanked him for his benefits, nor glorified him for his divine perfection.But became vain — Like the idols they worshipped.In their reasonings — Various, uncertain, foolish. What a terrible instance have we of this in the writings of Lucretius! What vain reasonings, and how dark a heart, amidst so pompous professions of wisdom!
