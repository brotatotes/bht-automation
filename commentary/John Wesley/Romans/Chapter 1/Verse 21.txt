<p><em>Because, knowing God</em> — For the wiser heathens did know that there was one supreme God; yet from low and base considerations they conformed to the idolatry of the vulgar.</p>
<p><em>They did not glorify him as God, neither were thankful</em> — They neither thanked him for his benefits, nor glorified him for his divine perfection.</p>
<p><em>But became vain</em> — Like the idols they worshipped.</p>
<p><em>In their reasonings</em> — Various, uncertain, foolish. What a terrible instance have we of this in the writings of Lucretius! What vain reasonings, and how dark a heart, amidst so pompous professions of wisdom!</p>
