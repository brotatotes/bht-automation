<p><em>Wherefore</em> — One punishment of sin is from the very nature of it, as <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:27">Romans 1:27</span>; another, as here, is from vindictive justice.</p>
<p><em>Uncleanness</em> — Ungodliness and uncleanness are frequently joined, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:5">1 Thessalonians 4:5</span> as are the knowledge of God and purity.</p>
<p><em>God gave them up</em> — By withdrawing his restraining grace.</p>
