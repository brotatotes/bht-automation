Wherefore — One punishment of sin is from the very nature of it, as Romans 1:27; another, as here, is from vindictive justice.Uncleanness — Ungodliness and uncleanness are frequently joined, 1 Thessalonians 4:5 as are the knowledge of God and purity.God gave them up — By withdrawing his restraining grace.
