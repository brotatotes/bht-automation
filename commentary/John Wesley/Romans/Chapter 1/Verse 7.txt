<p><em>To all that are in Rome</em> — Most of these were heathens by birth, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:13">Romans 1:13</span>, though with Jews mixed among them. They were scattered up and down in that large city, and not yet reduced into the form of a church. Only some had begun to meet in the house of Aquila and Priscilla.</p>
<p><em>Beloved of God</em> — And from his free love, not from any merit of yours, called by his word and his Spirit to believe in him, and now through faith holy as he is holy.</p>
<p><em>Grace</em> — The peculiar favour of God.</p>
<p><em>And peace</em> — All manner of blessings, temporal, spiritual, and eternal. This is both a Christian salutation and an apostolic benediction.</p>
<p><em>From God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ</em> — This is the usual way wherein the apostles speak, "God the Father," "God our Father." Nor do they often, in speaking of him, use the word Lord, as it implies the proper name of God, Jehovah. In the Old Testament, indeed, the holy men generally said, "The Lord our God;" for they were then, as it were, servants; whereas now they are sons: and sons so well know their father, that they need not frequently mention his proper name. It is one and the same peace, and one and the same grace, which is from God and from Jesus Christ. Our trust and prayer fix on God, as he is the Father of Christ; and on Christ, as he presents us to the Father.</p>
