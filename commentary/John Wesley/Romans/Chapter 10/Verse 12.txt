<p><em>The same Lord of all is rich</em> â€” So that his blessings are never to be exhausted, nor is he ever constrained to hold his hand. The great truth proposed in <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:11">Romans 10:11</span> is so repeated here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:13">Romans 10:13</span>, and farther confirmed, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:14,15">Romans 10:14,15</span>, as not only to imply, that "whosoever calleth upon him shall be saved;" but also that the will of God is, that all should savingly call upon him.</p>
