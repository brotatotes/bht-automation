But hath not Israel known — They might have known, even from Moses and Isaiah, that many of the gentiles would be received, and many of the Jews rejected.I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are not a nation — As they followed gods that were not gods, so he accepted in their stead a nation that was not a nation; that is, a nation that was not in covenant with God.A foolish nation — Such are all which know not God. Deuteronomy 32:21
