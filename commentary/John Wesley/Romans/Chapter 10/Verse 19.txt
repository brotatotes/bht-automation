<p><em>I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are not a nation</em> — As they followed gods that were not gods, so he accepted in their stead a nation that was not a nation; that is, a nation that was not in covenant with God.</p>
<p><em>A foolish nation</em> — Such are all which know not God. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="de+32:21">Deuteronomy 32:21</span></p>
