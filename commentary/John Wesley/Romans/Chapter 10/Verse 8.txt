<p><em>But what saith he</em> — Moses. Even these words, so remarkably applicable to the subject before us. All is done ready to thy hand.</p>
<p><em>The word is nigh thee</em> — Within thy reach; easy to be understood, remembered, practised. This is eminently true of the word of faith - The gospel.</p>
<p><em>Which we preach</em> — The sum of which is, If thy heart believe in Christ, and thy life confess him, thou shalt be saved.</p>
