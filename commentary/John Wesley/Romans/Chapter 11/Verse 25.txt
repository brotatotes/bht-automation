<p><em>Lest ye should be wise in your own conceits</em> — Puffed up with your present advantages; dreaming that ye are the only church; or that the church of Rome cannot fail.</p>
<p><em>Hardness in part is happened to Israel, till</em> — Israel therefore is neither totally nor finally rejected.</p>
<p><em>The fullness of the gentiles be come in</em> — Till there be a vast harvest amongst the heathens.</p>
