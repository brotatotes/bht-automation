St. Paul calls any truth known but to a few, a mystery. Such had been the calling of the gentiles: such was now the conversion of the Jews.Lest ye should be wise in your own conceits — Puffed up with your present advantages; dreaming that ye are the only church; or that the church of Rome cannot fail.Hardness in part is happened to Israel, till — Israel therefore is neither totally nor finally rejected.The fullness of the gentiles be come in — Till there be a vast harvest amongst the heathens.
