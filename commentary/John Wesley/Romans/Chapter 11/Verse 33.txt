<p><em>O the depth of the riches, and wisdom, and knowledge of God</em> — In the ninth chapter, St. Paul had sailed but in a narrow sea: now he is in the ocean. The depth of the riches is described, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:35">Romans 11:35</span>; the depth of wisdom, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:34">Romans 11:34</span>; the depth of knowledge, in the latter part of this verse. Wisdom directs all things to the best end; knowledge sees that end.</p>
<p><em>How unsearchable are his judgments</em> — With regard to unbelievers.</p>
<p><em>His ways</em> — With regard to believers. His ways are more upon a level; His judgments "a great deep." But even his ways we cannot trace.</p>
