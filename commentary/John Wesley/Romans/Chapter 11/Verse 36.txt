<p><em>Of him</em> — As the Creator.</p>
<p><em>Through him</em> — As the Preserver.</p>
<p><em>To him</em> — As the ultimate end, are all things. To him be the glory of his riches, wisdom, knowledge.</p>
<p><em>Amen</em> — A concluding word, in which the affection of the apostle, when it is come to the height, shuts up all.</p>
