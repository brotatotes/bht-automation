<p><em>And be not conformed</em> — Neither in judgment, spirit, nor behaviour.</p>
<p><em>To this world</em> — Which, neglecting the will of God, entirely follows its own.</p>
<p><em>That ye may prove</em> — Know by sure trial; which is easily done by him who has thus presented himself to God.</p>
<p><em>What is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God</em> — The will of God is here to be understood of all the preceptive part of Christianity, which is in itself so excellently good, so acceptable to God, and so perfective of our natures.</p>
