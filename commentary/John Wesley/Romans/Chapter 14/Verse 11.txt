<p><em>As I live</em> — An oath proper to him, because he only possesseth life infinite and independent. It is Christ who is here termed both Lord and God; as it is he to whom we live, and to whom we die.</p>
<p><em>Every tongue shall confess to God</em> — Shall own him as their rightful Lord; which shall then only be accomplished in its full extent. The Lord grant we may find mercy in that day; and may it also be imparted to those who have differed from us! yea, to those who have censured and condemned us for things which we have done from a desire to please him, or refused to do from a fear of offending him. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:23">Isaiah 45:23</span></p>
