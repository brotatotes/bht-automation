<p><em>Thy brother stumbleth</em> — By imitating thee against his conscience, contrary to righteousness.</p>
<p><em>Or is offended</em> — At what thou doest to the loss of his peace.</p>
<p><em>Or made weak</em> — Hesitating between imitation and abhorrence, to the loss of that joy in the Lord which was his strength.</p>
