<p><em>Hast thou faith</em> — That all things are pure? Have it to thyself before God - In circumstances like these, keep it to thyself, and do not offend others by it.</p>
<p><em>Happy is he that condemneth not himself</em> — By an improper use of even innocent things! and happy he who is free from a doubting conscience! He that has this may allow the thing, yet condemn himself for it.</p>
