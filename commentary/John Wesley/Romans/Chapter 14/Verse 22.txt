Hast thou faith — That all things are pure? Have it to thyself before God - In circumstances like these, keep it to thyself, and do not offend others by it.Happy is he that condemneth not himself — By an improper use of even innocent things! and happy he who is free from a doubting conscience! He that has this may allow the thing, yet condemn himself for it.
