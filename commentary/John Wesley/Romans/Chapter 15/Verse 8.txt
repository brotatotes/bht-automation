Now I say — The apostle here shows how Christ received us. Christ Jesus-Jesus is the name, Christ the surname. The latter was first known to the Jews; the former, to the gentiles. Therefore he is styled Jesus Christ, when the words stand in the common, natural order. When the order is inverted, as here, the office of Christ is more solemnly considered.Was a servant — Of his Father.Of the circumcision — For the salvation of the circumcised, the Jews.For the truth of God — To manifest the truth and fidelity of God.
