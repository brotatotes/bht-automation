Salute one another with an holy kiss â€” Termed by St. Peter, "the kiss of love," 1 Peter 5:14. So the ancient Christians concluded all their solemn offices; the men saluting the men, and the women the women. And this apostolical custom seems to have continued for some ages in all Christian churches.
