<p><em>Now to him who is able</em> — The last words of this epistle exactly answer the first, chapter i1-5: <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1-5">Romans 1:1-5</span>: in particular, concerning the power of God, the gospel, Jesus Christ, the scriptures, the obedience of faith, all nations.</p>
<p><em>To establish you</em> — Both Jews and gentiles.</p>
<p><em>According to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ</em> — That is, according to the tenor of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which I preach.</p>
<p><em>According to the revelation of the mystery</em> — Of the calling of the gentiles, which, as plainly as it was foretold in the Prophets, was still hid from many even of the believing Jews.</p>
