According to the commandment — The foundation of the apostolical office.Of the eternal God — A more proper epithet could not be. A new dispensation infers no change in God. Known unto him are all his works, and every variation of them, from eternity.Made known to all nations — Not barely that they might know, but enjoy it also, through obeying the faith.
