<p><em>According to the commandment</em> — The foundation of the apostolical office.</p>
<p><em>Of the eternal God</em> — A more proper epithet could not be. A new dispensation infers no change in God. Known unto him are all his works, and every variation of them, from eternity.</p>
<p><em>Made known to all nations</em> — Not barely that they might know, but enjoy it also, through obeying the faith.</p>
