<p><em>Therefore</em> — The apostle now makes a transition from the gentiles to the Jews, till, at <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:6">Romans 2:6</span>, he comprises both.</p>
<p><em>Thou art inexcusable</em> — Seeing knowledge without practice only increases guilt.</p>
<p><em>O man</em> — Having before spoken of the gentile in the third person, he addresses the Jew in the second person. But he calls him by a common appellation, as not acknowledging him to be a Jew. See verses <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:17,28">Romans 2:17,28</span>.</p>
<p><em>Whosoever thou art that judgest</em> — Censurest, condemnest.</p>
<p><em>For in that thou judgest the other</em> — The heathen.</p>
<p><em>Thou condemnest thyself; for thou doest the same things</em> — In effect; in many instances.</p>
