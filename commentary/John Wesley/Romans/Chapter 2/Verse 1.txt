Therefore — The apostle now makes a transition from the gentiles to the Jews, till, at Romans 2:6, he comprises both.Thou art inexcusable — Seeing knowledge without practice only increases guilt.O man — Having before spoken of the gentile in the third person, he addresses the Jew in the second person. But he calls him by a common appellation, as not acknowledging him to be a Jew. See verses Romans 2:17,28.Whosoever thou art that judgest — Censurest, condemnest.For in that thou judgest the other — The heathen.Thou condemnest thyself; for thou doest the same things — In effect; in many instances.
