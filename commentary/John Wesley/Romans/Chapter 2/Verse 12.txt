<p><em>For as many as have sinned</em> — He speaks as of the time past, for all time will be past at the day of judgment.</p>
<p><em>Without the law</em> — Without having any written law.</p>
<p><em>Shall also perish without the law</em> — Without regard had to any outward law; being condemned by the law written in their hearts. The word also shows the agreement of the manner of sinning, with the manner of suffering.</p>
<p><em>Perish</em> — He could not so properly say, Shall be judged without the law.</p>
