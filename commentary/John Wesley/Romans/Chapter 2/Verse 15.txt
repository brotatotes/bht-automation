<p><em>Who show</em> — To themselves, to other men, and, in a sense, to God himself.</p>
<p><em>The work of the law</em> — The substance, though not the letter, of it.</p>
<p><em>Written on their hearts</em> — By the same hand which wrote the commandments on the tables of stone.</p>
<p><em>Their conscience</em> — There is none of all its faculties which the soul has less in its power than this.</p>
<p><em>Bearing witness</em> — In a trial there are the plaintiff, the defendant, and the witnesses. Conscience and sin itself are witnesses against the heathens. Their thoughts sometimes excuse, sometimes condemn, them.</p>
<p><em>Among themselves</em> — Alternately, like plaintiff and defendant.</p>
<p><em>Accusing or even defending them</em> — The very manner of speaking shows that they have far more room to accuse than to defend.</p>
