Who show — To themselves, to other men, and, in a sense, to God himself.The work of the law — The substance, though not the letter, of it.Written on their hearts — By the same hand which wrote the commandments on the tables of stone.Their conscience — There is none of all its faculties which the soul has less in its power than this.Bearing witness — In a trial there are the plaintiff, the defendant, and the witnesses. Conscience and sin itself are witnesses against the heathens. Their thoughts sometimes excuse, sometimes condemn, them.Among themselves — Alternately, like plaintiff and defendant.Accusing or even defending them — The very manner of speaking shows that they have far more room to accuse than to defend.
