<p><em>But if thou art called a Jew</em> — This highest point of Jewish glorying, after a farther description of it interposed, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:17-20">Romans 2:17-20</span>, and refuted, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:21-24">Romans 2:21-24</span>, is itself refuted, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:25">Romans 2:25</span>, etc. The description consists of twice five articles; of which the former five, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:17,18">Romans 2:17,18</span>, show what he boasts of in himself; the other five, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:19,20">Romans 2:19,20</span>, what he glories in with respect to others. The first particular of the former five answers to the first of the latter; the second, to the second, and so on.</p>
<p><em>And restest in the law</em> — Dependest on it, though it can only condemn thee.</p>
<p><em>And gloriest in God</em> — As thy God; and that, too, to the exclusion of others.</p>
