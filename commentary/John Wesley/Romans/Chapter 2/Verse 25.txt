<p><em>Circumcision indeed profiteth</em> — He does not say, justifies. How far it profited is shown in the third and fourth chapters.</p>
<p><em>Thy circumcision is become uncircumcision</em> — is so already in effect. Thou wilt have no more benefit by it than if thou hadst never received it. The very same observation holds with regard to baptism.</p>
