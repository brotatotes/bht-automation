But he is a Jew — That is, one of God's people.Who is one inwardly — In the secret recesses of his soul. And the acceptable circumcision is that of the heart - Referring to Deuteronomy 30:6; the putting away all inward impurity. This is seated in the spirit, the inmost soul, renewed by the Spirit of God.And not in the letter — Not in the external ceremony.Whose praise is not from men, but from God — The only searcher of the heart.
