<p><em>Treasurest up wrath</em> — Although thou thinkest thou art treasuring up all good things. O what a treasure may a man lay up either way, in this short day of life! To thyself - Not to him whom thou judgest.</p>
<p><em>In the day of wrath, and revelation, and righteous judgment of God</em> — Just opposite to "the goodness and forbearance and longsuffering" of God. When God shall be revealed, then shall also be "revealed" the secrets of men's hearts, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:16">Romans 2:16</span>. Forbearance and revelation respect God, and are opposed to each other; longsuffering and righteous judgment respect the sinner; goodness and wrath are words of a more general import.</p>
