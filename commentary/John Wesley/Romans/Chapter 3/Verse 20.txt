<p><em>No flesh shall be justified</em> — None shall be forgiven and accepted of God.</p>
<p><em>By the works of the law</em> — On this ground, that he hath kept the law. St. Paul means chiefly the moral part of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:9,19">Romans 3:9,19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:21,26">Romans 2:21,26</span>; etc. which alone is not abolished, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:31">Romans 3:31</span>. And it is not without reason, that he so often mentions the works of the law, whether ceremonial or moral; for it was on these only the Jews relied, being wholly ignorant of those that spring from faith. For by the law is only the knowledge of sin - But no deliverance either from the guilt or power of it.</p>
