<p><em>But now the righteousness of God</em> — That is, the manner of becoming righteous which God hath appointed.</p>
<p><em>Without the law</em> — Without that previous obedience which the law requires; without reference to the law, or dependence on it.</p>
<p><em>Is manifested</em> — In the gospel. Being attested by the Law itself, and by the Prophets - By all the promises in the Old Testament.</p>
