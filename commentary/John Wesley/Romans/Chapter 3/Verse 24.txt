And are justified — Pardoned and accepted.Freely — Without any merit of their own.By his grace — Not their own righteousness or works.Through the redemption — The price Christ has paid.Freely by his grace — One of these expressions might have served to convey the apostle's meaning; but he doubles his assertion, in order to give us the fullest conviction of the truth, and to impress us with a sense of its peculiar importance. It is not possible to find words that should more absolutely exclude all consideration of our own works and obedience, or more emphatically ascribe the whole of our justification to free, unmerited goodness.
