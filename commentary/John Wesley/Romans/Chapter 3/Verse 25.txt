<p><em>Whom God hath set forth</em> — Before angels and men.</p>
<p><em>A propitiation</em> — To appease an offended God. But if, as some teach, God never was offended, there was no need of this propitiation. And, if so, Christ died in vain.</p>
<p><em>To declare his righteousness</em> — To demonstrate not only his clemency, but his justice; even that vindictive justice whose essential character and principal office is, to punish sin.</p>
<p><em>By the remission of past sins</em> — All the sins antecedent to their believing.</p>
