Before God — Though before men nothing of this appeared, those nations being then unborn.As quickening the dead — The dead are not dead to him and even the things that are not, are before God.And calling the things that are not — Summoning them to rise into being, and appear before him. The seed of Abraham did not then exist; yet God said, "So shall thy seed be." A man can say to his servant actually existing, Do this; and he doeth it: but God saith to the light, while it does not exist, Go forth; and it goeth. Genesis 17:5.
