<p><em>Before God</em> — Though before men nothing of this appeared, those nations being then unborn.</p>
<p><em>As quickening the dead</em> — The dead are not dead to him and even the things that are not, are before God.</p>
<p><em>And calling the things that are not</em> — Summoning them to rise into being, and appear before him. The seed of Abraham did not then exist; yet God said, "So shall thy seed be." A man can say to his servant actually existing, Do this; and he doeth it: but God saith to the light, while it does not exist, Go forth; and it goeth. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:5">Genesis 17:5</span>.</p>
