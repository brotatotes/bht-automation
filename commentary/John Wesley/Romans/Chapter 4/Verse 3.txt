Abraham believed God — That promise of God concerning the numerousness of his seed, Genesis 15:5,7; but especially the promise concerning Christ, Genesis 12:3, through whom all nations should be blessed.And it was imputed to him for righteousness — God accepted him as if he had been altogether righteous. Genesis 15:6.
