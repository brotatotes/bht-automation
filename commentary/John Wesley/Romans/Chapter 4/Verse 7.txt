<p><em>Happy are they whose sins are covered</em> â€” With the veil of divine mercy. If there be indeed such a thing as happiness on earth, it is the portion of that man whose iniquities are forgiven, and who enjoys the manifestation of that pardon. Well may he endure all the afflictions of life with cheerfulness, and look upon death with comfort. O let us not contend against it, but earnestly pray that this happiness may be ours! <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ps+32:1,2">Psalm 32:1,2</span>.</p>
