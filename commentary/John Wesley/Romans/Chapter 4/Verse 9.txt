<p><em>This happiness</em> — Mentioned by Abraham and David.</p>
<p><em>On the circumcision</em> — Those that are circumcised only.</p>
<p><em>Faith was imputed to Abraham for righteousness</em> — This is fully consistent with our being justified, that is, pardoned and accepted by God upon our believing, for the sake of what Christ hath done and suffered. For though this, and this alone, be the meritorious cause of our acceptance with God, yet faith may be said to be "imputed to us for righteousness," as it is the sole condition of our acceptance. We may observe here, forgiveness, not imputing sin, and imputing righteousness, are all one.</p>
