The Apostle shows the power and excellence of that faith to which he ascribes justification.Who against hope — Against all probability, believed and hoped in the promise. The same thing is apprehended both by faith and hope; by faith, as a thing which God has spoken; by hope, as a good thing which God has promised to us.So shall thy seed be — Both natural and spiritual, as the stars of heaven for multitude. Genesis 15:5.
