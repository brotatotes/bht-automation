<p>The Apostle shows the power and excellence of that faith to which he ascribes justification.</p>
<p><em>Who against hope</em> — Against all probability, believed and hoped in the promise. The same thing is apprehended both by faith and hope; by faith, as a thing which God has spoken; by hope, as a good thing which God has promised to us.</p>
<p><em>So shall thy seed be</em> — Both natural and spiritual, as the stars of heaven for multitude. <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:5">Genesis 15:5</span>.</p>
