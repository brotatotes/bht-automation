<p><em>Therefore</em> — This refers to all the preceding discourse; from which the apostle infers what follows. He does not therefore properly make a digression, but returns to speak again of sin and of righteousness.</p>
<p><em>As by one man</em> — Adam; who is mentioned, and not Eve, as being the representative of mankind.</p>
<p><em>Sin entered into the world</em> — Actual sin, and its consequence, a sinful nature.</p>
<p><em>And death</em> — With all its attendants. It entered into the world when it entered into being; for till then it did not exist.</p>
<p><em>By sin</em> — Therefore it could not enter before sin.</p>
<p><em>Even so</em> — Namely, by one man.</p>
<p><em>In that</em> — So the word is used also, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:4">2 Corinthians 5:4</span>.</p>
<p><em>All sinned</em> — In Adam. These words assign the reason why death came upon all men; infants themselves not excepted, in that all sinned.</p>
