Therefore — This refers to all the preceding discourse; from which the apostle infers what follows. He does not therefore properly make a digression, but returns to speak again of sin and of righteousness.As by one man — Adam; who is mentioned, and not Eve, as being the representative of mankind.Sin entered into the world — Actual sin, and its consequence, a sinful nature.And death — With all its attendants. It entered into the world when it entered into being; for till then it did not exist.By sin — Therefore it could not enter before sin.Even so — Namely, by one man.In that — So the word is used also, 2 Corinthians 5:4.All sinned — In Adam. These words assign the reason why death came upon all men; infants themselves not excepted, in that all sinned.
