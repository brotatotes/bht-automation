<p><em>Death reigned</em> — And how vast is his kingdom! Scarce can we find any king who has as many subjects, as are the kings whom he hath conquered.</p>
<p><em>Even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression</em> — Even over infants who had never sinned, as Adam did, in their own persons; and over others who had not, like him, sinned against an express law.</p>
<p><em>Who is the figure of him that was to come</em> — Each of them being a public person, and a federal head of mankind. The one, the fountain of sin and death to mankind by his offence; the other, of righteousness and life by his free gift. Thus far the apostle shows the agreement between the first and second Adam: afterward he shows the differences between them. The agreement may be summed up thus: As by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; so by one man righteousness entered into the world, and life by righteousness. As death passed upon all men, in that all had sinned; so life passed upon all men, (who are in the second Adam by faith,) in that all are justified. And as death through the sin of the first Adam reigned even over them who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression; so through the righteousness of Christ, even those who have not obeyed, after the likeness of his obedience, shall reign in life. We may add, As the sin of Adam, without the sins which we afterwards committed, brought us death; so the righteousness of Christ, without the good works which we afterwards perform, brings us life: although still every good, as well as evil, work, will receive its due reward.</p>
