<p>As by the disobedience of one man many (that is, all men) were constituted sinners - Being then in the loins of their first parent, the common head and representative of them all.</p>
<p><em>So by the obedience of one</em> — By his obedience unto death; by his dying for us.</p>
<p><em>Many</em> — All that believe.</p>
<p><em>Shall be constituted righteous</em> — Justified, pardoned.</p>
