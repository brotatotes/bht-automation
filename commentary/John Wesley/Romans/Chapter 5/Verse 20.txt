<p><em>The law came in between</em> — The offence and the free gift.</p>
<p><em>That the offence might abound</em> — That is, the consequence (not the design) of the law's coming in was, not the taking away of sin, but the increase of it.</p>
<p><em>Yet where sin abounded, grace did much more abound</em> — Not only in the remission of that sin which Adam brought on us, but of all our own; not only in remission of sins, but infusion of holiness; not only in deliverance from death, but admission to everlasting life, a far more noble and excellent life than that which we lost by Adam's fall.</p>
