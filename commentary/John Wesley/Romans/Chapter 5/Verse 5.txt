Hope shameth us not — That is, gives us the highest glorying. We glory in this our hope, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts - The divine conviction of God's love to us, and that love to God which is both the earnest and the beginning of heaven.By the Holy Ghost — The efficient cause of all these present blessings, and the earnest of those to come.
