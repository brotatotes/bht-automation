How can we now doubt of God's love? For when we were without strength - Either to think, will, or do anything good.In due time — Neither too soon nor too late; but in that very point of time which the wisdom of God knew to be more proper than any other.Christ died for the ungodly — Not only to set them a pattern, or to procure them power to follow it. It does not appear that this expression, of dying for any one, has any other signification than that of rescuing the life of another by laying down our own.
