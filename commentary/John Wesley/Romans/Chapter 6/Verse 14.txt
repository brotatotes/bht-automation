<p><em>Sin shall not have dominion over you</em> — It has neither right nor power.</p>
<p><em>For ye are not under the law</em> — A dispensation of terror and bondage, which only shows sin, without enabling you to conquer it.</p>
<p><em>But under grace</em> — Under the merciful dispensation of the gospel, which brings complete victory over it to every one who is under the powerful influences of the Spirit of Christ.</p>
