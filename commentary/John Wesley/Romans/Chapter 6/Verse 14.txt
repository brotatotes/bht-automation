Sin shall not have dominion over you — It has neither right nor power.For ye are not under the law — A dispensation of terror and bondage, which only shows sin, without enabling you to conquer it.But under grace — Under the merciful dispensation of the gospel, which brings complete victory over it to every one who is under the powerful influences of the Spirit of Christ.
