<p><em>I speak after the manner of men</em> — Thus it is necessary that the scripture should let itself down to the language of men.</p>
<p><em>Because of the weakness of your flesh</em> — Slowness of understanding flows from the weakness of the flesh, that is, of human nature.</p>
<p><em>As ye have presented your members servants to uncleanness and iniquity unto iniquity, so now present your members servants of righteousness unto holiness</em> — Iniquity (whereof uncleanness is an eminent part) is here opposed to righteousness; and unto iniquity is the opposite of unto holiness. Righteousness here is a conformity to the divine will; holiness, to the whole divine nature. Observe, they who are servants of righteousness go on to holiness; but they who are servants to iniquity get no farther. Righteousness is service, because we live according to the will of another; but liberty, because of our inclination to it, and delight in it.</p>
