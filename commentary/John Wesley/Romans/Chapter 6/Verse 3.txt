<p><em>As many as have been baptized into Jesus Christ have been baptized into his death</em> â€” In baptism we, through faith, are ingrafted into Christ; and we draw new spiritual life from this new root, through his Spirit, who fashions us like unto him, and particularly with regard to his death and resurrection.</p>
