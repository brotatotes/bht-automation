<p><em>We are buried with him</em> — Alluding to the ancient manner of baptizing by immersion.</p>
<p><em>That as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory</em> — Glorious power. Of the Father, so we also, by the same power, should rise again; and as he lives a new life in heaven, so we should walk in newness of life. This, says the apostle, our very baptism represents to us.</p>
