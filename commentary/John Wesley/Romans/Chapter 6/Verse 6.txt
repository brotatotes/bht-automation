<p><em>Our old man</em> — Coeval with our being, and as old as the fall; our evil nature; a strong and beautiful expression for that entire depravity and corruption which by nature spreads itself over the whole man, leaving no part uninfected. This in a believer is crucified with Christ, mortified, gradually killed, by virtue of our union with him.</p>
<p><em>That the body of sin</em> — All evil tempers, words, and actions, which are the "members" of the "old man," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="col+3:5">Colossians 3:5</span>, might be destroyed.</p>
