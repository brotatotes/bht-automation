<p>The apostle continues the comparison between the former and the present state of a believer, and at the same time endeavours to wean the Jewish believers from their fondness for the Mosaic law.</p>
<p><em>I speak to them that know the law</em> — To the Jews chiefly here.</p>
<p><em>As long</em> — So long, and no longer.</p>
<p><em>As it liveth</em> — The law is here spoken of, by a common figure, as a person, to which, as to an husband, life and death are ascribed. But he speaks indifferently of the law being dead to us, or we to it, the sense being the same.</p>
