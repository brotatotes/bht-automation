<p><em>But I see another law in my members</em> — Another inward constraining power of evil inclinations and bodily appetites.</p>
<p><em>Warring against the law of my mind</em> — The dictate of my mind, which delights in the law of God.</p>
<p><em>And captivating me</em> — In spite of all my resistance</p>
