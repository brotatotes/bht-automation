<p><em>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord</em> — That is, God will deliver me through Christ. But the apostle, as his frequent manner is, beautifully interweaves his assertion with thanksgiving;' the hymn of praise answering in a manner to the voice of sorrow, "Wretched man that I am!" So then - He here sums up the whole, and concludes what he began, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7">Romans 7:7</span>.</p>
<p><em>I myself</em> — Or rather that I, the person whom I am personating, till this deliverance is wrought.</p>
<p><em>Serve the law of God with my mind</em> — My reason and conscience declare for God.</p>
<p><em>But with my flesh the law of sin</em> — But my corrupt passions and appetites still rebel. The man is now utterly weary of his bondage, and upon the brink of liberty.</p>
