<p><em>What shall we say then</em> — This is a kind of a digression, to the beginning of the next chapter, wherein the apostle, in order to show in the most lively manner the weakness and inefficacy of the law, changes the person and speaks as of himself, concerning the misery of one under the law. This St. Paul frequently does, when he is not speaking of his own person, but only assuming another character, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:5">Romans 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:30">1 Corinthians 10:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:6">1 Corinthians 4:6</span>. The character here assumed is that of a man, first ignorant of the law, then under it and sincerely, but ineffectually, striving to serve God. To have spoken this of himself, or any true believer, would have been foreign to the whole scope of his discourse; nay, utterly contrary thereto, as well as to what is expressly asserted, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:2">Romans 8:2</span>.</p>
<p><em>Is the law sin</em> — Sinful in itself, or a promoter of sin.</p>
<p><em>I had not known lust</em> — That is, evil desire. I had not known it to be a sin; nay, perhaps I should not have known that any such desire was in me: it did not appear, till it was stirred up by the prohibition.</p>
