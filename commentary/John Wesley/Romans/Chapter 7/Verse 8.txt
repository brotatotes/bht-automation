<p><em>But sin</em> — My inbred corruption.</p>
<p><em>Taking occasion by the commandment</em> — Forbidding, but not subduing it, was only fretted, and wrought in me so much the more all manner of evil desire. For while I was without the knowledge of the law, sin was dead - Neither so apparent, nor so active; nor was I under the least apprehensions of any danger from it.</p>
