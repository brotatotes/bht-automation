<p><em>And I was once alive without the law</em> — Without the close application of it. I had much life, wisdom, virtue, strength: so I thought.</p>
<p><em>But when the commandment</em> — That is, the law, a part put for the whole; but this expression particularly intimates its compulsive force, which restrains, enjoins, urges, forbids, threatens.</p>
<p><em>Came</em> — In its spiritual meaning, to my heart, with the power of God.</p>
<p><em>Sin revived, and I died</em> — My inbred sin took fire, and all my virtue and strength died away; and I then saw myself to be dead in sin, and liable to death eternal.</p>
