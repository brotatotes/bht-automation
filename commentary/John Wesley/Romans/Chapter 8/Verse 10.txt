<p><em>Now if Christ be in you</em> — Where the Spirit of Christ is, there is Christ.</p>
<p><em>The body indeed is dead</em> — Devoted to death.</p>
<p><em>Because of sin</em> — Heretofore committed.</p>
<p><em>But the Spirit is life</em> — Already truly alive.</p>
<p><em>Because of righteousness</em> — Now attained. From <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:13">Romans 8:13</span>, St. Paul, having finished what he had begun, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1">Romans 6:1</span>, describes purely the state of believers.</p>
