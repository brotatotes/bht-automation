<p><em>For ye</em> — Who are real Christians.</p>
<p><em>Have not received the spirit of bondage</em> — The Holy Ghost was not properly a spirit of bondage, even in the time of the Old Testament. Yet there was something of bondage remaining even in those who then had received the Spirit.</p>
<p><em>Again</em> — As the Jews did before.</p>
<p><em>We</em> — All and every believer.</p>
<p><em>Cry</em> — The word denotes a vehement speaking, with desire, confidence, constancy.</p>
<p><em>Abba, Father</em> — The latter word explains the former. By using both the Syriac and the Greek word, St. Paul seems to point out the joint cry both of the Jewish and gentile believers. The spirit of bondage here seems directly to mean, those operations of the Holy Spirit by which the soul, on its first conviction, feels itself in bondage to sin, to the world, to Satan, and obnoxious to the wrath of God. This, therefore, and the Spirit of adoption, are one and the same Spirit, only manifesting itself in various operations, according to the various circumstances of the persons.</p>
