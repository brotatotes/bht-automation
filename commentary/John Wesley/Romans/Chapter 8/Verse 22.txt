<p><em>For the whole creation groaneth together</em> — With joint groans, as it were with one voice.</p>
<p><em>And travaileth</em> — Literally, is in the pains of childbirth, to be delivered of the burden of the curse.</p>
<p><em>Until now</em> — To this very hour; and so on till the time of deliverance.</p>
