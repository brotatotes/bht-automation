<p><em>And even we, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit</em> — That is, the Spirit, who is the first-fruits of our inheritance.</p>
<p><em>The adoption</em> — Persons who had been privately adopted among the Romans were often brought forth into the forum, and there publicly owned as their sons by those who adopted them. So at the general resurrection, when the body itself is redeemed from death, the sons of God shall be publicly owned by him in the great assembly of men and angels.</p>
<p><em>The redemption of our body</em> — From corruption to glory and immortality.</p>
