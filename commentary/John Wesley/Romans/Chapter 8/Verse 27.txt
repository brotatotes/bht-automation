<p><em>But he who searcheth the hearts</em> — Wherein the Spirit dwells and intercedes.</p>
<p><em>Knoweth</em> — Though man cannot utter it.</p>
<p><em>What is the mind of the Spirit, for he maketh intercession for the saints</em> — Who are near to God.</p>
<p><em>According to God</em> — According to his will, as is worthy of God. and acceptable to him.</p>
