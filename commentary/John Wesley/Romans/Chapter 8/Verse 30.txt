<p><em>Them he</em> — In due time.</p>
<p><em>Called</em> — By his gospel and his Spirit.</p>
<p><em>And whom he called</em> — When obedient to the heavenly calling, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:19">Acts 26:19</span>.</p>
<p><em>He also justified</em> — Forgave and accepted.</p>
<p><em>And whom he justified</em> — Provided they "continued in his goodness," <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:22">Romans 11:22</span>, he in the end glorified - St. Paul does not affirm, either here or in any other part of his writings. that precisely the same number of men are called, justified, and glorified. He does not deny that a believer may fall away and be cut off between his special calling and his glorification, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:22">Romans 11:22</span>. Neither does he deny that many are called who never are justified. He only affirms that this is the method whereby God leads us step by step toward heaven.</p>
<p><em>He glorified</em> — He speaks as one looking back from the goal, upon the race of faith. Indeed grace, as it is glory begun, is both an earnest and a foretaste of eternal glory.</p>
