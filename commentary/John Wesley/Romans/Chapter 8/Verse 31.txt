<p><em>What shall we say then to these things</em> — Related in the third, fifth, and eighth chapters? As if he had said, We cannot go, think, or wish anything farther.</p>
<p><em>If God be for us</em> — Here follow four periods, one general and three particular. Each begins with glorying in the grace of God, which is followed by a question suitable to it, challenging all opponents to all which, "I am persuaded," etc., is a general answer. The general period is, If God be for us, who can be against us? The first particular period, relating to the past time, is, He that spared not his own Son, how shall he not freely give us all things? The second, relating to the present, is, It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? The third, relating to the future, is, It is Christ that died - Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?</p>
