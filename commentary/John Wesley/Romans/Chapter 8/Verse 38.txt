<p><em>I am persuaded</em> — This is inferred from the thirty-fourth verse, in an admirable order: - Neither death" shall hurt us; For "Christ is dead:" "Nor life;" 'is risen" Nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers; nor things pre - sent, nor things to come;" "is at the right hand of God:" "Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature;" "maketh intercession for us." Neither death - Terrible as it is to natural men; a violent death in particular, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:36">Romans 8:36</span>.</p>
<p><em>Nor life</em> — With all the affliction and distress it can bring, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:35">Romans 8:35</span>; or a long, easy life; or all living men.</p>
<p><em>Nor angels</em> — Whether good (if it were possible they should attempt it) or bad, with all their wisdom and strength.</p>
<p><em>Nor principalities, nor powers</em> — Not even those of the highest rank, or the most eminent power.</p>
<p><em>Nor things present</em> — Which may befal us during our pilgrimage; or the whole world, till it passeth away.</p>
<p><em>Nor things to come</em> — Which may occur either when our time on earth is past, or when time itself is at an end, as the final judgment, the general conflagration, the everlasting fire.</p>
<p><em>Nor height, nor depth</em> — The former sentence respected the differences of times; this, the differences of places. How many great and various things are contained in these words, we do not, need not, cannot know yet.</p>
<p><em>The height</em> — In St. Paul's sublime style, is put for heaven.</p>
<p><em>The depth</em> — For the great abyss: that is, neither the heights, I will not say of walls, mountains, seas, but, of heaven itself, can move us; nor the abyss itself, the very thought of which might astonish the boldest creature.</p>
<p><em>Nor any creature</em> — Nothing beneath the Almighty; visible enemies he does not even deign to name.</p>
<p><em>Shall be able</em> — Either by force, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:35">Romans 8:35</span>; or by any legal claim, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:33">Romans 8:33</span>, etc.</p>
<p><em>To separate us from the love of God in Christ</em> — Which will surely save, protect, deliver us who believe in, and through, and from, them all.</p>
