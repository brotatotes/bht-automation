I am persuaded — This is inferred from the thirty-fourth verse, in an admirable order: - Neither death" shall hurt us; For "Christ is dead:" "Nor life;" 'is risen" Nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers; nor things pre - sent, nor things to come;" "is at the right hand of God:" "Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature;" "maketh intercession for us." Neither death - Terrible as it is to natural men; a violent death in particular, Romans 8:36.Nor life — With all the affliction and distress it can bring, Romans 8:35; or a long, easy life; or all living men.Nor angels — Whether good (if it were possible they should attempt it) or bad, with all their wisdom and strength.Nor principalities, nor powers — Not even those of the highest rank, or the most eminent power.Nor things present — Which may befal us during our pilgrimage; or the whole world, till it passeth away.Nor things to come — Which may occur either when our time on earth is past, or when time itself is at an end, as the final judgment, the general conflagration, the everlasting fire.Nor height, nor depth — The former sentence respected the differences of times; this, the differences of places. How many great and various things are contained in these words, we do not, need not, cannot know yet.The height — In St. Paul's sublime style, is put for heaven.The depth — For the great abyss: that is, neither the heights, I will not say of walls, mountains, seas, but, of heaven itself, can move us; nor the abyss itself, the very thought of which might astonish the boldest creature.Nor any creature — Nothing beneath the Almighty; visible enemies he does not even deign to name.Shall be able — Either by force, Romans 8:35; or by any legal claim, Romans 8:33, etc.To separate us from the love of God in Christ — Which will surely save, protect, deliver us who believe in, and through, and from, them all.
