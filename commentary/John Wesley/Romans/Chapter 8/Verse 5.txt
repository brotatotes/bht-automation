<p><em>They that are after the flesh</em> — Who remain under the guidance of corrupt nature.</p>
<p><em>Mind the things of the flesh</em> — Have their thoughts and affections fixed on such things as gratify corrupt nature; namely, on things visible and temporal; on things of the earth, on pleasure, (of sense or imagination,) praise, or riches.</p>
<p><em>But they who are after the Spirit</em> — Who are under his guidance.</p>
<p><em>Mind the things of the Spirit</em> — Think of, relish, love things invisible, eternal; the things which the Spirit hath revealed, which he works in us, moves us to, and promises to give us.</p>
