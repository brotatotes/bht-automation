For to be carnally minded — That is, to mind the things of the flesh.Is death — The sure mark of spiritual death, and the way to death everlasting.But to be spiritually minded — That is, to mind the things of the Spirit.Is life — A sure mark of spiritual life, and the way to life everlasting. And attended with peace - The peace of God, which is the foretaste of life everlasting; and peace with God, opposite to the enmity mentioned in the next verse.
