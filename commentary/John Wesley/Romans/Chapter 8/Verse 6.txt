<p><em>For to be carnally minded</em> — That is, to mind the things of the flesh.</p>
<p><em>Is death</em> — The sure mark of spiritual death, and the way to death everlasting.</p>
<p><em>But to be spiritually minded</em> — That is, to mind the things of the Spirit.</p>
<p><em>Is life</em> — A sure mark of spiritual life, and the way to life everlasting. And attended with peace - The peace of God, which is the foretaste of life everlasting; and peace with God, opposite to the enmity mentioned in the next verse.</p>
