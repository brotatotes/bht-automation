In the Spirit — Under his government.If any man have not the Spirit of Christ — Dwelling and governing in him.He is none of his — He is not a member of Christ; not a Christian; not in a state of salvation. A plain, express declaration, which admits of no exception. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear!
