<p><em>In the Spirit</em> — Under his government.</p>
<p><em>If any man have not the Spirit of Christ</em> — Dwelling and governing in him.</p>
<p><em>He is none of his</em> — He is not a member of Christ; not a Christian; not in a state of salvation. A plain, express declaration, which admits of no exception. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear!</p>
