<p><em>It</em> — The blessing.</p>
<p><em>Therefore is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth</em> — It is not the effect either of the will or the works of man, but of the grace and power of God. The will of man is here opposed to the grace of God, and man's running, to the divine operation. And this general declaration respects not only Isaac and Jacob, and the Israelites in the time of Moses, but likewise all the spiritual children of Abraham, even to the end of the world.</p>
