<p><em>What if God, being willing</em> — Referring to <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:18,19">Romans 9:18,19</span>. That is, although it was now his will, because of their obstinate unbelief, To show his wrath - Which necessarily presupposes sin.</p>
<p><em>And to make his power known</em> — This is repeated from the seventeenth verse.</p>
<p><em>Yet endured</em> — As he did Pharaoh.</p>
<p><em>With much longsuffering</em> — Which should have led them to repentance.</p>
<p><em>The vessels of wrath</em> — Those who had moved his wrath by still rejecting his mercy.</p>
<p><em>Fitted for destruction</em> — By their own wilful and final impenitence. Is there any injustice in this ?</p>
