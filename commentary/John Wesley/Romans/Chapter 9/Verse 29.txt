<p><em>As Isaiah had said before</em> — Namely, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:9">Isaiah 1:9</span>, concerning those who were besieged in Jerusalem by Rezin and Pekah.</p>
<p><em>Unless the Lord had left us a seed</em> — Which denotes, 1. The present paucity: 2. The future abundance.</p>
<p><em>We had been as Sodom</em> — So that it is no unexampled thing for the main body of the Jewish nation to revolt from God, and perish in their sin.</p>
