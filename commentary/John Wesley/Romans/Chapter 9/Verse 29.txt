As Isaiah had said before — Namely, Isaiah 1:9, concerning those who were besieged in Jerusalem by Rezin and Pekah.Unless the Lord had left us a seed — Which denotes, 1. The present paucity: 2. The future abundance.We had been as Sodom — So that it is no unexampled thing for the main body of the Jewish nation to revolt from God, and perish in their sin.
