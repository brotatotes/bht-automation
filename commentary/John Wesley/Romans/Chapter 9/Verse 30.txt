<p><em>What shall we say then</em> — What is to be concluded from all that has been said but this, That the gentiles, who followed not after righteousness - Who a while ago had no knowledge of, no care or thought about, it.</p>
<p><em>Have attained to righteousness</em> — Or justification. Even the righteousness which is by faith. This is the first conclusion we may draw from the preceding observations. The second is, that Israel - The Jews Although following after the law of righteousness - That law which, duly used, would have led them to faith, and thereby to righteousness.</p>
<p><em>Have not attained to the law of righteousness</em> — To that righteousness or justification which is one great end of the law</p>
