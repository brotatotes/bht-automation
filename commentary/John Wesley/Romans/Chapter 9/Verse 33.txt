As it is written — Foretold by their own prophet.Behold, I lay in Sion — I exhibit in my church, what, though it is in truth the only sure foundation of happiness, yet will be in fact a stumblingstone and rock of offence - An occasion of ruin to many, through their obstinate unbelief. Isaiah 8:14; Isaiah 28:16
