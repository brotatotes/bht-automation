<p><em>The adoption and the glory</em> — That is, Israel is the first-born child of God, and the God of glory is their God, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="de+4:7">Deuteronomy 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ps+106:20">Psalm 106:20</span>.

<p><em>And the worship, and the promises</em> — The true way of worshipping God; and all the promises made to the fathers.</p>
