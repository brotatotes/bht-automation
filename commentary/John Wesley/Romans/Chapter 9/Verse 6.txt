<p><em>Not as if</em> — The Jews imagined that the word of God must fail if all their nation were not saved. This St. Paul now refutes, and proves that the word itself had foretold their falling away.</p>
<p><em>The word of God</em> — The promises of God to Israel.</p>
<p><em>Had fallen to the ground</em> — This could not be. Even now, says the apostle, some enjoy the promises; and hereafter "all Israel shall be saved." This is the sum of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh chapters.</p>
<p><em>For</em> — Here he enters upon the proof of it.</p>
<p><em>All are not Israel, who are of Israel</em> — The Jews vehemently maintained the contrary; namely, that all who were born Israelites, and they only, were the people of God. The former part of this assertion is refuted here, the latter, <span class="scriptRef" com="wen" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:24">Romans 9:24</span>, etc. The sum is, God accepts all believers, and them only; and this is no way contrary to his word. Nay, he hath declared in his word, both by types and by express testimonies, that believers are accepted as the "children of the promise," while unbelievers are rejected, though they are "children after the flesh." All are not Israel - Not in the favour of God. Who are lineally descended of Israel.</p>
