<p><em>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ</em> — Titles suitable to the person of Paul, and the office he was assigning to Titus.</p>
<p><em>According to the faith</em> — The propagating of which is the proper business of an apostle.</p>
<p><em>A servant of God</em> — According to the faith of the elect.</p>
<p><em>An apostle of Jesus Christ</em> — According to the knowledge of the truth. We serve God according to the measure of our faith: we fulfil our public office according to the measure of our knowledge.</p>
<p><em>The truth that is after godliness</em> — Which in every point runs parallel with and supports the vital, spiritual worship of God; and, indeed, has no other end or scope. These two verses contain the sum of Christianity, which Titus was always to have in his eye.</p>
<p><em>Of the elect of God</em> — Of all real Christians</p>
