<p><em>To the pure</em> — Those whose hearts are purified by faith this we allow.</p>
<p><em>All things are pure</em> — All kinds of meat; the Mosaic distinction between clean and unclean meats being now taken away.</p>
<p><em>But to the defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure</em> — The apostle joins defiled and unbelieving, to intimate that nothing can be clean without a true faith: for both the understanding and conscience, those leading powers of the soul, are polluted; consequently, so is the man and all he does.</p>
