To the pure — Those whose hearts are purified by faith this we allow.All things are pure — All kinds of meat; the Mosaic distinction between clean and unclean meats being now taken away.But to the defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure — The apostle joins defiled and unbelieving, to intimate that nothing can be clean without a true faith: for both the understanding and conscience, those leading powers of the soul, are polluted; consequently, so is the man and all he does.
