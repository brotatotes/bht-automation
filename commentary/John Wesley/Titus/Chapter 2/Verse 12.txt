<p><em>Instructing us</em> — All who do not reject it.</p>
<p><em>That, having renounced ungodliness</em> — Whatever is contrary to the fear and love of God.</p>
<p><em>And worldly desires</em> — Which are opposite to sobriety and righteousness.</p>
<p><em>We should live soberly</em> — In all purity and holiness. Sobriety, in the scripture sense, is rather the whole temper of a man, than a single virtue in him. It comprehends all that is opposite to the drowsiness of sin, the folly of ignorance, the unholiness of disorderly passions. Sobriety is no less than all the powers of the soul being consistently and constantly awake, duly governed by heavenly prudence, and entirely conformable to holy affections.</p>
<p><em>And righteously</em> — Doing to all as we would they should do to us.</p>
<p><em>And godly</em> — As those who are consecrated to God both in heart and life.</p>
