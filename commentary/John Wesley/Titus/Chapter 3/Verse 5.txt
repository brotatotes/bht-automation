<p><em>Not by works</em> â€” In this important passage the apostle presents us with a delightful view of our redemption. Herein we have, 1. The cause of it; not our works or righteousness, but "the kindness and love of God our Saviour." 2. The effects; which are, (1.) Justification; "being justified," pardoned and accepted through the alone merits of Christ, not from any desert in us, but according to his own mercy, "by his grace," his free, unmerited goodness. (2.) Sanctification, expressed by the laver of regeneration, (that is, baptism, the thing signified, as well as the outward sign,) and the renewal of the Holy Ghost; which purifies the soul, as water cleanses the body, and renews it in the whole image of God3. The consummation of all; - that we might become heirs of eternal life, and live now in the joyful hope of it.</p>
