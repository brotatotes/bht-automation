<p>I beseech [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλω] </span></span>. See on consolation, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:24">Luke 6:24</span>. The word occurs more than one hundred times in the New Testament. </p>
<p>Divisions [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχισματα] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:19">John 10:19</span>. In classical Greek used only of actual rents in material. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:16">Matthew 9:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:21">Mark 2:21</span>. In the sense of discord, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:43">John 7:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:16">John 9:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:19">John 10:19</span>. Here, faction, for which the classical word is stasiv : division within the christian community. The divisions of the Corinthian church arose on questions of marriage and food (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:3">1 Corinthians 7:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:5">1 Corinthians 7:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:12">1 Corinthians 7:12</span>); on eating, meat offered to idols (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:7">1 Corinthians 8:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:20">1 Corinthians 10:20</span>); on the comparative value of spiritual endowments, such as speaking with "tongues" 79; on the privileges and demeanor of women in the assemblies for worship (xi. 5 - 15); on the relations of the rich and the poor in the agape or love - feasts (xi. 17 - 22); and on the prerogatives of the different christian teachers (i. 12, 13; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:3-22">1 Corinthians 3:3-22</span>). </p>
<p>Perfectly joined together [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηρτισμενοι] </span></span>. Rev., perfected together. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:16">Matthew 21:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:40">Luke 6:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:10">1 Peter 5:10</span>. Carrying on the metaphor in divisions. Not of individual and absolute perfection, but of perfection in the unity of the Church. </p>
<p>Mind [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νοι] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span>. </p>
<p>Judgment [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωμη] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+17:13">Revelation 17:13</span>. The distinction between mind and judgment is not between theoretical and practical, since nouv mind, includes the practical reason, while gnwmh judgment, has a theoretical side. Rather between understanding and opinion; nouv regarding the thing from the side of the subject, gnwmh from the side of the object. Being in the same realm of thought, they would judge questions from the same christian stand - point, and formulate their judgment accordingly.</p>
