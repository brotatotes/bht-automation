It hath been declared [εδηλωθη] . Rev., signified, which is hardly strong enough. The word means to make clear, or manifest [δηλος] . Compare ch. 3 13. It may imply that Paul was reluctant to believe the reports, but was convinced by unimpeachable testimony. Of the household of Chloe [των χλοης] . See on Romans 16:10 for the form of expression. The persons may have been slaves who had come to Ephesus on business for their mistress, or members of her family. Chloe means tender verdure, and was an epithet of Demeter (Ceres), the goddess of agriculture and rural life. It is uncertain whether she belonged to the Corinthian or to the Ephesian church. Contentions [εριδες] . Socrates in Plato's "Republic" distinguishes between disputing [εριζειν] and discussing [διαλεγεσθαι] , and identifies contention [ερις] with gainsaying [αντιλογια] , "Republic," 5, 454. Compare Titus 3:9.
