<p>Now this I say [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω δε τουτο] </span></span>. A familiar classical formula : What I mean is this. Rev., Now this I mean. This usually refers to what follows. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:17">Galatians 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17">Ephesians 4:17</span>. </p>
<p>I am of Paul and I of Apollos. The repeated de and, expresses the opposition between the respective parties. The followers of Apollos preferred his more philosophical and rhetorical preaching to the simpler and more direct utterances of Paul. Others ranged themselves under the name of Peter. </p>
<p>Cephas. Aramaic for Petrov Peter. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:42">John 1:42</span>. It is Paul 's usual name for Peter, Petrov occurring only <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:7">Galatians 2:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:8">Galatians 2:8</span>. Peter would be the rallying - point for the Judaizing Christians, who claimed him as the apostle of the circumcision. The state of the Corinthian church offered the most favorable ground for Paul 's Jewish - Christian adversaries, who took advantage of the reaction created by the looser views and practice of Gentile Christians, and by the differences of opinion on important questions, to press the necessity of legal regulation, and of ceremonial observances in non - essentials. </p>
<p>Of Christ. Many modern authorities hold that Paul thus designates a fourth and quite distinct party. This view rests mainly on the form of statement in this verse, and has no support in the epistle. The peculiar characteristics of this party, if it were such, can only be conjectured. It seems more probable that those who were "of Christ" belonged to the party of Peter : that they were native Jews, coming from abroad with letters of recommendation to Corinth, representing themselves as ministers and apostles of Christ, and using His name as the watchword under which they could most successfully prosecute their opposition to Paul and the gospel which he preached. The allusion in this verse would therefore link itself with those in the tenth and eleventh chapters of the second epistle.</p>
