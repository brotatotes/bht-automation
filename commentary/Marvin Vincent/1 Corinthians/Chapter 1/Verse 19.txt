<p>I will destroy, etc. Cited literally from the Septuagint, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:14">Isaiah 29:14</span>, except that the Septuagint has kruyw I will conceal, instead of I will reject. The Hebrew reads : "The wisdom of its (Judah 's) wise men shall perish, and the sagacity of its sagacious men shall hide itself." </p>
<p>Wisdom - prudence [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφιαν - συνεσιν] </span></span>. The two words are often found together, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+31:3">Exodus 31:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+4:6">Deuteronomy 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:9">Colossians 1:9</span>. Compare sofoi kai sunetoi wise and prudent, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span>. For the distinction, see, as to sofia wisdom, on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:33">Romans 11:33</span>; as to sunesiv prudence, on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:33">Mark 12:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:47">Luke 2:47</span>. Wisdom is the more general; mental excellence in its highest and fullest sense. Prudence is the special application of wisdom; its critical adjustment to particular cases. </p>
<p>Will bring to nothing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αθετησω] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:30">Luke 7:30</span>. Originally, to make disestablished [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αθετον</span></span>] something which is established or prescribed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θετον] </span></span>. Hence to nullify, make void, frustrate, and, in a milder sense, to despise or reject, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:21">Galatians 2:21</span>. The stronger sense is better here, so that Rev., reject is not an improvement on the A. V. The American revisers render : And the discernment of the discerning will I bring to nought.</p>
