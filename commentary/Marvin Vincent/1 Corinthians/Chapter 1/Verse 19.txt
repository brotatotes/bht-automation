I will destroy, etc. Cited literally from the Septuagint, Isaiah 29:14, except that the Septuagint has kruyw I will conceal, instead of I will reject. The Hebrew reads : "The wisdom of its (Judah 's) wise men shall perish, and the sagacity of its sagacious men shall hide itself." Wisdom - prudence [σοφιαν - συνεσιν] . The two words are often found together, as Exodus 31:3; Deuteronomy 4:6; Colossians 1:9. Compare sofoi kai sunetoi wise and prudent, Matthew 11:25. For the distinction, see, as to sofia wisdom, on Romans 11:33; as to sunesiv prudence, on Mark 12:33; Luke 2:47. Wisdom is the more general; mental excellence in its highest and fullest sense. Prudence is the special application of wisdom; its critical adjustment to particular cases. Will bring to nothing [αθετησω] . See on Luke 7:30. Originally, to make disestablished [αθετον] something which is established or prescribed [θετον] . Hence to nullify, make void, frustrate, and, in a milder sense, to despise or reject, as Galatians 2:21. The stronger sense is better here, so that Rev., reject is not an improvement on the A. V. The American revisers render : And the discernment of the discerning will I bring to nought.
