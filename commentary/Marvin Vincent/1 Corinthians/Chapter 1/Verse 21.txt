After that [επειδη] . Rev., correctly, seeing that. By wisdom [δια της σοφιας] . Better, as Rev., giving the force of the article, "through its wisdom." Preaching [κηρυγματος] . Not the act, but the substance of preaching. Compare ver. 23. To save [σωσαι] . The word was technically used in the Old Testament of deliverance at the Messiah 's coming; of salvation from the penalties of the messianic judgment, or from the evils which obstruct the messianic deliverance. See Joel 2:32; Matthew 1:21; compare Acts 2:40. Paul uses it in the ethical sense, to make one a partaker of the salvation which is through Christ. Edwards calls attention to the foregleam of this christian conception of the word in the closing paragraph of Plato's "Republic :" " And thus, Glaucon, the tale has been saved, and has not perished, and will save [σωσειεν] us if we are obedient to the word spoken, and we shall pass safely over the river of forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled.
