<p>The Jews. Omit the article. Among the Jews many had become Christians. </p>
<p>Require (aijtousin). Rev., ask. But it is questionable whether the A. V. is not preferable. The word sometimes takes the sense of demand, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:48">Luke 12:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:15">1 Peter 3:15</span>; and this sense accords well with the haughty attitude of the Jews, demanding of all apostolic religions their proofs and credentials. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:38">Matthew 12:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1">Matthew 16:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:30">John 6:30</span>. </p>
<p>Greeks. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>. </p>
<p>Seek after (zhtousin). Appropriate to the Greeks in contrast with the Jews. The Jews claimed to possess the truth : the Greeks were seekers, speculators (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:23">Acts 17:23</span>) after what they called by the general name of wisdom. </p>
<p>Christ crucified [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χριστον εσταυρωμενον] </span></span>. Not the crucified Christ, but Christ as crucified, not a sign - shower nor a philosopher; and consequently a scandal to the Jew and folly to the Gentile. </p>
<p>Unto the Greeks (%Ellhsi). The correct reading is eqnesin to the Gentiles. So Rev. Though %Ellhnev Greeks, is equivalent to Gentiles in the New Testament when used in antithesis to Jews, yet in this passage Paul seems to have in mind the Greeks as representing gentile wisdom and culture.</p>
