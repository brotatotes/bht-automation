Temptation [πειρασμος] . See on Matthew 6:13. Common to man [ανθρωπινος] . The word means what belongs to men, human. It occurs mostly in this epistle; once in Romans 6:19, meaning after the manner of men, popularly (see note). See James 3:7; 1 Peter 2:13; 1 Corinthians 2:4, 1 Corinthians 2:13; 1 Corinthians 4:3. It may mean here a temptation which is human, i e., incident or common to man, as A. V., or, inferentially, a temptation adapted to human strength; such as man can bear, Rev. The words are added as an encouragement, to offset the warning "let him that thinketh," etc. They are in danger and must watch, but the temptation will not be beyond their strength. A way to escape [την εκβασιν] . Rev., better, the way of escape. The word means an egress, a way out. In classical Greek, especially, of a way out of the sea. Hence, in later Greek, of a landing - place. Compare Xenophon : "The ford that was over against the outlet leading to the mountains" (" Anabasis, " 4. 3, 20). 110 For the sense of issue or end, see on Hebrews 13:7. The words with the temptation and the way of escape imply an adjustment of the deliverance to each particular case. To bear. Not the same as escape. Temptation which cannot be fed must be endured. Often the only escape is through endurance. See James 1:12.
