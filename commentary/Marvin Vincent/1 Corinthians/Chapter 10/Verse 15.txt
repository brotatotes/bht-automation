Wise [φρονιμοις] . See on wisdom, Luke 1:17; wisely, Luke 16:8. The warning against the sacrificial feasts and the allusion in ver. 3 suggest the eucharistic feast. An act of worship is sacramental, as bringing the worshipper into communion with the unseen. Hence he who practices idolatry is in communion with demons (ver. 20), as he who truly partakes of the Eucharist is in communion with Christ. But the two things are incompatible (ver. 21). In citing the Eucharist he appeals to them as intelligent (wise) men, concerning a familiar practice.
