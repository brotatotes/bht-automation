<p>The cup of blessing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ποτηριον της ευλογιας] </span></span>. Lit., the blessing : the cup over which the familiar formula of blessing is pronounced. Hence the Holy Supper was often styled Eulogia (Blessing). For blessing, see on blessed, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span>. It is the same as eucharistia (thanksgiving), applied as the designation of the Lord 's Supper : Eucharist. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:16">1 Corinthians 14:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:4">1 Timothy 4:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:5">1 Timothy 4:5</span>. The cup is first mentioned, perhaps, because Paul wishes to dwell more at length on the bread; or possibly, because drinking rather than eating characterized the idol - feasts. </p>
<p>Communion [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνια] </span></span>. Or participation. See on fellowship, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3">1 John 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:42">Acts 2:42</span>; partners, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:10">Luke 5:10</span>. The Passover was celebrated by families, typifying an unbroken fellowship of those who formed one body, with the God who had passed by the blood - sprinkled doors.</p>
