The cup of blessing [το ποτηριον της ευλογιας] . Lit., the blessing : the cup over which the familiar formula of blessing is pronounced. Hence the Holy Supper was often styled Eulogia (Blessing). For blessing, see on blessed, 1 Peter 1:3. It is the same as eucharistia (thanksgiving), applied as the designation of the Lord 's Supper : Eucharist. See ch. 1 Corinthians 14:16; 1 Timothy 4:4, 1 Timothy 4:5. The cup is first mentioned, perhaps, because Paul wishes to dwell more at length on the bread; or possibly, because drinking rather than eating characterized the idol - feasts. Communion [κοινωνια] . Or participation. See on fellowship, 1 John 1:3; Acts 2:42; partners, Luke 5:10. The Passover was celebrated by families, typifying an unbroken fellowship of those who formed one body, with the God who had passed by the blood - sprinkled doors.
