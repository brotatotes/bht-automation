Devils [δαιμονιοις] . See on Mark 1:34. Used here, as always in the New Testament, of diabolic spirits. 111 Daimonion the neuter of the adjective daimoniov divine, occurs in Paul 's writings only here and 1 Timothy 4:1. It is used in the Septuagint, Deuteronomy 32:17, to translate the Hebrew word which seems, originally, to have meant a supernatural being inferior to the gods proper, applied among the Assyrians to the bulldeities which guarded the entrances to temples and palaces. Among the Israelites it came to signify all gods but the God of Israel. Compare Isaiah 65:11, where Gad (good fortune, probably the star - God Jupiter) is rendered in the Septuagint tw daimoniw the demon. See Rev, O. T. Also Psalms 96:5 (Sept. 95.), where elilim things of nought, A. V. idols, is rendered by daimonia demons. 112
