Do we provoke - to jealousy [η παραζηλουμεν] . The A. V. does not translate h or, and thus breaks the connection with what precedes. You cannot be at the same time in communion with the Lord and with demons, or will you ignore this inconsistency and provoke God ? For the verb, see on Romans 10:19. Are we stronger. The force of the interrogative particle is, surely we are not stronger.
