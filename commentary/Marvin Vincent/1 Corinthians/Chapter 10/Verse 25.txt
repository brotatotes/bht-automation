<p>The shambles [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακελλω] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. It is a Latin word, which is not strange in a Roman colony like Corinth. In sacrifices usually only a part of the victim was consumed. The rest was given to the priests or to the poor, or sold again in the market. Any buyer might therefore unknowingly purchase meat offered to idols. </p>
<p>Asking no question. As to whether the meat had been used in idol sacrifice. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14">1 Corinthians 2:14</span>.</p>
