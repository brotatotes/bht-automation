<p>By grace [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριτι] </span></span>. Better, as Rev., in margin, with thankfulness : with an unsullied conscience, so that I can sincerely give thanks for my food. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:6">Romans 14:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:4">1 Timothy 4:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:5">1 Timothy 4:5</span>, Am I evil - spoken of [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλασφημουμαι] </span></span>. In the gospels this word, of which blaspheme is a transcript, has, as in the Septuagint, the special sense of treating the name of God with scorn. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:3">Matthew 9:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:65">Matthew 26:65</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:36">John 10:36</span>. In the epistles frequently as here, with the classical meaning of slandering or defaming. </p>
