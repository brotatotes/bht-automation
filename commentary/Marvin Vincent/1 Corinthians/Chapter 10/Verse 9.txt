Let us tempt Christ [εκπειραζωμεν τον χριστον] . The compound word is very significant, "to tempt out" [εκ] ; tempt thoroughly; try to the utmost. It occurs in three other places : Matthew 4:7; Luke 4:12; Luke 10:25; and, in every case, is used of tempting or testing Christ. Compare Psalms 77:18 (Sept.). For Christ read Kurion the Lord.
