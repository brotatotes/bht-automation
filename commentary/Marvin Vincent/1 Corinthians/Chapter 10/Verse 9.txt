<p>Let us tempt Christ [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπειραζωμεν τον χριστον] </span></span>. The compound word is very significant, "to tempt out" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ] </span></span>; tempt thoroughly; try to the utmost. It occurs in three other places : <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:7">Matthew 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:12">Luke 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:25">Luke 10:25</span>; and, in every case, is used of tempting or testing Christ. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+77:18">Psalms 77:18</span> (Sept.). For Christ read Kurion the Lord.</p>
