<p>Ordinances - delivered [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδοσεις - παρεδωκα] </span></span>. There is a play of two hundred words, both being derived from paradidwmi to give over. Ordinances is a faulty rendering. Better, Rev., traditions. By these words Paul avoids any possible charge of imposing his own notions upon the Church. He delivers to them what had been delivered to him.
