This is not [ουκ εστιν] . Rev., correctly, it is not possible. The Lord 's Supper [κυριακον δειπνον] . The emphasis is on Lord 's. Deipnon supper, represented the principal meal of the day, answering to the late dinner. The Eucharist proper was originally celebrated as a private expression of devotion, and in connection with a common, daily meal, an agape or love - feast. In the apostolic period it was celebrated daily. The social and festive character of the meal grew largely out of the gentile institution of clubs or fraternities, which served as savings - banks, mutual - help societies, insurance offices, and which expressed and fostered the spirit of good - fellowship by common festive meals, usually in gardens, round an altar of sacrifice. The communion - meal of the first and second centuries exhibited this character in being a feast of contribution, to which each brought his own provision. It also perpetuated the Jewish practice of the college of priests for the temple - service dining at a common table on festivals or Sabbaths, and of the schools of the Pharisees in their ordinary life. Indications of the blending of the eucharistic celebration with a common meal are found here, Acts 2:42; Acts 20:7, and more obscurely, Acts 27:35. Acts 27:118
