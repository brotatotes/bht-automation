<p>I received [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω παρελαβον] </span></span>. I is emphatic, giving the weight of personal authority to the statement. The question whether Paul means that he received directly from Christ, or mediately through the apostles or tradition, turns on a difference between two prepositions. Strictly, ajpo from or of, with the Lord, would imply the more remote source, from the Lord, through the apostles; but Paul does not always observe the distinction between this and para, from the preposition of the nearer source (see Greek, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:7">Colossians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:24">Colossians 3:24</span>); and this latter preposition compounded with the verb received, the emphatic I, and the mention of the fact itself, are decisive of the sense of an immediate communication from Christ to Paul. 119 Also [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και] </span></span>. Important as expressing the identity of the account of Jesus with his own. </p>
<p>He was betrayed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδιδετο] </span></span>. Imperfect tense, and very graphic. he was being betrayed. He instituted the Eucharist while His betrayal was going on.</p>
