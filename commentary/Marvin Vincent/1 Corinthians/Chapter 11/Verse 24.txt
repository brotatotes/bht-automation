<p>Had given thanks [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστης] </span></span>. Eucharistesas. Hence in post - apostolic and patristic writers, Eucharist was the technical term for the Lord 's Supper as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for all the gifts of God, especially for the "unspeakable gift," Jesus Christ. By some of the fathers of the second century the term was sometimes applied to the consecrated elements. The formula of thanksgiving cited in "The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles" is, for the cup first, 'We give thanks to Thee, our Father, for the holy vine of David Thy servant, which Thou hast made known to us through Jesus, Thy servant : to Thee be the glory forever. "And for the bread :" We give thanks to Thee, our Father, for the life and knowledge which Thou hast made known to us through Jesus Thy servant : to Thee be the glory forever. As this broken bread was scattered upon the mountains and, gathered together, became one, so let Thy Church be gathered together from the ends of the earth into Thy Kingdom, for Thine is the glory and the power through Jesus Christ forever. " </p>
