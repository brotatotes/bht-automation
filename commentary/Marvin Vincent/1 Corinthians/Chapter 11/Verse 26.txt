Ye do shew [καταγγελλετε] . Rev., better, proclaim. It is more than represent or signify. The Lord 's death is preached in the celebration of the Eucharist. Compare Exodus 13:8, thou shalt shew.

Dr. Schaff says of the eucharistic service of the apostolic age : "The fourteenth chapter of first Corinthians makes the impression - to use an American phrase - of a religions meeting thrown open. Everybody who had a spiritual gift, whether it was the gift of tongues, of interpretation, of prophecy, or of sober, didactic teaching, had a right to speak, to pray, and to sing. Even women exercised their gifts" (" Introduction to the Didache "). See, further, on ch. 14 33.
