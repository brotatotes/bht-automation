<p>Damnation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριμα] </span></span>.

From this the transition is easy and natural to the sense of doubting, disputing, judging, all of these involving the recognition of differences. The object of the discrimination here referred to, may, I think, be regarded as complex. After Paul 's words (vers. 20, 22), about the degradation of the Lord 's Supper, the discrimination between the Lord 's body and common food may naturally be contemplated; but further, such discernment of the peculiar significance and sacredness of the Lord 's body as shall make him shrink from profanation and shall stimulate him to penitence and faith. </p>
