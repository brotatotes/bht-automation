<p>Weak and sickly. Physical visitations on account of profanation of the Lord 's table. </p>
<p>Many sleep [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοιμωνται ικανοι] </span></span>. The word for many means, primarily, adequate, sufficient. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</span>. Rev., not a few hardly expresses the ominous shading of the word : quite enough have died. Sleep. Better, are sleeping. Here simply as a synonym for are dead, without the peculiar restful sense which christian sentiment so commonly conveys into it. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:60">Acts 7:60</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:4">2 Peter 3:4</span>.</p>
