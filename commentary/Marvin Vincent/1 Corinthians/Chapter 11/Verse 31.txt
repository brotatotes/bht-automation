<p>We would judge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεκρινομεν] </span></span>. An illustration of the confusion in rendering referred to under ver. 29. This is the same word as discerning in ver. 29, but the A. V. recognizes no distinction between it, and judged [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκρινομεθα</span></span>] immediately following. Render, as Rev., if we discerned ourselves; i e., examined and formed a right estimate. </p>
<p>We should not be judged [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ αν εκρινομεθα] </span></span>. By God. Here judged is correct. A proper self - examination would save us from the divine judgment.</p>
