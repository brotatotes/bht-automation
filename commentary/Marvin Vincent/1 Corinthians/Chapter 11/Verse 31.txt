We would judge [διεκρινομεν] . An illustration of the confusion in rendering referred to under ver. 29. This is the same word as discerning in ver. 29, but the A. V. recognizes no distinction between it, and judged [εκρινομεθα] immediately following. Render, as Rev., if we discerned ourselves; i e., examined and formed a right estimate. We should not be judged [ουκ αν εκρινομεθα] . By God. Here judged is correct. A proper self - examination would save us from the divine judgment.
