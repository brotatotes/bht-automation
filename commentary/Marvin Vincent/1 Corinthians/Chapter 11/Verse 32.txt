<p>When we are judged [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινομενοι] </span></span>. Correct. The same word as the last. With this construe by the Lord; not with chastened. The antithesis to judging ourselves is thus preserved. So Rev., in margin. </p>
<p>Condemned [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακριθωμεν] </span></span>. Signifying the final condemnatory judgment; but in ver. 29 the simple krima temporary judgment, is made equivalent to this. See note.</p>
