When we are judged [κρινομενοι] . Correct. The same word as the last. With this construe by the Lord; not with chastened. The antithesis to judging ourselves is thus preserved. So Rev., in margin. Condemned [κατακριθωμεν] . Signifying the final condemnatory judgment; but in ver. 29 the simple krima temporary judgment, is made equivalent to this. See note.
