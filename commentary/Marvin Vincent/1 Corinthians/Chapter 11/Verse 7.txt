Image and glory [εικων και δοξα] For image, see on Revelation 13:14. Man represents God 's authority by his position as the ruler of the woman. In the case of the woman, the word image is omitted, although she, like the man, is the image of God. Paul is expounding the relation of the woman, not to God, but to man.
