<p>Prophecy. Not mere foretelling of the future. Quite probably very little of this element is contemplated; but utterance under immediate divine inspiration : delivering inspired exhortations, instructions, or warnings. See on prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:26">Luke 7:26</span>. The fact of direct inspiration distinguished prophecy from "teaching." </p>
<p>Discerning of spirits. Rev., correctly, discernings. Distinguishing between the different prophetic utterances, whether they proceed from true or false spirits. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:2">1 John 4:2</span>. </p>

<p>III. RECORDED FACTS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. </p>
<p>(1.) The first recorded bestowment of the gift was at Pentecost (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:0">Acts 2:0</span>.). The question arises whether the speakers were miraculously endowed to speak with other tongues, or whether the Spirit interpreted the apostle 's words to each in his own tongue. </p>
<p>Probably the latter was the case, since there is no subsequent notice of the apostles preaching in foreign tongues; there is no allusion to foreign tongues by Peter, nor by Joel, whom he quotes. This fact, moreover, would go to explain the opposite effects on the hearers. </p>
<p>(2.) Under the power of the Spirit, the company addressed by Peter in the house of Cornelius at Caesarea spake with tongues. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:44-46">Acts 10:44-46</span>. </p>
<p>(3.) Certain disciples at Ephesus, who received the Holy Spirit in the laying on of Paul 's hands, spake with tongues and prophesied, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:6">Acts 19:6</span>. </p>
<p>MEANING OF THE TERM "TONGUE." The various explanations are : the tongue alone, inarticulately : rare, provincial, poetic, or archaic words : language or dialect. The last is the correct definition. It does not necessarily mean any of the known languages of men, but may mean the speaker's own tongue, shaped in a peculiar manner by the Spirit's influence; or an entirely new spiritual language. </p>
<p>NATURE OF THE GIFT IN THE CORINTHIAN CHURCH. </p>
<p>(1.) The gift itself was identical with that at Pentecost, at Caesarea, and at Ephesus, but differed in its manifestations, in that it required an interpreter. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:10">1 Corinthians 12:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:30">1 Corinthians 12:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:5">1 Corinthians 14:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:13">1 Corinthians 14:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:26">1 Corinthians 14:26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:27">1 Corinthians 14:27</span>. (2.) It was closely connected with prophesying : <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:1-6">1 Corinthians 14:1-6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:22">1 Corinthians 14:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:25">1 Corinthians 14:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:16-18">Acts 2:16-18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:6">Acts 19:6</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:19">1 Thessalonians 5:19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:20">1 Thessalonians 5:20</span>. It was distinguished from prophesying as an inferior gift, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:4">1 Corinthians 14:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:5">1 Corinthians 14:5</span>; and as consisting in expressions of praise or devotion rather than of exhortation, warning, or prediction, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:14-16">1 Corinthians 14:14-16</span>. </p>
<p>(3.) It was an ecstatic utterance, unintelligible to the hearers, and requiring interpretation, or a corresponding ecstatic condition on the part of the hearer in order to understand it. It was not for the edification of the hearer but of the speaker, and even the speaker did not always understand it, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:2">1 Corinthians 14:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:19">1 Corinthians 14:19</span>. It therefore impressed unchristian bystanders as a barbarous utterance, the effect of madness or drunkenness, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:13">Acts 2:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:15">Acts 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:11">1 Corinthians 14:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:23">1 Corinthians 14:23</span>. Hence it is distinguished from the utterance of the understanding, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:4">1 Corinthians 14:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:14-16">1 Corinthians 14:14-16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:19">1 Corinthians 14:19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:27">1 Corinthians 14:27</span>. </p>
<p>PAUL?ESTIMATE OF THE GIFT. He himself was a master of the gift (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:18">1 Corinthians 14:18</span>), but he assigned it an inferior position (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:4">1 Corinthians 14:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:5">1 Corinthians 14:5</span>), and distinctly gave prophesying and speaking with the understanding the preference (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:2">1 Corinthians 14:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:5">1 Corinthians 14:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:19">1 Corinthians 14:19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:22">1 Corinthians 14:22</span>). VII. RESULTS AND PERMANENCE. Being recognized distinctly as a gift of the Spirit, it must be inferred that it contributed in some way to the edification of the Church; but it led to occasional disorderly outbreaks (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:9">1 Corinthians 14:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:11">1 Corinthians 14:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:17">1 Corinthians 14:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:20-23">1 Corinthians 14:20-23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:26-28">1 Corinthians 14:26-28</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:40">1 Corinthians 14:40</span>). As a fact it soon passed away from the Church. It is not mentioned in the Catholic or Pastoral Epistles. A few allusions to it occur in the writings of the fathers of the second century. Ecstatic conditions and manifestations marked the Montanists at the close of the second century, and an account of such a case, in which a woman was the subject, is given by Tertullian. Similar phenomena have emerged at intervals in various sects, at times of great religious excitement, as among the Camisards in France, the early Quakers and Methodists, and especially the Irvingites. 121</p>
