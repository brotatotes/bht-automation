Made to drink [εποτισθημεν] . The verb means originally to give to drink, from which comes the sense of to water or irrigate. The former is invariably the sense in the gospels and Revelation; the latter in 1 Corinthians 3:6-8, and by some here. The reference is to the reception of the Spirit in baptism. Omit into before one Spirit.
