<p>Made to drink [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποτισθημεν] </span></span>. The verb means originally to give to drink, from which comes the sense of to water or irrigate. The former is invariably the sense in the gospels and Revelation; the latter in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:6-8">1 Corinthians 3:6-8</span>, and by some here. The reference is to the reception of the Spirit in baptism. Omit into before one Spirit.</p>
