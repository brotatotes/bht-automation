Seem to be [δοκουντα - υπαρχειν] . The allusion is probably to those which seem to be weaker in their original structure, naturally. This may be indicated by the use of uJparcein to be (see on James 2:15); compare einai to be, in ver. 23. Others explain of those which on occasion seem to be weaker, as when a member is diseased.
