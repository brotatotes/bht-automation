We bestow [περιτιθεμεν] . Elsewhere in the New Testament the word is used, without exception, of encircling with something; either putting on clothing, as Matthew 27:28; or surrounding with a fence, as Matthew 21:33; or of the sponge placed round the reed, as Mark 14:36; John 19:29. So evidently here. Rev., in margin, put on. The more abundant honor is shown by the care in clothing. Uncomely - comeliness [ασχημονα - ευσχημοσυνην] . See on honorable, Mark 14:43; shame, Revelation 16:15. Compare ajschmonein behaveth uncomely, ch. 7 36. The comeliness is outward, as is shown by the verb we put on, and by the compounds of ochma fashion. See on transfigured, Matthew 17:2.
