<p>We bestow [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιτιθεμεν] </span></span>. Elsewhere in the New Testament the word is used, without exception, of encircling with something; either putting on clothing, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:28">Matthew 27:28</span>; or surrounding with a fence, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:33">Matthew 21:33</span>; or of the sponge placed round the reed, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:36">Mark 14:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:29">John 19:29</span>. So evidently here. Rev., in margin, put on. The more abundant honor is shown by the care in clothing. </p>
<p>Uncomely - comeliness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασχημονα - ευσχημοσυνην] </span></span>. See on honorable, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:43">Mark 14:43</span>; shame, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+16:15">Revelation 16:15</span>. Compare ajschmonein behaveth uncomely, ch. 7 36. The comeliness is outward, as is shown by the verb we put on, and by the compounds of ochma fashion. See on transfigured, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:2">Matthew 17:2</span>.</p>
