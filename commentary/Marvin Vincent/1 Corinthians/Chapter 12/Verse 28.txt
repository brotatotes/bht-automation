Ignatius, in his letter to Polycarp says : "The occasion demands thee, as pilots [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυβερνηται</span></span>] the winds." The reading is disputed, but the sense seems to be that the crisis demands Polycarp as a pilot. Lightfoot says that this is the earliest example of a simile which was afterward used largely by christian writers - the comparison of the Church to a ship. Hippolytus represents the mast as the cross; the two rudders the two covenants; the undergirding ropes the love of Christ. The ship is one of the ornaments which Clement of Alexandria allows a Christian to wear (" Apostolic Fathers, " Part 2, Ignatius to Polycarp, 2.).</p>
