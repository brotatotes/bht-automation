Hath set [εθετο] . See on ver. 18. The middle voice implies for His own use. Miracles. Note the change from endowed persons to abstract gifts, and compare the reverse order, Romans 12:6-8. Helps [αντιλημψεις] . Rendered to the poor and sick as by the deacons. See on hath holpen, Luke 1:54. Governments [κυβερνησεις] . Only here in the New Testament. From kubernaw to steer. The kindred kubernhthv shipmaster or steersman, occurs Acts 27:11; Revelation 18:17. Referring probably to administrators of church government, as presbyters. The marginal wise counsels (Rev.) is based on Septuagint usage, as Proverbs 1:5; Proverbs 20:21. Compare Proverbs 11:14; Proverbs 24:6. Ignatius, in his letter to Polycarp says : "The occasion demands thee, as pilots [κυβερνηται] the winds." The reading is disputed, but the sense seems to be that the crisis demands Polycarp as a pilot. Lightfoot says that this is the earliest example of a simile which was afterward used largely by christian writers - the comparison of the Church to a ship. Hippolytus represents the mast as the cross; the two rudders the two covenants; the undergirding ropes the love of Christ. The ship is one of the ornaments which Clement of Alexandria allows a Christian to wear (" Apostolic Fathers, " Part 2, Ignatius to Polycarp, 2.).
