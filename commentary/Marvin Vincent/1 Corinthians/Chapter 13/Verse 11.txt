<p>A child. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:1">1 Corinthians 3:1</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span>. </p>
<p>I understood [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφρονουν] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:5">Romans 8:5</span>. The kindred noun frenev occurs only once in the New Testament, ch. 14 20, where also it is associated with children in the sense of reflection or discrimination. Rev. renders felt; but the verb, as Edwards correctly remarks, is not the generic term for emotion, though it may be used for what includes emotion. The reference here is to the earlier undeveloped exercise of the childish mind; a thinking which is not yet connected reasoning. This last is expressed by elogizomhn I thought or reasoned. There seems to be a covert reference to the successive stages of development; mere idle prating; thought, in the sense of crude, general notions; consecutive reasoning. </p>
<p>When I became [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτε γεγονα] </span></span>. Rev., better, giving the force of the perfect tense, now that I am become. Hence I have put away for I put away. Lit., have brought them to nought.</p>
