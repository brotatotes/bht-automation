<p>Faileth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπιπει] </span></span>. Falls off [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>] like a leaf or flower, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:11">James 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:24">1 Peter 1:24</span>. In classical Greek it was used of an actor who was hissed off the stage. But the correct reading is piptei falls, in a little more general sense, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:17">Luke 16:17</span>. Love holds its place.</p>
