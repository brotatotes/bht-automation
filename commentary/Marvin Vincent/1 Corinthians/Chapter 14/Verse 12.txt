<p>Spiritual gifts [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματων] </span></span>. Lit., spirits. Paul treats the different spiritual manifestations as if they represented a variety of spirits. To an observer of the unseemly rivalries it would appear as if not one spirit, but different spirits, were the object of their zeal.</p>
