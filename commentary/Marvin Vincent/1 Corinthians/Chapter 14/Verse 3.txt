<p>To edification - exhortation - comfort [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδομην - παρακλησιν - παραμυθιαν] </span></span>. Omit to. For edification see on build up, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:32">Acts 20:32</span>. Exhortation, so American Rev. Rev., comfort. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:24">Luke 6:24</span>. Paramuqia comfort, Rev., consolation, occurs only here in the New Testament. Paramuqion, which is the same, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:1">Philippians 2:1</span>. The two latter words are found together in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:1">Philippians 2:1</span>, and their kindred verbs in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:11">1 Thessalonians 2:11</span>. The differences in rendering are not important. The words will bear either of the meanings in the two Revisions. If paraklhsin be rendered as Rev., comfort, paramuqia might be rendered incentive, which implies exhortation. Consolation and comfort border a little too closely on each other.</p>
