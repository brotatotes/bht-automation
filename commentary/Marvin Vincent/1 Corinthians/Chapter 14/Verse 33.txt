Confusion [ακαταστασιας] . See on commotions, Luke 21:9; and unruly, James 3:8. Compare 2 Corinthians 6:5. As in all the churches of the saints. Many connect these words with let the women, etc. The old arrangement is retained by Rev. and by Westcott and Hort, though the latter regard the words and the spirits - of peace as parenthetical. I see no good reason for departing from the old arrangement.
