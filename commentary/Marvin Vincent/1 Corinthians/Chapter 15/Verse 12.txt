There is no resurrection. Compare Aeschylus : "But who can recall by charms a man's dark blood shed in death, when once it has fallen to the ground at his feet ? Had this been lawful, Zeus would not have stopped him who knew the right way to restore men from the dead" 127 (" Agamemnon, " 987 - 992).
