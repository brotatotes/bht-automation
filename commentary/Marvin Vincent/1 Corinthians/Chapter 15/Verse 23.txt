<p>Order [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταγματι] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. In Sept., a band, troop, or cohort; also a standard; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+10:14">Numbers 10:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+18:22">Numbers 18:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+18:25">Numbers 18:25</span>. How the one idea ran into the other may be perceived from the analogy of the Latin manipulus, a handful of hay twisted round a pole and used by the Romans as the standard of a company of soldiers, from which the company itself was called manipulus. In classical Greek, besides the meaning of company, it means an ordinance and a fixed assessment. Here in the sense of band, or company, in pursuance of the principle of a descending series of ranks, and of consequent subordinations which is assumed by Paul. The series runs, God, Christ, man. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:21-23">1 Corinthians 3:21-23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:3">1 Corinthians 11:3</span>. The reference is not to time or merit, but simply to the fact that each occupies his own place in the economy of resurrection, which is one great process in several acts. Band after band rises. First Christ, then Christians. The same idea appears in the first - fruits and the harvest.</p>
