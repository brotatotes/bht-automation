<p>When He saith [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν ειπη] </span></span>. God, speaking through the Psalmist (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:6">Psalms 8:6</span>). Some, however, give a future force to the verb, and render but when He shall have said; i e., when, at the end, God shall have said, "All things are put under Him. The subjection is accomplished." See Rev., margin.</p>
