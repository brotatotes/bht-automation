<p>Communications [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομιλιαι] </span></span>. Wrong. Lit., companionships. Rev., company. </p>
<p>Manners [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηθη] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. Originally hqov means an accustomed seat or haunt; thence custom, usage; plural, manners, morals, character. The passage, "Evil company doth corrupt good manners," is an iambic line; either the repetition of a current proverb, or a citation of the same proverb from the poet Menander. Compare Aeschylus : "Alas for the ill - luck in mortals that brings this honest man into company with those who have less regard for religion. In every matter, indeed, nothing is worse than evil - fellowship" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομιλιας</span></span>] (" Seven against Thebes, " 593 - 595).</p>
