Communications [ομιλιαι] . Wrong. Lit., companionships. Rev., company. Manners [ηθη] . Only here in the New Testament. Originally hqov means an accustomed seat or haunt; thence custom, usage; plural, manners, morals, character. The passage, "Evil company doth corrupt good manners," is an iambic line; either the repetition of a current proverb, or a citation of the same proverb from the poet Menander. Compare Aeschylus : "Alas for the ill - luck in mortals that brings this honest man into company with those who have less regard for religion. In every matter, indeed, nothing is worse than evil - fellowship" [ομιλιας] (" Seven against Thebes, " 593 - 595).
