How - with what [πως - ποιω] . Rev., correctly, with what manner of. There are two questions : the first as to the manner, the second as to the form in which resurrection is to take place. The answer to the first, How, etc., is, the body is raised through death (ver. 36); to the second, with what kind of a body, the answer, expanded throughout nearly the whole chapter, is, a spiritual body. Body [σωματι] . Organism. The objection assumes that the risen man must exist in some kind of an organism; and as this cannot be the fleshly body which is corrupted and dissolved, resurrection is impossible. Swma body is related to sarx flesh, as general to special; swma denoting the material organism, not apart from any matter, but apart from any definite matter; and sarx the definite earthly, animal organism. See on Romans 6:6. The question is not, what will be the substance of the risen body, but what will be its organization (Wendt)?
