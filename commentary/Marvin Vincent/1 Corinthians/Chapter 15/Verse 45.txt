A living soul [ψυχην ζωσαν] . See Genesis 2:7. Here yuch passes into its personal sense - an individual personality (see Romans 11:4), yet retaining the emphatic reference to the yuch as the distinctive principle of that individuality in contrast with the pneuma spirit following. Hence this fact illustrates the general statement there is a natural body : such was Adam 's, the receptacle and organ of the yuch soul. Last Adam. Christ. Put over against Adam because of the peculiar relation in which both stand to the race : Adam as the physical, Christ as the spiritual head. Adam the head of the race in its sin, Christ in its redemption. Compare Romans 5:14. Quickening spirit [πνευμα ζωοποιουν] . Rev., life - giving. Not merely living, but imparting life. Compare John 1:4; John 3:36; John 5:26, John 5:40; John 6:33 John 6:35; John 10:10; John 11:25; John 14:6. The period at which Christ became a quickening Spirit is the resurrection, after which His body began to take on the characteristics of a spiritual body. 133 See Romans 6:4; 1 Peter 1:21.
