Earthy [χοικος] . Only in this chapter. The kindred noun couv dust appears Mark 6:11; Revelation 18:19. From cew to pour; hence of earth thrown down or heaped up : loose earth. Compare Genesis 2:7, Sept., where the word is used. From heaven [εζ ουρανου] . Ex out of, marking the origin, as ejk ghv out of the earth. Meyer acutely remarks that "no predicate in this second clause corresponds to the earthy of the first half of the verse, because the material of the glorified body of Christ transcends alike conception and expression." The phrase includes both the divine origin and the heavenly nature; and its reference, determined by the line of the whole argument, is to the glorified body of Christ - the Lord who shall descend from heaven in His glorified body.
