<p>We shall bear [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαορεσομεν] </span></span>. The great weight of authority is in favor of foreswmen let us bear. This reading presents a similar difficulty to that of let us have in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1">Romans 5:1</span> (see note). The context and the general drift of the argument are certainly against it. The perceptive or hortative subjunctive is, as Ellicott remarks, singularly out of place and unlooked for. It may possibly be a case of itacism, i e., the confusing of one vowel with another in pronunciation leading to a loose mode of orthography.</p>
