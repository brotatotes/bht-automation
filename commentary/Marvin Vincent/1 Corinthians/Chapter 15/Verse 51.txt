We shall not all sleep [παντες ου κοιμηθησομεθα] . Not, there is not one of us now living who shall die before the Lord 's coming, but, we shall not all die. There will be some of us Christians living when the Lord comes, but we shall be changed. The other rendering would commit the apostle to the extent of believing that not one Christian would die before the coming of Christ.
