<p>Is swallowed up [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεποθη] </span></span>. From <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+25:8">Isaiah 25:8</span>. The quotation agrees with the Hebrew : He shall swallow up death forever, rather than with the Septuagint, Death has prevailed and swallowed men up, which reverses the meaning of the Hebrew. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:4">2 Corinthians 5:4</span>. </p>
<p>In victory [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις νικος] </span></span>. Lit., unto victory, so that victory is to be established.</p>
