<p>O death, where, etc. From <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ho+13:14">Hosea 13:14</span>, a free version of the Sept. : " Where is thy penalty, O Death ? Where thy sting, O Hades ? Heb. : Where are thy plagues, O Death ? Where thy pestilence, O Sheol? </p>
<p>O grave [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδη] </span></span>. Which is the reading of the Septuagint. The correct reading is qanate O death. So Rev. Hades does not occur in Paul 's writings. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:7">Romans 10:7</span> he uses abyss. Edwards thinks that this is intentional, and suggests that Paul, writing to Greeks, may have shunned the ill - omened name which people dreaded to utter. So Plato : "People in general use the word (Pluto) as a euphemism for Hades, which their fears lead them to derive erroneously from ajeidhv the invisible" (" Cratylus, " 403). </p>
<p>Sting [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεντρον] </span></span>. In the Septuagint for the Hebrew pestilence. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+9:9">Revelation 9:9</span>. The image is that of a beast with a sting; not death with a goad, driving men.</p>
