That which was lacking on your part [το υμετερο υστερημα] . Or the (i. e. my) lack of you. The Greek will bear either rendering. Compare Philippians 2:30; 2 Corinthians 8:14; 2 Corinthians 9:12. The latter is preferable. Edwards, somewhat naively says : "I do not see what could be lacking on the part of the Corinthians which Stephanas and his two friends could supply at Ephesus."
