<p>That which was lacking on your part [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το υμετερο υστερημα] </span></span>. Or the (i. e. my) lack of you. The Greek will bear either rendering. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:30">Philippians 2:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:14">2 Corinthians 8:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:12">2 Corinthians 9:12</span>. The latter is preferable. Edwards, somewhat naively says : "I do not see what could be lacking on the part of the Corinthians which Stephanas and his two friends could supply at Ephesus."</p>
