<p>Upon the first day of the week [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα μιαν σαββατου] </span></span>. Kata has a distributive force, every first day. For week, lit., Sabbath, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7">Acts 20:7</span>. </p>
<p>Lay by him in store [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρ εαυτω τιθετω θησαυριζων] </span></span>. Lit., put by himself treasuring. Put by at home. 137 As God hath prospered [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο τι αν ευοδωται] </span></span>. Lit., whatsoever he may prosper in. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:10">Romans 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:2">3 John 1:2</span>; and on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:29">Acts 11:29</span> for the verb eujporew in the similar sense of making a prosperous journey. </p>
<p>No gatherings, etc. Rev., collections. The amount would be greater through systematic weekly saving than through collections made once for all on his arrival. </p>
<p>When I am come [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν ελθω τοτε] </span></span>. Lit., then whenever I may have come. The indefinite whenever and the emphatic then indicate his unwillingness to rely upon a special contribution called forth by his arrival at any uncertain time. Christian beneficence is to be the outcome of a settled principle, not of an occasional impulse.</p>
