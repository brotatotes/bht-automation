Upon the first day of the week [κατα μιαν σαββατου] . Kata has a distributive force, every first day. For week, lit., Sabbath, see on Acts 20:7. Lay by him in store [παρ εαυτω τιθετω θησαυριζων] . Lit., put by himself treasuring. Put by at home. 137 As God hath prospered [ο τι αν ευοδωται] . Lit., whatsoever he may prosper in. See on Romans 1:10; 3 John 1:2; and on Acts 11:29 for the verb eujporew in the similar sense of making a prosperous journey. No gatherings, etc. Rev., collections. The amount would be greater through systematic weekly saving than through collections made once for all on his arrival. When I am come [οταν ελθω τοτε] . Lit., then whenever I may have come. The indefinite whenever and the emphatic then indicate his unwillingness to rely upon a special contribution called forth by his arrival at any uncertain time. Christian beneficence is to be the outcome of a settled principle, not of an occasional impulse.
