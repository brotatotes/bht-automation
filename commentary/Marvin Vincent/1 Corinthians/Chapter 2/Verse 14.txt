<p>The natural man [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχικος ανθρωπος] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:4">Romans 11:4</span>, on the distinction between yuch soul, life, and pneuma spirit. The contrast is between a man governed by the divine Spirit and one from whom that Spirit is absent. But yucikov natural, is not equivalent to sarkikov fleshy. Paul is speaking of natural as contrasted with spiritual cognition applied to spiritual truth, and therefore of the yuch soul, as the organ of human cognition, contrasted with the pneuma spirit, as the organ of spiritual cognition. The man, therefore, whose cognition of truth depends solely upon his natural insight is yucikov natural, as contrasted with the spiritual man [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικος</span></span>] to whom divine insight is imparted. In other words, the organ employed in the apprehension of spiritual truth characterizes the man. Paul therefore "characterizes the man who is not yet capable of understanding divine wisdom as yucikov, i e., as one who possesses in his yuch soul, simply the organ of purely human cognition, but has not yet the organ of religious cognition in the pneuma spirit" (Dickson). 82 It is perhaps impossible to find an English word which will accurately render yucikov. Psychic is simply the Greek transcribed. We can do no better than hold by the A. V. natural. 83 Receiveth not [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου δεχεται] </span></span>. Not, does not understand, but does not admit them into his heart; thus, according to New Testament usage, when the word is used in connection with teaching. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:13">Luke 8:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:14">Acts 8:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1">Acts 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:6">1 Thessalonians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:21">James 1:21</span>. </p>
<p>Are foolishness. Not merely seem. To him they are. </p>
<p>Neither can he know [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και ου δυναται γνωναι] </span></span>. Rev., more strictly, and he cannot know. "It is an utter perversion of such statements to maintain that there is in the natural man any organic, constitutional incapacity of spiritual perception requiring to be created in them by the Holy Spirit.... The uniform teaching of Scripture is that the change effected in regeneration is a purely moral and spiritual one" (Brown). </p>
<p>Discerned [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακρινεται] </span></span>. Rev., judged. Used only by Luke and Paul, and by the latter in this epistle only. By Luke, mostly of judicial examination : <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:14">Luke 23:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:9">Acts 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:19">Acts 12:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:8">Acts 24:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:18">Acts 28:18</span>. Of examining the Scriptures, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:11">Acts 17:11</span>, but with the sense of proving or coming to a judgment on. The fundamental idea of the word is examination, scrutiny, following up [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα</span></span>] a series of objects or particulars in order to distinguish [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω] </span></span>. This is its almost universal meaning in classical Greek. At Athens it was used technically in two senses : to examine magistrates with a view to proving their qualifications; and to examine persons concerned in a suit, so as to prepare the matter for trial, as a grand jury. The meaning judged is, at best, inferential, and the Rev. inserts examined in the margin. Bishop Lightfoot says : "Anakrinein is neither to judge nor to discern; but to examine, investigate, inquire into, question, as it is rightly translated, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:3">1 Corinthians 9:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:25">1 Corinthians 10:25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:27">1 Corinthians 10:27</span>. The apostle condemns all these impatient human praejudicia which anticipate the final judgment, reserving his case for the great tribunal, where at length all the evidence will be forthcoming and a satisfactory verdict can be given. Meanwhile the process of gathering evidence has begun; an ajnakrisiv investigation is indeed being held, not, however, by these self - appointed magistrates, but by one who alone has the authority to institute the inquiry, and the ability to sift the facts" (" On a Fresh Revision of the New Testament "). See, further, on ch. 4 3, 4.</p>
