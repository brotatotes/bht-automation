<p>Eye hath not seen, etc. From <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+64:4">Isaiah 64:4</span>, freely rendered by Septuagint. The Hebrew reads : "From of old men have not heard, not perceived with the ear, eye has not seen a God beside Thee who does (gloriously) for him who waits on Him." Septuagint, "From of old we have not heard, nor have our eyes seen a God beside Thee, and Thy works which Thou wilt do for those who wait for mercy."
