<p>He taketh [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δρασσομενος] </span></span>. Cited from <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+5:13">Job 5:13</span>, but not following the Septuagint verbally. The verb occurs only here, meaning to grasp with the hand. Rev., more accurately, gives the force of the participle with the article, he that taketh. This is the only allusion to the book of Job in the New Testament, except <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:11">James 5:11</span>.</p>
