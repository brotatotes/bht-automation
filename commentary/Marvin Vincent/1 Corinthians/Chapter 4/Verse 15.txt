<p>Tutors [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδαγωγους] </span></span>. From paiv boy and ajgwgov leader. The Paedagogus was a slave to whom boys were entrusted on leaving the care of the females, which was somewhere about their sixteenth year. He was often a foreigner, sometimes educated and refined, but often otherwise; for Plutarch complains that seamen, traders, usurers, and farmers are engaged in this capacity. The office was one of general guardianship, not of instruction, though sometimes the paedagogus acted as teacher. He accompanied the boy to school, carrying his books, etc., and attended him to the gymnasium and elsewhere. 87 See, further, on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:24">Galatians 3:24</span>. </p>
