<p>Judge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινετε] </span></span>. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14">1 Corinthians 2:14</span>. The change of the verb favors the rendering examine for ajnakrinw. The Lord is the only competent examiner therefore do not judge until He comes to judgment. Even I myself am not competent to institute a conclusive examination, for the absence of condemnation from my conscience does not absolutely acquit me. See the critical note on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:19-22">1 John 3:19-22</span>.</p>
