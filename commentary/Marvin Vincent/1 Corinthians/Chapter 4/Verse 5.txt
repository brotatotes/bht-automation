Judge [κρινετε] . See on ch. 1 Corinthians 2:14. The change of the verb favors the rendering examine for ajnakrinw. The Lord is the only competent examiner therefore do not judge until He comes to judgment. Even I myself am not competent to institute a conclusive examination, for the absence of condemnation from my conscience does not absolutely acquit me. See the critical note on 1 John 3:19-22.
