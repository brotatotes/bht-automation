Commonly [ολως] . Better, absolutely or actually, as Rev. Should have. Opinions are divided as to whether the relation was that of marriage or concubinage. The former is urged on the ground that ecein to have is commonly used in the New Testament of marriage; and that the aorist participles poihsav (so Tex. Rec.) had done, and katergasamenon hath wrought, imply that an incestuous marriage had already taken place. It is urged, on the other hand, that ecein to have is used of concubinage, John 4:18; but it takes its meaning there from the sense of marriage in the preceding clause, and is really a kind of play on the word. "He who now stands for thy husband is not thy husband." The indications seem to be in favor of marriage. Notwithstanding the facilities for divorce afforded by the Roman law, and the loose morals of the Corinthians, for a man to marry his stepmother was regarded as a scandal.
