<p>Idolaters [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδωλολατραις] </span></span>. Only twice outside of Paul 's writings : <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:8">Revelation 21:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+22:15">Revelation 22:15</span>. This is the earliest known instance of the use of the word. For the collocation of the covetous and idolaters, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:15">Colossians 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>. New - Testament usage does not confine the term to the worship of images, but extends it to the soul 's devotion to any object which usurps the place of God.</p>
