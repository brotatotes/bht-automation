Idolaters [ειδωλολατραις] . Only twice outside of Paul 's writings : Revelation 21:8; Revelation 22:15. This is the earliest known instance of the use of the word. For the collocation of the covetous and idolaters, compare Colossians 3:15; Ephesians 5:5. New - Testament usage does not confine the term to the worship of images, but extends it to the soul 's devotion to any object which usurps the place of God.
