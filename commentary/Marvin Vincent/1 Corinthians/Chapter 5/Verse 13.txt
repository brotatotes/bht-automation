Wicked [πονηρον] . Mischievous to the Church. See on Luke 3:19. The usage of the Septuagint emphasizes the idea of active harmfulness. The word has, however, in some passages, the sense of niggardly or grudging, and the Hebrew word which is usually translated by ponhrov mischievous, is sometimes rendered by baskanov malignant, with a distinct reference to the "evil" or "grudging eye." This sense may go to explain Matthew 20:15, and possibly Matthew 6:19, and Matthew 7:11.
