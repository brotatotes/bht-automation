<p>To deliver - unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh. On this very obscure and much controverted passage it may be observed : </p>
<p>1. That it implies excommunication from the Church. </p>
<p>2. That it implies something more, the nature of which is not clearly known. </p>
<p>3. That casting the offender out of the Church involved casting him back into the heathen world, which Paul habitually conceives as under the power of Satan. </p>
<p>4. That Paul has in view the reformation of the offender : "that the spirit may be saved," etc. </p>
<p>This reformation is to be through affliction, disease, pain, or loss, which also he is wont to conceive as Satan 's work. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:18">1 Thessalonians 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:16">Luke 13:16</span>. Hence in delivering him over to these he uses the phrase deliver unto Satan. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20">1 Timothy 1:20</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:8">1 Timothy 1:8</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:8">1 Timothy 1:8</span></p>
