Compare Ignatius; "Dispense, therefore, with the evil leaven that has grown old [παλαιωθεισαν] and that has gone sour [ενοξισασαν] , and be changed into new leaven which is Jesus Christ" (Epistle to Magnesians, 10.). New [νεον] . See on Matthew 26:29. Passover [το πασχα] . The Paschal lamb, as Mark 14:12; Luke 22:7.
