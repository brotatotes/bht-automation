<p>Let us keep the feast [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εορταζωμεν] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. The epistle was probably written a short time before the Passover. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:8">1 Corinthians 16:8</span>. </p>
<p>Sincerity [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειλικρινειας] </span></span>. See on pure minds, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:1">2 Peter 3:1</span>. </p>
