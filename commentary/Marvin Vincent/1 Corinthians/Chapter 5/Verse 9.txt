<p>I write - in my epistle. American Rev., as it is I wrote. The reference is probably to a former letter now lost. Some explain egraya I wrote as the epistolary aorist (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:13">1 John 2:13</span>); but the words in my epistle seem to favor the other view. </p>
<p>To company [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναναμιγνυσθαι</span></span>] : Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:14">2 Thessalonians 3:14</span>. The translation company is inadequate, but cannot perhaps be bettered. The word is compounded of sun together, ajna up and down among, and, mignumi to mingle. It denotes, therefore, not only close, but habitual, intercourse.</p>
