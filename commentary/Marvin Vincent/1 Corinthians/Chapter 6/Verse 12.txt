Are lawful [εξεστιν] . There is a play between this word and ejxousiasqhsomai be brought under the power, which can hardly be accurately conveyed to the English reader. The nearest approach to it is : "all things are in my power, but I shall not be brought under the power of any." Will - be brought under the power [εξουσιασθησομαι] . From ejxousia power of choice, permissive authority. See on Mark 2:10. This in turn is derived from exesti it is permitted. See above on are lawful. This kinship of the two words explains the play upon them.
