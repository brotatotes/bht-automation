<p>Matters [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριτηριων] </span></span>. The word means, 1, The instrument or rule of judging; 2, the tribunal of a judge. It occurs only here, ver. 4, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:6">James 2:6</span>, where it means judgment - seats. This latter gives a good sense here without having recourse to the meaning suit or case, which lacks warrant. So Rev., in margin, "are ye unworthy of the smallest tribunals?" That is, are ye unworthy of holding or passing judgment in such inferior courts ?</p>
