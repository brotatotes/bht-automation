<p>Judgments [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριτηρια] </span></span>. Better, tribunals or courts, as ver. 2. If you have to hold courts for the settlement of private matters. </p>
<p>Set [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθιζετε] </span></span>. Seat them as judges on the tribunal. It is disputed whether kaqizete is to be taken as imperative, set (A. V.), or as interrogative, do ye set (Rev.). 89 The A. V. seems, on the whole, preferable. The passage is well paraphrased by Farrar. "Dare they, the destined judges of the world and of angels, go to law about mere earthly trifles, and that before the heathen ? Why did they not rather set up the very humblest members of the Church to act as judges in such matters?" 90</p>
