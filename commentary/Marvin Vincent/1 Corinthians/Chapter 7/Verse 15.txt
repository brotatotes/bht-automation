Is not under bondage [ου δεδουλωται] . A strong word, indicating that Christianity has not made marriage a state of slavery to believers. Compare dedetai is bound, ver. 39, a milder word. The meaning clearly is that willful desertion on the part of the unbelieving husband or wife sets the other party free. Such cases are not comprehended in Christ 's words. Hath called us to peace [εν ειρηνη κεκληκεν ημας] . Rev., correctly, in peace. Compare Galatians 1:6, "into the grace" (ejn cariti, Rev., in); Ephesians 4:4, in one hope [εν μια ελπιδι] ; 1 Thessalonians 4:7, in sanctification [εν αγιασμω] . Denoting the sphere or element of the divine calling. Enslavement in the marriage relation between the believer and the unbeliever is contrary to the spirit and intent of this calling.
