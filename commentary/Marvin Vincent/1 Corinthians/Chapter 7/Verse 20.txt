<p>Calling [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλησει] </span></span>, Not the condition or occupation, a meaning which the word does not have in classical Greek, nor in the New Testament, where it always signifies the call of God into His kingdom through conversion. Paul means : If God 's call was to you as a circumcised man or as an uncircumcised man; as a slave or as a freedman - abide in that condition. Compare ch. 1 26.</p>
