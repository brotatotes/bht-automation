<p>Virgins [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρθενων] </span></span>. Not the unmarried of both sexes, as Bengel. The use of the word by ecclesiastical writers for an unmarried man has no warrant in classical usage, and may have arisen from the misinterpretation of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+14:4">Revelation 14:4</span>, where it is employed adjectivally and metaphorically. In every other case in the New Testament the meaning is unquestionable.</p>
