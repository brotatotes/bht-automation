<p>I spare you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμων φειδομαι] </span></span>. Rev., "I would spare," is not warranted grammatically, but perhaps avoids the ambiguity of I spare, which might be understood : I spare you further mention of these things. The meaning is : I give you these injunctions in order to spare you the tribulation of the flesh.</p>
