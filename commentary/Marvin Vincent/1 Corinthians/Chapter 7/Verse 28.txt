I spare you [υμων φειδομαι] . Rev., "I would spare," is not warranted grammatically, but perhaps avoids the ambiguity of I spare, which might be understood : I spare you further mention of these things. The meaning is : I give you these injunctions in order to spare you the tribulation of the flesh.
