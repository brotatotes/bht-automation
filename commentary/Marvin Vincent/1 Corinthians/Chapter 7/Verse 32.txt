<p>Without carefulness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμεριμνους] </span></span>. Not a good translation, because carefulness has lost its earlier sense of anxiety. So Latimer : "This wicked carefulness of men, when they seek how to live - like as if there were no God at all." See on take no thought, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:25">Matthew 6:25</span>. Rev., free from cares. Ignatius uses the phrase ejn ajmerimnia Qeou in godly carelessness (Polycarp, 7.).</p>
