<p>There is a difference. The textual question here is very perplexing, and it is well - nigh impossible to explain the differences to the English reader. He must observe, 1st. That gunh wife is also the general term for woman, whether virgin, married, or widow. 2nd. That memeristai A. V., there is a difference, literally means, is divided, so that the literal rendering of the A. V., would be, the wife and the virgin are divided. Some of the best texts insert kai and both before and after is divided, and join that verb with the close of ver. 33, so that it reads : careth for the things of the world how he may please his wife, and he is distracted. This makes gunh and parqenov (A. V., wife and virgin) begin a new sentence connected with the preceding by kai and Gunh is rendered woman, and the words h agamov the unmarried, instead of beginning a sentence as A. V., are placed directly after woman as a qualifying phrase, so that the reading is hJ gunh hJ agamov the unmarried woman, and both this and hJ parqenov the virgin are nominative to merimna careth. The whole, then, from the beginning of ver 33, will read : But he who is married careth for the things of the world how he may please his wife, and he is distracted; and the unmarried woman and the virgin care for the things of the Lord. 98</p>
