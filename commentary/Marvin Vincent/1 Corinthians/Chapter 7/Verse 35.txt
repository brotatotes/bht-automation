Snare [βροχον] . Lit., a noose or slip - knot for hanging or strangling. Thus Homer of Jocasta : "She went to Hades having suspended a noose on high from the lofty roof" (" Odyssey, " 11, 278). Sophocles, of Antigone : "We descried her hanging by the neck, slung by a thread - wrought halter of fine linen" (" Antigone, " 1222). Also a snare for birds; the meshes of a net. That ye may attend [προς - ευπαρεδρον] . Only here in the New Testament. From euj well, paredrov setting beside. That ye may attend is a kind of circumlocution. The Greek reads literally : for that which is seemly and for that which is assiduous. Assiduous conveys the sense of the word as nearly as possible, since etymologically it means sitting close at. One is reminded of Mary at Bethany sitting at Jesus ' feet, Luke 10:39. Without distraction [απερισπαστως] See on Luke 10:40. The same word compounded here with aj not, is used of Martha 's being cumbered or distracted with much serving.
