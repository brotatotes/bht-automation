<p>Be dead [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοιμηθη] </span></span>. Lit., have fallen asleep. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:60">Acts 7:60</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:4">2 Peter 3:4</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:2">Romans 7:2</span>, where the usual word for die, ajpoqanh is used. In that passage Paul is discussing the abstract question. Here the inference is more personal, which is perhaps the reason for his using the more tender expression.</p>
