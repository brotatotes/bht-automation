Matthew 5:9 Matthew 5:9 "Such, if on high their thoughts are set, Nor in the stream the source forget, If prompt to quit the bliss they know, Following the Lamb where'er He go, By purest pleasure unbeguiled To idolize or wife or child : Such wedded souls our God shall own For faultless virgins round His throne."
