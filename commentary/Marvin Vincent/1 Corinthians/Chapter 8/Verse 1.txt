<p>Things offered unto idols [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδωλοθυτων] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+2:14">Revelation 2:14</span>. We know that we all, etc. The arrangement of the text is in question. Evidently a parenthesis intervenes between the beginning of ver. 1 and ver. </p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:0">1 Corinthians 8:0</span>:4It seems best to begin this parenthesis with knowledge puffeth up, and to end it with known of him (ver. 3). </p>
<p>We all have knowledge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντες γνωσιν εχομεν] </span></span>. The exact reference of these words must remain uncertain. Some understand Paul himself and the more enlightened Corinthians. Others, all Christians. All the expositions are but guesses. I prefer, on the whole, the view that Paul is here repeating, either verbally or in substance, a passage from the letter of the Corinthians to him. In that case the sense is slightly ironical : "We know, to use your own words, that we all have knowledge." The parenthesis thus comes in with an appropriate cautionary force. </p>
<p>Puffeth up. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:6">1 Corinthians 4:6</span>. The contrast is striking between puffing up and building up - a bubble and a building.</p>
