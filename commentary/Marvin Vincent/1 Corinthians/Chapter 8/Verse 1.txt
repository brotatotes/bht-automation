Things offered unto idols [ειδωλοθυτων] . See on Revelation 2:14. We know that we all, etc. The arrangement of the text is in question. Evidently a parenthesis intervenes between the beginning of ver. 1 and ver. 1 Corinthians 8:0:4It seems best to begin this parenthesis with knowledge puffeth up, and to end it with known of him (ver. 3). We all have knowledge [παντες γνωσιν εχομεν] . The exact reference of these words must remain uncertain. Some understand Paul himself and the more enlightened Corinthians. Others, all Christians. All the expositions are but guesses. I prefer, on the whole, the view that Paul is here repeating, either verbally or in substance, a passage from the letter of the Corinthians to him. In that case the sense is slightly ironical : "We know, to use your own words, that we all have knowledge." The parenthesis thus comes in with an appropriate cautionary force. Puffeth up. See on ch. 1 Corinthians 4:6. The contrast is striking between puffing up and building up - a bubble and a building.
