<p>For if l do this thing willingly, etc. The exact line of Paul 's thought is a matter of much discussion, and must be determined if we are to understand the force of the several words. It appears to be as follows : He has been speaking of the fact that he preaches at his own cost. He so glories in this that he would rather die than surrender this ground of boasting Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:7-12">2 Corinthians 11:7-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:13-16">2 Corinthians 12:13-16</span>. For it is the only ground of boasting that is possible to him. The preaching of the Gospel in itself furnishes no such ground, for one cannot boast of what he needs must do; and the necessity to preach the Gospel is laid on him under penalty of a "woe" if he refuse. He goes on to show, in two propositions, why and how there is no cause for boasting in preaching under necessity. 1 Supposing there were no necessity, but that he preached of free will, like the twelve who freely accepted the apostleship at Christ 's call, then he would rightfully have a reward, as a free man entering freely upon service; and so would have some ground of glorying. 2. But supposing I became an apostle under constraint, as was the fact, then I am not in the position of a free man who chooses at will, but of a slave who is made household steward by his master's will, without his own choice, and consequently I have no claim for reward and no ground of boasting. What, then, is my reward ? What ground of boasting have I? Only this : to make the Gospel without charge. In this I may glory. </p>
<p>Willingly - against my will [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκων - ακων] </span></span>. These words are not to be explained of the spirit in which Paul fulfilled his ministry; but of his attitude toward the apostolic charge when it was committed to him. He was seized upon by Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:12">Philippians 2:12</span>); constrained by His call on the way to Damascus. Rev., of mine own will - not of mine own will. Reward. Correlative with the second kauchma something to glory of, in ver. 16. </p>
<p>A dispensation is committed unto me [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικονομιαν πεπιστυμαι] </span></span>. Lit., I am entrusted with a stewardship. For a similar construction see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:2">Romans 3:2</span>. Stewards belonged to the class of slaves. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:42">Luke 12:42</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:43">Luke 12:43</span>, and note oijkonomov steward in ver. 42, and doulov ejkeinov that bond - servant in ver. 43. Paul is not degrading the gospel ministry to a servile office. He is only using the word to illustrate a single point - the manner of his appointment.</p>
