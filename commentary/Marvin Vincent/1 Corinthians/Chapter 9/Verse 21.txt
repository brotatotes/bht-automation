By intercourse with them, relinquishment of Jewish observances, and adapting his teaching to their modes of thought. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:0">Acts 17:0</span>. </p>
<p>Under law [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εννομος] </span></span>. The expression differs from that in ver. 20, uJpo nomon under law, though with only a shade of difference in meaning.
