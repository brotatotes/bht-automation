The candidate for the races was required to be ten months in training, and to practice in the gymnasium immediately before the games, under the direction of judges who had themselves been instructed for ten months in the details of the games. The training was largely dietary. Epictetus says : "Thou must be orderly, living on spare food; abstain from confections; make a point of exercising at the appointed time, in heat and in cold; nor drink cold water nor wine at hazard." Horace says : "The youth who would win in the race hath borne and done much; he hath sweat and been cold; he hath abstained from love and wine" (" Ars Poetica, "412).

Compare 2 Timothy 2:5. Crown [στεφανον] . Chaplet of pine - leaves. See on Revelation 4:4.
