<p>I keep under [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπωπιαζω] </span></span>. A feeble translation, and missing the metaphor. The word means to strike under the eye; to give one a black eye. It occurs elsewhere in the New Testament but once, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:5">Luke 18:5</span> (see note). Rev., I buffet. The blow of the trained boxer was the more formidable from the use of the cestus, consisting of ox - hide bands covered with knots and nails, and loaded with lead and iron. So Entellus throws his boxing - gloves into the ring, formed of seven bulls' hides with lead and iron sewed into them (Virgil, "Aeneid," 5, 405). They were sometimes called guiotoroi limb - breakers. A most interesting account is given by Rodolfo Lanziani, "Ancient Rome in the Light of Recent Discoveries," of the exhuming at the foundation of the Temple of the Sun, erected by Aurelian, of a sitting bronze statue of a boxer. The accompanying photograph shows the construction of the fur - lined boxing - gloves secured by thongs wound round the forearm half - way to the elbow. The gloves cover the thumb and the hand to the first finger - joints. The writer says; "The nose is swollen from the effects of the last blow received; the ears resemble a flat and shapeless piece of leather; the neck, the shoulders, the breast, are seamed with scars.... The details of the fur - lined boxing - gloves are also interesting, and one wonders how any human being, no matter how strong and powerful, could stand the blows from such weapons as these gloves, made of four or five thicknesses of leather, and fortified with brass knuckles." Bring it into subjection [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλαγωγω] </span></span>. Rev., bring in into bondage. Metaphor of captives after battle. Not of leading the vanquished round the arena (so Godet), a custom of which there is no trace, and which, in most cases, the condition of the vanquished would render impossible. It is rather one of those sudden changes and mixtures of metaphor so frequent in Paul 's writings. See, for instance, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:2">2 Corinthians 5:2</span>. </p>
<p>Having preached [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυξας] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span>. Some find in the word an allusion to the herald [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυξ</span></span>] who summoned the contestants and proclaimed the prizes. </p>
<p>Castaway [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδοκιμος] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:28">Romans 1:28</span>. Better, as Rev., rejected, as unworthy of the prize. </p>
