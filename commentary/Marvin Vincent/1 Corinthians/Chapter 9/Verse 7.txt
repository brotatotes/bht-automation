<p>Goeth a warfare [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατευεται] </span></span>. The "a" in a warfare is the abbreviated preposition on or in, as a coming, afield, going a pilgrimage. In the Geneva Bible, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+24:5">Deuteronomy 24:5</span> is rendered, "When a man taketh a newe wife, he shal not go a warfare." So Froissart : "He was not in good poynt to ride a warfare." The phrase, however, is incorrect as a translation, since the Greek word is used not only of war, but of military service in general. Soldiers are called strateuomenoi, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:14">Luke 3:14</span>. More correctly, who serveth as a soldier ? or, as Rev., what soldier servet? See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:14">Luke 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:1">James 4:1</span>. </p>
<p>Charges [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψωνιοις] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:14">Luke 3:14</span>, and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:23">Romans 6:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:8">2 Corinthians 11:8</span>. </p>
<p>Feedeth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμαινει] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:2">1 Peter 5:2</span>. Bengel remarks : "The minister of the gospel is beautifully compared with the soldier, vine - dresser, shepherd." He goes forth to contend with the world, to plant churches, and to exercise pastoral care over them.</p>
