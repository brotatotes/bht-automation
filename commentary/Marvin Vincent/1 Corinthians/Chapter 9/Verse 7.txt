Goeth a warfare [στρατευεται] . The "a" in a warfare is the abbreviated preposition on or in, as a coming, afield, going a pilgrimage. In the Geneva Bible, Deuteronomy 24:5 is rendered, "When a man taketh a newe wife, he shal not go a warfare." So Froissart : "He was not in good poynt to ride a warfare." The phrase, however, is incorrect as a translation, since the Greek word is used not only of war, but of military service in general. Soldiers are called strateuomenoi, Luke 3:14. More correctly, who serveth as a soldier ? or, as Rev., what soldier servet? See on Luke 3:14; James 4:1. Charges [οψωνιοις] . See on Luke 3:14, and compare Romans 6:23; 2 Corinthians 11:8. Feedeth [ποιμαινει] . See on 1 Peter 5:2. Bengel remarks : "The minister of the gospel is beautifully compared with the soldier, vine - dresser, shepherd." He goes forth to contend with the world, to plant churches, and to exercise pastoral care over them.
