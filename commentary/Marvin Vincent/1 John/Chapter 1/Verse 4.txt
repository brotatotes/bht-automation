<p>These things. The whole Epistle. </p>
<p>Write we unto you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφομεν υμιν] </span></span>. The best texts read hJmeiv we, instead of uJmin to you. Both the verb and the pronoun are emphatic. The writer speaks with conscious authority, and his message is to be not only announced (ajpaggellomen, ver. 3), but written. We write is emphasized by the absence of the personal object, to you. </p>
<p>Your joy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η χαρα υμων] </span></span>. The best texts read hJmwn, our, though either reading gives a good sense. </p>
<p>Full [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπληρωμενη</span></span>] More correctly, fulfilled. Frequent in John. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:29">John 3:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:8">John 7:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:38">John 8:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:11">John 14:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:12">2 John 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+6:11">Revelation 6:11</span>. "The peace of reconciliation, the blessed consciousness of sonship, the happy growth in holiness, the bright prospect of future completion and glory, - all these are but simple details of that which, in all its length and breadth is embraced by one word, Eternal Life, the real possession of which is the immediate source of our joy. We have joy, Christ 's joy, because we are blessed, because we have life itself in Christ" (Dusterdieck, cit. by Alford). And Augustine : "For there is a joy which is not given to the ungodly, but to those who love Thee for thine own sake, whose joy Thou thyself art. And this is the happy life, to rejoice to Thee, of Thee; this is it and there is no other" (" Confessions, "10 22). Alford is right in remarking that this verse gives an epistolary character to what follows, but it can hardly be said with him that it" fills the place of the cairein greeting, lit., rejoice, so common in the opening of Epistles.
