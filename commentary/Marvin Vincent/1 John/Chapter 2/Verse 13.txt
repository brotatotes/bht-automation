<p>Have known [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγνωκατε</span></span>] Rev., correctly, ye know. Knowledge is the characteristic of fathers; knowledge as the fruit of experience. Ye have perceived, therefore ye know. </p>
<p>Have overcome [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νενικηκατε] </span></span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:33">John 16:33</span>.

The prince of darkness is styled by John oJ diabolov the false accuser (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:2">John 13:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:8">1 John 3:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:10">1 John 3:10</span>.

Note the abrupt introduction of the word here, as indicating something familiar. I have written [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγραψα] </span></span>. Or, strictly, I wrote. Compare I write (vv. 12, 13), and note the change of tense. The past tense, I wrote, does not refer to some previous writing, as the Gospel, but, like the present, to this Epistle. The present, I write, refers to the immediate act of writing : the aorist is the epistolary aorist, by which the writer places himself at the reader's stand - point, regarding the writing as past. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:12">1 Peter 5:12</span>. I write, therefore, refers to the Apostle 's immediate act of writing; I have written, or I wrote, to the reader's act of reading the completed writing. </p>
<p>Little children [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδια] </span></span>. Compare teknia little children (ver. 1), which emphasizes the idea of kinship, while this word emphasizes the idea of subordination and consequent discipline. Hence it is the more appropriate word when spoken from the stand - point of authority rather than of affection. </p>
<p>Ye have known [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγνωκατε] </span></span>. Rev., correctly, ye known. </p>
<p>The Father. In His rightful authority, as a Father over little children.</p>
