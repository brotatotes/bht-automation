Fathers. Indicating age and authority. Have known [εγνωκατε] Rev., correctly, ye know. Knowledge is the characteristic of fathers; knowledge as the fruit of experience. Ye have perceived, therefore ye know. Have overcome [νενικηκατε] . Compare John 16:33. The image is characteristic of Revelation and First Epistle. See Revelation 2:7, Revelation 2:11, Revelation 2:17, Revelation 2:26; Revelation 12:11; Revelation 21:7; 1 John 2:14; 1 John 4:4; 1 John 5:4, 1 John 5:5. The evil one [τον πονηρον] . See on wickedness, Mark 7:22; evils, Luke 3:19; evil spirits, Luke 7:21. The prince of darkness is styled by John oJ diabolov the false accuser (John 8:44; John 13:2; 1 John 3:8, 1 John 3:10. See on Matthew 4:1) : oJ Satanav Satan, the adversary (John 13:27; compare oJ kathgwr the accuser, properly, in court, Revelation 12:10) : oJ ponhrov the evil one (John 17:15; 1 John 2:13, 1 John 2:14; 1 John 3:12; 1 John 5:18, 1 John 5:19) : oJ arcwn tou kosmou toutou the ruler of this world (John 12:31; John 14:30; John 16:11). Note the abrupt introduction of the word here, as indicating something familiar. I have written [εγραψα] . Or, strictly, I wrote. Compare I write (vv. 12, 13), and note the change of tense. The past tense, I wrote, does not refer to some previous writing, as the Gospel, but, like the present, to this Epistle. The present, I write, refers to the immediate act of writing : the aorist is the epistolary aorist, by which the writer places himself at the reader's stand - point, regarding the writing as past. See on 1 Peter 5:12. I write, therefore, refers to the Apostle 's immediate act of writing; I have written, or I wrote, to the reader's act of reading the completed writing. Little children [παιδια] . Compare teknia little children (ver. 1), which emphasizes the idea of kinship, while this word emphasizes the idea of subordination and consequent discipline. Hence it is the more appropriate word when spoken from the stand - point of authority rather than of affection. Ye have known [εγνωκατε] . Rev., correctly, ye known. The Father. In His rightful authority, as a Father over little children.
