The world [τον κοσμον] . See on John 1:9. The love of the Father [η αγαπη του πατρος] . The phrase occurs only here in the New Testament. It means love towards the Father, yet as generated by the Father 's love to man. Compare 1 John 3:1. See on love of God, ver. 5. Is not in him. This means more than that he does not love God : rather that the love of God does not dwell in him as the ruling principle of his life. Westcott cites a parallel from Philo : "It is impossible for love to the world to coexist with love to God, as it is impossible for light and darkness to coexist." Compare Plato. "Evils, Theodorus, can never pass away; for there must always remain something which is antagonist to good. Having no place among the gods in heaven, of necessity they hover around the earthly nature, and this mortal sphere. Wherefore we ought to fly away from earth to heaven as quickly as we can; and to fly away is to become like God, as far as this is possible; and to become like Him is to become holy and just and wise" (" Theaetetus, " 176).
