<p>Little children [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδια] </span></span>. See on ver. 13. </p>
<p>The last hour [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσχατη ωρα] </span></span>. The phrase only here in the New Testament. On John's use of wra hour, as marking a critical season, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:4">John 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:21">John 4:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:23">John 4:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:28">John 5:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:30">John 7:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:20">John 8:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:2">John 11:2</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:3">John 11:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:27">John 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:2">John 16:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:4">John 16:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:25">John 16:25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:32">John 16:32</span>. The dominant sense of the expression last days, in the New Testament, is that of a period of suffering and struggle preceding a divine victory. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:3">James 5:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span>. Hence the phrase here does not refer to the end of the world, but to the period preceding a crisis in the advance of Christ 's kingdom, a changeful and troublous period, marked by the appearance of "many antichrists." </p>
<p>Antichrist. Peculiar to John in the New Testament. The absence of the article shows its currency as a proper name. It may mean one who stands against Christ, or one who stands instead of Christ; just as ajntistrathgov may mean either one who stands in the place of a strathgov praetor, a propraetor (see Introd. to Luke, vol. 1, p. 246, and note on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:20">Acts 16:20</span>), or an opposing general. John never uses the word yeudocristov false Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:22">Mark 13:22</span>). While the false Christ is merely a pretender to the Messianic office, the Antichrist "assails Christ by proposing to do or to preserve what he did, while denying Him." Antichrist, then, is one who opposes Christ in the guise of Christ. Westcott's remark is very important, that John's sense of Antichrist is determined by the full Christian conception of Christ, and not by the Jewish conception of the promised Savior. </p>
<p>Cometh [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχεται] </span></span>. The prophetic present, equivalent to is about to come. The same term is used of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:3">John 14:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:22">John 21:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+22:20">Revelation 22:20</span>). </p>
<p>Are there [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγονασιν] </span></span>. Rev., more correctly, have there arisen. </p>
<p>Whereby [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οθεν] </span></span>. Lit., whence. Only here in John. It is found in Matthew and Luke, and frequently in Hebrews, and not elsewhere.</p>
