Hereby [εν τουτω] . Lit., in this. Characteristic of John. See John 8:35; John 14:8; John 16:30; 1 John 2:5; 1 John 3:24; 1 John 4:13; 1 John 5:2; 1 John 3:16; 1 John 3:19; 1 John 4:2. The expression points to what follows, "if we keep His commandments," yet with a covert reference to that idea as generally implied in the previous words concerning fellowship with God and walking in the light. We know [γινωσκομεν] . Or, perceive. By experience, from day to day; distinguished from oidamen we know, expressing absolute, immediate knowledge of a fact once for all. Compare 1 John 3:2. That we know [οτι εγνωκαμεν] . Or, more literally, have come to know. John does not use the compound forms ejpiginwskein and ejpignwsiv (see on Matthew 7:16. See Luke 1:4; Acts 4:13; Romans 1:28; Ephesians 1:17, etc.), nor the kindred word gnwsiv knowledge (Luke 1:77; Romans 2:20, etc.). We keep His commandments [τας εντολας αυτου τηρωμεν] . A phrase peculiar to John and occurring elsewhere only Matthew 19:17; 1 Timothy 6:14. In 1 Corinthians 7:19, we find thrhsiv ejntolwn the keeping of the commandments. On threw to keep, see on 1 Peter 1:5.
