He abideth in Him [εν αυτω μενειν] . To abide in God is a more common expression with John than to be in God, and marks an advance in thought. The phrase is a favorite one with John.

Bengel notes the gradation in the three phrases "to know Him, to be in Him, to abide in Him; knowledge, fellowship, constancy." Ought [οφειλει] . An obligation, put as a debt. See Luk 27:10, and on debts, Matthew 6:12. The word expresses a special, personal obligation, and not as dei must, an obligation in the nature of things. See John 20:9, and compare 1 John 3:16; 1 John 4:11; 3 John 1:8. He [εκεινος] . Always of Christ in the Epistles of John. See ejkeinhv, referring to aJmartia sin, 1 John 5:16.
