<p>Brethren [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδελφοι] </span></span>. The correct reading is ajgaphoi beloved. The first occurrence of this title, which is suggested by the previous words concerning the relation of love. </p>
<p>No new commandment [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εντολην καινην] </span></span>. The Rev., properly, places these words first in the sentence as emphatic, the point of the verse lying in the antithesis between the new and the old. On new, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:29">Matthew 26:29</span>. </p>
<p>Old [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλαιαν] </span></span>. Four words are used in the New Testament for old or elder. Of these gerwn and presbuterov refer merely to the age of men, or, the latter, to official position based primarily upon age. Hence the official term elder. Between the two others, ajrcaiov and palaiov, the distinction is not sharply maintained. Arcaiov emphasizes the reaching back to a beginning [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχη] </span></span>. Thus Satan is "that old [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχαιος</span></span>] serpent," whose evil work was coeval with the beginning of time (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+7:9">Revelation 7:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:2">Revelation 20:2</span>). The world before the flood is "the old [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχαιος</span></span>] world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span>). Mnason was "an old [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχαιος</span></span>] disciple;" not aged, but having been a disciple from the beginning (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:16">Acts 21:16</span>). Sophocles, in "Trachiniae," 555, gives both words. "I had an old [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλαιον</span></span>] gift," i e., received long ago, "from the old [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχαιου</span></span>] Centaur." The Centaur is conceived as an old - world creature, belonging to a state of things which has passed away. It carries, therefore, the idea of old fashioned : peculiar to an obsolete state of things. </p>
<p>Palaiov carries the sense of worn out by time, injury, sorrow, or other causes. Thus the old garment (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:16">Matthew 9:16</span>) is palaion. So the old wine - skins (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:17">Matthew 9:17</span>). The old men of a living generation compared with the young of the same generation are palaioi. In palaiov the simple conception of time dominates. In ajrcaiov there is often a suggestion of a character answering to the remote age. </p>
<p>The commandment is here called old because it belonged to the first stage of the Christian church. Believers had had it from the beginning of their Christian faith. </p>
<p>Commandment. The commandment of love. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:34">John 13:34</span>. This commandment is fulfilled in walking as Christ walked. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:1">Ephesians 5:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:2">Ephesians 5:2</span>.</p>
