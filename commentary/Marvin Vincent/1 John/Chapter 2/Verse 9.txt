Men fall into two classes, those who are in fellowship with God, and therefore walk in light and love, and those who are not in fellowship with God, and therefore walk in darkness and hatred. "A direct opposition," says Bengel; where love is not, there is hatred. "The heart is not empty." See John 3:20; John 7:7; John 14:18 sqq.; John 17:14. The word hate is opposed both to the love of natural affection [φιλειν] , and to the more discriminating sentiment - love founded on a just estimate [αγαπαν] . For the former see John 12:25; John 14:18, John 14:19; compare Luke 14:26. For the latter, 1 John 3:14, 1 John 3:15; 1 John 4:20, Matthew 5:43; Matthew 6:24; Ephesians 5:28, Ephesians 5:29.

Not found in John's Epistles nor in Revelation. Brethren. The first title given to the body of believers after the Ascension (Acts 1:15, where the true reading is aJudelfwn brethren, for maqhtwn disciples).
