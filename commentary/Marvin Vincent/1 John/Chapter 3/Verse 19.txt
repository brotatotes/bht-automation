<p>Shall assure [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεισομεν] </span></span>. Two renderings are possible; the primitive meaning persuade (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:26">Acts 19:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:4">Acts 17:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:11">2 Corinthians 5:11</span>); or the secondary and consequent sense, assure, quiet, conciliate (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:14">Matthew 28:14</span>). Render as A. V., and Rev. as sure. See critical note at the end of the commentary on this Epistle. </p>
<p>Before Him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμπροσθεν αυτου] </span></span>. Emphatic, the order being, before Him we shall assure our heart. These words are to be kept in mind as the key - note of what follows.</p>
