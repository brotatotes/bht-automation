<p>Whosoever committeth sin [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πας ο ποιων την αμαρτιαν] </span></span>. Rev., better, every one that doeth sin. See on ver. 3, every man that hath, and note the frequent repetition of this form of expression in the present chapter. Compare pav oJ aJmartanwn whosoever sinneth (ver. 6). The phrase to do sin regards sin as something actually realized in its completeness. He that does sin realizes in action the sin (note the article thn) that which includes and represents the complete ideal of sin. Compare do righteousness, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:29">1 John 2:29</span>. </p>
<p>Transgresseth also the law [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και την ανομιαν ποιει] </span></span>. Rev., more accurately, doeth also lawlessness. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:41">Matthew 13:41</span>, and the phrase oiJ ejrgazomenoi thn ajnomian ye that work iniquity (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23">Matthew 7:23</span>). </p>
<p>For [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και] </span></span>. Rev., correctly, and. This and the preceding clause are coordinated after John's manner. </p>
<p>Is the transgression of the law [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν η ανομια] </span></span>. Rev., correctly, is lawlessness. Sin is the violation of the law of our being, the law which includes our threefold relation to God, to the men and things around us, and to ourselves. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:14">James 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:17">James 4:17</span>.</p>
