<p>Abideth. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:4-10">John 14:4-10</span>. To abide in Christ is more than to be in Him, since it represents a condition maintained by communion with God and by the habitual doing of His will. See on 2 6. </p>
<p>Sinneth not. John does not teach that believers do not sin, but is speaking of a character, a habit. Throughout the Epistle he deals with the ideal reality of life in God, in which the love of God and sin exclude each other as light and darkness. </p>
<p>Seen - known. The vision of Christ and the appropriation of what is seen. Rev., correctly, knoweth.</p>
