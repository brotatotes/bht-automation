We have seen [πεθεαμεθα] . Have deliberately and steadfastly contemplated. Compare 1 John 1:1, and see on John 1:14. Do testify [μαρτυρουμεν] . Rev., bear witness. See on John 1:7. Sent. See on ver. 9. The Savior of the world. See the same phrase, John 4:42, and compare John 3:17. Swth. r Savior, occurs in John only here and John 4:42. Elsewhere it is applied both to God (1 Timothy 1:1; 1 Timothy 2:3; Titus 1:3; Titus 2:10; Titus 3:4; Jude 1:25), and to Christ (Luke 2:11; Acts 5:31; Acts 13:23; 2 Timothy 1:10; Titus 1:4, etc.). The title is found in Paul 's Epistles of the Captivity (Ephesians 5:23; Philippians 3:20), and in the Pastorals (see above), but not in Corinthians, Romans, Galatians, or Thessalonians. In classical writings the term is applied to many deities, especially to Zeus (Jupiter); also to Hermes [μερχυρψ] , Apollo, Hercules, and even to female deities, as Fortune and Aphrodite (Venus). "Zeus Soter" (Zeus Savior) was used as a formula in drinking at banquets. The third cup was dedicated to him. Compare Plato : "Then, by way of a third libation to the savior Zeus, let us sum up and reassert what has been said" (" Philebus, "66). The drinking of this cup was a symbol of good fortune, and the third time came to mean the lucky time." Twice then has the just man overthrown the unjust; and now comes the third trial, which, after Olympic fashion, is sacred to Zeus the savior,... and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of falls "(Plato," Republic, " 583). Hence the proverb, to triton tw swthri, lit., the third to the savior; i e., the third or lucky time. The name was also given later to princes or public benefactors. The kindred noun swthria salvation, does not occur in John's Epistles, and appears only once in the Gospel (iv. 22). It is found thrice in Revelation 7:10; Revelation 12:10; Revelation 19:1). Swzein to save occurs six times in John's Gospel, and once in Revelation (xxi. 24). It does not appear in the Epistles.
