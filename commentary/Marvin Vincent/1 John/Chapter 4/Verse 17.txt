<p>Herein [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τουτω] </span></span>. To what does this refer? Two explanations are given. (1.) To the following that we may have boldness. So Huther, who argues thus on the ground that ver. 18 shows that the drift of the writer's thought is toward the fearlessness of love. According to this, therefore, love has its fulfillment in freeing us from fear, and inspiring us with boldness even in view of the final judgment. (2.) To what precedes, viz., our dwelling in God and He in us. So Westcott : "The fellowship of God with man and of man with God, carries with it the consummation of love." I prefer the latter, principally on the ground that in such phrases as ejn toutw in this, dia touto on this account, therefore, the pronoun usually refers to something preceding, though more fully developed in what follows. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:16">John 5:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:65">John 6:65</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:47">John 8:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:17">John 10:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:18">John 12:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:1">John 16:1</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:5">John 16:5</span>. Our love [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αγαπη μεθ ημων] </span></span>. The A. V. construes meq' hJmwn with us, with love, making with us equivalent to our. In that case it might mean either the love which is between Christians, or the love which is between God and Christians. The Rev. construes with us with the verb : love is made perfect with us. The latter is preferable. I do not think it would be easy to point out a parallel in the New Testament to the expression ajgaph meq' love that with us = our love. The true idea is that love is perfected in fellowship. The love of God is perfected with us, in communion with us, through our abiding in Him and He in us. "Love is not simply perfected in man, but in fulfilling this issue God works with man" (Westcott). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:3">2 John 1:3</span>, "grace shall be with us" (true reading); and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:4">Acts 25:4</span>, "what things God had done with them."
