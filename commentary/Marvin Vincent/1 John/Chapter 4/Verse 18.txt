<p>There is no fear in love [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβος ουκ εστιν εν τη αγαπη] </span></span>. Lit., fear is not. It has no existence. The fear is that spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:17">1 Peter 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:28">Hebrews 12:28</span>; godly fear; filial reverence; not slavish fear, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>. In love, lit., the love, that perfected love of which John has been speaking. </p>
<p>Perfect [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελεια] </span></span>. Not perfected, as ver. 17 but perfect as the result of having been perfected. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:14">Hebrews 5:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:4">James 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:2">James 3:2</span>. Casteth out [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξω βαλλει] </span></span>. A strong expression : turneth out of doors. Fear is cast out of the sphere of the fellowship of love. See the phrase in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:37">John 6:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:34">John 9:34</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:35">John 9:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:31">John 12:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>. </p>
<p>Hath torment [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολασιν εχει] </span></span>. Torment is a faulty translation. The word means punishment, penalty. It occurs in the New Testament only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:46">Matthew 25:46</span>. The kindred verb, kolazomai to punish, is found <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:21">Acts 4:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:9">2 Peter 2:9</span>. Note the present tense, hath. The punishment is present. Fear by anticipating punishment has it even now. The phrase hath punishment (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:22">John 16:22</span>) indicates that the punishment is inherent in the fear. Fear carries its own punishment. Augustine, commenting on the expulsion of fear by love, says : "As in sewing, we see the thread passed through by the needle. The needle is first pushed in, but the thread cannot be introduced until the needle is brought out. So fear first occupies the mind, but does not remain permanently, because it entered for the purpose of introducing love." The words because fear hath punishment are parenthetical. </p>
<p>He that feareth The A. V. omits and [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε] </span></span>, which is important as closely connecting this clause with there is no fear in love, etc. That is an abstract statement; this is personal; two modes of stating the same truth. Rev. "and he that feareth." </p>
<p>Is not made perfect. "Men's condition is varied; without fear and love; with fear without love; with fear and love; without fear with love" (Bengel).</p>
