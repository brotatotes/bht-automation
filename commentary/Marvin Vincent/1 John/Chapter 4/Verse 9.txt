Was manifested. See on John 21:1; 1 John 3:5. Toward us [εν ημιν] . Wrong. Not "among us," as John 1:14, nor "in us;" but as Rev., in margin, in our case. 67 Sent [απεσταλκεν] . John describes the incarnation as a sending, more frequently than in any other way. Apostellw is to send under commission, as an envoy. The perfect tense, hath sent, points to the abiding results of the sending. See on 3 5. His only - begotten Son [τον υιον αυτου τον μονογενη] . Lit., His Son, the only - begotten (Son). A mode of expression common in John, enlarging upon the meaning of a noun by the addition of an adjective or a participle with the article. See 1 John 1:2; 1 John 2:7, 1 John 2:8, 1 John 2:25; 1 John 5:4; John 6:41, John 6:44, John 6:50, John 6:51; John 14:1, etc. On only - begotten, see on John 1:14.
