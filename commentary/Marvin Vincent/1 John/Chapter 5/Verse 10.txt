On the Son of God. Faith in the person of Christ, not merely in the fact that Jesus is the Son of God. God. Also personal. To believe God, is to believe the message which comes from Him. See on John 1:12. Hath made - hath believed [πρποιηκεν - πεπιστευκεν] . The perfect tense marks the two results expressed by the verbs as connected with a past act. The act perpetuates itself in the present condition of the unbeliever. Believed on the witness [πεπιστευκεν εις την μαρτυριαν] . The phrase occurs only here. See on John 1:12. In one other case to believe on is used with an object not directly personal, pisteuete eijv to fwv; but the reference is clearly to the personal Christ as the Light of the World (John 8:12).
