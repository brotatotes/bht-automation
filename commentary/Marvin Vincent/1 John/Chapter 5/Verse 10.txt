<p>On the Son of God. Faith in the person of Christ, not merely in the fact that Jesus is the Son of God. </p>
<p>God. Also personal. To believe God, is to believe the message which comes from Him. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:12">John 1:12</span>. </p>
<p>Hath made - hath believed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρποιηκεν - πεπιστευκεν] </span></span>. The perfect tense marks the two results expressed by the verbs as connected with a past act. The act perpetuates itself in the present condition of the unbeliever. </p>
<p>Believed on the witness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπιστευκεν εις την μαρτυριαν] </span></span>. The phrase occurs only here. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:12">John 1:12</span>. In one other case to believe on is used with an object not directly personal, pisteuete eijv to fwv; but the reference is clearly to the personal Christ as the Light of the World (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>).</p>
