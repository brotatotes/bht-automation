<p>Hath life [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχει την ζωην] </span></span>. More strictly, as Rev., the life; i e., the life which God gave (ver. 11). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:22">John 16:22</span>. Compare Christ who is our life (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:4">Colossians 3:4</span>). </p>
<p>The Son of God. Hath the Son, hath not the Son of God, pointing back to God as the giver of life in His Son. Bengel observes : "The verse has two clauses : in the former, of God is not added, because believers know the Son; in the other it is added, that unbelievers may know at length how serious it is not to have Him." </p>
<p>Hath not life. Note the inversion "He that hath the Son hath the life. He that hath not the Son of God, the life hath he not."</p>
