<p>Unrighteousness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικια] </span></span>. This is the character of every offense against that which is right. Every breach of duty is a manifestation of sin. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:4">1 John 3:4</span>, where sin is defined as ajnomia lawlessness, and lawlessness as sin. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:13">Romans 6:13</span>.</p>
