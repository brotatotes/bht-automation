<p>We know [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδαμεν] </span></span>. John uses this appeal to knowledge in two forms : we know (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:14">2 Timothy 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:18">1 John 5:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:19">1 John 5:19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:20">1 John 5:20</span>); ye know (ii. 20; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:5">1 John 3:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:15">1 John 3:15</span>). He that is begotten of God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο γεννηθεις εκ του θεου] </span></span>. Lit., was begotten. This exact phrase does not occur elsewhere. Some refer it to the man who is born of God, making it parallel with oJ gegennhmenov ejk tou Qeou, he that is begotten of God. Others to Christ, the only - begotten of God. The later is preferable. </p>
<p>That wicked one [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πονηρος] </span></span>. See on 2 13. Rev., the evil one. </p>
<p>Toucheth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απτεται] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:17">John 20:17</span>, the only other passage in John's writings where the verb occurs. Both this verb and qigganw (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:21">Colossians 2:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:28">Hebrews 11:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:20">Hebrews 12:20</span>) express a touch which exerts a modifying influence upon the object, though qigganw indicates rather a superficial touch. On yhlafaw (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:27">Acts 27:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:18">Hebrews 12:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>), see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:39">Luke 24:39</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:21">Colossians 2:21</span>. The idea here is layeth not hold of him.</p>
