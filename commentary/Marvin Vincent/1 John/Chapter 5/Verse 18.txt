We know [οιδαμεν] . John uses this appeal to knowledge in two forms : we know (2 Timothy 2:14; 1 John 5:18, 1 John 5:19, 1 John 5:20); ye know (ii. 20; 1 John 3:5, 1 John 3:15). He that is begotten of God [ο γεννηθεις εκ του θεου] . Lit., was begotten. This exact phrase does not occur elsewhere. Some refer it to the man who is born of God, making it parallel with oJ gegennhmenov ejk tou Qeou, he that is begotten of God. Others to Christ, the only - begotten of God. The later is preferable. That wicked one [ο πονηρος] . See on 2 13. Rev., the evil one. Toucheth [απτεται] . See on John 20:17, the only other passage in John's writings where the verb occurs. Both this verb and qigganw (Colossians 2:21; Hebrews 11:28; Hebrews 12:20) express a touch which exerts a modifying influence upon the object, though qigganw indicates rather a superficial touch. On yhlafaw (Acts 27:27; Hebrews 12:18; 1 John 1:1), see on Luke 24:39. Compare Colossians 2:21. The idea here is layeth not hold of him.
