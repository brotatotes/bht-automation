<p>Keep yourselves [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλαξατε εαυτα] </span></span>. The exact phrase is not found elsewhere in the New Testament. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:17">2 Peter 3:17</span>. Rev., rightly, guard. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:4">1 Peter 1:4</span>. </p>
<p>Idols [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδωλων] </span></span>. Strictly, images. The command, however, has apparently the wider Pauline sense, to guard against everything which occupies the place due to God. </p>
