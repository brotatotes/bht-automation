Overcometh [νικα] . See on 2 13. The victory [η νικη] . Only here in the New Testament. That overcometh [η νικησασα] . The aorist tense, overcame. On the cumulative form of expression, the victory, that which overcame, see on 4 9. The aorist is to be held here to its strict sense. The victory over the world was, potentially, won when we believed in Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God. We overcome the world by being brought into union with Christ. On becoming as He is (iii. 17) we become partakers of His victory (John 16:33). "Greater is He that is in you than He that is in the world" (iv. 4). Our faith [πιστις ημων] . Pistiv faith, only here in John's Epistles and not in the Gospel. Our faith is embraced in the confession that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. On the question of the subjective and objective use of the faith, see on Acts 6:7.
