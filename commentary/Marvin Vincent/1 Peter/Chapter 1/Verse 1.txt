<p>Peter [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πετρος] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>. As Paul in his letters does not call himself by his original name of Saul, so Peter calls himself, not Simon, but Peter, the name most significant and precious both to himself and to his readers, because bestowed by his Lord. In the opening of the second epistle he uses both names. </p>
<p>An apostle. Of all the catholic epistles, Peter's alone puts forward his apostleship in the introduction. He is addressing churches with which he had no immediate connection, and which were distinctively Pauline. Hence he appeals to his apostleship in explanation of his writing to them, and as his warrant for taking Paul 's place. </p>
<p>To the strangers - elect (ver. 2, ejklektoiv parepidhmoiv). The Rev., properly, joins the two words, elect who are sojourners, instead of continuing elect with according to the foreknowledge, etc., as A. V. </p>
<p>Elect. Regarding all whom he addressed as subjects of saving grace. The term corresponds to the Old - Testament title of Jehovah 's people : <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:9">Isaiah 65:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:15">Isaiah 65:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:22">Isaiah 65:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+105:43">Psalms 105:43</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:16">Matthew 20:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:14">Matthew 22:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:33">Romans 8:33</span>. </p>
<p>Sojourners [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεπιδημοις] </span></span>. Persons sojourning for a brief season in a foreign country. Though applied primarily to Hebrews scattered throughout the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+23:4">Genesis 23:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+39:12">Psalms 39:12</span>), it has here a wider, spiritual sense, contemplating Christians as having their citizenship in heaven. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>. The preposition para, in composition, implies a sense of transitoriness, as of one who passes by to something beyond. </p>
<p>Scattered [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασπορας] </span></span>. Lit., of the dispersion; from diaspeirw, to scatter or spread abroad; speirw meaning, originally, to sow. The term was a familiar one for the whole body of Jews outside the Holy Land, scattered among the heathen.</p>
