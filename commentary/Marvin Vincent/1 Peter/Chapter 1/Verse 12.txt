<p>Desire (ejpiqumousin). The word commonly denotes intense desire. It is used by Christ in expressing his wish to eat the passover (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:15">Luke 22:15</span>); of the prodigal's desire to satisfy his hunger with the husks (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:16">Luke 14:16</span>); and of the flesh lusting against the spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:17">Galatians 5:17</span>). To look into [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακυψαι] </span></span>. A very graphic word, meaning to stoop sideways [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα] </span></span>. Used by Aristophanes to picture the attitude of a bad harp - player. Here it portrays one stooping and stretching the neck to gaze on some wonderful sight. It occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:25">James 1:25</span>, describing him who looks into the perfect law of liberty as into a mirror; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:12">Luke 24:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:5">John 20:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:11">John 20:11</span>, of Peter and John and Mary stooping and looking into the empty tomb. Possibly the memory of this incident unconsciously suggested the word to Peter. The phrase illustrates Peter's habitual emphasis upon the testimony of sight (see Introduction). Bengel acutely notes the hint in para, beside, that the angels contemplate the work of salvation from without, as spectators and not as participants.
