Gird up [αναζωσαμενοι] . Lit., having girded up. Used here only. The metaphor is suggested by the girding up of the loose eastern robes preparatory to running or other exertion. Perhaps recalling the words of Christ, Luke 12:35. Christ 's call is a call to active service. There is a fitness in the figure as addressed to sojourners and pilgrims (ch. 1 Peter 1:1; 1 Peter 2:11), who must be always ready to move. Mind [διανοιας] . See on Mark 12:30. Be sober [νηφοντες] . Lit., being sober. Primarily, in a physical sense, as opposed to excess in drink, but passing into the general sense of self - control and equanimity. Hope to the end [τελειως ελπισατε] . Better, as Rev., set your hope perfectly : wholly and unchangeably; without doubt or despondency. That is to be brought [την φερομενην] . Lit., which is being brought, as Rev., in margin. The object of hope is already on the way.
