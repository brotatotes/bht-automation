<p>Obedient children [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνα υπακοης] </span></span>. Literally, and more correctly, as Rev., children of obedience. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:17">Mark 3:17</span>. The Christian is represented as related to the motive principle of his life as a child to a parent. </p>
<p>Fashioning yourselves [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συσχηματιζομενοι] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:2">Matthew 17:2</span>; and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:2">Romans 12:2</span>, the only other passage where the word occurs. As schma is the outward, changeable fashion, as contrasted with what is intrinsic, the word really carries a warning against conformity to something changeful, and therefore illusory.</p>
