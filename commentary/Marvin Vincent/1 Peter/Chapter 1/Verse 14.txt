Obedient children [τεκνα υπακοης] . Literally, and more correctly, as Rev., children of obedience. See on Mark 3:17. The Christian is represented as related to the motive principle of his life as a child to a parent. Fashioning yourselves [συσχηματιζομενοι] . See on Matthew 17:2; and compare Romans 12:2, the only other passage where the word occurs. As schma is the outward, changeable fashion, as contrasted with what is intrinsic, the word really carries a warning against conformity to something changeful, and therefore illusory.
