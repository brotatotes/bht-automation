As he which hath called you is holy [κατα τον καλεσαντα υμας αγιον] . As of the A. V. is according to, or after the pattern of; and holy is to be taken as a personal name; the which hath called being added for definition, and in order to strengthen the exhortation. Render, therefore, after the pattern of the Holy One who called you. So, nearly, Rev., in margin. A similar construction occurs 2 Peter 2:1 : the Lord that bought them. Conversation [αναστροφη] . A favorite word with Peter; used eight times in the two epistles. From ajna, up, and strefw, to turn. The process of development in the meaning of the word is interesting. 1. A turning upside down. 2. A turning about or wheeling. 3. Turning about in a place, going back and forth there about one's business; and so, 4. one's mode of life or conduct. This is precisely the idea in the word conversation (Lat., conversare, to turn around) which was used when the A. V. was made, as the common term for general deportment or behavior, and was, therefore, a correct rendering of ajnastrofh. So Latimer (" Sermons ") : "We are not bound to follow the conversations or doings of the saints." And Shakspeare, 2 Hen 4, 5, 5 "But all are banished till their conversation Appear more wise and modest to the world." Our later limitation of the meaning to the interchange of talk makes it expedient to change the rendering, as Rev., to manner of living.
