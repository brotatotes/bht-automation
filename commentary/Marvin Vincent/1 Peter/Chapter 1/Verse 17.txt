<p>If ye call on the Father - judgeth. More correctly, Rev., If ye call on him as Father; the point being that God is to be invoked, not only as Father, but as Judge. </p>
<p>Without respect of persons [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απροσωπολημπτως] </span></span>. Here only. Peter, however, uses proswpolhmpthv, a respecter of persons, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:34">Acts 10:34</span>, which whole passage should be compared with this. Paul and James also use the kindred word swpolhmyia, respect of persons. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:11">Romans 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1">James 2:1</span>. James has the verb proswpolhmptew, to have respect of persons. The constituents of the compound word, proswpon, the countenance, and lambanw, to receive, are found in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:6">Galatians 2:6</span>; and the word is the Old - Testament formula to accept or to raise the face of another; opposed to making the countenance fall (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+29:24">Job 29:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:5">Genesis 4:5</span>). Hence, to receive kindly, or look favorably upon one (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:21">Genesis 19:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+32:20">Genesis 32:20</span>, etc.). In the Old Testament it is, as Bishop Lightfoot observes, "a neutral expression involving no subsidiary notion of partiality, and is much oftener found in a good than in a bad sense. When it becomes an independent Greek phrase, however, the bad sense attaches to it, owing to the secondary meaning of proswpon, a mask; so that proswpon lambanein signifies to regard the external circumstances of a man, his rank, wealth, etc., as opposed to his real, intrinsic character." Sojourning [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παροικιας] </span></span>. Compare sojourners, ver. 1.</p>
