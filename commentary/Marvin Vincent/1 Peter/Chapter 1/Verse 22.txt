<p>Purified [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγνικοτες] </span></span>. The Septuagint translation of the Old - Testament technical term for the purification of the people and priests (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jos+3:5">Joshua 3:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ch+14:12">1 Chronicles 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+16:5">1 Samuel 16:5</span>). Also, of the separation from wine and strong drink by the Nazarite (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:2-6">Numbers 6:2-6</span>). In this ceremonial sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:55">John 11:55</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:24">Acts 21:24</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:26">Acts 21:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:18">Acts 24:18</span>. In the moral sense, as here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:8">James 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span>. Compare kaqarisav, purifying, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:9">Acts 14:9</span>. </p>
<p>Obeying [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπακοη] </span></span>. Rev., obedience. A peculiarly New Testament term unknown in classical Greek. In the Septuagint only <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2sa+22:36">2 Samuel 22:36</span>; rendered in A. V. gentleness. Rev., condescension, in margin. </p>
<p>Unfeigned [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανυποκριτον] </span></span>. 'A, not, uJpokrithv, actor. The latter word is from uJpokrinesqai, to answer on the stage, and hence to play a part or to act. A hypocrite is, therefore, an actor. </p>
<p>With a pure heart [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ καθαρας καρδιας] </span></span>. The best texts reject kaqarav, pure. Render, therefore, as Rev., from the heart. </p>
<p>Fervently [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτενως] </span></span>. Used by Peter only, and only in this passage. He uses the kindred adjective ejktenhv, without ceasing, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:5">Acts 12:5</span>, where the narrative probably came from him, and also at ch. 4 8; "fervent charity." The words are compounded with the verb teinw, to stretch, and signify intense strain; feeling on the rack.</p>
