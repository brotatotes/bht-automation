Purified [ηγνικοτες] . The Septuagint translation of the Old - Testament technical term for the purification of the people and priests (Joshua 3:5, 1 Chronicles 14:12; 1 Samuel 16:5). Also, of the separation from wine and strong drink by the Nazarite (Numbers 6:2-6). In this ceremonial sense, John 11:55; Acts 21:24, Acts 21:26; Acts 24:18. In the moral sense, as here, James 4:8; 1 John 3:3. Compare kaqarisav, purifying, Acts 14:9. Obeying [υπακοη] . Rev., obedience. A peculiarly New Testament term unknown in classical Greek. In the Septuagint only 2 Samuel 22:36; rendered in A. V. gentleness. Rev., condescension, in margin. Unfeigned [ανυποκριτον] . 'A, not, uJpokrithv, actor. The latter word is from uJpokrinesqai, to answer on the stage, and hence to play a part or to act. A hypocrite is, therefore, an actor. With a pure heart [εκ καθαρας καρδιας] . The best texts reject kaqarav, pure. Render, therefore, as Rev., from the heart. Fervently [εκτενως] . Used by Peter only, and only in this passage. He uses the kindred adjective ejktenhv, without ceasing, in Acts 12:5, where the narrative probably came from him, and also at ch. 4 8; "fervent charity." The words are compounded with the verb teinw, to stretch, and signify intense strain; feeling on the rack.
