Being born again [αναγεγεννημενοι] . Rev., having been begotten again. Compare James 1:18. Of [εκ] seed - by [δια] the word. Note the difference in the prepositions; the former denoting the origin or source of life, the latter the medium through which it imparts itself to the nature. Word of God [λογου θεου] . The gospel of Christ. Compare ver. 25, and Peter's words, Acts 10:36. Also, Ephesians 1:13; Colossians 1:5; James 1:18. Not the personal Word, as the term is employed by John. Nevertheless, the connection and relation of the personal with the revealed word is distinctly recognized. "In the New Testament we trace a gradual ascent from (a) the concrete message as conveyed to man by personal agency through (b) the Word, the revelation of God to man which the message embodies, forming, as it were, its life and soul, to (c) THE WORD, who, being God, not only reveals but imparts himself to us, and is formed in us thereby" (Scott, on James 1:18, " Speaker's Commentary "). Seed [σπορας] . Nowhere else in the New Testament. Primarily, the sowing of seed.
