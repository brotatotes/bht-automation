Blessed [ευλογητος] . eu, well, logov, a word. Well - spoken - of; praised; honored. Used in the New Testament of God only. The kindred verb is applied to human beings, as to Mary (Luke 1:28) : "Blessed [ευλογημενη] art thou." Compare the different word for blessed in Matthew 5:3, etc. [μακαριοι] , and see notes there. The style of this doxological phrase is Pauline. Compare 2 Corinthians 1:3; Ephesians 1:3. Hath begotten us again [αναγεννησας ημας] . The verb is used by Peter only, and by him only here and ver. 23. It is in the aorist tense, and should be rendered, as Rev., begat; because regeneration is regarded as a definite historical act accomplished once for all, or possibly because Peter regards the historical act of Christ 's resurrection as virtually effecting the regeneration. The latter sentiment would be Pauline, since Paul is wont to speak of Christians as dying and rising with Christ. Romans 7:4; Romans 6:8-11. Lively [ζωσαν] . Better, as Rev., literally rendering the participle, living : a favorite word with Peter. See 1 Peter 1:23; 1 Peter 2:4, 1 Peter 2:5, 1 Peter 2:24; 1 Peter 4:5, 1 Peter 4:6; and compare Acts 9:41, where Peter is the prominent actor; and Acts 10:42, where he is the speaker. Hope [ελπιδα] . Peter is fond of this word also (see 1 Peter 1:13, 1 Peter 1:21; 1 Peter 3:5, 1 Peter 3:15), which, in classical Greek, has the general signification of expectancy, relating to evil as well as to good. Thus Plato speaks of living in evil hope (" Republic, " 1, 330); i e., in the apprehension of evil; and Thucydides, of the hope of evils to come; i e., the expectation or apprehension. In the New Testament the word always relates to a future good.
