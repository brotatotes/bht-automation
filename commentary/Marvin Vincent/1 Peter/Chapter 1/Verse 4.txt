<p>An inheritance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κληρονομιαν] </span></span>. A Pauline word, from klhrov, a lot, and nemomai, to distribute among themselves. Hence an inheritance is originally a portion which one receives by lot in a general distribution. In the New Testament the idea of chance attaching to the lot is eliminated. It is the portion or heritage which one receives by virtue of birth or by special gift. So of the vineyard seized by the wicked husbandmen : "Let us seize on his inheritance" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:38">Matthew 21:38</span>); of Abraham in Canaan : "God gave him none inheritance" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:5">Acts 7:5</span>); "an eternal inheritance" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span>). </p>
<p>Incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away. Note Peter's characteristic multiplication of epithets. Incorruptible [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφθαρτον] </span></span>. From aj, not, and fqeirw, to destroy or corrupt. Undefiled [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμιαντον] </span></span>. From aj, not, and miainw to defile, though the verb means especially to defile by staining, as with color; while molunw, also translated defile (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:7">1 Corinthians 8:7</span>), is to besmirch, as with mire. We might render unstained, though the word is not used with any conscious reference to its etymology. That fadeth not away [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαραντον] </span></span>. Used by Peter only, and but once. From aj, not, and marainomai, to wither. The loveliness of the heavenly inheritance is described as exempt from the blight which attaches to earthly bloom. As between afqarton, incorruptible, and ajmaranton, unwithering, the former emphasizes the indestructibility of substance, and the latter of grace and beauty. The latter adjective appears in the familiar botanical name amaranth. It will be observed that all of these three epithets are compounded with the negative particle aj, not. Archbishop Trench aptly remarks that "it is a remarkable testimony to the reign of sin, and therefore of imperfection, of decay, of death throughout this whole fallen world, that as often as we desire to set forth the glory, purity, and perfection of that other, higher world toward which we strive, we are almost inevitably compelled to do this by the aid of negatives; by the denying to that higher order of things the leading features and characteristics of this." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:1">Revelation 21:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:4">Revelation 21:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:22">Revelation 21:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:23">Revelation 21:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:27">Revelation 21:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+22:3">Revelation 22:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+22:5">Revelation 22:5</span>. Reserved [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετηρημενην] </span></span>. Lit., which has been reserved, a perfect participle, indicating the inheritance as one reserved through God 's care for his own from the beginning down to the present. Laid up and kept is the idea. The verb signifies keeping as the result of guarding. Thus in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:11">John 17:11</span>, Christ says, "keep [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρσον</span></span>] those whom thou hast given me;" in ver. 12, "I kept them" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετηρουν] </span></span>; i e., preserved by guarding them. "Those whom thou gavest me I guarded [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφυλαξα] </span></span>." So Rev., which preserves the distinction. Similarly, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:15">John 14:15</span>, "keep [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρησατε</span></span>] my commandments;" preserve them unbroken by careful watching. So Peter was delivered to the soldiers to guard him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλασσειν] </span></span>, but he was kept [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετηρειτο</span></span>] in prison (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:4">Acts 12:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:51">Acts 12:51</span>). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>, where a different word is used : ajpokeimenhn, lit., laid away. </p>
<p>For you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις] </span></span>. The use of this preposition, instead of the simpler dative, is graphic : with reference to you; with you as its direct object.</p>
