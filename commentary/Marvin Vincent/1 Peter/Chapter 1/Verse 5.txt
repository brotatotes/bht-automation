Kept [φρουρουμενους] . A military term. Lit., garrisoned. Rev., guarded. Compare 2 Corinthians 11:32, and the beautiful metaphorical use of the word at Philippians 4:7, "shall guard your hearts." The present participle indicates something in progress, a continuous process of protection. Hence, lit., who are being guarded. "The inheritance is kept; the heirs are guarded" (Bengel). By [εν] the power; through [δια] faith; unto [εις] salvation. By, indicating the efficient cause; through, the secondary agency; unto, the result. Salvation. Note the frequent occurrence of this word, vv. 9, 10. Ready [ετοιμην] . Stronger than about to be, or destined to be, implying a state of waiting or preparedness, and thus harmonizing with reserved.
