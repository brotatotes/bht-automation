<p>Ye greatly rejoice [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαλλιασθε] </span></span>. The word is always employed in the New Testament for great or lively joy. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:12">Matthew 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:47">Luke 1:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span>. </p>
<p>For a season [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολιγον] </span></span>. More literally and correctly, as Rev., for a little while. Compare ch. 5 10. The word is used nowhere else in the New Testament in this sense. </p>
<p>In heaviness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυπηθεντες] </span></span>. Lit., having been grieved. Rev., ye have been put to grief. </p>
<p>Through [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν] </span></span>. But Rev., better, in; the preposition not being instrumental, but indicating the sphere or environment in which the grief operates. </p>
<p>Manifold [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποικιλοις] </span></span>. Literally the word means variegated. It is used to describe the skin of a leopard, the different - colored veinings of marble, or an embroidered robe; and thence passes into the meaning of changeful, diversified, applied to the changing months or the variations of a strain of music. Peter employs it again, ch. 4 10, of the grace of God, and James of temptations, as here (i. 2). Compare polupoikilov, manifold, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</span>, applied to the wisdom of God. The word gives a vivid picture of the diversity of the trials, emphasizing this idea rather than that of their number, which is left to be inferred. </p>
<p>Temptations [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειρασμοις] </span></span>. Better, trials, as in margin of Rev., since the word includes more than direct solicitation to evil. It embraces all that goes to furnish a test of character. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2">James 1:2</span>.</p>
