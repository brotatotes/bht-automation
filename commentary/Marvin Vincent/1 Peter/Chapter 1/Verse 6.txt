Ye greatly rejoice [αγαλλιασθε] . The word is always employed in the New Testament for great or lively joy. See Matthew 5:12; Luke 1:47; Luke 10:21. For a season [ολιγον] . More literally and correctly, as Rev., for a little while. Compare ch. 5 10. The word is used nowhere else in the New Testament in this sense. In heaviness [λυπηθεντες] . Lit., having been grieved. Rev., ye have been put to grief. Through [εν] . But Rev., better, in; the preposition not being instrumental, but indicating the sphere or environment in which the grief operates. Manifold [ποικιλοις] . Literally the word means variegated. It is used to describe the skin of a leopard, the different - colored veinings of marble, or an embroidered robe; and thence passes into the meaning of changeful, diversified, applied to the changing months or the variations of a strain of music. Peter employs it again, ch. 4 10, of the grace of God, and James of temptations, as here (i. 2). Compare polupoikilov, manifold, in Ephesians 3:10, applied to the wisdom of God. The word gives a vivid picture of the diversity of the trials, emphasizing this idea rather than that of their number, which is left to be inferred. Temptations [πειρασμοις] . Better, trials, as in margin of Rev., since the word includes more than direct solicitation to evil. It embraces all that goes to furnish a test of character. Compare James 1:2.
