<p>Trial [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμιον] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:3">James 1:3</span>. Rev., proof. The word means a test. As the means of proof, however, is not only the touchstone itself, but the trace of the metal left upon it, the sense here is the result of the contact of faith with trial, and hence the verification of faith. The expression is equivalent to your approved faith. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:7">Romans 2:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:10">Romans 2:10</span>. Than of gold. Omit the of, and read than gold. The comparison is between the approved faith and the gold; not between the faith and the proof of the gold. </p>
<p>Though it be tried [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμαζομενου] </span></span>. Kindred with dokimion, proof, and better rendered by Rev., proved. The verb is used in classical Greek of assaying or testing metals, and means, generally, to approve or sanction upon test. It is radically akin to decesqai, to receive, and hence implies a proof with a view to determine whether a thing be worthy to be received. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:13">1 Corinthians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:4">Galatians 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span>. It thus differs from peirazein, to try or tempt (see on peirasmoiv, ver. 6), in that that verb indicates simply a putting to proof to discover what good or evil is in a person; and from the fact that such scrutiny so often develops the existence any energy of evil, the word acquired a predominant sense of putting to the proof with the design or hope of breaking down the subject under the proof - in other words, of temptation in the ordinary sense. Hence Satan is called oJ peirazwn, the tempter, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:3">Matthew 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:5">1 Thessalonians 3:5</span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:13">Matthew 6:13</span>. Archbishop Trench observes that "dokimazein could not be used of Satan, since he never proves that he may approve, nor tests that he may accept." </p>
<p>Might be found [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρεθη] </span></span>. In accord with the preceding expressions, and indicating discovery as the result of scrutiny. </p>
<p>Praise and glory and honor. Such is the order of the best texts, and so. Rev. Glory and honor often occur together in the New Testament, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:7">Romans 2:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:10">Romans 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:17">1 Timothy 1:17</span>. Only here with praise. Compare spirit of glory, ch. 4 14.</p>
