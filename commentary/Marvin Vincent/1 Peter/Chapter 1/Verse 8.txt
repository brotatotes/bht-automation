<p>Full of glory [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεδοξασμενη] </span></span>. Lit., glorified, as Rev., in margin. Receiving [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κομιζομενοι] </span></span>. The verb originally means to take care of or provide for; thence to receive hospitably or entertain; to bring home with a view to entertaining or taking care of. Hence, to carry away so as to preserve, to save, rescue, and so to carry away as a prize or booty. Generally, to receive or acquire. Paul uses it of receiving the awards of judgment (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:8">Ephesians 6:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:25">Colossians 3:25</span>). In Heb. it is used of receiving the promise (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:36">Hebrews 10:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:39">Hebrews 11:39</span>), and of Abraham receiving back Isaac (xi. 19). Peter uses it thrice, and in each case of receiving the rewards of righteousness or of iniquity.
