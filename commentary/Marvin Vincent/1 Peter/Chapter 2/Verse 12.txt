<p>Conversation. Rev., behavior. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:15">1 Peter 1:15</span>. </p>
<p>Whereas [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ω] </span></span>. Rev., correctly, wherein; in the matter in which. They speak against (katalalousin). Compare evil - speakings, ver. 1, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:22">Acts 28:22</span>. </p>
<p>Which they shall behold [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποπτευοντες] </span></span>. Rev., beholding. Used by Peter only, here and ch. 3 2. The kindred noun ejpopthv, an eye - witness, occurs only at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16">2 Peter 1:16</span>. It is a technical word, meaning one who was admitted to the highest degree of initiation in the Elensinian mysteries. Here it conveys the idea of personal witness; behold with their own eyes. Evil - doers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακοποιων] </span></span>. The word occurs four times in Peter, and nowhere else in the New Testament except <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:30">John 18:30</span>, where it is applied by the priests to Christ himself. </p>
<p>Visitation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισκοπης] </span></span>. The radical idea of the word is that of observing or inspecting. Hence ejpiskopov, an overseer or bishop. Visiting grows naturally out of this, as visitare from visere, to look at attentively. See Introduction, on Peter's emphasis upon sight; and compare behold, in this verse. The "day of visitation" is the day of looking upon : "When God shall look upon these wanderers, as a pastor over his flock, and shall become the overlooker or bishop of their souls" (ver. 25, Lumby).</p>
