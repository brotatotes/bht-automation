<p>Conscience toward God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνειδησιν θεου] </span></span>. Rev., in margin, conscious of God. The idea is not conscientiousness in the ordinary sense, but the conscious sense of one's relation to God; his consciousness of God. Thus one suffers patiently, not from a conscientious sense of dury, but from an inner consciousness of his relation to God as a son, and to Christ as a joint - heir, which involves his suffering with him no less than his being glorified with him.</p>
