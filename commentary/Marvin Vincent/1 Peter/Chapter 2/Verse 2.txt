<p>New - born [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτιγεννητα] </span></span>. Peculiar to Peter, and only in this passage. Lit., born but just now [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτι] </span></span>. </p>
<p>Babes [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βρεφη] </span></span>. The word signifying peculiarly a child at birth, or of tender years. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:15">Luke 18:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:19">Acts 7:19</span>. Of the infant Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:12">Luke 2:12</span>, </p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:1">1 Peter 2:1</span>6Here marking the recency of Christian life in the converts addressed. Desire [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιποθησατε] </span></span>. The compound is intensive; earnestly desire. So Rev., long for. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:26">Philippians 2:26</span>. </p>
<p>The sincere milk of the word [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το λογικον αδολον γαλα] </span></span>. The A. V. has rendered logikon, of the word; but wrongly. It describes the quality of the milk as spiritual or rational, as opposed to liberal and ceremonial. In the only other place where it occurs (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span>) it is rendered reasonable; which Rev. gives here in margin. </p>
<p>Sincere [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδολον</span></span>] is another epithet of the milk. Lit., without guile, unadulterated. Compare guile in ver. 1. Laying aside guile, desire the guileless milk, etc. Hence Rev., renders the whole passage, Long for the spiritual milk which is without guile. </p>
<p>That ye may grow thereby. The best texts add, unto salvation.</p>
