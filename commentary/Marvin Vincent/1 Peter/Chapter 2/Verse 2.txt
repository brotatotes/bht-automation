New - born [αρτιγεννητα] . Peculiar to Peter, and only in this passage. Lit., born but just now [αρτι] . Babes [βρεφη] . The word signifying peculiarly a child at birth, or of tender years. See Luke 18:15; Acts 7:19. Of the infant Jesus, Luke 2:12, 1 Peter 2:16Here marking the recency of Christian life in the converts addressed. Desire [επιποθησατε] . The compound is intensive; earnestly desire. So Rev., long for. Compare Philippians 2:26. The sincere milk of the word [το λογικον αδολον γαλα] . The A. V. has rendered logikon, of the word; but wrongly. It describes the quality of the milk as spiritual or rational, as opposed to liberal and ceremonial. In the only other place where it occurs (Romans 12:1) it is rendered reasonable; which Rev. gives here in margin. Sincere [αδολον] is another epithet of the milk. Lit., without guile, unadulterated. Compare guile in ver. 1. Laying aside guile, desire the guileless milk, etc. Hence Rev., renders the whole passage, Long for the spiritual milk which is without guile. That ye may grow thereby. The best texts add, unto salvation.
