<p>An example [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπογραμμον] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. A graphic word, meaning a copy set by writing - masters for their pupils. Some explain it as a copy of characters over which the student is to trace the lines. </p>
<p>Follow [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επακολουθησητε] </span></span>. Lit., follow upon. The compound verb implies close following. From writers and painters, the metaphor changes now to a guide.</p>
