<p>Bare [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηνεγκεν] </span></span>. See on ver. 5. Bare up to the cross, as to an altar, and offered himself thereon. </p>
<p>The tree [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυλον] </span></span>. Lit., wood. Peter uses the same peculiar term for the cross, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:30">Acts 5:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:39">Acts 10:39</span>. </p>
<p>Being dead [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απογενομενοι] </span></span>. Rev., more strictly, having died. Used here only in the New Testament. The rendering of the verb can be given only in a clumsy way, having become off unto sins; not becoming separate from sins, but having ceased to exist as regards them. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:18">Romans 6:18</span>. Stripes [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωλωπι] </span></span>. Lit., bruise. So Rev., in margin. Only here in New Testament; meaning a bloody wale which arises under a blow. "Such a sight we feel sure, as we read this descriptive passage, St. Peter's eyes beheld on the body of his Master, and the flesh so dreadfully mangled made the disfigured form appear in his eyes like one single bruise" (Lumby).</p>
