<p>For ye were as sheep going astray [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητε γαρ ως προβατα πλανωμενοι] </span></span>; i e., as commonly understood, ye were like straying sheep. But the ye were should be construed with the participle going astray, the verb and the participle together denoting habitual action or condition. Render, as Rev., ye were going astray like sheep. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:24">Mark 12:24</span>. Bishop. See on ver. 12. </p>
