Coming [προσερχομενοι] . Indicating a close [προς] and an habitual (present participle) approach and an intimate association. A living stone [λιθον ζωντα] . Omit as unto. So Rev. The words are in apposition with whom (Christ). Compare Peter's use of the same word, stone, in Acts 4:11, and Matthew 21:42. It is not the word which Christ uses as a personal name for Peter [πετρος] ; so that it is not necessary to infer that Peter was thinking of his own new name. Disallowed [αποδεδοκιμασμενον] . Rev., rejected. See on the simple verb, ch. 1 7. The word indicates rejection after trial. Of God [παρα θεω] . Of in the A. V. is equivalent to by; but para has a stronger sense, implying the absolute power of decisive choice which is with God. Render, as Rev., with God; i e., God being judge; and compare Matthew 19:26; Romans 2:11. Precious [εντιμον] . At ch. 1 19 (precious blood) another word is used [τιμιος] , denoting essential preciousness. The word here indicates the preciousness as recognized or held in honor.
