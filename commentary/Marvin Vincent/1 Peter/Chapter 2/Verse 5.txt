<p>Living stones - built up - a spiritual house. It seems as though Peter must have had in mind the conception embodied in Christ 's commission to him, of a building erected upon a rock. The metaphor of a house built of living stones is violent, and sufficiently characteristic of Peter; yet it pictures, in a very striking way, the union of stability, growth, and activity in the ideal church. Note the transition from babes growing (ver. 2) to stones built up. But, as Salmond remarks, " In Paul we have even bolder instances of apparent confusion of metaphors, as when, in one breath, he represents believers as at once walking, rooted, and built up in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:6">Colossians 2:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:7">Colossians 2:7</span>). </p>
<p>To offer up [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανενεγκαι] </span></span>. The usual Old - Testament (Septuagint) term for offering of sacrifice. Lit., to bring up to the altar. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:15">Hebrews 13:15</span>. The force of ajna, up, appears in the fact of the altar being raised. The word is often used of carrying from a lower to a higher place. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:1">Matthew 17:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:51">Luke 24:51</span>. In this sense ver. 24 of this chapter is suggestive, where it is said that Christ bare [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηνεγκεν</span></span>] our sins : carried them up to the cross. See note there.</p>
