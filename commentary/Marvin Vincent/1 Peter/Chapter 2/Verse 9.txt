Generation [γενος] . Better, Rev., race : a body with a common life and descent. Nation [εθνος] . People [λαος] . The distinction between these three words cannot be closely pressed. Race emphasizes the idea of descent; nation, of community. Laov, people, occurring very often in the Septuagint, is used there mostly of the Israelites, the chosen people. The same use is also frequent in the New Testament; but it is employed in a more general sense, as by Luke 2:10. It would seem that this idea, however, in its metaphorical and Christian application, the chosen Israel of God, directed Peter's choice of the word, since he adds, a people for God 's own possession. Peculiar [εις περιποιησιν] . Lit., a people for acquisition. Rev., a people for God 's own possession. Wyc., a people of purchasing. Cranmer, a people which are won. The word occurs 1 Thessalonians 5:9, rendered obtaining (Rev.); Ephesians 1:14, God 's own possession (Rev.). See Isaiah 43:21 (Sept.), where the kindred verb occurs : " This people have I formed for myself [περιεποιησαμην] . Shew forth [εξαγγειλητε] . Only here in New Testament. Proclaim, tell abroad. The praises [τας αρετας] . Lit., the virtues. So Rev., excellencies. The word occurs Isaiah 43:21 (Sept., see above), and is rendered praise. See, also, Isaiah 43:12 (Sept.), "Declare his praise [αρετας] in the islands."
