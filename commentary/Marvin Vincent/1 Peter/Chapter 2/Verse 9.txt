<p>Generation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενος] </span></span>. Better, Rev., race : a body with a common life and descent. </p>
<p>Nation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνος] </span></span>. People [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαος] </span></span>. The distinction between these three words cannot be closely pressed. Race emphasizes the idea of descent; nation, of community. Laov, people, occurring very often in the Septuagint, is used there mostly of the Israelites, the chosen people. The same use is also frequent in the New Testament; but it is employed in a more general sense, as by <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:10">Luke 2:10</span>. It would seem that this idea, however, in its metaphorical and Christian application, the chosen Israel of God, directed Peter's choice of the word, since he adds, a people for God 's own possession. </p>
<p>Peculiar [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις περιποιησιν] </span></span>. Lit., a people for acquisition. Rev., a people for God 's own possession. Wyc., a people of purchasing. Cranmer, a people which are won. The word occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:9">1 Thessalonians 5:9</span>, rendered obtaining (Rev.); <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>, God 's own possession (Rev.). See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+43:21">Isaiah 43:21</span> (Sept.), where the kindred verb occurs : " This people have I formed for myself [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεποιησαμην] </span></span>. </p>
<p>Shew forth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαγγειλητε] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. Proclaim, tell abroad. </p>
<p>The praises [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας αρετας] </span></span>. Lit., the virtues. So Rev., excellencies. The word occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+43:21">Isaiah 43:21</span> (Sept., see above), and is rendered praise. See, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+43:12">Isaiah 43:12</span> (Sept.), "Declare his praise [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρετας</span></span>] in the islands."</p>
