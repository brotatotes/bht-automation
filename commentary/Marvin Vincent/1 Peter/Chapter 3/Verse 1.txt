<p>Likewise [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιως] </span></span>. Rev., in like manner; better, because likewise in popular speech has, wrongly, the sense of also. Peter means in like manner with servants (ch. 2 18). </p>
<p>Be in subjection [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσομεναι] </span></span>. Lit., being in subjection, or submitting yourselves; the same word which is used of the submission of servants (ch. 2 18). </p>
<p>Be won [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδηθησονται] </span></span>. Rev., be gained. The word used by Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:15">Matthew 18:15</span> : "gained thy brother."</p>
