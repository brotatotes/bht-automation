<p>Eschew [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλινατω] </span></span>. The old word eschew is from the Norman eschever, to shun or avoid. It reappears in the German scheuen, to be startled or afraid, and in the English shy, and to shy (as a horse). The Greek word here occurs only twice elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:12">Romans 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:17">Romans 16:17</span>), where Rev. renders turn aside and turn away. It is compounded of ejk, out of, and klinw, to cause to bend or slope; so that the picture in the word is of one bending aside from his course at the approach of evil. Rev., turn away from.</p>
