<p>According to knowledge. With an intelligent recognition of the nature of the marriage relation. </p>
<p>The woman [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω γυναικειω] </span></span>. Not a noun, however, as would appear from the ordinary rendering, but an adjective, agreeing with skeuei, vessel, as does also ajsqenesterw, weaker. Both are attributes of vessel; the female vessel as weaker. So Rev., in margin. </p>
<p>Vessel [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκευει] </span></span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:4">1 Thessalonians 4:4</span>. The primary idea of vessel, which is formed from the Latin vasellum, the diminutive of vas, a vase, is that of the receptacle which covers and contains; the case or protecting cover. Hence it is allied, etymologically, with vest, vestment, and wear. It is used in the New Testament </p>
<p>(1) in the sense of a cup or dish (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:16">Luke 8:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:29">John 19:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:20">2 Timothy 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27">Revelation 2:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+18:12">Revelation 18:12</span>). </p>
<p>(2) Of the man, as containing the divine energy, or as a subject of divine mercy or wrath, and hence becoming a divine instrument. Thus Paul is a chosen vessel to bear God 's name (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span>). Vessels of wrath (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:22">Romans 9:22</span>); of mercy (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:23">Romans 9:23</span>). So of the woman, as God 's instrument, along with man, for his service in the family and in society. </p>
<p>(3) Collectively, in the plural, of all the implements of any particular economy, as a house, or a ship. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:29">Matthew 12:29</span>, goods; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:17">Acts 27:17</span>, the tackling or gear of a ship. </p>
<p>Giving [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απονεμοντες] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. The word means, literally, to portion out, and is appropriate to the husband as controlling what is to be meted out to the wife. </p>
<p>Hindered [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγκοπτεσθαι] </span></span>. So A. V. and Rev., and the best texts, and the majority of commentators. The word means, literally, to knock in; make an incision into; and hence, generally, to hinder or thwart (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:7">Galatians 5:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:18">1 Thessalonians 2:18</span>). Some, however, read ejkkoptesqai, to cut off or destroy.</p>
