Of one mind [ομοφρονες] . Rev., like - minded. Only here in New Testament. Compare Romans 12:16; Romans 14:5; Philippians 2:2, etc. Indicating unity of thought and feeling. From oJmov, one and the same, and frhn, the mind. Having compassion one of another [συμπαθεις] . Only here in New Testament, though the kindred verb is found Hebrews 4:15; Hebrews 10:34. The rendering is needlessly diffuse. Rev., much better, compassionate; sympathetic, in margin. Interchange of fellow - feeling in joy or sorrow. Our popular usage errs in limiting sympathy to sorrow. Love as brethren [φιλαδελφοι] . Rev., more strictly, loving as brethren. Only here in New Testament. Pitiful [ευσπλαγχνοι] . Only here and Ephesians 4:32. Rev., better, tender - hearted. From eu, well, and splagcna, the nobler entrails, which are regarded as the seat of the affections, and hence equivalent to our popular use of heart. The original sense has given rise to the unfortunate translation bowels in the A. V., which occurs in its literal meaning only at Acts 1:18. Courteous. The A. V. has here followed the reading of the Tex. Rec., filofronev. But the best texts read tapeinofronev, humble - minded. So Rev. This occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, though the kindred noun tapeinofrosunh, humility, is found often. See on tapeinov, lowly, notes on Matthew 11:29.
