<p>Of one mind [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοφρονες] </span></span>. Rev., like - minded. Only here in New Testament. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:16">Romans 12:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:5">Romans 14:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:2">Philippians 2:2</span>, etc. Indicating unity of thought and feeling. From oJmov, one and the same, and frhn, the mind. </p>
<p>Having compassion one of another [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμπαθεις] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament, though the kindred verb is found <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:34">Hebrews 10:34</span>. The rendering is needlessly diffuse. Rev., much better, compassionate; sympathetic, in margin. Interchange of fellow - feeling in joy or sorrow. Our popular usage errs in limiting sympathy to sorrow. </p>
<p>Love as brethren [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλαδελφοι] </span></span>. Rev., more strictly, loving as brethren. Only here in New Testament. </p>
<p>Pitiful [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευσπλαγχνοι] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:32">Ephesians 4:32</span>. Rev., better, tender - hearted. From eu, well, and splagcna, the nobler entrails, which are regarded as the seat of the affections, and hence equivalent to our popular use of heart. The original sense has given rise to the unfortunate translation bowels in the A. V., which occurs in its literal meaning only at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:18">Acts 1:18</span>. </p>
<p>Courteous. The A. V. has here followed the reading of the Tex. Rec., filofronev. But the best texts read tapeinofronev, humble - minded. So Rev. This occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, though the kindred noun tapeinofrosunh, humility, is found often. See on tapeinov, lowly, notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>.</p>
