<p>Arm yourselves [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπλισασθε] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. The thought is Pauline. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:12">Romans 13:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:7">2 Corinthians 6:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:10">Ephesians 6:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:17">Ephesians 6:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:8">1 Thessalonians 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12">Colossians 3:12</span>. </p>
<p>Mind [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εννοιαν] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:12">Hebrews 4:12</span>. Literally the word means thought, and so some render it here. Rev. puts it in margin. The rendering intent, resolution, is very doubtful. It seems rather to be the thought as determining the resolution. Since Christ has suffered in the flesh, be ye also willing to suffer in the flesh.</p>
