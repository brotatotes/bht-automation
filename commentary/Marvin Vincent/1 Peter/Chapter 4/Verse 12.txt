<p>Think it not strange [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ξενιζεσθε] </span></span>. i e., alien from you and your condition as Christians. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span>. </p>
<p>Fiery trial [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυρωσει] </span></span>. The word means burning. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+27:21">Proverbs 27:21</span> (Sept.), it is rendered furnace. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:0">Psalms 45:0</span> (Sept.), 46 (A. V.), we read, "Thou, O God, hast proved us : thou hast smelted us, as silver is smelted." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:9">Zechariah 13:9</span>. </p>
<p>Which is to try you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμιν γινομενη] </span></span>. The A. V. thus makes the trial a thing of the future; mistranslating the Greek present participle, which is taking place. This participle, therefore, represents the trial as actually in progress. The Rev. does not give this force by its which cometh upon you. To try you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς πειρασμον] </span></span>. Lit., for trial or probation. </p>
<p>Strange thing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξενον] </span></span>. Compare think it not strange, above. </p>
<p>Happened [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμβαινοντος] </span></span>. Again the present participle. Better, perhaps, were happening; by chance, instead of with the definite purpose indicated by "taking place with a view to probation." See above.</p>
