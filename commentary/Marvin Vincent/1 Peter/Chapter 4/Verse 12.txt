Think it not strange [μη ξενιζεσθε] . i e., alien from you and your condition as Christians. Compare 1 Peter 5:4. Fiery trial [πυρωσει] . The word means burning. In Proverbs 27:21 (Sept.), it is rendered furnace. In Psalms 45:0 (Sept.), 46 (A. V.), we read, "Thou, O God, hast proved us : thou hast smelted us, as silver is smelted." Compare Zechariah 13:9. Which is to try you [υμιν γινομενη] . The A. V. thus makes the trial a thing of the future; mistranslating the Greek present participle, which is taking place. This participle, therefore, represents the trial as actually in progress. The Rev. does not give this force by its which cometh upon you. To try you [προς πειρασμον] . Lit., for trial or probation. Strange thing [ξενον] . Compare think it not strange, above. Happened [συμβαινοντος] . Again the present participle. Better, perhaps, were happening; by chance, instead of with the definite purpose indicated by "taking place with a view to probation." See above.
