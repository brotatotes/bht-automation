<p>"Lo, Baccus comes! and with the festive cries Resound the fields; and mixed in headlong rout, Men, matrons, maids, paupers, and nobles proud, To the mysterious rites are born along." Metamorphoses, 3, 528 - 530. </p>
<p>Excess [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναχυσιν] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. Lit., pouring forth. Rev. has flood in margin. The word is used in classical Greek of the tides which fill the hollows. </p>
<p>Riot [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασωτιας] </span></span>. From aj, not, and swzw, to save. Lit., unsavingness, prodigality, wastefulness; and thence of squandering on one's own debased appetites, whence it takes the sense of dissoluteness or profligacy. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:13">Luke 14:13</span>, the kindred adverb ajswtwv is used. The prodigal is described as scattering his substance, to which is added, living wastefully [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζων ασωτως] </span></span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:18">Ephesians 5:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:6">Titus 1:6</span>.</p>
