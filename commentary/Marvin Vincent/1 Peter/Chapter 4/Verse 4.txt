Run not with them. "In a troop" (Bengel); like a band of revellers. See above. Compare Ovid's description of the Bacchic rites : "Lo, Baccus comes! and with the festive cries Resound the fields; and mixed in headlong rout, Men, matrons, maids, paupers, and nobles proud, To the mysterious rites are born along." Metamorphoses, 3, 528 - 530. Excess [αναχυσιν] . Only here in New Testament. Lit., pouring forth. Rev. has flood in margin. The word is used in classical Greek of the tides which fill the hollows. Riot [ασωτιας] . From aj, not, and swzw, to save. Lit., unsavingness, prodigality, wastefulness; and thence of squandering on one's own debased appetites, whence it takes the sense of dissoluteness or profligacy. In Luke 14:13, the kindred adverb ajswtwv is used. The prodigal is described as scattering his substance, to which is added, living wastefully [ζων ασωτως] . Compare Ephesians 5:18; Titus 1:6.
