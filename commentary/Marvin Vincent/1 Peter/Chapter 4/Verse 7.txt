Is at hand [ηγγικεν] . Lit., has come near. The word constantly used of the coming of Christ and his kingdom. See Matthew 3:2; Mark 1:15; Luke 10:9; Hebrews 10:25. Be ye sober [σωφρονησατε] . The word is from swv, sound, and frhn, the mind. Therefore, as Rev., be ye of sound mind. Compare Mark 5:15. Watch [νηψατε] . See on ch. 1 Peter 1:13. The A. V. has followed the Vulgate, vigilate (watch). Rev. is better : be sober. Unto prayer [εις προσευχας] . Lit., prayers. The plural is used designedly : prayers of all kinds, private or public. Tynd. renders, Be ye discreet and sober, that ye may be apt to prayers. Compare Ephesians 6:18, "with every kind of prayer, and watching thereunto."
