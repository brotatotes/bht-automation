Also an elder [συμπρεσβυτερος] . Only here in New Testament. Better, as Rev., fellow - elder. The expression is decisive against the primacy of Peter. Witness [μαρτυς] . The word is used in the New Testament to denote : (a) a spectator or eye - witness (Acts 10:39; Acts 6:0; Acts 13:0). (b) One who testifies to what he has seen (Acts 1:8; Acts 5:32). (c) In the forensic sense, a witness in court (Matthew 26:65; Mark 14:63). (d) One who vindicates his testimony by suffering : a martyr (Acts 22:20; Hebrews 12:1; Revelation 2:13; Revelation 17:6). The first three meetings run into each other. The eye - witness, as a spectator, is always such with a view to giving testimony. Hence this expression of Peter cannot be limited to the mere fact of his having seen what he preached; especially since, when he wishes to emphasize this fact, he employs another word, ejpopothv (2 Peter 1:16). Therefore he speaks of himself as a witness, especially in the sense of being called to testify of what he has seen. Partaker [κοινωνος] . This use of the word, expressing a present realization of something not yet attained, occurs in no other writer in the New Testament. See on 2 Peter 1:4.
