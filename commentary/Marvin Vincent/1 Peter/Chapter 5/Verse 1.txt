<p>Also an elder [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμπρεσβυτερος] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. Better, as Rev., fellow - elder. The expression is decisive against the primacy of Peter. </p>
<p>Witness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυς] </span></span>. The word is used in the New Testament to denote : </p>
<p>(a) a spectator or eye - witness (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:39">Acts 10:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:0">Acts 6:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:0">Acts 13:0</span>). </p>
<p>(b) One who testifies to what he has seen (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:8">Acts 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:32">Acts 5:32</span>). </p>
<p>(c) In the forensic sense, a witness in court (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:65">Matthew 26:65</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:63">Mark 14:63</span>). </p>
<p>(d) One who vindicates his testimony by suffering : a martyr (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:20">Acts 22:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+2:13">Revelation 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+17:6">Revelation 17:6</span>). </p>
<p>The first three meetings run into each other. The eye - witness, as a spectator, is always such with a view to giving testimony. Hence this expression of Peter cannot be limited to the mere fact of his having seen what he preached; especially since, when he wishes to emphasize this fact, he employs another word, ejpopothv (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16">2 Peter 1:16</span>). Therefore he speaks of himself as a witness, especially in the sense of being called to testify of what he has seen. </p>
<p>Partaker [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνος] </span></span>. This use of the word, expressing a present realization of something not yet attained, occurs in no other writer in the New Testament. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span>.</p>
