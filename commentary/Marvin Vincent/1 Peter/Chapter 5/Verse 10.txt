<p>Who hath called us [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο καλεσας ημας] </span></span>. But the tense is the aorist, and the true reading is uJmav, you, instead of us. Render, therefore, as Rev., who called you; before the foundation of the world. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:30">Romans 8:30</span>, and compare unto his eternal glory and them he also glorified. </p>
<p>By Christ Jesus [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν χριστω ιησου] </span></span>. The best texts omit Jesus. So Rev., which also renders, better, in Christ, denoting the sphere or element in which the calling and its results take place : "Christ as the life, head, and very principle of all existence to the Christian" (Cook). </p>
<p>Awhile [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολιφον] </span></span>. Rev., more literally, a little while. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:6">1 Peter 1:6</span>. Make you perfect, etc. The Tex. Rec. makes this and the three following verbs in the optative mood, expressing a wish. So the A. V. But the best texts make them all indicative future, and thus convert the wish or prayer into an assurance. Thus, then, Shall himself perfect [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος καταρτισει] </span></span>. The A. V. overlooks the aujtov, himself, which is very significant as indicating God 's personal interest and energy in the work of confirming his children. </p>
<p>Shall perfect. Rev. reads restore, in margin. The root of this word appears in arw or ajrariskw, to fit or join together. So arqron means a joint. The radical notion of the verb is, therefore, adjustment - the putting of all the parts into right relation and connection. We find it used of mending the nets (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:21">Matthew 4:21</span>), and of restoring an erring brother (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:1">Galatians 6:1</span>); of framing the body and the worlds (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5">Hebrews 10:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:3">Hebrews 11:3</span>); of the union of members in the church (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:10">1 Corinthians 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:11">2 Corinthians 13:11</span>). Out of this comes the general sense of perfecting (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:16">Matthew 21:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:40">Luke 6:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:10">1 Thessalonians 3:10</span>). </p>
<p>Shall stablish [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηριξει] </span></span>. The word is akin at the root to stereov, steadfast (ver. 9), and is the very word used by Christ in his exhortation to Peter, "strengthen thy brethren" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:32">Luke 22:32</span>). Possibly there is a reminiscence of this in Peter's use of the word here. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:17">2 Thessalonians 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:8">James 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+3:2">Revelation 3:2</span>. Shall strengthen [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σθενωσει] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:16">Ephesians 3:16</span>. </p>
<p>Shall settle [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμελιωσει] </span></span>. Omitted by some texts, and by Rev. From qemeliov, a foundation. The radical notion of the word is, therefore, to ground securely. It occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:25">Matthew 7:25</span>, of the house founded on a rock; in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:10">Hebrews 1:10</span>, of laying the foundations of the earth. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:18">Ephesians 3:18</span>, it is joined with rooted. The massings of these expressions, unconnected by conjunctions, indicates strong feeling. Bengel thus sums up the whole : "Shall perfect, that no defect remain in you : shall stablish, that nothing may shake you : shall strengthen, that you may overcome every adverse force. A saying worthy of Peter. He is strengthening his brethren."</p>
