<p>Silvanus. Probably the companion of Paul known in the Acts as Silas (xv. 22, 27, 32, 34, 40, etc.), and called Silvanus by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:19">2 Corinthians 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:1">2 Thessalonians 1:1</span>. </p>
<p>A faithful brother. Brother has the definite article, the faithful brother, designating him as one well known for his fidelity. Rev. renders our, with the in margin. </p>
<p>Unto you. Construe, not as A. V., a brother unto you, but I have written unto you. So Rev. </p>
<p>As I suppose [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως λογιζομαι] </span></span>. Too feeble, since the verb denotes a settled persuasion or assurance. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:28">Romans 3:28</span>, "we conclude" or reckon, as the result of our reasoning. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:18">Romans 8:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:19">Hebrews 11:19</span>. Rev., as I account him. </p>
<p>I have written [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγραψα] </span></span>. Lit., I wrote. An example of what is known as the epistolary aorist. The writer regards the time of writing as his correspondent will do when he shall have received the letter. We say in a letter, I write. Paul, writing to Philemon, says ajnepemya, I sent; since to Philemon the act of sending would be already past. Therefore in using this form of expression Peter does not refer to the second epistle, not to another now lost, but to the present epistle. </p>
<p>Briefly [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι ολιγω] </span></span>. Lit., through few (words). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:22">Hebrews 13:22</span>, where the expression is dia bracewn, through brief words. </p>
<p>Testifying [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιμαρτυρων] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. See on ver. 1. Wherein ye stand [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ην εστηκατε] </span></span>. The best texts read sthte, imperative. So Rev., stand ye fast therein. Lit., "into which stand," the preposition with the verb having the pregnant force of entering into and standing fast in.</p>
