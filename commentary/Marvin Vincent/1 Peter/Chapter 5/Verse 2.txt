Feed [ποιμανατε] . Better, Rev., tend, since the verb denotes all that is included in the office of a shepherd - guiding, guarding, folding, no less than feeding, which latter is expressed by boskw. There is, doubtless, a reminiscence in the word of Christ 's charge to Peter (John 21:15-17). Both words are used there : "Feed [βοσκε] my lambs" (ver. 15); "tend [ποιμαινε] my sheep" (ver. 16); "feed [βοσκε] my sheep" (ver. 17). The A. V. obliterates the distinction by rendering all three feed. Bengel rightly remarks, "Feeding is part of tending." See on Matthew 2:6. Taking the oversight. The best texts omit. Rev. retains. By constraint [αναγκαστως] . Only here in New Testament. Willingly [εκουσιως] . Only here and Hebrews 10:26. For filthy lucre [εισχροκερδως] . From aijscrov, disgraceful, and kerdov, gain. Only here in New Testament. The word filthy is intended to convey the idea which lies in aijscrov, base or dishonorable; becoming such if it is made the motive of the minister 's service. Compare 2 Corinthians 12:14. Willingly [προθυμως] . Not strong enough. The word is compounded of pro, forward, and qumov, heart or spirit. Hence Rev., with a ready mind; a forward spirit; denoting not mere willingness, but zeal. Only here in New Testament. Compare the kindred adjective proqumov, ready (Romans 1:15; Matthew 26:41; Mark 14:38), and the kindred noun proqumia, readiness (2 Corinthians 8:11, 2 Corinthians 8:12, 2 Corinthians 8:19; 2 Corinthians 9:2).
