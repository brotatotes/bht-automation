<p>Feed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμανατε] </span></span>. Better, Rev., tend, since the verb denotes all that is included in the office of a shepherd - guiding, guarding, folding, no less than feeding, which latter is expressed by boskw. There is, doubtless, a reminiscence in the word of Christ 's charge to Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15-17">John 21:15-17</span>). Both words are used there : "Feed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βοσκε</span></span>] my lambs" (ver. 15); "tend [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμαινε</span></span>] my sheep" (ver. 16); "feed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βοσκε</span></span>] my sheep" (ver. 17). The A. V. obliterates the distinction by rendering all three feed. Bengel rightly remarks, "Feeding is part of tending." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:6">Matthew 2:6</span>. </p>
<p>Taking the oversight. The best texts omit. Rev. retains. </p>
<p>By constraint [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγκαστως] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. </p>
<p>Willingly [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκουσιως] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:26">Hebrews 10:26</span>. </p>
<p>For filthy lucre [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισχροκερδως] </span></span>. From aijscrov, disgraceful, and kerdov, gain. Only here in New Testament. The word filthy is intended to convey the idea which lies in aijscrov, base or dishonorable; becoming such if it is made the motive of the minister 's service. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:14">2 Corinthians 12:14</span>. </p>
<p>Willingly [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προθυμως] </span></span>. Not strong enough. The word is compounded of pro, forward, and qumov, heart or spirit. Hence Rev., with a ready mind; a forward spirit; denoting not mere willingness, but zeal. Only here in New Testament. Compare the kindred adjective proqumov, ready (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:15">Romans 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:41">Matthew 26:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:38">Mark 14:38</span>), and the kindred noun proqumia, readiness (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:11">2 Corinthians 8:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:12">2 Corinthians 8:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:19">2 Corinthians 8:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:2">2 Corinthians 9:2</span>).</p>
