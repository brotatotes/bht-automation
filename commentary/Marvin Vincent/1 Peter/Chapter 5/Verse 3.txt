But this carries the idea of high - handed rule. Heritage [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κληρων] </span></span>. Plural. Klhrov means a lot. See on inheritance, ch. 1 4. From the kindred adjective klhrikov comes the English cleric, contracted into clerk, which in ecclesiastical writings originally signified a minister; either as being chosen by lot like Matthias, or as being the lot or inheritance of God. Hence Wycliffe translates the passage, "neither as having lordship in the clergie." As in the Middle Ages the clergy were almost the only persons who could write, the word clerk came to have one of its common modern meanings. The word here, though its interpretation is somewhat disputed, seems to refer to the several congregations - the lots or charges assigned to the elders.

<p>Examples [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυποι] </span></span>. Peter uses three different terms for a pattern or model : uJpogrammov, a writing - copy (ch. 2 21); uJpodeigma, for which classical writers prefer paradeigma, an architect's plan or a sculptor's or painter's model (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:6">2 Peter 2:6</span>); tupov (see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:21">1 Peter 3:21</span>), of which our word type is nearly a transcript.

Generally, an image or form, always with a statement of the object; and hence the kindred meaning of a pattern or model.
