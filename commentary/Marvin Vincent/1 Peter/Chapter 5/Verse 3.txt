As lording it [κατακυριευοντες] . See Matthew 20:0; Matthew 25:0; Acts 19:16. Other words are used for the exercise of legitimate authority in the church; proistamai, to be over (1 Thessalonians 5:12; 1 Timothy 5:17); poimainw, as ver. 2, tend. But this carries the idea of high - handed rule. Heritage [κληρων] . Plural. Klhrov means a lot. See on inheritance, ch. 1 4. From the kindred adjective klhrikov comes the English cleric, contracted into clerk, which in ecclesiastical writings originally signified a minister; either as being chosen by lot like Matthias, or as being the lot or inheritance of God. Hence Wycliffe translates the passage, "neither as having lordship in the clergie." As in the Middle Ages the clergy were almost the only persons who could write, the word clerk came to have one of its common modern meanings. The word here, though its interpretation is somewhat disputed, seems to refer to the several congregations - the lots or charges assigned to the elders. Compare proseklhrwqhsan, were added as disciples; A. V., consorted with (Acts 17:4). Rev. renders charge. Why not charges? Examples [τυποι] . Peter uses three different terms for a pattern or model : uJpogrammov, a writing - copy (ch. 2 21); uJpodeigma, for which classical writers prefer paradeigma, an architect's plan or a sculptor's or painter's model (2 Peter 2:6); tupov (see on ch. 1 Peter 3:21), of which our word type is nearly a transcript. The word primarily means the impression left by a stroke (tuptw, to strike). Thus John 20:25, "the print of the nails." Used of the stamp on coin; the impression of any engraving or hewn work of art; a monument or statue; the figures of the tabernacle of Moloch and of the star Remphan (Acts 7:43). Generally, an image or form, always with a statement of the object; and hence the kindred meaning of a pattern or model. See Acts 23:25; Romans 5:14; Philippians 3:17; Hebrews 8:5.
