<p>The chief Shepherd [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχιποιμενος] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. In harmony with ver. 2. "The last thing Peter could have dreamed of as possible would be its misapplication to himself or his so - called successors" (Cook). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:20">Hebrews 13:20</span>, great Shepherd; and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:14">John 10:14</span>, good Shepherd.

<p>Crown [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στεφανον</span></span>] . From stefw, to put round, encircle. It is the crown of victory in the games; of military valor; the marriage wreath, or the festal garland, woven of leaves or made of gold in imitation of leaves. Thus it is distinguished from the royal crown, which is diadhma, of which diadem is a transcript. In Paul, stefanov is always used of the conqueror's crown, not of the king's (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:24-26">1 Corinthians 9:24-26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:5">2 Timothy 2:5</span>). Though it is urged that Peter would not have employed a reference to the crown of the victors in the games, because of the abhorrence of the Palestinian Jews for heathen spectacles, yet the reference to the crown of leaves seems to be determined by the epithet unfading, as compared with garlands of earthly leaves. The crown of thorns woven for Jesus is called stefanov, with reference rather to its being twined than to its being a caricature of a kingly crown.</p>
