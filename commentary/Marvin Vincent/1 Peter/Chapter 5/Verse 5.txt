<p>Be clothed with humility [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ταπεινοφροσυνην εγκομβωσασθε] </span></span>. The last word is a very peculiar one, occurring only here. It is derived from kombov, a roll, band, or girth : a knot or roll of cloth, made in tying or tucking up any part of the dress. The kindred word ejgkombwma, from which the verb is directly formed, means a slave 's apron, under which the loose garments were girt up. Compare Horace's "puer alte cinctus," a slave girt high. Hence the figure carries an exhortation to put on humility as a working virtue employed in ministry. This is apparent from the evident reminiscence of that scene in which Peter figured so prominently - the washing of the disciple 's feet by the Lord, when he girded himself with a towel as a servant, and gave them the lesson of ministry both by word and act. Bengel paraphrases, "Put on and wrap yourselves about with humility, so that the covering of humility cannot possibly be stripped from you." </p>
<p>Resisteth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιτασσεται] </span></span>. A strong and graphic word. Lit., setteth himself in array against, as one draws out a host for battle. Pride calls out God 's armies. No wonder, therefore, that it "goeth before destruction." The proud [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερηφανοις] </span></span>.
