Casting [επιρριψαντες] . The aorist participle denoting an act once for all; throwing the whole life with its care on him. All your care [πασαν την μεριμναν] . The whole of your care. "Not every anxiety as it arises, for none will arise if this transference has been effectually made." Care. See on Matthew 6:25, take no thought. Rev., rightly, anxiety. He careth [μελει] . Meaning the watchful care of interest and affection. The sixth and seventh verses should be taken together : Humble yourselves and cast all your anxiety. Pride is at the root of most of our anxiety. To human pride it is humiliating to cast everything upon another and be cared for. See James 4:6, James 4:7.
