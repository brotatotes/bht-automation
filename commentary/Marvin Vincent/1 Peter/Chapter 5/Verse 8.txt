Be sober [νηψατε] . See on ch. 1 Peter 4:7. Be vigilant [γρηγορησατε] . Rev., be watchful. See on Mark 13:35; and 1 Thessalonians 5:6, where both verbs occur : watch and be sober. A reminiscence of the scene in Gethsemane : Could ye not watch with me? (Matthew 26:40, Matthew 26:41). Adversary [ο αντιδικος] . The article points to a well - known adversary. From ajnti, against, and dikh, a lawsuit. Strictly, an adversary in a lawsuit. Here an adversary in general. Compare Zechariah 3:1-5. Only here, in New Testament, of Satan. The devil. See on Matthew 4:1. Roaring [ωρυομενος] . Only here in New Testament. The word conveys somewhat of the sense by the sound [ορυομενοσ] . It denotes especially the howl of a beast in fierce hunger. Lion. Augustine says, "Christ is called 'a lion ' (Revelation 5:5) because of his courage : the devil, because of his ferocity. The one lion comes to conquer, the other to hurt." Seven Hebrew words are used for this animal; six to describe his movements and four to describe his roar. He is mentioned in the Bible about one hundred and thirty times. In Job 4:10, Job 4:11, give different words are used for him. In Jude 1:14:5; Psalms 21:13; Psalms 103:21 (Sept.), the same word as here is used for the roaring of the lion as a translation of the Hebrew word for the thunder in Job 37:4. Walketh about [περιπατει] . Compare Job 1:7; Job 2:2. This word gave name to that sect of Greek philosophers known as Peripatetics, because they walked about while teaching or disputing. "St. Peter calls Satan the Peripatetic" (Cox, on Job). The Arabs call him the Busy One. It was to Peter that Christ said, "Satan hath desired to have you," etc. (Luke 22:31). Devour [καταπιη] . Lit., swallow down. See on Matthew 23:24.
