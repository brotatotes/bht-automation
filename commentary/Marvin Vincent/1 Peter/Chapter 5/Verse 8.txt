<p>Lion. Augustine says, "Christ is called 'a lion ' (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+5:5">Revelation 5:5</span>) because of his courage : the devil, because of his ferocity. The one lion comes to conquer, the other to hurt." Seven Hebrew words are used for this animal; six to describe his movements and four to describe his roar. He is mentioned in the Bible about one hundred and thirty times. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+4:10">Job 4:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+4:11">Job 4:11</span>, give different words are used for him.

This word gave name to that sect of Greek philosophers known as Peripatetics, because they walked about while teaching or disputing. "St. Peter calls Satan the Peripatetic" (Cox, on Job).
