Resist [αντιστητε] . The Rev., very judiciously, substitutes withstand; resist having been already used in ver. 5 for ajntitassetai. Withstand is, moreover, the more accurate rendering; as the verb means rather to be firm against onset than to strive against it. With in withstand is the Saxon wid, against, which appears in the German wider. Steadfast [στερεοι] . Compare 2 Timothy 2:19; and the kindred verb stereow, to strengthen (Acts 3:7, Acts 3:16; Acts 16:5). Paul, in Colossians 2:5, uses a cognate noun, sterewma, evidently as a military metaphor : "Beholding your order (taxin, compare ajntitassetai, ver. 5) and your solid front or close phalanx" [στερεωμα] . It might be difficult to find, on the whole, a better rendering than steadfast, yet it falls a little short of the meaning. Steadfast is Anglo - Saxon, stede, a place, and faest, fast; and hence means firm in its place; but stereoi conveys also the sense of compactness, compact solidity, and is appropriate, since a number of individuals are addressed and exhorted to withstand the onset of Satan as one compacted body. Stereov implies solidity in the very mass and body of the thing itself; steadfastness, mere holding of place. A rock is stereov, firm, solid; but a flexible weed with its tough root resisting all efforts to pull it up, may be steadfast. The exhortation is appropriate from Peter, the Rock. The same afflictions [τα αυτα των παθηματων] . Rev., better, sufferings. A very peculiar construction, occurring nowhere else in the New Testament. Lit., the same things of sufferings, emphasizing the idea of identity. Are accomplished [επιτελεισθαι] . More correctly, are being accomplished. The present infinitive denotes something in process of accomplishment. Brethren [αδελφοτητι] . Lit., brotherhood. Only here and ch. 2 17.
