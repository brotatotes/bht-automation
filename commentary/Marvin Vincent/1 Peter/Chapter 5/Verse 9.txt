<p>Resist [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιστητε] </span></span>. The Rev., very judiciously, substitutes withstand; resist having been already used in ver. 5 for ajntitassetai. Withstand is, moreover, the more accurate rendering; as the verb means rather to be firm against onset than to strive against it. With in withstand is the Saxon wid, against, which appears in the German wider. </p>
<p>Steadfast [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στερεοι] </span></span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:19">2 Timothy 2:19</span>; and the kindred verb stereow, to strengthen (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:7">Acts 3:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:16">Acts 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:5">Acts 16:5</span>). Paul, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:5">Colossians 2:5</span>, uses a cognate noun, sterewma, evidently as a military metaphor : "Beholding your order (taxin, compare ajntitassetai, ver. 5) and your solid front or close phalanx" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στερεωμα] </span></span>. It might be difficult to find, on the whole, a better rendering than steadfast, yet it falls a little short of the meaning. Steadfast is Anglo - Saxon, stede, a place, and faest, fast; and hence means firm in its place; but stereoi conveys also the sense of compactness, compact solidity, and is appropriate, since a number of individuals are addressed and exhorted to withstand the onset of Satan as one compacted body. Stereov implies solidity in the very mass and body of the thing itself; steadfastness, mere holding of place. A rock is stereov, firm, solid; but a flexible weed with its tough root resisting all efforts to pull it up, may be steadfast. The exhortation is appropriate from Peter, the Rock. The same afflictions [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα αυτα των παθηματων] </span></span>. Rev., better, sufferings. A very peculiar construction, occurring nowhere else in the New Testament. Lit., the same things of sufferings, emphasizing the idea of identity. </p>
<p>Are accomplished [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτελεισθαι] </span></span>. More correctly, are being accomplished. The present infinitive denotes something in process of accomplishment. </p>
<p>Brethren [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδελφοτητι] </span></span>. Lit., brotherhood. Only here and ch. 2 17.</p>
