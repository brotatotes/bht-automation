<p>Without ceasing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδιαλειπτως] </span></span>. P o. In LXX see 1 Macc. 7 11; 2 Macc. 3 26; 9 4; 8 12; 14 7; 3 Maccvi. 33. Should be construed with making mention, not with remembering, as A. V. and Rev. The salutations of Paul reproduce ordinary conventional forms of greeting. Thus the familiar Greek greeting cairein be joyful, hail, welcome, appears in cariv grace. This was perceived by Theodore of Mopsuestia (350 - 428 A. D.), who, in his commentary on Ephesians, says that in the preface to that letter Paul does very much as we do when we say "So and so to So and so, greeting" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δεινα τω δεινι χαιρειν] </span></span>. Deissmann gives some interesting parallels from ancient papyri. For instance, a letter dated 172 B. C., from an Egyptian lady to her brother or husband : "Isias to her brother Hephaestion, greeting [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρειν] </span></span>. If you are well, and other things happen as you would wish, it would be in accordance with my constant prayer to the gods. I myself am well, and the boy; and all at home make constant remembrance of you. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:9">Romans 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:16">Ephesians 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:4">Philippians 1:4</span>. Again :" Ammonios to his sister Tachnumi, abundant greeting [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα πλειστα χαιρειν] </span></span>. Before all things, I pray that you may be in health; and each day I make the act of worship for you. " In these specimens the conventional salutations in correspondence include the general greeting [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρειν</span></span>] and the statement that prayer is made for the correspondent's welfare; and the words constant and daily are attached to the act of prayer. It is further to be noticed that many passages of Paul 's Epistles give evidence of having been shaped by expressions in letters received by him from the parties he is addressing. In his answer he gives them back their own words, as is common in correspondence. Thus, making mention of you and remembering your work, etc., together with the statement that Timothy reports that you have a good remembrance of us (ch. 3 6), all together suggest that Paul had before him, when writing to the Thessalonians, a letter which Timothy had brought from them. Other instances will be noted as they occur. 10 Work - labor - patience [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επργου - κοπου - υπομονης] </span></span>. Ergon work, may mean either the act, the simple transaction, or the process of dealing with anything, or the result of the dealing, - as a book or a picture is called a work. Kopov labor, from koptein to strike or hew; hence, laborious, painful exertion. Upomonh patience, patient endurance and faithful persistence in toil and suffering. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:6">2 Peter 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:7">James 5:7</span>. The genitives, of faith, love, hope, mark the generating principles of the work and labor and patience, which set their stamp upon each; thus, work which springs from faith, and is characteristic of faith. The phrase patience of hope is found only here; but see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:4">Romans 5:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:25">Romans 8:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:4">Romans 14:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:7">1 Corinthians 8:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:11">Hebrews 7:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:12">Hebrews 7:12</span>. uJpomonh in LXX, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ch+29:15">1 Chronicles 29:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+14:19">Job 14:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+9:18">Psalms 9:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+38:7">Psalms 38:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+1:4">Jeremiah 1:4</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+1:8">Jeremiah 1:8</span>.
