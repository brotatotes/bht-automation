Election of God. Incorrect. Const. of or by [υπο] God with beloved. Eklogh election, in N. T., mostly by Paul. Elsewhere only Acts 9:15, and 2 Peter 1:10. This, and the kindred words, ejklegein to choose, and ejklektov chosen or elect, are used of God 's selection of men or agencies for special missions or attainments; but neither here nor elsewhere in the N. T. is there any warrant for the revolting doctrine that God has predestined a definite number of mankind to eternal life, and the rest to eternal destruction. 11 The sense in this passage appears to be defined by the succeeding context. The Thessalonians had been chosen to be members of the Christian church, and their conduct had justified the choice. See vv. 5 - 10.
