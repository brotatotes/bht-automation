<p>They themselves shew [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοι απαγγελλουσιν] </span></span>. They themselves in contrast with we, ver. 8. We need not speak of anything : they themselves volunteer testimony to your faith. Shew, more correctly announce or report. 13 Entering in [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισοδον] </span></span>. Comp. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:1">1 Thessalonians 2:1</span>. The thought of ver. 5 is resumed. The repetition of the word in ch. 2 1, and of in vain in ch. 3 5, may point to expressions in a letter of the Thessalonians. </p>
<p>Unto you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς] </span></span>. The preposition combines with the sense of direction that of relation and intercourse. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:56">Matthew 13:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:16">Mark 9:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:25">Acts 3:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+4:5">Colossians 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:20">Hebrews 9:20</span>. </p>
<p>Ye turned unto God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεστρεψατε προς τον θεον] </span></span>. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:15">Acts 14:15</span>. The exact phrase only here. The verb is common in LXX, with both kurion Lord and qeon God. </p>
<p>Idols. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:3">1 Corinthians 8:3</span>. The word would indicate that the majority of the converts were heathen and not Jews. </p>
<p>Living and true [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωντι και αληθινω] </span></span>. The only instance in N. T. of this collocation. It does not occur in O. T. For ajlhqinov genuine, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:37">John 4:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:28">John 7:28</span>.
