<p>Comforted [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραμυθουμενοι] </span></span>. The A. V. renders the three participles in this verse as finite verbs, we exhorted, etc. Rev. retains the participial construction. Better than comforted, persuading. Persuasion is the form which the exhortation assumed. Paraklhsiv exhortation, and paramuqiou persuasion, are associated in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:1">Philippians 2:1</span>. The verb paramuqeomai, to persuade occurs only four times in N. T. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:1">Philippians 2:1</span>. Neither verb nor noun in LXX </p>
<p>Charged [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρομενοι] </span></span>. Rev. testifying; but the A. V. is more correct. Rend. charging. The verb means to conjure, or appeal to by something sacred. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17">Ephesians 4:17</span>.
