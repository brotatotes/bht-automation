Comforted [παραμυθουμενοι] . The A. V. renders the three participles in this verse as finite verbs, we exhorted, etc. Rev. retains the participial construction. Better than comforted, persuading. Persuasion is the form which the exhortation assumed. Paraklhsiv exhortation, and paramuqiou persuasion, are associated in Philippians 2:1. The verb paramuqeomai, to persuade occurs only four times in N. T. See on Philippians 2:1. Neither verb nor noun in LXX Charged [μαρτυρομενοι] . Rev. testifying; but the A. V. is more correct. Rend. charging. The verb means to conjure, or appeal to by something sacred. So Ephesians 4:17. Comp. Acts 20:26; Galatians 5:3, and diamarturomai I charge, 1 Timothy 5:21; 2 Timothy 2:14; 2 Timothy 4:1. Comp. Thucyd. 6 80.
