<p>Walk [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιπατειν] </span></span>. By Paul exclusively in the metaphorical sense of behaving or conducting one's self. Similarly in Hebrews. In the Synoptic Gospels, with one exception (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:5">Mark 7:5</span>), of the physical act. Both senses in the Fourth Gospel, but only the metaphorical sense in John's Epistles. Once in the metaphorical sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:21">Acts 21:21</span>. In LXX almost exclusively literal; but see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ki+20:23">2 Kings 20:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+8:20">Proverbs 8:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ec+11:9">Ecclesiastes 11:9</span>. The phrase ajxiwv peripatein to walk worthily, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:10">Colossians 1:10</span>. Worthy of God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιως θεου] </span></span>. Better worthily. For ajxiwv comp. LXX, Wisd. 7 15; 16 1; Sir. 14 11. The formula ajxiwv qeou is found among the Pergamum papyri. A priest of Dionysus is described as having performed his sacred duties ajxiwv qeou. A priestess of Athene as having served ajxiwv thv qeou kai thv patridov worthily of the goddess and of her fatherland. A chief herdsman as having conducted the divine mysteries. ajxiwv tou kaqhgemonov Dionusou worthily of his chief, Dionysus. The dates of these papyri are from 141 B.

God 's kingdom is here conceived as present - the economy of divine grace to which the readers are called as Christians. Glory is the future consummation of that kingdom. For basileia kingdom, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:20">Luke 6:20</span>. Doxa glory is not used in N. T. in its primary, classical sense of opinion or notion.

Glory of God expresses the sum total of the divine perfections. The idea is prominent in redemptive revelation : see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:1">Isaiah 60:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>. It expresses the form in which God reveals himself in the economy of salvation : see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:23">Romans 9:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:12">Ephesians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:11">1 Timothy 1:11</span>.

It is the goal of Christian hope : see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:18">Romans 8:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21">Romans 8:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span>.</p>
