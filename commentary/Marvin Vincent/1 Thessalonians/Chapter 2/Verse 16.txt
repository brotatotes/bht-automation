<p>To speak - that they might be saved (lalhsai ina swqwsin). Not, to speak to the Gentiles in order that they might be saved, but to tell the Gentiles that they might be saved. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:33">1 Corinthians 10:33</span>. </p>
<p>To fill up [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναπληρωσαι] </span></span>. The verb means the making up of what is lacking to perfect fulness; the filling of a partial void. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:30">Philippians 2:30</span>. Once in LXX of filling up of sins, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:16">Genesis 14:16</span>. Always blind and stubborn, the Jews filled up the measure of their sins by their treatment of Christ and his apostles. </p>
<p>Alway [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντοτε] </span></span>. Emphatically placed at the end of the sentence. At all times - before Christ, in Christ 's time, now - the Jews by their resistance to the divine word fill up their 'sins. </p>
<p>Is come [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφθασεν] </span></span>. The verb not frequent in N. T. and used mostly by Paul. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:14">2 Corinthians 10:14</span>, and comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:31">Romans 9:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:16">Philippians 3:16</span>. </p>
<p>To the uttermost [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τελος] </span></span>. This is not the meaning of the phrase in N. T. It is to the end : see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:22">Matthew 10:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:13">Matthew 24:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:5">Luke 18:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span>. The wrath of God had not come upon them to the uttermost. The meaning is that the divine wrath had reached the point where it passed into judgment.</p>
