<p>I Paul. Not implying any less desire on the part of his associates, but emphasising his own. See on the use of the epistolary plural, ch. 1 2. Satan [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σατανας] </span></span>. From the Aramaic Satana, adversary. In the canonical LXX the name appears only three times, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+11:14">1 Kings 11:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+11:23">1 Kings 11:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+11:25">1 Kings 11:25</span>, and in each case is applied to a man. In LXX diabolov is used, almost without exception, as the translation of the Hebrews Satan. Of 22 instances of diabolov only 9 are outside of the book of Job. From the more general conception of an adversary, there is, in the O. T., a gradual development toward that of an evil personality. For instance, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2sa+24:1">2 Samuel 24:1</span>, the numbering of the people is ascribed to the anger of the Lord. The later historian, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ch+21:1">1 Chronicles 21:1</span>, ascribes the act to Satan. See also Job, Wisd. 2 24; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+2:1">Zechariah 2:1</span>. The specialising of the conception was due, in part, to the contact of the Jews with the religions of Babylon and Persia. In N. T. Satan appears as the personal spirit of evil - the same who is called the devil, the wicked one, the prince of the power of the air, the prince of this world, the serpent, the God of this world, the tempter. He tempts to evil, opposes God 's work, inspires evil dispositions, torments God 's people. The word Satan occurs only once in the Fourth Gospel, not in the Epistles, but often in Revelation. Mark never uses diabolov, Matthew never Satan. Paul seldom diabolov, often Satan. Satan alone in Pastorals. Luke uses both. It is clear that Paul here as elsewhere employs the word in a personal sense; but any attempt to base the doctrine of a personal devil on this and similar passages is unsafe. </p>
