Having suffered before [προπαθοντες] . N. T. o. Although we had suffered. Having been shamefully entreated [υβρισθεντες] . Comp. Matthew 22:32; Acts 14:5. This may have been added because propaqontev alone might denote the experience of something good; but it is more probably intended as an expansion and illustration of that word. Paul 's sensitiveness to personal indignity appears in the narrative in Acts 16:0, which gives the historical explanation of the two words. It appears frequently in 2nd Corinthians. As ye know [καθως οιδατε] . One of the many characteristic expressions of these Epistles which indicate community of experience and sentiment on the part of Paul and his readers.

En parrhsia in boldness, John 7:4; John 16:29; Ephesians 6:19; Philippians 1:20. Both the verb and the noun are found in LXX See Leviticus 26:13; Proverbs 10:10; Wisd. 5 1; 1 Macc. 4 18; Sir. 6 11. In our God [εν τω θεω ημων] . Const. with we waxed bold. Their boldness was not mere natural courage, but was inspired by God.

For the phrase see Mk. i. 14; Romans 1:1; Romans 14:16; 2 Corinthians 11:7; 1 Thessalonians 2:8, 1 Thessalonians 2:9; 1 Peter 4:17. It points to the monotheistic character of the gospel.
