<p>Exhortation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακλησις] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:24">Luke 6:24</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span>. Exhortation or counsel is Paul 's usual sense. </p>
<p>Of deceit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ πλανης] </span></span>. Better, of error. It may imply deceit as accompanying or causing error, but it does not occur in the sense of deceit. Our exhortation did not proceed from any false teaching which we had ourselves received. We were guided by " the spirit of truth "; See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:6">1 John 4:6</span>, and comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16">2 Peter 1:16</span>. </p>
<p>Of uncleanness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ ακαθαρσιας] </span></span>. " Akaqarsia in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:27">Matthew 23:27</span> of the corruption of the sepulchre. Elsewhere in N. T. of sensual impurity. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:24">Romans 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:21">2 Corinthians 12:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:19">Ephesians 4:19</span>. Here in the sense of impurity on the side of sordidness. 17 In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:19">Ephesians 4:19</span>, Paul speaks of working uncleanness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακαθαρσιαν</span></span>] in a spirit of selfish desire [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεονεξια</span></span>] which is the spirit of covetousness. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3">Ephesians 5:3</span>, uncleanness and covetousness are closely associated. Paul means that his exhortation did not proceed from greed for gain or lust for power. </p>
<p>In guile [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν δολω] </span></span>. While uncleanness expresses impure purpose or motive, guile has reference to improper means; plausible but insincere methods of winning converts; suppression of the truth; "huckstering the word of God" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span>); adulterating it for purposes of gain or popularity.</p>
