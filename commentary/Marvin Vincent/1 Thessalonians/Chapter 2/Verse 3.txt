Exhortation [παρακλησις] . See on Luke 6:24 and 1 Corinthians 14:3. Exhortation or counsel is Paul 's usual sense. Of deceit [εκ πλανης] . Better, of error. It may imply deceit as accompanying or causing error, but it does not occur in the sense of deceit. Our exhortation did not proceed from any false teaching which we had ourselves received. We were guided by " the spirit of truth "; See 1 John 4:6, and comp. 2 Peter 1:16. Of uncleanness [εξ ακαθαρσιας] . " Akaqarsia in Matthew 23:27 of the corruption of the sepulchre. Elsewhere in N. T. of sensual impurity. See Romans 1:24; 2 Corinthians 12:21; Ephesians 4:19. Here in the sense of impurity on the side of sordidness. 17 In Ephesians 4:19, Paul speaks of working uncleanness [ακαθαρσιαν] in a spirit of selfish desire [πλεονεξια] which is the spirit of covetousness. In Ephesians 5:3, uncleanness and covetousness are closely associated. Paul means that his exhortation did not proceed from greed for gain or lust for power. In guile [εν δολω] . While uncleanness expresses impure purpose or motive, guile has reference to improper means; plausible but insincere methods of winning converts; suppression of the truth; "huckstering the word of God" (see on 2 Corinthians 2:17); adulterating it for purposes of gain or popularity.
