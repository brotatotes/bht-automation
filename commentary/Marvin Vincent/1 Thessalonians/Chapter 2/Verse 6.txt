<p>When we might have been burdensome [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμενοι εν βαρει ειναι] </span></span>. Lit. being able to be in weight. The phrase ejn barei in weight is unique in N. T., and does not occur in LXX The better rendering here is to be in authority. Paul means that his position as an apostle would have warranted him in asserting authority or standing on his dignity, which he did not do. Barov weight, in the sense of influence, is found in late Greek. Paul 's Epistles were called weighty [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρειαι] </span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span> : others explain as referring to the apostolic right to exact pecuniary support. 18</p>
