With all his saints [μετα παντων των αγιων αυτου] . Saints is often explained as angels; but the meaning is the holy and glorified people of God. OiJ agioi is uniformly used of these in N. T. and never of angels unless joined with aggeloi. See Luke 9:26; Mark 8:38; Acts 10:22. It is doubtful if oiJ agioi is used of angels in LXX Zechariah 14:5, which is confidently cited as an instance, is quoted at the conclusion of the Didache (xvi. 7), clearly with the sense of glorified believers. %Agioi aggeloi appears Tob. 11 14; 12 15; Job 5:1. Angels has no connection with anything in this Epistle, but glorified believers is closely connected with the matter which was troubling the Thessalonians. See ch. 1 Thessalonians 4:13. This does not exclude the attendance of angels on the Lord 's coming (see Mark 8:38; Luke 9:26), but when Paul speaks of such attendance, as 2 Thessalonians 1:7, he says, with the angels [αγγελων] of his power.
