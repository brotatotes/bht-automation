<p>With all his saints [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα παντων των αγιων αυτου] </span></span>. Saints is often explained as angels; but the meaning is the holy and glorified people of God. OiJ agioi is uniformly used of these in N. T. and never of angels unless joined with aggeloi. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:26">Luke 9:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:38">Mark 8:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:22">Acts 10:22</span>. It is doubtful if oiJ agioi is used of angels in LXX <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:5">Zechariah 14:5</span>, which is confidently cited as an instance, is quoted at the conclusion of the Didache (xvi. 7), clearly with the sense of glorified believers. %Agioi aggeloi appears Tob. 11 14; 12 15; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+5:1">Job 5:1</span>. Angels has no connection with anything in this Epistle, but glorified believers is closely connected with the matter which was troubling the Thessalonians. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13">1 Thessalonians 4:13</span>. This does not exclude the attendance of angels on the Lord 's coming (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:38">Mark 8:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:26">Luke 9:26</span>), but when Paul speaks of such attendance, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:7">2 Thessalonians 1:7</span>, he says, with the angels [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγελων</span></span>] of his power. </p>
