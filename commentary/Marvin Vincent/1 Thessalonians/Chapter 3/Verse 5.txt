The tempter [ο πειραζων] . Only here and Matthew 4:3. LXX See on Matthew 6:13. In vain [εις κενον] . The phrase only in Paul. See 2 Corinthians 6:1; Galatians 2:2; Philippians 2:16. The force of the preposition is fairly represented by to in the phrase to no purpose. LXX has eijv kenon, eijv to kenon, and eijv kena.
