<p>Them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και ο θεος τους κοιμηθεντας δια του ιησου αξει συν αυτω] </span></span>. </p>
<p>(1) Which sleep should be, which have been laid asleep or have fallen asleep, giving the force of the passive. </p>
<p>(2) Dia tou Ihsou can by no possibility be rendered in Jesus, which would be ejn Ihsou : see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:18">1 Corinthians 14:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>. It must mean through or by means of Jesus. </p>
<p>(3) The attempt to construe dia tou Ihsou with touv koimhqentav those who have fallen asleep by means of Jesus, gives an awkward and forced interpretation. It has been explained by supposing a reference to martyrs who have died by Jesus; because of their faith in him. In that case we should expect the accusative, dia ton Ihsoun on account of or for the sake of Jesus. Moreover Paul is not accentuating that idea. Koimhqentav would be universally understood by the church as referring to the death of Christians, so that by Jesus would be superfluous. </p>
<p>(4) Dia tou Ihsou should be construed with axei will bring. Rend. the whole : them also that are fallen asleep will God through Jesus bring with him. Jesus is thus represented as the agent of the resurrection. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:21">1 Corinthians 14:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:28">John 5:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:39">John 6:39</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44">John 6:44</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:54">John 6:54</span>. Bring [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξει</span></span>] is used instead of ejgeirei shall raise up, because the thought of separation was prominent in the minds of the Thessalonians.</p>
