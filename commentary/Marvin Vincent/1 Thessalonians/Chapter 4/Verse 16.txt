<p>The word of the Lord, ver. 15, is apparently not intended to include the specific details which follow. In that word the revelation was to the effect that all believers simultaneously should share the blessings of the advent. The following description of the Lord 's descent from heaven is intended to emphasise the fact that the reunion of dead and living believers will be accomplished by the Lord in person [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος] </span></span>. %Oti does not indicate the contents of the word of the Lord (that, as A. V.), but means for or because; and the details are meant to strengthen the more general declaration of ver. 15. In the details themselves there are traces of certain O. T. theophanies, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:11-18">Exodus 19:11-18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mic+1:3">Micah 1:3</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mic+1:2">Micah 1:2</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mic+1:7">Micah 1:7</span> Shall descend from heaven. Used nowhere else of Christ 's second coming. Frequently in the Fourth Gospel, of Christ 's descent to earth as man. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span>; 1Th 6:33, 38, 41, etc. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:9">Ephesians 4:9</span>, of his descent by the Spirit in order to endow the church. </p>
<p>With a shout [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν κελευσματι] </span></span>. N. T. o. Once in LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+24:6">Proverbs 24:6</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+24:2">Proverbs 24:2</span> (English Bib 30:27). From keleuein to summon. Often in Class. Lit. a shout of command, as of a general to his army, an admiral to his oarsmen, or a charioteer to his horses. </p>
<p>Archangel [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχαγγελου] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:9">Jude 1:9</span>. Not in O. T. The Pauline angelology shows traces of Rabbinical teachings in the idea of orders of angels. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21">Ephesians 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:38">Romans 8:38</span>. The archangels appear in the apocryphal literature. In the Book of Enoch (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:14">Jude 1:14</span>) four are named, Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel. Michael is set over the tree which, at the time of the great judgment, will be given over to the righteous and humble, and from the fruit of which life will be given to the elect. In Tob. 12 15, Raphael appears as one of the seven holy angels. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+8:2">Revelation 8:2</span>.

<p>With the trump of God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν σαλπιγγι θεου] </span></span>. For the trumpet heralding great manifestations of God, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:13">Exodus 19:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:16">Exodus 19:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+47:5">Psalms 47:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+27:13">Isaiah 27:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:14">Zechariah 9:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zep+1:16">Zephaniah 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:1">Joel 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:52">1 Corinthians 14:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+1:10">Revelation 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1">Revelation 4:1</span>. Of God does not indicate the size or loudness of the trumpet, but merely that it is used in God 's service. Comp. harps of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+14:2">Revelation 14:2</span>; musical instruments of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ch+16:42">1 Chronicles 16:42</span>. The later Jews believed that God would use a trumpet to raise the dead.</p>
