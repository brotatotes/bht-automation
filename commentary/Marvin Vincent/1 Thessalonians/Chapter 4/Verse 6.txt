<p>That no man go beyond [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μη υπερβαινειν] </span></span>. Lit. the not going beyond. Dependent on this is the will of Glod, ver. 3. The verb N. T.. Often in LXX, mostly in the literal sense of overpassing limits. Also of overtaking, passing by, surpassing, as in wickedness or cruelty. It is an expansion of the preceding thought. Pursue your business as holy men : do not overreach or defraud. </p>
<p>It is the overstepping of the line between mine and thine. It is used absolutely, being defined by the succeeding clause. The A. V. is literal, go beyond. Rev. renders tranegress. Weizsacker and Bornemann "ubergreife overreach." So. Rev. margin. This last is the best. </p>
<p>Defraud [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεονεκτειν] </span></span>. P o. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:11">2 Corinthians 2:11</span>, and covetousness, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:29">Romans 1:29</span>. It emphasises gain as the motive of fraud. Three times in LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:4">Jude 1:4</span>:11; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:9">Habakkuk 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+22:27">Ezekiel 22:27</span>. Often in Class. </p>
<p>In any matter [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω πραγματι] </span></span>. Rev. correctly, in the matter. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:11">2 Corinthians 7:11</span>. The sense is the business in hand, whatever it be. The tw does not stand for tini any. For pragmati, matter, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:19">Matthew 18:19</span>. Those who connect this clause with the preceding, explain tw as the matter just mentioned - adultery. </p>
<p>Avenger [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκδικος] </span></span>. P o. Here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:4">Romans 13:4</span>. In LXX rarely, and in the same sense as here. In this sense it occurs only in late Greek. For the warning comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:6">Ephesians 5:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:6">Colossians 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:4">Romans 13:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:21">Galatians 5:21</span>.</p>
