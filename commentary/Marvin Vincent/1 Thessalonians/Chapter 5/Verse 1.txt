Times - seasons [χρονων - καιρων] . See on Acts 1:7. With special reference to the Lord 's coming. The plural is used because Paul is thinking of a number of incidents attending the preparation and accomplishment of the second advent, and occurring at different times. The collocation times and seasons only here and Acts 1:7. Kairov is the suitable time, cronov the time measured by duration. Hence kairov a juncture, an occasion, as Matthew 16:3. The distinction is so well marked that have the phrases cronou kairov the right moment of the time, and eukairov cronov the opportune moment. See Soph. Elec. 1292.
