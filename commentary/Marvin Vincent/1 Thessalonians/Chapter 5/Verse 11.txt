Comfort [παρακαλειτε] . Rev. renders exhort; but comfort suits better the general drift of the passage, and corresponds with ch. 4 18. There is some force in Bornemann's suggestion that the two meanings may be combined. Exhort each other to be of good heart. Edify [οικοδομειτε] . Lit. build up. See on Acts 20:32. The metaphorical sense habitually in Paul. See 1 Corinthians 8:1, 1 Corinthians 8:10; 1 Corinthians 10:23; 1 Corinthians 14:4; Ephesians 2:20. In O. T. mostly in the literal sense. See however LXX, Ruth 4:11; Psalms 27:5; Psalms 88:2; Jeremiah 31:4.
