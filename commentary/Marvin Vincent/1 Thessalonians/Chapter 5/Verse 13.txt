<p>Esteem [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγεισθαι] </span></span>. Primarily to lead, which is the only sense in the Gospels and Acts, except <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:2">Acts 26:2</span>, in a speech of Paul. To lead the mind through a reasoning process to a conclusion, and so to think, to estimate. Only in this sense by Paul, Peter, and James. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:5">2 Corinthians 9:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:3">Philippians 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2">James 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:9">2 Peter 3:9</span>. In both senses in Hebrews. See 1Th 10:29; 1Th 13:7. </p>
<p>Very highly in love. Const. very highly with esteem. In love qualifies both words. 31 For their work 's sake [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια το εργον αυτων] </span></span>. Their esteem for their superintendents is not to rest only on personal attachment or respect for their position, but on intelligent and sympathetic appreciation of their work. It is a good and much - needed lesson for the modern congregation no less than for the Thessalonian church.</p>
