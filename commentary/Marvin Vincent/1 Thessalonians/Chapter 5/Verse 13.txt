Esteem [ηγεισθαι] . Primarily to lead, which is the only sense in the Gospels and Acts, except Acts 26:2, in a speech of Paul. To lead the mind through a reasoning process to a conclusion, and so to think, to estimate. Only in this sense by Paul, Peter, and James. See 2 Corinthians 9:5; Philippians 2:3; James 1:2; 2 Peter 3:9. In both senses in Hebrews. See 1Th 10:29; 1Th 13:7. Very highly in love. Const. very highly with esteem. In love qualifies both words. 31 For their work 's sake [δια το εργον αυτων] . Their esteem for their superintendents is not to rest only on personal attachment or respect for their position, but on intelligent and sympathetic appreciation of their work. It is a good and much - needed lesson for the modern congregation no less than for the Thessalonian church.
