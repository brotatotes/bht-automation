<p>That which is good [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το αγαθον] </span></span>. Not to be limited to profitable, beneficent (as Lightfoot, Lunemann), although ajgaqov commonly includes a corresponding beneficent relation of its subject to another subject, which is emphasized here by to all men. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:7">Romans 5:7</span>. It may also include what is absolutely, morally good, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:10">Romans 2:10</span>. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:21">Hebrews 13:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:11">1 Peter 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:18">Romans 7:18</span>.</p>
