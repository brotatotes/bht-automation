That which is good [το αγαθον] . Not to be limited to profitable, beneficent (as Lightfoot, Lunemann), although ajgaqov commonly includes a corresponding beneficent relation of its subject to another subject, which is emphasized here by to all men. See on Romans 5:7. It may also include what is absolutely, morally good, as Romans 2:10. So Hebrews 13:21; 1 Peter 3:11; Romans 7:18.
