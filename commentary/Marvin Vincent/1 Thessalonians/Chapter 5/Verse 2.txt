<p>The day of the Lord [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερα κυριου] </span></span>. The day of Christ 's second coming. In Paul 's Epistles this is expressed by hJ hJmera the day, absolutely, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:4">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:13">1 Corinthians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:12">Romans 13:12</span> : hJ hJmera ejkeinh that day, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:10">2 Thessalonians 1:10</span> : hJmera cristou the day of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:10">Philippians 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:16">Philippians 2:16</span> : hJmera kuriou or tou kuriou day of the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:2">1 Thessalonians 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span> : hJmera tou kuriou hJmwn Ihsou [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χριστου] </span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:8">1 Corinthians 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:14">2 Corinthians 1:14</span>. These expressions refer to a definite time when the Lord is expected to appear, and Paul expects this appearance soon. Attempts to evade this by referring such expressions to the day of death, or to the advance toward perfection after death until the final judgment, are forced, and are shaped by dogmatic conceptions of the nature of Biblical inspiration. 30 In the O. T. the phrase day of the Lord denotes a time in which God will conspicously manifest his power and goodness or his penal justice. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:12">Isaiah 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+13:5">Ezekiel 13:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joe+1:15">Joel 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:11">Joel 2:11</span>; and comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:5">Romans 2:5</span>. The whole class of phrases is rare in N. T. outside of Paul 's Epistles. As a thief [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως κλεπτης] </span></span>.

<p>In the night [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν νυκιτι] </span></span>. The ancient church held that the advent was to be expected at night, on an Easter eve. This gave rise to the custom of vigils. Jerome, on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:6">Matthew 25:6</span>, says : "It is a tradition of the Jews that Messiah will come at midnight, after the likeness of that season in Egypt when the Passover was celebrated, and the Destroyer came, and the Lord passed over the dwellings. I think that this idea was perpetuated in the apostolic custom, that, on the day of vigils, at the Pascha, it was not alloxved to dismiss the people before midnight, since they expected the advent of Christ." </p>
<p>It is noteworthy how many of the gospel lessons on watchfulness are associated with the night and a visit by night.
