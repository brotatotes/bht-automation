<p>Prophesyings [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητειας] </span></span>. The emphasis on prophesyings corresponds with that in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:1-5">1 Corinthians 14:1-5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:22">1 Corinthians 14:22</span> ff. Prophecy in the apostolic church was directly inspired instruction, exhortation, or warning. The prophet received the truth into his own spirit which was withdrawn from earthly things and concentrated upon the spiritual world. His higher, spiritual part [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα] </span></span>, and his moral intelligence [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νους] </span></span>, and his speech [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος</span></span>] worked in harmony. His spirit received a spiritual truth in symbol : his understanding interpreted it in its application to actual events, and his speech uttered the interpretation. He was not ecstatically rapt out of the sphere of human intelligence, although his understanding was intensified and clarified by the phenomenal action of the Spirit upon it. This double action imparted a peculiarly elevated character to his speech. The prophetic influence was thus distinguished from the mystical ecstasy, the ecstasy of Paul when rapt into the third heaven, which affected the subject alone and was incommunicable (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:1-4">2 Corinthians 12:1-4</span>). The gift of tongues carried the subject out of the prophetic condition in which spirit, understanding, and speech operated in concert, and into a condition in which the understanding was overpowered by the communication to the spirit, so that the spirit could not find its natural expression in rational speech, or speech begotten of the understanding, and found supernatural expression in a tongue created by the Spirit. Paul attached great value to prophecy. He places prophets next after apostles in the list of those whom God has set in the Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>). He associates apostles and prophets as the foundation of the Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>). He assigns to prophecy the precedence among spiritual gifts (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:1-5">1 Corinthians 14:1-5</span>), and urges his readers to desire the gift (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:1">1 Corinthians 14:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:39">1 Corinthians 14:39</span>). Hence his exhortation here.</p>
