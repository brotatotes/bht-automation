Prove all things [παντα δοκιμαζετε] . A general exhortation, not confined to prophesyings; but Paul elsewhere insists that a test be applied to phenomena which claim to be supernatural. See on discerning of spirits, 1 Corinthians 12:10; 1 Corinthians 14:29, and comp. 2 Thessalonians 2:2, and 1 John 4:1-3. For dokimazete prove, see on 1 Peter 1:7. In LXX, Proverbs 27:21; Psalms 11:6, dokimion is a crucible or furnace. Hold fast that which is good [το καλον κατεχετ] . These words are associated in early Christian writers with an apocryphal saying ascribed to Jesus, and very frequently quoted, ginesqe de dokimoi trapezitai show yourselves approved money - changers. By some ancient writers the two are cited together as Paul 's; by others they are distinguished, as by Origen, who cites the saying as an injunction [εντολην] of Jesus, and adds, "and also (observing) the teaching of Paul, who says, 'prove all things, hold fast the good, abstain from every form of evil. '" The saying about the money - changers is probably a genuine logion of the Lord. Some have thought that the words added by Clement of Alexandria, "rejecting some things but holding fast the good," formed part of the Lord 's saying, and that, accordingly, Paul 's words here depend on an original utterance of Jesus. If this could be proved, eidov form, ver. 22, might be explained as a figure of exchangers distinguishing between genuine and false coins. 32
