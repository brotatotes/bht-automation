Appearance [ειδους] . As commonly explained, abstain from everything that even looks like evil. But the word signifies form or kind. Comp. Luke 3:22; John 5:37, and see nearly the same phrase in Joseph. Ant 10:3, 1. It never has the sense of semblance. Moreover, it is impossible to abstain from everything that looks like evil. Of evil [πονηρου] . To be taken as a noun; not as an adjective agreeing with eidouv form (from every evil form). The meaning of ponhrov in N. T. cannot be limited to active evil, mischief, though it often has that sense. The same is true in LXX, where it sometimes means grudying or niggardly. See Sir. 14 4, 5; 34 23.
