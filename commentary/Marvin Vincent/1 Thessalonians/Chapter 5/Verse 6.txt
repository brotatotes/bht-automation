<p>Others [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οι λοιποι] </span></span>. The rest, as ch. 4 13. </p>
<p>Let us watch [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γρηγορωμεν] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:35">Mark 13:35</span>, and comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:14">Ephesians 5:14</span>. </p>
<p>Be sober [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νηφωμεν] </span></span>. Primarily in a physical sense, as opposed to excess in drink, but passing into the ethical sense of calm, collected, circumspect. Alert wakefulness and calm assurance will prevent their being surprised and confused by the Lord 's coming, as by a thief in the night.</p>
