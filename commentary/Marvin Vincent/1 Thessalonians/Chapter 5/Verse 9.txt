For [οτι] . Special emphasis is laid on the hope of salvation. The exhortation to put it on is enforced by the fact that God 's appointment is to salvation and not to wrath. To obtain [εις περιποιησιν] . More literally, unto the obtaining. See on Ephesians 1:14. In three out of five instances in N. T. the word clearly means acquiring or obtaining. In Ephesians 1:14 and 1 Peter 2:9, it is sometimes rendered possession (so Rev.). But in Ephesians the meaning is redemption or acquisition, or redemption which will give possession; and in 1st Peter a people for acquisition. The meaning here is that we might obtain. Comp. LXX, Malachi 3:17.
