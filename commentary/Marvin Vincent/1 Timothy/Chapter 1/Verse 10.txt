Them that defile themselves with mankind [αρσενοκοιταις] . Only here and 1 Corinthians 6:9. o LXX, o Class. Menstealers [ανδραποδισταις] . N. T. o. Once in LXX Ellicott remarks that this is a repulsive and exaggerated violation of the eighth commandment, as ajrsenokoitein is of the seventh. The penalty of death is attached to it, Exodus 21:16. Perjured persons [επιορκοις] . N. T. o. Once in LXX, Zechariah 5:3. See Leviticus 19:12. Is contrary to [αντικειται] . Lit. Lies opposite to. Used by Paul and Luke. See Luke 13:17; Galatians 5:17. The sound doctrine [τη υγιαινουση διδασκαλια] . A phrase peculiar to the Pastorals. Ugiainein to be in good health, Luke 5:31; Luke 7:10; Luke 3:0 James 1 Timothy 1:0:2o P. Quite frequent in LXX, and invariably in the literal sense. Often in salutations or dismissals. See 2 Macc 110; 9 19; 2 Samuel 14:8; Exodus 4:18. In the Pastorals, the verb, which occurs eight times, is six times associated with didaskalia teaching, or logoi words, and twice with ejn th pistei or th pistei in the faith. The sound teaching (comp. didach teaching, 2 Timothy 4:2; Titus 1:9) which is thus commended is Paul 's, who teaches in Christ 's name and by his authority (2 Timothy 1:13; 2 Timothy 2:2, 2 Timothy 2:8). In all the three letters it is called ajlh. qeia or hJ ajlhqeia the truth, the knowledge [επιγνωσις] of which is bound up with salvation. See 1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Timothy 2:25; 2 Timothy 3:7; Titus 1:1. As truth it is sound or healthful. It is the object of faith. To be sound in the faith is, practically, to follow [παρακολουθειν] sound teaching or the truth. The subjective characteristic of Christians is eujsebeia or qeosebeia godliness or piety 1 Timothy 2:2, 1 Timothy 2:10; 1 Timothy 3:16; 1 Timothy 4:7, 1 Timothy 4:8; 1 Timothy 6:6, 1 Timothy 6:11); and the teaching and knowledge of the truth are represented as kat' eujsebeian according to godliness 1 Timothy 6:3; Titus 1:1). Comp. eujsebein to show piety, 1 Timothy 5:4. eujsebwv zhn to live godly, 2 Timothy 3:12; Titus 2:12; and bion diagein ejn pash eujsebeia to lead a life in all godliness, 1 Timothy 2:2. The contents of this sound teaching which is according to godliness are not theoretical or dogmatic truth, but Christian ethics, with faith and love. See 1 Timothy 1:14; 1 Timothy 2:15; 1 Timothy 4:12; 1 Timothy 6:11; 2 Timothy 1:13; 2 Timothy 3:10; Titus 2:2. Alhqeia truth is used of moral things, rather than in the high religious sense of Paul. Comp., for instance, Romans 3:7; Romans 9:1; 1 Corinthians 5:8; 2 Corinthians 4:2; 2 Corinthians 11:10; Galatians 2:5; Ephesians 4:21, Ephesians 4:24; and 2 Timothy 2:25, 2 Timothy 2:26; 2 Timothy 3:7 (comp. 2Ti 5:1 - xciv. 3, 4; Titus 1:12 (comp. Tit 5:11, 15); Titus 2:4 (comp. 5 1, 3); Titus 3:1. Whoever grasps the truth has faith 2 Timothy 1:13; 2 Timothy 2:18; 2 Timothy 3:8; Titus 1:3 f.). That the ethical character of faith is emphasized, appears from the numerous expressions regarding the false teachers, as 1 Timothy 1:19; 1 Timothy 4:1; 1 Timothy 5:8, 1 Timothy 5:12; 1 Timothy 6:10, 1 Timothy 6:21. There is a tendency to objectify faith, regarding it as something believed rather than as the act of believing. See 1 Timothy 1:19; 1 Timothy 4:1; 1 Timothy 6:10, 1 Timothy 6:21; Titus 1:4. In comparing the ideal of righteousness ver. 9) with that of Paul, note that it is not denied that Christ is the source of true righteousness; but according to Paul, the man who is not under the law is the man who lives by faith in Christ. Paul emphasizes this. It is faith in Christ which sets one free from the law. Here, the man for whom the law is not made (ver. 9) is the man who is ethically conformed to the norm of sound teaching. The two conceptions do not exclude each other : the sound teaching is according to the gospel (ver. 11), but the point of emphasis is shifted.
