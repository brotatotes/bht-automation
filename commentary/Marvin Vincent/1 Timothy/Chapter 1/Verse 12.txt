Putting [θεμενος] . Better appointing. The participle defines counted me faithful. He counted me faithful in that he appointed, etc. Into the ministry [εις διακονιαν] . Better, appointing me to his service. The conventional phrase "the ministry" gives a wrong impression. The term is general, covering every mode of service, either to God or to men.
