Blasphemer - persecutor - injurious [βλασφημον - διωκτην - υβριστην] . Neither blasfhmov nor diwkthv is used by Paul. Blasfhmov in Acts 7:11; 2 Peter 2:11; diwkthv N. T. o.; uJbristhv in Romans 1:30 only; often in LXX See on blasphemym Mark 7:22, and comp. 1 Corinthians 10:30. Ubristhv is one whose insolence and contempt of others break forth in wanton and outrageous acts. Paul was uJbristhv when he persecuted the church. He was uJbrisqeiv shamefully entreated at philippi (1 Thessalonians 2:2). Christ prophesies that the Son of man shall be shamefully entreted (uJbrisqhsetai, Luke 18:32). Similar regretful references of paul to his former career appear in Acts 22:4; Galatians 1:13, Galatians 1:23. Such a passage may have occurred in some Pauline letters to which this writer had access, or it may be an imitation. I obtained mercy [ηλεηθην] . Comp. Ver. 16. In speaking of his conversin, Paul uses cariv grace. See ver. 14, and the apostleship he speaks of himself as one who has obtained mercy [ηλεημενος] of the Lord to be faithful. 1 Corinthians 7:25; comp. 2 Corinthians 4:1.
