<p>Blasphemer - persecutor - injurious [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλασφημον - διωκτην - υβριστην] </span></span>. Neither blasfhmov nor diwkthv is used by Paul. Blasfhmov in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:11">Acts 7:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:11">2 Peter 2:11</span>; diwkthv N. T. o.; uJbristhv in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:30">Romans 1:30</span> only; often in LXX See on blasphemym <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:22">Mark 7:22</span>, and comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:30">1 Corinthians 10:30</span>. Ubristhv is one whose insolence and contempt of others break forth in wanton and outrageous acts. Paul was uJbristhv when he persecuted the church. He was uJbrisqeiv shamefully entreated at philippi (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span>). Christ prophesies that the Son of man shall be shamefully entreted (uJbrisqhsetai, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:32">Luke 18:32</span>). Similar regretful references of paul to his former career appear in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:4">Acts 22:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:13">Galatians 1:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:23">Galatians 1:23</span>. Such a passage may have occurred in some Pauline letters to which this writer had access, or it may be an imitation. I obtained mercy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλεηθην] </span></span>. Comp. Ver. 16. In speaking of his conversin, Paul uses cariv grace. See ver. 14, and the apostleship he speaks of himself as one who has obtained mercy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλεημενος</span></span>] of the Lord to be faithful. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:25">1 Corinthians 7:25</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:1">2 Corinthians 4:1</span>.</p>
