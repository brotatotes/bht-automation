<p>First [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτω</span></span>] Not the chief sinner, but the representative instance of God 's longsuffering applied to a high - handed transgressor. It is explained by pattern. </p>
<p>All longsuffering [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την απασαν μακροθυμιαν] </span></span>. More correctly, "all his longsuffering." The A. V. misses the possessive force of the article. For longsuffering see on be patient, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:7">James 5:7</span>. The form apav occurs as an undisputed reading only once in Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span>, and not there as an adjective. Often in Acts and Luke. This use of the article with the adjective pav or apav is without parallel in Paul. </p>
<p>Pattern [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτυπωσιν] </span></span>. Or, ensample. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:13">2 Timothy 1:13</span>. o LXX o Class. An example of the writer's fondness for high - sounding compounds. Paul uses tupov. </p>
<p>To them. The A. V. conveys the sense more clearly than Rev. "Of them," which is ambiguous. The genitive has a possessive sense. He would be their ensample, or an ensample for their benefit. </p>
<p>Believe [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευ. ειν] </span></span>. This verb, so frequent in Paul, occurs six times in the pastorals. In two instances, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:11">1 Timothy 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:3">Titus 1:3</span>, it is passive, in the sense of to be intrusted with. Here in the Pauline sense of believing on Christ. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>, passive, of Christ believe d on in the world. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span>, of God the Father, in whom the writer confides to keep the trust committed to him. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:8">Titus 3:8</span>, of belief in God. With ejpi upon and the dative, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:11">Romans 10:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:6">1 Peter 2:6</span> (all citations), and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:18">Romans 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:25">Luke 24:25</span>. </p>
<p>Unto life everlasting [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ζωην αιωνιον] </span></span>. Better, eternal life. See additional not on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:9">2 Thessalonians 1:9</span>. The conception of life eternal is not limited to the future life (as von Soden). Godliness has promise of the life which now is, as well as of that which is to come (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:8">1 Timothy 4:8</span>). The promise of eteral life (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:1">2 Timothy 1:1</span>) and the words who brought life and immortality to light through the gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:10">2 Timothy 1:10</span>) may fairly be taken to cover the present life.</p>
