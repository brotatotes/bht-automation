First [πρωτω] Not the chief sinner, but the representative instance of God 's longsuffering applied to a high - handed transgressor. It is explained by pattern. All longsuffering [την απασαν μακροθυμιαν] . More correctly, "all his longsuffering." The A. V. misses the possessive force of the article. For longsuffering see on be patient, James 5:7. The form apav occurs as an undisputed reading only once in Paul, Ephesians 6:13, and not there as an adjective. Often in Acts and Luke. This use of the article with the adjective pav or apav is without parallel in Paul. Pattern [υποτυπωσιν] . Or, ensample. Only here and 2 Timothy 1:13. o LXX o Class. An example of the writer's fondness for high - sounding compounds. Paul uses tupov. To them. The A. V. conveys the sense more clearly than Rev. "Of them," which is ambiguous. The genitive has a possessive sense. He would be their ensample, or an ensample for their benefit. Believe [πιστευ. ειν] . This verb, so frequent in Paul, occurs six times in the pastorals. In two instances, 1 Timothy 1:11; Titus 1:3, it is passive, in the sense of to be intrusted with. Here in the Pauline sense of believing on Christ. In 1 Timothy 3:16, passive, of Christ believe d on in the world. In 2 Timothy 1:12, of God the Father, in whom the writer confides to keep the trust committed to him. In Titus 3:8, of belief in God. With ejpi upon and the dative, Romans 9:33; Romans 10:11; 1 Peter 2:6 (all citations), and Romans 4:18; Luke 24:25. Unto life everlasting [εις ζωην αιωνιον] . Better, eternal life. See additional not on 2 Thessalonians 1:9. The conception of life eternal is not limited to the future life (as von Soden). Godliness has promise of the life which now is, as well as of that which is to come (1 Timothy 4:8). The promise of eteral life (2 Timothy 1:1) and the words who brought life and immortality to light through the gospel (2 Timothy 1:10) may fairly be taken to cover the present life.
