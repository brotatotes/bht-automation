<p>This charge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτην την παραγγελιαν] </span></span>. See on ver. T It refers to what follows, that thou might'st war, etc. </p>
<p>I commit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρατιθεμαι] </span></span>. The verb in the active voice means to place beside. In the middle, to deposit or intrust. Only once in Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:27">1 Corinthians 10:27</span>. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:19">1 Peter 4:19</span>. </p>
<p>According to the prophecies which went before on thee [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα τας προαγουσας επι σε προφητειας] </span></span>. Const, according to with I commit : which went before is to be taken absolutely, and not with on thee : const. prophecies with on these. On thee means concerning thee. The sense of the whole passage is : "I commit this charge unto thee in accordance with prophetic intimations which I formerly received concerning thee." Prophecy is ranked among the foremost of the special spiritual endowments enumerated by Paul. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:6">Romans 12:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:10">1 Corinthians 12:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:2">1 Corinthians 13:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:8">1 Corinthians 13:8</span>; xiv. 6, 2<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>, prophets come next after apostles in the list of those whom God has appointed in the church. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>, believers, Jew and Gentile, are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. According to <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>, prophecy has previously designated Timothy as the recipient of a special spiritual gift; and the prophecies in our passage are the single expressions or detailed contents of the prophecy mentioned there. Proagein to go before is not used by Paul. In the Pastorals and Heb. it appears only as an intransitive verb, and so in the only instance in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:39">Luke 18:39</span>. In Acts always transitive, to bring forth. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:6">Acts 12:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:30">Acts 16:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:26">Acts 25:26</span>. That by them [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα εν αυταις] </span></span>. %Ina that denoting the purport of the charge. By them [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν] </span></span>, lit. in them; in their sphere, or, possibly, in the power of these. </p>
<p>Thou mightiest war a good warfare [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατευη - την καλην στρατειαν] </span></span>. More correctly, the good warfare. Strateia war - fare once by Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:4">2 Corinthians 10:4</span>. Not flight [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαχην] </span></span>, but covering all the particulars of a soldier 's service.</p>
