<p>Holding [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχων] </span></span>. Not merely having, but holding fast, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:13">2 Timothy 1:13</span>. </p>
<p>Faith and a good conscience [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστιν και αγαθην συνειδησιν] </span></span>. The phrase good conscience is not in Paul, although suneidhsiv is a Pauline word. The phrase appears once in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:1">Acts 23:1</span>), and twice in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:16">1 Peter 2:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:21">1 Peter 2:21</span>). In Hebrews evil [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονηρας</span></span>] conscience and fair [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλην</span></span>] conscience; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:22">Acts 10:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:18">Acts 13:18</span>. The combination faith and good conscience is peculiar to the Pastorals. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:9">1 Timothy 3:9</span>. </p>
<p>Which [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην] </span></span>. Referring to God conscience. </p>
<p>Having put away [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απωσαμενοι] </span></span>. The A. V. is not strong enough. Better, having thrust from them. It implies willful violence against conscience. Twice in Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:1">Romans 11:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:2">Romans 11:2</span>, and three times in Acts. </p>
<p>Concerning faith have made shipwreck [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περι την πιστιν εναυαγησαν] </span></span>. Better, "concerning the faith made shipwreck." For a similar use of peri concerning, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:25">Acts 19:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:40">Luke 10:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:21">1 Timothy 6:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:18">2 Timothy 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:8">2 Timothy 3:8</span>. It is noteworthy that peri with the accusative occurs only once in Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:23">Philippians 2:23</span>). Nauagein to make shipwreck only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:25">2 Corinthians 11:25</span>. Nautical metaphors are rare in Paul 's writings.</p>
