<p>I exhort [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλω] </span></span>. See on consolation, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:24">Luke 6:24</span>. </p>
<p>First of all [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτον παντων] </span></span>. Connect with I exhort. The only instance of this phrase in N. T. </p>
<p>Supplications be made [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεισθαι δεησεις] </span></span>. The phrase occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:33">Luke 5:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:4">Philippians 1:4</span>. o LXX o Class. Dehsiv is petitionary prayer. Proseuch prayer is limited to prayer to God, while dehsiv may be addressed to men. The two are associated, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:5">1 Timothy 5:5</span> : the inverse order, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:18">Ephesians 6:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:6">Philippians 4:6</span>. </p>
<p>Intercessions [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευντευξεις] </span></span>. Only here and ch. 4 5. LXX, 2 Macc. 4 8. The verb ejntugcanein, commonly rendered to make intercession, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:27">Romans 8:27</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:34">Romans 8:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:2">Romans 11:2</span>; and uJperentugcanein to intercede in behalf of, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</span>. The verb signifies to fall in with a person; to draw near so as to converse familiarly. Hence, enteuxiv is not properly intercession in the accepted sense of that term, but rather approach to God in free and familiar prayer. Entugcanein in the passages cited is not to make intercession, but to intervene, interfere. Thus in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</span>, it is not that the Spirit pleads in our behalf, but that he throws himself into our case; takes part in it. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:25">Hebrews 8:25</span> : not that Jesus is ever interceding for us, but that he is eternally meeting us at every point, and intervening in al our affairs for our benefit. In ejnteuxeiv here the idea of interposition is prominent : making prayers a factor in relations with secular rulers.</p>
