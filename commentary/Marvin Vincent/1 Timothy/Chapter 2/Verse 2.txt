<p>That are in authority [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των εν υπεροχη οντων] </span></span>. Uperoch authority only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1">1 Corinthians 2:1</span>. Several times in LXX Originally, projection, prominence : metaphorically, preeminence, superiority. In Byzantine Greek, a little like our Excellency. This very phrase is found in an inscription of the early Roman period, after 133 B. 100, at Pergamum. Paul has the phrase ejx ousiai uJperecousai higher powers, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:1">Romans 13:1</span>; and oiJ uJperecontev those in high places is found Wisd. 6 5. </p>

<p>Quiet and peaceable [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρεμον και ησυχιον] </span></span>. Hremov, N. T. o. In class. Only the adverb hjrema quietly. Hsuciov tranquil, o P. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:4">1 Peter 3:4</span>. In LXX once, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:2">Isaiah 66:2</span>. Hremov denotes quiet arising fro the absence of outward disturbance : hJouciov tranquillity arising from within. Thus, ajnhr hJsuciov is the composed, discreet, self - contained man, who keeps himself from rash doing : hremov ajnhr is he who is withdrawn from outward disturbances. Hence, hremov here may imply keeping aloof from political agitation's and freedom from persecutions. </p>
<p>Honesty [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεμνοτητι] </span></span>. Better, gravity. Honesty, according to the modern acceptation, is an unfortunate rendering. In earlier English it signified becoming department, decency, decorum. So Shakespeare : "He is of a noble strain, of approved valor and confirmed honesty" (Much Ado, 21). This noun and the kindred adjective semnov only in the Pastorals, except <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:8">Philippians 4:8</span>. The adjective signifies reverend or venerable; exhibiting a dignity which arises from moral elevation, and thus invites reverence. In LXX it is used to characterize the name of God (2 Macc. 6 28); the words of wisdom (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+8:6">Proverbs 8:6</span>); the words of the pure (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+15:26">Proverbs 15:26</span>). Godliness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευσεβεια</span></span>] see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span>, and sound doctrine, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:10">1 Timothy 1:10</span>. o P.
