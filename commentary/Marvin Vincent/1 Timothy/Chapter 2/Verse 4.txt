<p>Who will have all men to be saved [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος παντας ανθρωπους θελει σωθηναι] </span></span>. Lit, who willeth all men, etc. As who, or seeing that he, giving the ground of the previous statement. Prayer to God for all is acceptable to him, because he wills the salvation of all. Thelei willeth, marking a determinate purpose. </p>
<p>Come to the knowledge of the truth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις επιγνωσιν αληθειας ελθειν] </span></span>. The phrase only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:7">2 Timothy 3:7</span>. Epignwsiv is a favorite Pauline word. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20">Romans 3:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:9">Colossians 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:4">1 Timothy 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:3">1 Timothy 4:3</span>. It signifies advanced or full knowledge. The difference between the simple gnwsiv and the compound word is illustrated in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21">Romans 1:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:28">Romans 1:28</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span>. In N. T. always of the knowledge of things ethical or divine, and never ascribed to God. For ajlh. qeia truth, see on sound doctrine, ch. 1 10. It appears 14 times in the Pastorals, and always without a defining genitive. So, often in Paul, but several times with a defining genitive, as truth of God, of Christ, of the gospel. The logical relation in the writer's mind between salvation and the knowledge of the truth is not quite clear. Knowledge of the truth may be regarded as the means of salvation, or it may be the ideal goal of the whole saving work. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:8">Philippians 3:8</span>; Jas 17:3. The latter is more in accord with the general drift of teaching in these Epistles.</p>
