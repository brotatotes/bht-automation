<p>To be testified in due time [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μαρτυριον καιροις ιδιοις] </span></span>. Lit. (gave himself a ransom) the testimony in its own times. That is, the gift of Christ as a ransom was to be the substance or import of the testimony which was to be set forth in its proper seasons. Thus marturion testimony is in apposition with the whole preceding sentence, and not with ransom only. Marturion is used sometimes simply as witness or testimony (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:4">Matthew 8:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:11">Mark 6:11</span>) : sometimes specially of the proclamation of the gospel, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:14">Matthew 24:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:33">Acts 4:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:10">1 Thessalonians 1:10</span>.
