Who gave himself [ο δους εαυτον] . The phrase with the simple verb only here, Galatians 1:4, and Titus 2:14. Paul uses the compound verb paradidonai, Galatians 2:20; Ephesians 5:2, Ephesians 5:25. Comp. Romans 8:32. Ransom [αντιλυτρον] . N. T. o. o LXX o Class. Lutron ransom, Matthew 20:28; Mark 10:45, applied to Christ 's life given for many. But neither this nor any of its kindred words is used by Paul. He uses ajpolutrwsiv, but that means the act not the means of redemption. For all [υπερ] . Uper does not mean instead of [αντι] . See on Romans 5:6. Any idea of exchange or substitution which may be implied, resides in ajntilutron; but it is pressing that unique word too far to find in it the announcement of a substitutional atonement. To be testified in due time [το μαρτυριον καιροις ιδιοις] . Lit. (gave himself a ransom) the testimony in its own times. That is, the gift of Christ as a ransom was to be the substance or import of the testimony which was to be set forth in its proper seasons. Thus marturion testimony is in apposition with the whole preceding sentence, and not with ransom only. Marturion is used sometimes simply as witness or testimony (Matthew 8:4; Mark 6:11) : sometimes specially of the proclamation of the gospel, as Matthew 24:14; Acts 4:33; 1 Thessalonians 1:10. The apostles are said, marturein to bear witness, as eye or ear witnesses of the sayings, deeds, and sufferings of Jesus (1 Corinthians 14:15). In 1 Corinthians 1:6, marturion tou Cristou is practically = the gospel. In 2 Thessalonians 1:10, to marturion hJmwn ejf' uJmav our testimony among you is our public attestation of the truth of the gospel. The idea of witness is a favorite one with John. See John 1:7. The exact phrase kairoiv ijdioiv in its own times, only in the Pastorals, here, ch. 6 15; Titus 1:3. In Galatians 6:9 kairw ijdiw in due time. Comp. Galatians 4:4.
