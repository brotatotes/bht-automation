I am ordained [ετεθην εγω] . Better, Iwas appointed. See on. John 14:16. A preacher [κηρυξ] . Lit. a herald. See on 2 Peter 2:5. Paul does not use the noun, but the kindred verb khrussein to proclaim or preach is very common in his writings. See Romans 10:8; 1 Corinthians 1:23; 2 Corinthians 4:5; Philippians 1:15, etc. I speak the truth in Christ and lie not. Omit in Christ. A strange asseveration to an intimate and trusted friend. Apparently an imitation of Romans 9:1. A teacher of the Gentiles [διδασκαλος εθνων] . Paul does not use this phrase. He expressly distinguishes between teacher and apostle. See 1 Corinthians 12:28; Ephesians 4:11. He calls himself ejqnwn ajpostolov apostle of the Gentiles (Romans 11:13); leitourgov Cristou Ihsou eijv ta eqnh minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles (Romans 14:16); and desmiov tou Cristou Ihsou uJper uJmwn twn ejqnwn prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles (Ephesians 3:1). In faith and verity [εν πιστει και αληθεια] . Or faith and truth. The combination only here. Paul has sincerity and truth (1 Corinthians 5:8), and sanctification of the Spirit and faith of the truth (2 Thessalonians 2:13). The phrase must not be explained in true faith, nor faithfully and truly. It means that faith and truth are the element or sphere in which the apostolic function is discharged : that he preaches with a sincere faith in the gospel, and with a truthful representation of the gospel which he believes.
