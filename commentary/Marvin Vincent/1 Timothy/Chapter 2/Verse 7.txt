<p>I am ordained [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετεθην εγω] </span></span>. Better, Iwas appointed. See on. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16">John 14:16</span>. </p>
<p>A preacher [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυξ] </span></span>. Lit. a herald. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span>. Paul does not use the noun, but the kindred verb khrussein to proclaim or preach is very common in his writings. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:8">Romans 10:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:23">1 Corinthians 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:5">2 Corinthians 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:15">Philippians 1:15</span>, etc. </p>
<p>I speak the truth in Christ and lie not. Omit in Christ. A strange asseveration to an intimate and trusted friend. Apparently an imitation of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:1">Romans 9:1</span>. </p>
<p>A teacher of the Gentiles [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκαλος εθνων] </span></span>. Paul does not use this phrase. He expressly distinguishes between teacher and apostle. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>. He calls himself ejqnwn ajpostolov apostle of the Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:13">Romans 11:13</span>); leitourgov Cristou Ihsou eijv ta eqnh minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:16">Romans 14:16</span>); and desmiov tou Cristou Ihsou uJper uJmwn twn ejqnwn prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span>). </p>
<p>In faith and verity [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πιστει και αληθεια] </span></span>. Or faith and truth. The combination only here. Paul has sincerity and truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:8">1 Corinthians 5:8</span>), and sanctification of the Spirit and faith of the truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span>). The phrase must not be explained in true faith, nor faithfully and truly. It means that faith and truth are the element or sphere in which the apostolic function is discharged : that he preaches with a sincere faith in the gospel, and with a truthful representation of the gospel which he believes.</p>
