<p>I will [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλομαι] </span></span>. Better, I desire. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:9">Matthew 1:9</span>, and comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:12">Philippians 1:12</span>. Paul 's word is qelw I will. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:19">Romans 16:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:32">1 Corinthians 7:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:20">1 Corinthians 10:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:5">1 Corinthians 14:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:19">1 Corinthians 14:19</span>, etc. </p>
<p>Everywhere [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν παντι τοπω] </span></span>. Lit. in every place. Wherever Christian congregations assemble. Not every place indiscriminately. </p>
<p>Lifting up holy hands [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαιροντας οσιους χειρας] </span></span>. The phrase is unique in N. T. o LXX Among Orientals the lifting up of the hands accompanied taking an oath, blessing, and prayer. The custom passed over into the primitive church, as may be seen from the mural paintings in the catacombs. See Clement, Ad Corinth. xxix, which may possibly be a reminiscence of this passage. The verb ejpairein to raise, twice in Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:5">2 Corinthians 10:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:20">2 Corinthians 11:20</span>; but often in Luke. Osiouv holy, o P. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:75">Luke 1:75</span>. </p>
<p>Without wrath and doubting [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρις οργης και διαλογισμων] </span></span>. The combination only here. Orgh is used by Paul mostly of the righteous anger and the accompanying judgment of God against sin. As here, only in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:31">Ephesians 4:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:8">Colossians 3:8</span>. Dialogismov in N. T. habitually in the plural, as here. The only exception is <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:46">Luke 9:46</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:47">Luke 9:47</span>. By Paul usually in the sense of disputatious reasoning. It may also mean sceptical questionings or criticisms as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:14">Philippians 2:14</span>. So probably here. Prayer, according to our writer, is to be without the element of sceptical criticism, whether of God 's character and dealings, or of the character and behavior of those for whom prayer is offered.</p>
