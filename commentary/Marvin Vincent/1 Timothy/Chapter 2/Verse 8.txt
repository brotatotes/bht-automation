I will [βουλομαι] . Better, I desire. See on Matthew 1:9, and comp. Philippians 1:12. Paul 's word is qelw I will. See Romans 16:19; 1 Corinthians 7:32; 1 Corinthians 10:20; 1 Corinthians 14:5, 1 Corinthians 14:19, etc. Everywhere [εν παντι τοπω] . Lit. in every place. Wherever Christian congregations assemble. Not every place indiscriminately. Lifting up holy hands [επαιροντας οσιους χειρας] . The phrase is unique in N. T. o LXX Among Orientals the lifting up of the hands accompanied taking an oath, blessing, and prayer. The custom passed over into the primitive church, as may be seen from the mural paintings in the catacombs. See Clement, Ad Corinth. xxix, which may possibly be a reminiscence of this passage. The verb ejpairein to raise, twice in Paul, 2 Corinthians 10:5; 2 Corinthians 11:20; but often in Luke. Osiouv holy, o P. See on Luke 1:75. Without wrath and doubting [χωρις οργης και διαλογισμων] . The combination only here. Orgh is used by Paul mostly of the righteous anger and the accompanying judgment of God against sin. As here, only in Ephesians 4:31; Colossians 3:8. Dialogismov in N. T. habitually in the plural, as here. The only exception is Luke 9:46, Luke 9:47. By Paul usually in the sense of disputatious reasoning. It may also mean sceptical questionings or criticisms as Philippians 2:14. So probably here. Prayer, according to our writer, is to be without the element of sceptical criticism, whether of God 's character and dealings, or of the character and behavior of those for whom prayer is offered.
