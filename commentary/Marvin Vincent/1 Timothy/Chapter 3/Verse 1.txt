This is a true saying [πιστος ο λογος] . Better, faithful is the saying. See on ch. 1 Timothy 1:15. Desire [ορεγεται] . Better, seeketh. Only here, ch. 6 10, and Hebrews 11:16. Originally to stretchv forth, to reach after. Here it implies not only desiring but seeking after. Desire is expressed by ejpiqumei immediately following. The word implies eagerness, but not of an immoderate or unchristian character. Comp. the kindred word orexiv with its terrible meaning in Romans 1:27. The office of a bishop [επισκοπης] . o P. Episkopov superintendent, overseer, by Paul only in Philippians 1:1. The fundamental idea of the sword is overseeing. The term ejpiskopov was not furnished by the gospel tradition : it did not come from the Jewish synagogue, and it does not appear in Paul 's lists of those whom God has set in the church (1 Corinthians 12:28; Ephesians 4:11). Its adoption came about in a natural way. Just as senatus, gerousia and presbuterov passed into official designations through the natural association of authority with age, so ejpiskopov would be, almost inevitably, the designation of a superintendent. This process of natural selection was probably aided by the familiar use of the title In the clubs and guilds to designate functions analogous to those of the ecclesiastical administrator. The title can hardly be traced to the O. T. There are but two passages in LXX where the word has any connection with religious worship, Numbers 4:16; 2 Kings 11:18. It is applied to God (Job 20:29), and in N. T. to Christ (1 Peter 2:25). It is used of officers in the army and of overseers of workmen. The prevailing O. T. sense of ejpiskoph is visitation for punishment, inquisition, or numbering. 101 He desireth [επιθυμει] . See on 1 Peter 1:12.
