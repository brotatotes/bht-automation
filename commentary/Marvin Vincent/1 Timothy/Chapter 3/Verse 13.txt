<p>Purchase [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιποιουνται] </span></span>. Only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:33">Luke 17:33</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span> On which see note. Purchase is unfortunate from the point of modern usage; but it is employed in its original sense of to win, acquire, without any idea of a bargain. So Bacon, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ezr+4:14">Ezra 4:14</span> : "There is no man doth a wrong for the wrong's sake; but thereby to purchase himself profit, or pleasure, or honor, or the like." And Shakespeare : </p>
<p>"Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition Worthily purchased, take my daughter." Temp 4 1, 14 </p>
<p>Rend. acquire or obtain for themselves. </p>
<p>A good degree [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαθμον καλον] </span></span>. Baqmov, N. T. o. Primarily, a step. In LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+5:5">1 Samuel 5:5</span>; Sir. 6 36, a threshold : <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ki+20:9">2 Kings 20:9</span>, a degree on the dial. In ecclesiastical writers, order, grade, rank : see, for instance, Eusebius, H. E. 7 15. Also degree of relationship or affinity. Here the word apparently means a position of trust and influence in the church; possibly a promotion from the diaconate to the episcopate. Others (as De Wette, Eillicott, Pfleiderer) refer it to a high grade in the future life, which Holtzmann sarcastically describes as a ladder - round in heaven (eine Staffel im Himmel). John the Scholar, known as Climacus, a monk of the latter half of the sixth century, and Abbot of the Sinai Convent, wrote a mystical work entitled Klimax tou Paradeisou the Ladder of Paradise. The ladder, according to him, had thirty rounds. </p>
<p>Boldness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρρησιαν] </span></span>. Primarily, free and bold speaking; speaking out every word [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν, ρημα] </span></span>. Its dominant idea is boldness, confidence, as opposed to fear, ambiguity, or reserve. The idea of publicity is sometimes attached to it, but as secondary. Only here in the Pastorals : several times in Paul, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:12">2 Corinthians 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:4">2 Corinthians 7:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:20">Philippians 1:20</span>. The phrase pollh parrhsia much boldness is also Pauline. An assured position and blameless reputation in the church, with a pure conscience, would assure boldness of speech and of attitude in the Christian community and elsewhere. </p>
<p>In faith. Connect with boldness only. It designates the boldness as distinctively Christian, founded on faith in Christ</p>
