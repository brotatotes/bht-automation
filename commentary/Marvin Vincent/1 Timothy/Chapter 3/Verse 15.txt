I tarry long [βραδυνω] . Only here and 2 Peter 3:9. Thou oughtest to behave thyself [δει αναστρεφεσθαι] . The verb ajnastrefesqai only here in Pastorals. In Paul, 2 Corinthians 1:12; Ephesians 2:3. The reference is not to Timothy's conduct as the A. V. impliest but rather to the instructions which he is to give to church members. Rend. how men ought to behave. See on conversation, 1 Peter 1:15. House of God [οικω θεου] . An O. T. phrase, used of the temple. More frequently, house of the Lord [κυριου] ; see 1 Kings 3:1; 1 Kings 6:1; 1 Chronicles 22:2, 1 Chronicles 22:11; 1 Chronicles 29:2, etc. Applied to the church only here. Paul has oijkeiouv thv pistewv Hebrews householders of the faith (Galatians 6:10), and oijkeioi tou qeou householders of God (Ephesians 2:19), signifying members of the church. Christians are called naov qeou sanctuary of God (1 Corinthians 3:16, 1 Corinthians 3:17; 2 Corinthians 6:16); and the apostles are oijkonomoi household stewards (1 Corinthians 4:1). So of a Bishop (Titus 1:7). See also Hebrews 3:6. Church [εκκλησια] . See on 1 Thessalonians 1:1. Pillar and ground of the truth [στυλος και εδραιωμα της αληθειας] . Stulov. pillar, in Paul only Galatians 2:9. In Revelation 3:12; Revelation 10:1. Edraiwma stay, prop, better than ground. N. T. o. o LXX, o Class. The kindred adjective eJdaiov firm, stable, 1 Corinthians 7:37; 1 Corinthians 14:58; Colossians 1:23. These words are in apposition with church. 106 The idea is that the church is the pillar, and, as such, the prop or support of the truth. It is quite beside the mark to press the architectural metaphor into detail. By giving to eJdraiwma the sense of stay or prop, the use of the two words for the same general idea is readily explained. The church is the pillar of the truth, and the function of the pillar is to support. 107
