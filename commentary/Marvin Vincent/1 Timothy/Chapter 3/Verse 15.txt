Stulov. pillar, in Paul only <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>.

These words are in apposition with church. 106 The idea is that the church is the pillar, and, as such, the prop or support of the truth. It is quite beside the mark to press the architectural metaphor into detail. By giving to eJdraiwma the sense of stay or prop, the use of the two words for the same general idea is readily explained. The church is the pillar of the truth, and the function of the pillar is to support. 107</p>
