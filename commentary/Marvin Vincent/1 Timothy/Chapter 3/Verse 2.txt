<p>The husband of one wife [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιας γυναικος ανδρα] </span></span>. Comp. ver. 12; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:6">Titus 1:6</span>. Is the injunction aimed (a) at immoralities respecting marriage - concubinage, etc., or (b) at polygamy, or (c) at remarriage after death or divorce ? </p>
<p>The last is probably meant. Much of the difficulty arises from the assumption that the Pastorals were written by Paul. In that case his views seem to conflict. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:2">Romans 7:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:3">Romans 7:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:39">1 Corinthians 7:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:8">1 Corinthians 8:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:9">1 Corinthians 8:9</span>, where Paul declares that widows are free to marry again, and puts widows and virgins on the same level; and comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:9">1 Timothy 5:9</span>, according to which a widow is to be enrolled only on the condition of having been the wife of but one man. The Pauline view is modified in detail by the writer of the Pastorals. Paul, while asserting that marriage is right and honorable, regards celibacy as the higher state (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:7">1 Corinthians 7:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:26">1 Corinthians 7:26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:34">1 Corinthians 7:34</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:37">1 Corinthians 7:37</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:38">1 Corinthians 7:38</span>). In this the Pastoral writer does not follow him (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:15">1 Timothy 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:4">1 Timothy 3:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:12">1 Timothy 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:3">1 Timothy 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:10">1 Timothy 5:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:14">1 Timothy 5:14</span>). The motive for marriage, namely, protection against incontinency, which is adduced by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:2">1 Corinthians 7:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:9">1 Corinthians 7:9</span>, is given in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:11-14">1 Timothy 5:11-14</span>. As in Paul, the married state is honorable, for Bishops, Deacons, and Presbyters are married (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:12">1 Timothy 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:6">Titus 1:6</span>), and the honor of childbearing conferred upon the mother of our Lord is reflected in the Christian woman of later times (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:15">1 Timothy 2:15</span>). While Paul advises against second marriages (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:8">1 Corinthians 7:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:9">1 Corinthians 7:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:27">1 Corinthians 7:27</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:39">1 Corinthians 7:39</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:40">1 Corinthians 7:40</span>), in the Pastorals emphasis is laid only on the remarriage of church - officers and churchwidows. In the Pastorals we see a reflection of the conditions of the earlier post - apostolic age, when a non - Pauline asceticism was showing itself (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:3">1 Timothy 4:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:4">1 Timothy 4:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:8">1 Timothy 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:15">Titus 1:15</span>). The opposition to second marriage became very strong in the latter part of the second century. It was elevated into an article of faith by the Montanists, and was emphasised by Tertullian, and by Athenagoras, who called second marriage "a specious adultery" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευπρεπης μοιχεια] </span></span>. 102 Vigilant (nhfalion). Only in the Pastorals. See ver. 11, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:2">Titus 2:2</span>. o LXX The kindred verb nhfein means to be sober with reference to drink, and, in a metaphorical sense, to be sober and wary; cool and unimpassioned. Thus Epicharmus, nafe kai memnas ajpistein be wary and remember not to be credulous. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:6">1 Thessalonians 5:6</span>. In N. T. the meaning of the verb is always metaphorical, to be calm, dispassionate, and circumspect. The A. V. vigilant is too limited. Wise caution may be included; but it is better to render sober, as A. V. in ver. 11 and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:2">Titus 2:2</span>, in the metaphorical sense as opposed to youthful levity. </p>

See note on pursuing hospitality, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:13">Romans 12:13</span>. </p>
<p>Apt to teach [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδακτικον] </span></span>. o P. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:24">2 Timothy 2:24</span>. o LXX, o Class. In the Pastorals the function of teaching pertains to both Bishops and Elders (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17">1 Timothy 5:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:9">Titus 1:9</span>). It is at this point that the tendency to confound and identify the two reveals itself. Bishops and Presbyters are not identical. Earlier, the teaching function does not seem to have attached to the position of ejpiskopov. The office acquired a different character when it assumed that function, which is not assigned to it in Clement's Epistle to the Corinthians. In the Didache or Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (about 100 A. D.) the ministry of teaching is to be assumed by the Bishops only in the absence of the Prophets and Teachers (xiii. xv).</p>
