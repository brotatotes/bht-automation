Given to wine [παροινον] . Only here and Titus 1:7. The verb paroinein to behave ill at wine, to treat with drunken violence, is found in Xenophon, Aeschines, Aristophanes, and Aristotle. Once in LXX, Isaiah 41:12. Rev. renders brawler, which is not definite enough. Better, quarrelsome over wine. See Aristoph. Acharn. 981 : paroiniov ajnhr efu which Frere renders "behaved in such a beastly way." Cicero, ad Att 10 10, uses paroinikwv = insolently. Striker [πληκτην] . Only here and Titus 1:7. Some soften down the meaning into a pugnacious or combative person. In any case, it is a peculiar state of things which calls out such admonitions to Bishops. Not greedy of filthy lucre. Omit. Patient [επιεικη] . Better, forbearing. The word occurs Philippians 4:5, and ejpieikia forbearance in 2 Corinthians 10:1, where it is associated with prauthv meekness. From eijkov reasonable. Hence, not unduly rigorous; not making a determined stand for one's just due. In 1 Peter 2:18; James 3:17, it is associated with ajgaqov kindly, and eujpeiqhv easy to be entreated. It occurs in LXX Not a brawler [αμαχον] . Better, not contentious. Not covetous [αφιλαργυρον] . Only here and Hebrews 13:5. o LXX, o Class. Filargurov money - loving, Luke 16:14; 2 Timothy 3:2. Rend. not a money - lover. The word for covetous is pleonekthv. For the distinction see on Romans 1:29. This admonition is cited by some writers in support of the view that the original ejpiskopov was simply a financial officer. It is assumed that it was prompted by the special temptations which attached to the financial function. Admitting that the episcopal function may have included the financial interests of the church, it could not have been confined to these. It can hardly be supposed that, in associations distinctively moral and religious, one who bore the title of overseer should have been concerned only with the material side of church life. 103
