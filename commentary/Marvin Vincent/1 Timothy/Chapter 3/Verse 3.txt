<p>Given to wine [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παροινον] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</span>. The verb paroinein to behave ill at wine, to treat with drunken violence, is found in Xenophon, Aeschines, Aristophanes, and Aristotle. Once in LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+41:12">Isaiah 41:12</span>. Rev. renders brawler, which is not definite enough. Better, quarrelsome over wine. See Aristoph. Acharn. 981 : paroiniov ajnhr efu which Frere renders "behaved in such a beastly way." Cicero, ad Att 10 10, uses paroinikwv = insolently. </p>
<p>Striker [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληκτην] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</span>. Some soften down the meaning into a pugnacious or combative person. In any case, it is a peculiar state of things which calls out such admonitions to Bishops. Not greedy of filthy lucre. Omit. </p>
<p>Patient [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιεικη] </span></span>. Better, forbearing. The word occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:5">Philippians 4:5</span>, and ejpieikia forbearance in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:1">2 Corinthians 10:1</span>, where it is associated with prauthv meekness. From eijkov reasonable. Hence, not unduly rigorous; not making a determined stand for one's just due. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18">1 Peter 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:17">James 3:17</span>, it is associated with ajgaqov kindly, and eujpeiqhv easy to be entreated. It occurs in LXX </p>
<p>Not a brawler [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαχον] </span></span>. Better, not contentious. </p>
<p>Not covetous [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιλαργυρον] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:5">Hebrews 13:5</span>. o LXX, o Class. Filargurov money - loving, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:14">Luke 16:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:2">2 Timothy 3:2</span>. Rend. not a money - lover. The word for covetous is pleonekthv. For the distinction see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:29">Romans 1:29</span>. </p>
<p>This admonition is cited by some writers in support of the view that the original ejpiskopov was simply a financial officer. It is assumed that it was prompted by the special temptations which attached to the financial function. Admitting that the episcopal function may have included the financial interests of the church, it could not have been confined to these. It can hardly be supposed that, in associations distinctively moral and religious, one who bore the title of overseer should have been concerned only with the material side of church life. 103</p>
