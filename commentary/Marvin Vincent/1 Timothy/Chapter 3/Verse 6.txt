<p>Novice [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεοφυτον] </span></span>. N. T. o. From neov new and futon a plant. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:6">1 Corinthians 3:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:7">1 Corinthians 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:13">Matthew 14:13</span>. Hence, a new convert, a neophyte. Comp. in LXX <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+14:9">Job 14:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+127:3">Psalms 127:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+143:12">Psalms 143:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+5:7">Isaiah 5:7</span>. Chrysostom explains it as newly catechised [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεοκατηχητος] </span></span>; but a neophyte differed from a catechumen in having received baptism. Better the ancient Greek interpreters, newly baptized [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεοβαπτιστος] </span></span>. After the ceremony of baptism the neophytes wore white garments for eight days, from Easter eve until the Sunday after Easter, which was called Dominica in albis, the Sunday in white. The Egyptian archives of Berlin give neofutov a Fayum papyrus of the second century A. D., of newly - planted palm trees. Comp. LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+127:3">Psalms 127:3</span> : "Thy sons as neofuta ejlaiwn plants of olives." </p>
<p>Being lifted up with pride [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυφωθεις] </span></span>. Only in the Pastorals. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:4">1 Timothy 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:4">2 Timothy 3:4</span>. The verb means primarily to make a smoke : hence, metaphorically, to blind with pride or conceit. Neither A. V. nor Rev. puffied up, preserves the radical sense, which is the sense here intended - a beclouded and stupid state of mind as the result of pride. </p>
<p>Fall into condemnation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις κριμα εμπεση] </span></span>. Krima in N. T. usually means judgment. The word for condemnation is katakrima. See especially <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16">Romans 5:16</span>, where the two are sharply distinguished. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:2">Matthew 7:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:25">Acts 24:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:2">Romans 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:7">1 Corinthians 6:7</span>. However, krima occasionally shades off into the meaning condemnation, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:8">Romans 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:1">James 3:1</span>. See on go to law, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:7">1 Corinthians 6:7</span>, and on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:29">1 Corinthians 11:29</span>. Krima is a Pauline word; but the phrase ejmpiptein eijv krima to fall into judgment is found only here. </p>
<p>Of the devil [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του διαβολου] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:1">Matthew 4:1</span>, and on Satan, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:18">1 Thessalonians 2:18</span>. Paul uses diabolov only twice, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:27">Ephesians 4:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:11">Ephesians 6:11</span>. Commonly Satan. The use of diabolov as an adjective is peculiar to the Pastorals (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:11">1 Timothy 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:3">2 Timothy 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:3">Titus 2:3</span>), and occurs nowhere else in N. T., and not in LXX The phrase judgment of the devil probably means the accusing judgment of the devil, and not the judgment passed upon the devil. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+12:10">Revelation 12:10</span> Satan is called the accuser of the brethren. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20">1 Timothy 1:20</span>, men are given over to Satan for judgment. In ver. 7 the genitive diabolou is clearly subjective. In this chapter it appears that a Christian can fall into the reproach of the devil (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:9">Jude 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:11">2 Peter 2:11</span>), the snare of the devil (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:26">2 Timothy 2:26</span>), and the judgment of the devil.</p>
