Novice [νεοφυτον] . N. T. o. From neov new and futon a plant. Comp. 1 Corinthians 3:6, 1 Corinthians 3:7; Matthew 14:13. Hence, a new convert, a neophyte. Comp. in LXX Job 14:9; Psalms 127:3; Psalms 143:12; Isaiah 5:7. Chrysostom explains it as newly catechised [νεοκατηχητος] ; but a neophyte differed from a catechumen in having received baptism. Better the ancient Greek interpreters, newly baptized [νεοβαπτιστος] . After the ceremony of baptism the neophytes wore white garments for eight days, from Easter eve until the Sunday after Easter, which was called Dominica in albis, the Sunday in white. The Egyptian archives of Berlin give neofutov a Fayum papyrus of the second century A. D., of newly - planted palm trees. Comp. LXX, Psalms 127:3 : "Thy sons as neofuta ejlaiwn plants of olives." Being lifted up with pride [τυφωθεις] . Only in the Pastorals. See ch. 1 Timothy 6:4; 2 Timothy 3:4. The verb means primarily to make a smoke : hence, metaphorically, to blind with pride or conceit. Neither A. V. nor Rev. puffied up, preserves the radical sense, which is the sense here intended - a beclouded and stupid state of mind as the result of pride. Fall into condemnation [εις κριμα εμπεση] . Krima in N. T. usually means judgment. The word for condemnation is katakrima. See especially Romans 5:16, where the two are sharply distinguished. Comp. Matthew 7:2; Acts 24:25; Romans 2:2; Romans 5:18; 1 Corinthians 6:7. However, krima occasionally shades off into the meaning condemnation, as Romans 3:8; James 3:1. See on go to law, 1 Corinthians 6:7, and on 1 Corinthians 11:29. Krima is a Pauline word; but the phrase ejmpiptein eijv krima to fall into judgment is found only here. Of the devil [του διαβολου] . See on Matthew 4:1, and on Satan, 1 Thessalonians 2:18. Paul uses diabolov only twice, Ephesians 4:27; Ephesians 6:11. Commonly Satan. The use of diabolov as an adjective is peculiar to the Pastorals (see 1 Timothy 3:11; 2 Timothy 3:3; Titus 2:3), and occurs nowhere else in N. T., and not in LXX The phrase judgment of the devil probably means the accusing judgment of the devil, and not the judgment passed upon the devil. In Revelation 12:10 Satan is called the accuser of the brethren. In 1 Corinthians 5:5; 1 Timothy 1:20, men are given over to Satan for judgment. In ver. 7 the genitive diabolou is clearly subjective. In this chapter it appears that a Christian can fall into the reproach of the devil (comp. Jude 1:9; 2 Peter 2:11), the snare of the devil (comp. 2 Timothy 2:26), and the judgment of the devil.
