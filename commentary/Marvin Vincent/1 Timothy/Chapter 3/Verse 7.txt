<p>A good report [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυριαν καλην] </span></span>. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:3">Acts 6:3</span>. Not only does kalov occur in the Pastorals nearly twice as many times as in Paul, but the usage is different. Out of 16 instances in Paul, there is but one in which kalov is not used substantively (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:16">Romans 7:16</span>), while in the Pastorals it is, almost without exception, used adjectively. Marturian, better testimony. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:13">Titus 1:13</span>. Not in Paul, who uses marturion. </p>
<p>Of them which are without [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο των εξωθεν] </span></span>. Exwqen only once in Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:6">2 Corinthians 7:6</span>), and oiJ exwqen nowhere in Paul, and only here in Pastorals. Paul 's phrase is oJ exw : see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:12">1 Corinthians 5:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:13">1 Corinthians 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:16">2 Corinthians 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:12">1 Thessalonians 4:12</span>. </p>
<p>Reproach [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονειδισμον] </span></span>. By Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:3">Romans 14:3</span> only here in Pastorals : three times in Hebrews. </p>
<p>Snare [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παγιδα] </span></span>. Comp. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:9">1 Timothy 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:26">2 Timothy 2:26</span>. In Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:9">Romans 11:9</span>, see note. Both reproach and snare govern diabolou.</p>
