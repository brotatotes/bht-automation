A good report [μαρτυριαν καλην] . Comp. Acts 6:3. Not only does kalov occur in the Pastorals nearly twice as many times as in Paul, but the usage is different. Out of 16 instances in Paul, there is but one in which kalov is not used substantively (Romans 7:16), while in the Pastorals it is, almost without exception, used adjectively. Marturian, better testimony. Comp. Titus 1:13. Not in Paul, who uses marturion. Of them which are without [απο των εξωθεν] . Exwqen only once in Paul (2 Corinthians 7:6), and oiJ exwqen nowhere in Paul, and only here in Pastorals. Paul 's phrase is oJ exw : see 1 Corinthians 5:12, 1 Corinthians 5:13; 2 Corinthians 4:16; 1 Thessalonians 4:12. Reproach [ονειδισμον] . By Paul in Romans 14:3 only here in Pastorals : three times in Hebrews. Snare [παγιδα] . Comp. ch. 1 Timothy 6:9; 2 Timothy 2:26. In Paul, Romans 11:9, see note. Both reproach and snare govern diabolou.
