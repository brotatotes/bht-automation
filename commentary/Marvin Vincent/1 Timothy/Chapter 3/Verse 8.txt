<p>Deacons. The office of Deacon appears in the Pastorals, but not in Paul 's letters, with the single exception of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>, where the Deacons do not represent an ecclesiastical office, though they remark an advance toward it. Clement of Rome (ad Corinth. xlii, xliv) asserts their apostolic appointment. But the evidence at our command does not bear out the view that the institution of the diaconate is described in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1-6">Acts 6:1-6</span>. The terms diakonov and diakonia are, in the Pauline writings, common expressions of servants and service either to Christ or to others. Paul applies these terms to his own ministry and to that of his associates. Diakonia is used of the service of the apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:25">Acts 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:4">Acts 6:4</span>. Diakonov is used of Paul and Apollos (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5">1 Corinthians 3:5</span>); of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:17">Galatians 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:8">Romans 14:8</span>); of the civil ruler (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:4">Romans 13:4</span>); of ministers of Satan (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:15">2 Corinthians 11:15</span>). The appointment of the seven grew out of a special emergency, and was made for a particular service; and the resemblance is not close between the duties and qualifications of deacons in the Pastorals and those of the seven. The word diakonov does not appear in Acts; and when Paul and Barnabas brought to Jerusalem the collection for the poor saints, they handed it over to the elders. </p>
<p>In like manner [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωσαυτως] </span></span>. Rare in Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:25">1 Corinthians 11:25</span>). Frequent in Pastorals. </p>
<p>Grave [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεμνους] </span></span>. In Paul only <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:8">Philippians 4:8</span>. See on semnothv gravity, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:2">1 Timothy 2:2</span>. </p>
<p>Double - tongued [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διλογους] </span></span>. N. T. o. o LXX, o Class. Saying one thing and meaning another, and making different representations to different people about the same thing. </p>
<p>Given to much wine [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οινω πολλω προσεχοντας] </span></span>. Seeon <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:4">1 Timothy 1:4</span>. Total abstinence is not enjoined, even on a deacon. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:23">1 Timothy 5:23</span>. </p>
<p>Greedy of filthy lucre [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αισχροκερδεις] </span></span>. N. T. o. o LXX The adverb aijscrokerdwv in a base, gain - greedy way, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:2">1 Peter 5:2</span>. From aijscrov disgraceful and kerdov gain. Comp. Hdt 1:187 : eij mh aplhstov te eav crhmatwn kai aijscrokerdhv if thou hadst not been insatiable of wealth and ready to procure it by disgraceful means. Aristoph. Peace, 622, alludes to two vices of the Spartans, ontev aijscrokerdeiv kai dieirwnoxenoi sordidly greedy of gain, and treacherous under the mask of hospitality. Similarly Eurip. Androm. 451. Comp. turpilucricupidus, Plaut. Trin. 1, 2, 63.</p>
