<p>The mystery of the faith [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μυστηριον της πιστεως] </span></span>. The phrase N. T. '. In the Gospels only, mystery or mysteries of the kingdom of God or of heaven. In Paul, mystery or mysteries of God, of his will, of Christ, of the gospel, of iniquity, the mystery kept secret or hidden away. Several times without qualification, the mystery or mysteries. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</span>. The mystery of the faith is the subject - matter of the faith; the truth which is its basis, which was kept hidden from the world until revealed at the appointed time, and which is a secret to ordinary eyes, but is made known by divine revelation.

Const. with holding. The emphasis of the passage is on these words. They express conscientious purity and sincerity in contrast with those who are described as branded in their own conscience, and thus causing their followers to fall away from the faith (ch. 4 1, 2). The passage illustrates the peculiar treatment of "faith" in these Epistles, in emphasising its ethical aspect and its ethical environment. This is not contrary to Paul 's teaching, nor does it go to the extent of substituting morals for faith as the condition of salvation and eternal life. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:1">2 Timothy 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5">Titus 3:5</span>. Nonetheless, there is a strong and habitual emphasis on good works (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:10">1 Timothy 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:10">1 Timothy 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:18">1 Timothy 6:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:21">2 Timothy 2:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:17">2 Timothy 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:16">Titus 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:7">Titus 2:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:14">Titus 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:1">Titus 3:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:8">Titus 3:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:14">Titus 3:14</span>), and faith is placed in a series of practical duties (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:5">1 Timothy 1:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:14">1 Timothy 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:15">1 Timothy 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12">1 Timothy 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:13">2 Timothy 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:19">1 Timothy 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:7">1 Timothy 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:9">1 Timothy 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:11">1 Timothy 6:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:22">2 Timothy 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:10">2 Timothy 3:10</span>). "Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience" is a significant association of faith with ethics. As Weiss puts it : "It is as if the pure conscience were the vessel in which the mystery of the faith is preserved." The idea is sound and valuable. A merely intellectual attitude toward the mystery which, in every age, attaches to the faith, will result in doubt, questioning, and wordy strife (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:4">1 Timothy 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:23">2 Timothy 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:9">Titus 3:9</span>), sometimes in moral laxity, sometimes in despair. Loyalty and duty to God are compatible with more or less ignorance concerning the mystery. An intellect, however powerful and active, joined with an impure conscience, cannot solve but only aggravates the mystery; whereas a pure and loyal conscience, and a frank acceptance of imposed duty along with mystery, puts one in the best attitude for attaining whatever solution is possible.
