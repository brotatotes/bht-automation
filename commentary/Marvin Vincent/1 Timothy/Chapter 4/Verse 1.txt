<p>Now [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε] </span></span>. Better but, since there is a contrast with the preceding confession of the norm of faith. </p>
<p>Expressly [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρητως] </span></span>. N. T. o. o LXX In express words. </p>
<p>In the latter times [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υστεροις καιροις] </span></span>. The phrase only here.

Not the same as ejn ejscataiv in the last days, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:1">2 Timothy 3:1</span>, which denotes the peliod closing the present aeon, and immediately preceding the parousia; while this signifies merely a time that is future to the writer. There is not the intense sense of the nearness of Christ 's coming which characterises Paul. The writer does not think of his present as "the latter days." </p>
<p>Some [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινες] </span></span>. Not, as ch. 1 3, the heretical teachers, but those whom they mislead. </p>

The verb in Paul only <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:8">2 Corinthians 12:8</span>. Quite frequent in Luke and Acts. The kindred noun tasia (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:21">Acts 21:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</span>) is almost literally transcribed in our apostasy. </p>
<p>Seducing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλανοις] </span></span>. Primarily, wandering, roving. O planov a vagabond, hence deceiver or seducer. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:7">2 John 1:7</span>, and comp. oJ planwn the deceiver, used of Satan, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10">Revelation 20:10</span>; to pneuma thv planhv the spirit of error, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:6">1 John 4:6</span>. Once in Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:8">2 Corinthians 6:8</span>, and in LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+19:4">Job 19:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:32">Jeremiah 23:32</span>.

Very frequent in Luke : in Paul only <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:20">1 Corinthians 10:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:21">1 Corinthians 10:21</span>. Teachings proceeding from or inspired by demons. The working of these evil spirits is here specially concerned with striking at the true teaching which underlies godliness. It is impossible to say what particular form of false teaching is alluded to.</p>
