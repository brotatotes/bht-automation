<p>Neglect [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμελει] </span></span>. Rare in N. T. Only <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:5">Matthew 22:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:3">Hebrews 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:9">Hebrews 8:9</span>. </p>
<p>The gift that is in thee [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του εν σοι χαρισματος] </span></span>. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span>. Carisma gift is a distinctively Pauline word, being found only three times outside of Paul 's Epistles, and o LXX, o Class. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:11">Romans 1:11</span>. That is in thee, comp. thv ejn soi pistewv the faith that is in thee, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:5">2 Timothy 1:5</span>. The meaning is the special inward endowment which qualified Timothy for exhortation and teaching, and which was directly imparted by the Holy Spirit. 112 By prophecy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια προφητειας] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span>. Profhteiav genitive, not accusative. The meaning is by the medium of prophecy. The reference is to prophetic intimation given to Paul concerning the selection of Timothy for the ministerial office. These prophecies were given by the Holy Spirit who bestowed the " gift ", so that the gift itself and the prophecy concurred in attesting the candidate for ordination. </p>
<p>With the laying on of the hands [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα επιθεσεως των χειρων] </span></span>. Meta implies that the prophetic intimations were in some way repeated or emphasised in connection with the ceremony of ordination. We note the association of prophecy with ordination in the setting apart of Paul and Barnabas (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:9">Acts 13:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:3">Acts 13:3</span>); so that the case of Timothy has an analogue in that of Paul himself. 113 Epiqesiv laying on, emposition, also <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:18">Acts 8:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:2">Hebrews 6:2</span>, in each case with of hands. "The custom," says Lange, "is as old as the race." The Biblical custom rests on the conception of the hand as the organ of mediation and transference. The priest laid his hand on the head of the bullock or goat (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+1:4">Leviticus 1:4</span>) to show that the guilt of the people was transferred. The hand was laid on the head of a son, to indicate the transmission of the hereditary blessing (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:14">Genesis 48:14</span>); upon one appointed to a position of authority, as Joshua (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+27:18-23">Numbers 27:18-23</span>); upon the sick or dead in token of miraculous power to heal or to restore to life (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ki+4:34">2 Kings 4:34</span>). So Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:5">Mark 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:40">Luke 4:40</span>). In the primitive Christian church the laying on of hands signified the imparting of the Holy Spirit to the newly - baptized (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:17">Acts 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:6">Acts 19:6</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:2">Hebrews 6:2</span>). Hands were laid Upon the seven (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:6">Acts 6:6</span>). But the form of consecration in ordination varied. No one mode has been universal in the church, and no authoritative written formula exists. In the Alexandrian and Abyssinian churches it was by breathing : in the Eastern church generally, by lifting up the hands in benediction : in the Armenian church, by touching the dead hand of the predecessor : in the early Celtic church, by the transmission of relics or pastoral staff : in the Latin church, by touching the head. </p>
<p>Of the presbytery [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του πρεσβυτεριου] </span></span>. The word is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:66">Luke 22:66</span>, where it denotes the body of representative elders of the people in the Sanhedrim, as distinguished from the two other constituents of that body - the chief priests and scribes. Similarly <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:5">Acts 22:5</span>. Here of the college or fraternity of Christian elders in the place where Timothy was ordained. The word is frequent in the Epistles of Ignatius. 114 According to this, Timothy was not ordained by a Bishop. Bishop and Presbyter are not identical. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span> we read, "by the laying on of my hands." The inconsistency is usually explained by saying that Paul was associated with the Presbyters in the laying on of hands.</p>
