<p>It is sanctified [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιαζεται] </span></span>. Not declared holy, but made holy. The declaration confirms the last clause of ver. 4. Thanksgiving to God has a sanctifying effect. The food in itself has no moral quality (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:14">Romans 14:14</span>), but acquires a holy quality by its consecration to God; by being acknowledged as God 's gift, and partaken of as nourishing the life for God 's service. Comp. Paul 's treatment of the unbelieving husband and the believing wife, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:14">1 Corinthians 7:14</span>. </p>
<p>By the word of God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια λογου θεου] </span></span>. That is, by the word of God as used in the prayer. Scripture is not called "the Word of God." The Word of God includes much more than Scripture : but Scripture contains the Word of God, and the thanksgiving at table was in the words of Scripture. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+145:15">Psalms 145:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+145:16">Psalms 145:16</span>.
