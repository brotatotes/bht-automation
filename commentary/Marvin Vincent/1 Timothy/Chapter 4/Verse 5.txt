It is sanctified [αγιαζεται] . Not declared holy, but made holy. The declaration confirms the last clause of ver. 4. Thanksgiving to God has a sanctifying effect. The food in itself has no moral quality (Romans 14:14), but acquires a holy quality by its consecration to God; by being acknowledged as God 's gift, and partaken of as nourishing the life for God 's service.
