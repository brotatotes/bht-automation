Presbuterov elder, o P., but frequent in Gospels, Acts, and Revelation. Modern critical opinion has largely abandoned the view that the original Christian polity was an imitation of that of the Synagogue. The secular and religious authorities of the Jewish communities, at least in purely Jewish localities, were the same; a fact which is against the probability that the polity was directly transferred to the Christian church. The prerogatives of the Jewish elders have nothing corresponding with them in extent in the Christian community. Functions which emerge later in the Jewish - Christian communities of Palestine do not exist in the first Palestinian - Christian society. At the most, as Weizsacker observes, it could only be a question of borrowing a current name. 115 Modern criticism compels us, I think, to abandon the view of the identity of Bishop and Presbyter which has obtained such wide acceptance, especially among English scholars, through the discussions of Lightfoot and Hatch. 116 The testimony of Clement of Rome (Ep. ad Corinth.) goes to show that the Bishops [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγουμενοι ορ προηγουμενοι</span></span>] are distinguished from the Presbyters, and that if the Bishops are apparently designated as Presbyters, it is, because they have been chosen from the body of Presbyters, and have retained the name even when they have ceased to hold office. for this reason deceased Bishops are called Presbyters. In Clement, Presbyters signify a class or estate - members of long standing and approved character, and not office - bearers regularly appointed. Among these the Bishops are to be sought. Bishops are reckoned as Presbyters, not because the Presbyter as such is a Bishop, but because the Bishop as such is a Presbyter. In the Pastorals, Bishops and Deacons are associated without mention of Presbyters (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:1-13">1 Timothy 3:1-13</span>). Presbyters are referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17-19">1 Timothy 5:17-19</span>, but in an entirely different connection. The qualifications of Bishops and Deacons are detailed in the former passage, and the list of qualifications concludes with the statement that this is the ordering of the church as the house of God (vv. 14, 15). The offices are exhausted in the description of Bishops and Deacons. Nothing is said of Presbyters until ch. 5, where Timothy's relations to individual church - members are prescribed; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:2">Titus 2:2</span> ff. these members are classified as old men [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτας</span></span>] old women, young men, and servants. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17">1 Timothy 5:17</span> are mentioned elders who rule well [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οι καλως προεστωτες πρεσβυτεροι] </span></span>. Assuming that Presbyters and Bishops were identical, a distinction would thus be implied between two classes of Bishops - those who rule well and those who do not : where as the distinction is obviously between old and honored church - members, collectively considered, forming the presbyterial body, and certain of their number who show their qualifications for appointment as overseers. </p>
<p>Presbyters as such are not invested with office. There is no formal act constituting a Presbyter. The Bishops are reckoned among the Elders, but the elders as such are not officers. </p>
<p>Thus are to be explained the allusions to appointed Elders, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</span>. Elders are to be appointed as overseers or Bishops, for the overseers must have the qualitications of approved Presbyters. The ordination of Presbyters is the setting apart of Elders to the position of Superintendents. The Presbyterate denotes an honorable and influential estate in the church on the ground of age, duration of church membership, and approved character. Only Bishops are appointed There is no appointment to the Presbyterate. At the close of Clement's letter to the Corinthians, the qualifications of a Presbyter are indicated in the description of the three commissioners from the Roman church who are the bearers of the letter, and to whom no officiel title is given. They are old, members of the Roman church from youth, blameless in life, believing, and sober. 117</p>
