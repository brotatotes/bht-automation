<p>Of the saints [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιων] </span></span>. %Agiov is rare in Class. In LXX, the standard word for holy. Its fundamental idea is setting apart, as in Class., devoted to the gods. In O T., set apart to God, as priests; as the Israelites consecrated to God. In N. T., applied to Christians. Ideally, it implies personal holiness. It is used of God, Christ, John the Baptist, God 's law, the Spirit of God. Paul often uses oiJ agioi as a common designation of Christians belonging to a certain region or community, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:0">2 Corinthians 1:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:2">Colossians 1:2</span>. In such cases it does not imply actual holiness, but holiness obligatory upon those addressed, as consecrated persons, and appropriate to them. What ought to be is assumed as being.
