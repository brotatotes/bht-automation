The elders that rule well [οι καλως προεστωτες πρεσβυτεροι] . For that rule well, see on kalwv proistamenon ruling well, 1 Timothy 3:4. The phrase is peculiar to the Pastorals. See on ver. 1. Double honor [διπλης τιμης] . This at least includes pecuniary remuneration for services, if it is not limited to that. The use of timh as pay or price appears Matthew 27:6, Matthew 27:9; Acts 4:34; Acts 7:16; 1 Corinthians 6:20. Double, not in a strictly literal sense, but as pleiona timhn more honor, Hebrews 3:3. The comparison is with those Elders who do not exhibit equal capacity or efficiency in ruling. The passage lends no support to the Reformed theory of two classes of Elders - ruling and teaching. The special honor or emolument is assigned to those who combine qualifications for both. Those who labor [οι κοπιωντες] . See on ch. 1 Timothy 4:10. No special emphesis attaches to the word - hard toiling in comeparison with those who do not toil. The meaning is, those who faithfully discharge the arduous duty of teaching. Comp. Hebrews 13:7. In word and doctrine [εν λογω και διδασκαλια] . Better, word and teaching. Word is general, teaching special. In word signifies, in that class of functions where speech is concerned. The special emphasis (malista especially) shows the importance which was attached to teaching as an antidote of heresy.
