The Scripture [η γραφη] . Comp. 2 Timothy 3:16. To the Jews hJ grafh signified the O. T. canon of Scripture; but in most cases hJ grafh is used of a particular passage of Scripture which is indicated in the context. See John 7:38, John 7:42; Acts 1:16; Acts 8:32, Acts 8:35; Romans 4:3; Romans 9:17; Romans 10:11; Galatians 3:8. Where the reference is to the sacred writings as a whole, the plural grafai or aiJ grafai is used, as Matthew 21:42; Luke 24:32; John 5:39; Romans 14:4. Once grafai agiai holy Scriptures, Romans 1:2. Etera grafh another or a different Scripture, John 19:37; hJ grafh auth this Scripture, Luke 4:21; pasa grafh every Scripture, 2 Timothy 3:16. See on writings, John 2:22. The passage cited here is Deuteronomy 25:4, also by Paul, 1 Corinthians 9:9. Thou shalt not muzzle [ου φιμωσεις] . In N. T. mostly in the metaphorical sense of putting to silence. See on speechless, Matthew 22:12, and put to silence, Matthew 22:34. Also on Mark 4:39. On the whole passage see note on 1 Corinthians 9:9. That treadeth out [αλοωντα] . More correctly, while he is treading out. The verb only here and 1 Corinthians 9:9, 1 Corinthians 9:10. Comp. alwn a threshing - floor, Matthew 3:12; Luke 3:17. An analogy to the O. T. injunction may be found in the laws giving to the Athenians by the mythical Triptolemus, one of which was, "Hurt not the laboring beast." Some one having violated this command by slaying a steer which was eating the sacred cake that lay upon the altar, - an expiation - feast, Bouphonia or Diipolta was instituted for the purpose of atoning for this offense, and continued to be celebrated in Athens. Aristophanes refers to it (Clouds, 985). A laboring ox was led to the altar of Zeus on the Acropolis, which was strewn with wheat and barley. As soon as the ox touched the grain, he was killed by a blow from an axe. The priest who struck the blow threw away the axe and fled. The flesh of the ox was then eaten, and the hide was stuffed and set before the plough. Then began the steer - trial before a judicial assembly in the Prytaneum, by which the axe was formally condemned to be thrown into the sea. The laborer is worthy, etc. A second scriptural quotation would seem to be indicated, but there is no corresponding passage in the O. T. The words are found Luke 10:7, and, with a slight variation, Matthew 10:10. Some hold that the writer adds to the O. T. citation a popular proverb, and that Christ himself used the words in this way. But while different passages of Scripture are often connected in citation by kai, it is not according, to N. T. usage thus to connect Scripture and proverb. Moreover, in such series of citations it is customary to use kai palin and again, or palin simply. See Matthew 4:7; Matthew 5:33; John 12:39; Romans 14:9-12; 1 Corinthians 3:20; Hebrews 1:5; Hebrews 2:13. According to others, the writer here cites an utterance of Christ from oral tradition, coordinately with the O. T. citation, as Scripture. Paul, in 1 Thessalonians 4:15; 1 Corinthians 7:10, appeals to a word of the Lord; and in Acts 10:35 he is represented as quoting "it is more blessed to give than to receive" as the words of Jesus. In 1 Corinthians 9:0, in the discussion of this passage from Deuteronomy, Paul adds (ver. 14) "even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel," which resembles the combination here. This last is the more probable explanation.
