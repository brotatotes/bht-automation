<p>Widows [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χηρας] </span></span>. Paul alludes to widows in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:8">1 Corinthians 7:8</span> only, where he advises them against remarrying. They are mentioned as a class in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>, in connection With the appointment of the seven. Also <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:39">Acts 9:39</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:41">Acts 9:41</span>. In the Pastorals they receive special notice, indicating their advance from the position of mere beneficiaries to a quasi - official position in the church. from the very first, the church recognised its obligation to care for their support. A widow, in the East, was peculiarly desolate and helpless. 119 In return for their maintenance certain duties were required of them, such as the care of orphans, sick and prisoners, and they were enrolled in an order, which, however, did not include all of their number who received alms of the church. In Polyearp's Epistle to the Philippians, they are styled "the altar of God." To such an order the references in the Pastorals point. The Fathers, from the end of the second century to the fourth, recognised a class known as presbutidev aged women (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:3">Titus 2:3</span>), who had oversight of the female church - members and a separate seat in the congregation. The council of Laoclicaea abolished this institution, or so modified it that widows no longer held an official relation to the church. Who are widows indeed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας οντως χηρας] </span></span>. Comp. vv. 5, 16.

See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:18">2 Peter 2:18</span>. Wherever ontwv is used by Paul or by any other N. T. writer, it is used purely as an adverb (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:47">Luke 23:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:34">Luke 24:34</span>) : but in all the four instances in the Pastorals, it is preceded by the article and converted into an adjective. The meaning is, who are absolutely bereaved, without children or relations (comp. ver. 4), and have been but once married. There is probably also an implied contrast with those described in vv. 6, 11 - 13.</p>
