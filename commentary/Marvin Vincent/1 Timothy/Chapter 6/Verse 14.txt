<p><span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:1">1 Timothy 6:1</span>5In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:18">2 Timothy 4:18</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span>, it denotes, as here, the second coming of Christ. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:10">2 Timothy 1:10</span>, his historical manifestation, for which also the verb ejpifainein is used, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:11">Titus 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:4">Titus 3:4</span>. for the Lord is second advent Paul commonly uses parousia presence; once the verb faneroun to make manifest (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:4">Colossians 3:4</span>), and once ajpokaluyiv revelation (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:7">2 Thessalonians 1:7</span>). It is quite possible that the word ejpifaneia, so characteristic of these Epistles, grew out of the Gnostic vocabulary, in which it was used of the sudden appearing of the hitherto concealed heavenly aeon, Christ. This they compared to a sudden light from heaven; and Christ, who thus appeared, though only docetically, without an actual fleshly body, was styled swthr savior, although his oneness with the God of creation was denied. The Creator and the Redeemer were not the same, but were rather opposed. Christ was only a factor of a great cosmological process of development. As Neander observes : "The distinctive aim of the Gnostics was to apprehend the appearance of Christ and the new creation proceeding from him in their connection with the evolution of the whole universe."</p>
