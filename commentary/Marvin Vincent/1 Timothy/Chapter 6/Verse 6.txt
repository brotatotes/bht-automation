Aujtarkeia is an inward self - sufficiency, as opposed to the lack or the desire of outward things. It was a favorite Stoic word, expressing the doctrine of that sect that a man should be sufficient unto himself for all things, and able, by the power of his own will, to resist the force of circumstances. In Ps. of Song of Solomon 5:18, we read : "Blessed is the man whom God remembereth with a sufficiency convenient for him" [εν συμμετρια αυταρκεσιας] ; that is, with a sufficiency proportioned to his needs.
