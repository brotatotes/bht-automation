The adjective aujtarkhv self - sufficient, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:11">Philippians 4:11</span>. Comp. Sir. 40 18. Aujtarkeia is an inward self - sufficiency, as opposed to the lack or the desire of outward things. It was a favorite Stoic word, expressing the doctrine of that sect that a man should be sufficient unto himself for all things, and able, by the power of his own will, to resist the force of circumstances. In Ps. of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="so+5:18">Song of Solomon 5:18</span>, we read : "Blessed is the man whom God remembereth with a sufficiency convenient for him" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν συμμετρια αυταρκεσιας] </span></span>; that is, with a sufficiency proportioned to his needs.</p>
