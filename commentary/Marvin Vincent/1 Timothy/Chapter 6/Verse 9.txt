They that will be rich [οι βουλομενοι πλουτειν] . Better, they that desire to be rich. lt is not the possession of richess but the love of them that leads men into temptation. Fall [εμπιπτουσιν] . o P. Lit. fall into; but invariably in N. T. with eijv into. Temptation [πειρασμον] . See on Matthew 6:13. Foolish [ανοητους] . Foolish answers to several words in N. T., ajnohtov, ajsunetov, afrwn, mwrov. Anohtov not understanding; a want of proper application of the moral judgment or perception, as Luke 24:9 Luke 24:5; Galatians 3:1. See notes on both. Afrwn is senseless, stupid, of images, beasts. Comp. Luke 12:20, note. Asunetov approaches the meaning of ajnohtov unintelligent. See Sir. 22 13, 15; 27 12. It also implies a moral sense, wicked, Wisd. 1 5; 11 15; Sir. 14 7. On the etymological sense, see on Matthew 11:25; Mark 12:33; Luke 2:47. Mwrov is without forethought, as Matthew 7:26; Matthew 25:3; without learning, as 1 Corinthians 1:27; 1 Corinthians 3:18; with a moral sense, empty, useless, 2 Timothy 2:23; Titus 3:9; and impious, godless, Matthew 5:22; Psalms 43:8; Jeremiah 5:21. Hurtful [βλαβερας] . N. T. o. LXX once, Proverbs 10:26. Drown [βυθιζουσι] . Only here and Luke 5:7, note. A strong expression of the results of avarice. Destruction [ολεθρον] . See on 1 Thessalonians 1:9, and additional note. Perdition [απωλειαν] . It is unsafe to distinguish between oleqrov destruction in general, and ajpwleia as pointing mainly to destruction of the soul. Apwleia sometimes of spiritual destruction, as Philippians 1:28; but also of destruction and waste in general, as Mark 14:4; Acts 8:20. One is reminded of Virgil, Aen 3:56 : "Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, Auri sacra fames?"
