<p>All [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσαι] </span></span>. Wrong. As many as. </p>
<p>Are yea, etc. Making this the predicate of promises, which is wrong. The meaning is that how many soever are God 's promises, in Christ is the incarnate answer, "yea!" to the question, "Will they be fulfilled?" Hence Rev., correctly : How many soever be the promises of God, in Him is the yea. </p>
<p>And in Him Amen [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και εν αυτω το αμην] </span></span>. The correct reading is : dio kai dij aujtou to ajmhn Wherefore also through Him is the Amen. In giving this answer in His person and life, Christ puts the emphatic confirmation upon God 's promises, even as in the congregation the people say Amen, verily. In Him is in His person : through Him, by His agency. By us [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι ημων] </span></span>. Through our ministration. Christ, in and through whom are the yea and the amen, is so proclaimed by us as to beget assurance of God 's promises, and so to glorify Him.</p>
