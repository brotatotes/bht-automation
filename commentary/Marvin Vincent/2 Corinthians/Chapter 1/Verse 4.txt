<p>In all our tribulation - in any trouble [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι παση τη θλιψει ημων - εν παση θλιψει] </span></span>. Note the nice use of the article : all our tribulation, collectively; any or every trouble, specifically. In is literally upon; the trouble forming the ground of the comfort. So in hope, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:18">Romans 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span>. We ourselves are comforted. An illustration of the personal character which pervades this epistle. Paul had been oppressed with anxiety concerning the reception of his first epistle by the Corinthian Church, by the delay of tidings, and by his disappointment in meeting Titus. The tidings, when at last they did arrive, aroused his gratitude for the wholesome effect of his rebuke upon the Church, and his indignation at the aggressions of the Judaizing teachers. With these feelings mingled his anxiety to hasten, in the Corinthian Church, the contribution for the poor saints in Judaea. This second letter therefore bears the marks of the high tension of feeling which finds expression in frequent personal allusions, especially to his afflictions. 139</p>
