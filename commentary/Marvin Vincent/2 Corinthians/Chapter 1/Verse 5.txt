Sufferings of Christ. Not things suffered for Christ 's sake, but Christ 's own sufferings as they are shared by His disciples. See Matthew 20:22; Philippians 3:10; Colossians 1:24; 1 Peter 4:13. Note the peculiar phrase abound [περισσευει] in us, by which Christ 's sufferings are represented as overflowing upon His followers. See on Colossians 1:24.
