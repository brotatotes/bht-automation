<p>We stretch not ourselves beyond our measure [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη υπερεκτεινομεν εαυτους] </span></span>. The verb only here in the New Testament. The A. V. is needlessly verbose. Rev., better, stretch not ourselves overmuch. </p>
<p>As though we reached not unto you. Lit., as not reaching. Paul would say : It is not as if God had not appointed our apostolic labor to reach to you. If He had not thus appointed, then our desire to labor among you would have been an overstretching of ourselves. Therefore, in boasting of our labor in Corinth, we do not boast beyond our measure. </p>
<p>We are come [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφθασαμεν] </span></span>. Rev., we came. The verb originally means to come before, anticipate, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span> (A. V., prevent; Rev., precede); but it gradually loses the idea of priority, and means simply come to, arrive at. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:28">Matthew 12:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:16">Philippians 3:16</span>. It may possibly be used here with a hint of the earlier meaning, were the first to come. See Rev., margin.</p>
