Paul means that, as the faith of the Corinthians increases, he hopes that his apostolic efficiency will increase, so that Corinth shall become the basis of larger efforts, extending into other regions. The verb megalunw also means to praise or celebrate, as Luke 1:46; Acts 5:13; Acts 10:46, and is so explained by some interpreters here.

According to our rule. His wider labors will still be regulated by God 's measuring - line.
