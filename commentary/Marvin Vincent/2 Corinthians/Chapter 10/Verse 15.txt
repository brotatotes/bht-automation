<p>Be enlarged by you - according to our rule abundantly [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υμιν μεγαλυνθηναι - εις περισσειαν] </span></span>. Paul means that, as the faith of the Corinthians increases, he hopes that his apostolic efficiency will increase, so that Corinth shall become the basis of larger efforts, extending into other regions. The verb megalunw also means to praise or celebrate, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:46">Luke 1:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:13">Acts 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:46">Acts 10:46</span>, and is so explained by some interpreters here. But this would be inconsistent with the figure, to which Paul adheres. "He who can work far off is a man of great stature, who, without overstretching himself, reaches afar" (Meyer). </p>
<p>According to our rule. His wider labors will still be regulated by God 's measuring - line.</p>
