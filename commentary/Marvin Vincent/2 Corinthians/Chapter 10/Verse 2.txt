<p>But I beseech you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεομαι δε] </span></span>. In ver. 1, parakalw is used for beseech. It is doubtful whether the two words can be strictly distinguished as indicating different degrees of feeling. It may be said that deomai and its kindred noun dehsiv are frequently used of prayer to God, while parakalw occurs only twice in this sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:53">Matthew 26:53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:8">2 Corinthians 12:8</span>. On the other hand, parakalw is used of God 's pleading with men, while in the same passage deomai is used of men's entreating men; ch. 5 20. Rev., in ver. 1, renders entreat, which, according to older English usage, is the stronger word, meaning to prevail by entreaty, just as persuade, which originally meant to use persuasion, now signifies to prevail by persuasion. </p>
<p>The construction of the passage is difficult. Literally it is : I pray the not showing courage when present, with the confidence, etc. The sense is : I pray you that you may not make it necessary for me to show, when I am present, that official peremptoriness which I am minded to show against those who charge me with unworthy motives. </p>
<p>May not be bold - think to be bold [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαρρησαι - τολμησαι] </span></span>. The A. V. thus misses the distinction between the two verbs. The former signifies to be stout - hearted or resolutely confident in view of one's conscious strength or capacity; the latter, to carry this feeling into action; to dare. The distinction is not easy to represent by single English words. It might be approximately given by brave and bold, though, in common usage, this distinction practically disappears. QarjrJhsai does not so much emphasize fearlessness as the tore positive quality of cheerful confidence in the presence of difficulty and danger, the sense which appears in the earlier usage of brave as gay (see the various uses in Shakespeare). Hence Rev. is on the right line in the use of courage, from cor heart, through the French coeur. Rev. renders, show courage - be bold. In classical Greek, the kindred noun qarsov is sometimes, though not often, used in a bad sense, audacity, as in Homer, where Minerva is rebuking Mars for exciting strife among the gods with stormy or furious courage (qarsov ahton "Iliad," 21, 395). So the reckless daring of Hector is described qarsov muihv the effrontery of a fly (" Iliad, " 17, 570).</p>
