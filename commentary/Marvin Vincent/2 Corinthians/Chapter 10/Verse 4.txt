<p>Pulling down [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαιρεσιν] </span></span>. Only in this epistle. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:52">Luke 1:52</span>. Also used of taking down pride, or refuting arguments. </p>

Pompey inflicted a crushing defeat upon their navy off the rocky stronghold of Coracesium on the confines of Cilicia and Pisidia.</p>
