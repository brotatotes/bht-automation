<p>No man shall stop me of this boasting [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η καυχησις αυτη ου φραγησεται εις εμε] </span></span>. Lit., this boasting shall not be blocked up as regards me. The boasting is that of preaching gratuitously. For the verb, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:19">Romans 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:33">Hebrews 11:33</span>.</p>
