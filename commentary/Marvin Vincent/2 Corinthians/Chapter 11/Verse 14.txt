<p>Satan. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:18">Luke 10:18</span>. The rabbinical writings represent the devil rather as the enemy of man than of God or of good. They use none of the New - Testament names for the Evil One except Satan, and contain no mention of a kingdom of Satan. Edersheim says : "Instead of the personified principle of evil to which there is response in us - we have only a clumsy and often a stupid hater." 157 It is also to be observed that in the Septuagint the usage is limited to the enemy of man, as is that of diabolov devil by which Satan is translated.
