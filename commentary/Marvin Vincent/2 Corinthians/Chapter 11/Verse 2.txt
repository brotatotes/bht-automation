I am jealous [ζηλω] . The translation is correct. The word is appropriate to the image which follows, in which Paul represents himself as the marriage - friend who has betrothed the bride to the bridegroom, and consequently shares the bridegroom's jealousy of his bride (see on John 3:29). Compare the Old - Testament passages in which God is represented as the spouse of His people : Isaiah 54:5; Isaiah 61:5; Jeremiah 3:1; Ezekiel 16:8; Hosea 2:18, Hosea 2:19. For the different senses of the word, see on envying, James 3:14. James 3:15 James 3:6 Theodoret's comment on the passage is : "I was your wooer for your husband, and the mediator of your marriage; through me you received the bridegroom's gifts; wherefore I am now affected with jealousy." I have espoused [ηρμοσαμην] . Only here in the New Testament. Lit., have fitted together. Used in the classics of carpenter 's or joiner's work; of arranging music, tuning instruments, and fitting clothes or armor. As here, of betrothing or taking to wife. The Septuagint usage is substantially the same. Present. Compare Ephesians 5:27.
