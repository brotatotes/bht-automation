<p>I am jealous [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλω] </span></span>. The translation is correct. The word is appropriate to the image which follows, in which Paul represents himself as the marriage - friend who has betrothed the bride to the bridegroom, and consequently shares the bridegroom's jealousy of his bride (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:29">John 3:29</span>). Compare the Old - Testament passages in which God is represented as the spouse of His people : <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:5">Isaiah 54:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:5">Isaiah 61:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+3:1">Jeremiah 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:8">Ezekiel 16:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:18">Hosea 2:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:19">Hosea 2:19</span>. For the different senses of the word, see on envying, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:14">James 3:14</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:15">James 3:15</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:6">James 3:6</span> Theodoret's comment on the passage is : "I was your wooer for your husband, and the mediator of your marriage; through me you received the bridegroom's gifts; wherefore I am now affected with jealousy." </p>
<p>I have espoused [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρμοσαμην] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. Lit., have fitted together. Used in the classics of carpenter 's or joiner's work; of arranging music, tuning instruments, and fitting clothes or armor. As here, of betrothing or taking to wife. The Septuagint usage is substantially the same. </p>
<p>Present. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:27">Ephesians 5:27</span>.</p>
