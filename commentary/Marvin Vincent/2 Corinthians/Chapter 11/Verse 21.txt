<p>As concerning reproach [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα ατιμιαν] </span></span>. Better, Rev., by way of disparagement. Intensely ironical. Yes, you have borne with these enslavers and devourers and smiters. I could never ask you to extend such toleration to me. I speak as one without position or authority, having shown myself weak as you know. </p>
<p>I speak foolishly [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αφροσυνη] </span></span>. Rev., in foolishness. My pretensions are equal to theirs, but, of course, it is folly to advance them, and they amount to nothing. Yet, even speaking in this foolish way, I possess every qualification on which they plume themselves.</p>
