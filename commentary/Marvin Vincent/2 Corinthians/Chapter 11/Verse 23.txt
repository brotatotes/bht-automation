<p>Ministers of Christ Referring to his opponents' claim to have a closer connection with Christ than he had. See the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span>. </p>
<p>As a fool [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραφρονων] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. See the kindred parafronia madness, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:16">2 Peter 2:16</span>. Lit., being beside myself Rev., as one beside myself. This expression is stronger than that in ver. 21, because the statement which it characterizes is stronger. Up to this point Paul has been asserting equality with the other teachers. Now he asserts superiority "I more;" and ironically characterizes this statement from their stand - point as madness. </p>

<p>Stripes above measure [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερβαλλοντως] </span></span>. This peculiar form of suffering is emphasized by details. He specifies three Roman scourgings, and five at the hands of the Jews. Of the former, only one is recorded, that at Philippi (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:22">Acts 16:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:23">Acts 16:23</span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:25">Acts 22:25</span>), and none of the latter. The Jewish scourge consisted of two thongs made of calf 's or ass's skin, passing through a hole in a handle. Thirteen blows were inflicted on the breast, thirteen on the right, and thirteen on the left shoulder. The law in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+25:3">Deuteronomy 25:3</span> permitted forty blows, but only thirty - nine were given, in order to avoid a possible miscount. During the punishment the chief judge read aloud <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+28:58">Deuteronomy 28:58</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+28:59">Deuteronomy 28:59</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+29:9">Deuteronomy 29:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:38">Psalms 68:38</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:39">Psalms 68:39</span>. The possibility of death under the infliction was contemplated in the provision which exonerated the executioner unless he should exceed the legal number of blows. Paul escaped Roman scourging at Jerusalem on the ground of his Roman citizenship. It is not related that he and Silas urged this privilege at Philippi until after the scourging. It is evident from the narrative that they were not allowed a formal hearing before the magistrates; and, if they asserted their citizenship, it may have been that their voices were drowned by the mob. That this plea did not always avail appears from the case cited by Cicero against Verres, that he scourged a Roman citizen in spite of his continued protest under the scourge, "I am a Roman citizen" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:37">Acts 16:37</span>), and from well - known instances of the scourging of even senators under the Empire. </p>
