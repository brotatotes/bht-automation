"The rivers of Asia Minor, like all the rivers in the Levant, are liable to violent and sudden changes, and no district in Asia Minor is more singularly characterized by its water - floods than the mountainous tract of Pisidia, where rivers burst out at the bases of huge cliffs, or dash down wildly through narrow ravines" (Conybeare and Howson, 1, ch. 6.). </p>

Paul may have encountered such on his journey to the Pisidian Antioch, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:14">Acts 13:14</span>. Mine own countrymen. Conspiracies of the Jews at Damascus, Lystra, Thessalonica, Beroea, etc. </p>
<p>The Gentiles. As at Philippi and Ephesus. </p>
<p>False brethren. Judaizing Christians, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:4">Galatians 2:4</span>.</p>
