Perils of rivers. From the sudden swelling of mountain streams or flooding of dry water - courses. "The rivers of Asia Minor, like all the rivers in the Levant, are liable to violent and sudden changes, and no district in Asia Minor is more singularly characterized by its water - floods than the mountainous tract of Pisidia, where rivers burst out at the bases of huge cliffs, or dash down wildly through narrow ravines" (Conybeare and Howson, 1, ch. 6.). Robbers. The tribes inhabiting the mountains between the table - land of Asia Minor and the coast were notorious for robbery. Paul may have encountered such on his journey to the Pisidian Antioch, Acts 13:14. Mine own countrymen. Conspiracies of the Jews at Damascus, Lystra, Thessalonica, Beroea, etc. The Gentiles. As at Philippi and Ephesus. False brethren. Judaizing Christians, as Galatians 2:4.
