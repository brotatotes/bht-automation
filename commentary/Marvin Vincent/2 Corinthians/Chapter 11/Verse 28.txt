<p>Those things that are without [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των παρεκτος] </span></span>. Some explain, external calamities; others, the things which are left out in the enumeration, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32">Matthew 5:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:29">Acts 26:29</span>. Better, the latter, so that the literal meaning is, apart from the things which are beside and outside my enumeration : or, as Alford, not to mention those which are beside these. The word does not occur in classical Greek, and no instance of its usage in the former sense occurs in the New Testament or in the Septuagint. See Rev., margin. </p>
<p>That which cometh upon me [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισυστασις] </span></span>. Lit., a gathering together against. Both here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:12">Acts 24:12</span>, the best texts read ejpistasiv onset. Rev., that which presseth upon me. "The crowd of cares." </p>
<p>Farrar remarks upon vers. 23 - 28, that it is "the most marvelous record ever written of any biography; a fragment beside which the most imperiled lives of the most suffering saints shrink into insignificance, and which shows us how fractional at the best is our knowledge of the details of St. Paul 's life." Eleven of the occurrences mentioned here are not alluded to in Acts.</p>
