Another Jesus - another Spirit [αλλον - ετερον] . Rev., another Jesus, a different Spirit. See on Matthew 6:24. Another denies the identity; a different denies the similarity of nature. It is the difference of "individuality and kind" (Alford). See on Galatians 1:6, Galatians 1:7. Ye might well bear [καλως ηνειχεσθε] . Following the reading which makes the verb in the imperfect tense, putting the matter as a supposed case. The Rev. follows the reading ajnecesqe, present tense, and puts it as a fact : ye do well to bear. Lit., ye endure them finely. The expression is ironical. You gladly endure these false teachers, why do you not endure me?
