<p>Another Jesus - another Spirit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλον - ετερον] </span></span>. Rev., another Jesus, a different Spirit. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:24">Matthew 6:24</span>. Another denies the identity; a different denies the similarity of nature. It is the difference of "individuality and kind" (Alford). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:7">Galatians 1:7</span>. </p>
<p>Ye might well bear [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλως ηνειχεσθε] </span></span>. Following the reading which makes the verb in the imperfect tense, putting the matter as a supposed case. The Rev. follows the reading ajnecesqe, present tense, and puts it as a fact : ye do well to bear. Lit., ye endure them finely. The expression is ironical. You gladly endure these false teachers, why do you not endure me?</p>
