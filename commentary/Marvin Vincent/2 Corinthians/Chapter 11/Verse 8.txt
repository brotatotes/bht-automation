<p>I robbed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσυλησα] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament, though it appears in the verb iJerosulew to commit sacrilege, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:22">Romans 2:22</span>, and in iJerosuloi robbers of churches, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:37">Acts 19:37</span>. Originally to strip off, as arms from a slain foe, and thence, generally, to rob, plunder, with the accompanying notion of violence. Paul thus strongly expresses the fact that he had accepted from other churches more than their share, that he might not draw on the Corinthians. </p>
