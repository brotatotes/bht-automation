<p>Finally [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λοιπον] </span></span>. Lit., as for the rest. Sometimes rendered now, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:45">Matthew 26:45</span>. "Sleep on now," for the time that remains. Besides, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:16">1 Corinthians 1:16</span>. It remaineth, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:29">1 Corinthians 7:29</span>. Henceforth, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:13">Hebrews 10:13</span>. Often as here, finally. In every case the idea of something left over is at the bottom of the translation. </p>
<p>Farewell [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρετε] </span></span>. In the classics used both at meeting and at parting. Lit., hail! See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>. Rev., in margin, has rejoice. It is somewhat doubtful whether it ever has the meaning farewell in the New Testament. </p>
<p>Edersheim says that, on Sabbaths, when the outgoing course of priests left the temple, they parted from each other with a farewell, reminding us of this to the Corinthians : "He that has caused His name to dwell in this house cause love, brotherhood, peace, and friendship to dwell among you" (" The Temple, " p. 117). </p>
<p>Be perfect [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταρτιζεσθε] </span></span>. Rev., be perfected. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:40">Luke 6:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:10">1 Peter 5:10</span>. Paul speaks both of individual perfection and of the perfection of the Church through the right adjustment of all its members in Christ. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:10">1 Corinthians 1:10</span>. The verb is kindred with perfecting, ver. 9.</p>
