Finally [λοιπον] . Lit., as for the rest. Sometimes rendered now, as Matthew 26:45. "Sleep on now," for the time that remains. Besides, as 1 Corinthians 1:16. It remaineth, 1 Corinthians 7:29. Henceforth, 2 Timothy 4:8; Hebrews 10:13. Often as here, finally. In every case the idea of something left over is at the bottom of the translation. Farewell [χαιρετε] . In the classics used both at meeting and at parting. Lit., hail! See on James 1:1. Rev., in margin, has rejoice. It is somewhat doubtful whether it ever has the meaning farewell in the New Testament. Edersheim says that, on Sabbaths, when the outgoing course of priests left the temple, they parted from each other with a farewell, reminding us of this to the Corinthians : "He that has caused His name to dwell in this house cause love, brotherhood, peace, and friendship to dwell among you" (" The Temple, " p. 117). Be perfect [καταρτιζεσθε] . Rev., be perfected. See on Luke 6:40; 1 Peter 5:10. Paul speaks both of individual perfection and of the perfection of the Church through the right adjustment of all its members in Christ. Compare 1 Corinthians 1:10. The verb is kindred with perfecting, ver. 9.
