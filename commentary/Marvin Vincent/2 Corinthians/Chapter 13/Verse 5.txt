<p>Examine yourselves [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτους πειραζετε] </span></span>. Yourselves is emphatic. Instead of putting Christ to the test, test yourselves. Rev., try, is better than examine. Examination does not necessarily imply a practical test. It may be merely from curiosity. Trial implies a definite intent to ascertain their spiritual condition. </p>
<p>The faith, See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:7">Acts 6:7</span>. In a believing attitude toward Christ. </p>
<p>Prove [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμαζετε] </span></span>. As the result of trying. </p>
<p>Or know ye not, etc. Assuming that you thus prove yourselves, does not this test show you that Christ is in you as the result of your faith in him? </p>
<p>Reprobates [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδοκιμοι] </span></span>. An unfortunate translation. A retrobate is one abandoned to perdition. The word is kindred to the verb prove [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμαζετε] </span></span>, and means disapproved on trial See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:28">Romans 1:28</span>.</p>
