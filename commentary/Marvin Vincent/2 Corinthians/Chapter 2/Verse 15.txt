A sweet savor of Christ [χριστου ευωδια] . Compare Ephesians 5:2; Philippians 4:18. As so often in Paul 's writings, the figure shifts; the apostolic teachers themselves being represented as an odor, their Christian personality redolent of Christ. It is not merely a sweet odor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself is the savor which exhales in their character and work.
