<p>A sweet savor of Christ [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χριστου ευωδια] </span></span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:2">Ephesians 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:18">Philippians 4:18</span>. As so often in Paul 's writings, the figure shifts; the apostolic teachers themselves being represented as an odor, their Christian personality redolent of Christ. It is not merely a sweet odor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself is the savor which exhales in their character and work.</p>
