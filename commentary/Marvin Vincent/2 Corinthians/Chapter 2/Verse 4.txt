So anguish, from the Latin, angere to choke : anger, which, in earlier English, means affiction, mental torture : anxious : the Latin anguis a snake, marking the serpent by his throttling. In Sanscrit, anhas, from the same root, was the name for sin, the throttler. It reappears obscurely in our medical term quinsy, which was originally quinancy, Greek kunagkh dog - throttling, med., cynanche.</p>
