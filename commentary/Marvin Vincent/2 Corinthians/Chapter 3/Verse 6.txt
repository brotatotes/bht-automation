<p>Hath made us able ministers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικανωσεν ημας διακονους] </span></span>. An unfortunate translation, especially in view of the conventional sense of able. The verb iJkanow from iJkanov sufficient (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</span>), means to make sufficient or fit. It occurs only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:12">Colossians 1:12</span>. The correct sense is given by Rev., hath made us sufficient as ministers.

Of course the term is never applied in the gospels or epistles to the collection of New - Testament writings. </p>
<p>Of the letter [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραμματος] </span></span>. Depending on ministers, not on covenant. For letter, see on writings, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:47">John 5:47</span>. Here used of the mere formal, written ordinance as contrasted with the Gospel, which is "spirit and life."
