<p>The ministration of death [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η διακονια του θανατου] </span></span>. Because it is the ministry of the letter which killeth. The law meant death to the sinner. Written and engraven in stones [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν γραμμασιν εντετυπωμενη λιθοις] </span></span>. Lit., engraven on stones by means of letters. The use of these words to describe a ministration is peculiar. The ministration of death (see above) is that of Moses, and does not apply to his entire career as Israel 's lawgiver, but to his particular ministry in receiving on Sinai and transmitting to the people the law of God. The ministration may be said to have been graven on stones, since the whole purport of that economy which he represented was contained in the tables, and he was its minister in being the agent through whom God delivered it to the people. </p>
<p>Was glorious [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενηθη εν δοξη] </span></span>. A very inadequate translation. Egenhqh means came to pass or took place, not simply was. A glory passed from God to Moses, so that his face became shining. It is much more graphic and truthful to render ejn doxh literally, in or with glory, than to convert the two words into a single adjective, glorious. Rev., much better, came with glory. </p>

<p>Passing away [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταργουμενην] </span></span>. Lit., being done away or brought to nought. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:7">Luke 13:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:3">Romans 3:3</span>.</p>
