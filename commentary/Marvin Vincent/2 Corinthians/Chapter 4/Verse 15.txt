The abundant grace [η χαρις πλεονασασα] . Lit., the grace having abounded. Rev., the grace being multiplied. Grace is the divine gift of spiritual energy which is shown in the labor, suffering, and triumph of the apostles. Might through the thanksgiving of many redound [δια των πλειονων την ευχαριστιαν περισσευση] . Numerous arrangements of these words are proposed. Through [δια] should govern the many, not thanksgiving; and redound should be transitive, cause to abound, and governing thanksgiving. So Rev., the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound. The thought is on the line of ver. 12, that the sufferings and risks of the apostles promote spiritual life in the Church. The grace of God, thus manifest in the apostles, shall be multiplied through the increasing number of those who share it, and shall thus make thanksgiving more abundant for the fruits of this grace as exhibited in the apostles and in the Church. Redound (A. V.) is from the Latin redundare to surge back. Therefore, primarily, of a fullness or overflow from the setting back of a tide. So Milton : "The evil, soon Driven back, redounded as a flood on those From whom it sprang." Generally, to abound. From this arises the secondary sense, to conduce, contribute to; that is, to make the causes mount up, or abound, so as to produce the effect. So Addison : "The care of our national commerce redounds more to the riches and prosperity of the public," etc.
