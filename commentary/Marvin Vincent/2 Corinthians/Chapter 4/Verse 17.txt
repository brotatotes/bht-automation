Our light affliction which is but for a moment [το παραυτικα ελαφρον της θλιψεως ημων] . Lit., the present light (burden) of our affliction. Worketh [κατεργαζεται] . Works out : achieves. A far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory [καθ υπερεβολην εις υπερβολην αιωνιον βαρος δοξης] . Rev., more and more exceedingly an eternal weight, etc. An expression after the form of Hebrew superlatives, in which the emphatic word is twice repeated. Lit., exceedingly unto excess. The use of such cumulative expressions is common with Paul. See, for example, Philippians 1:23, lit., much more better; Romans 8:37, abundantly the conquerors; Ephesians 3:20, exceeding abundantly, etc. Note how the words are offset : for a moment, eternal; light, weight; affliction, glory.
