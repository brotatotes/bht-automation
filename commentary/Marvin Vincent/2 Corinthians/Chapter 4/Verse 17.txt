<p>A far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθ υπερεβολην εις υπερβολην αιωνιον βαρος δοξης] </span></span>. Rev., more and more exceedingly an eternal weight, etc. An expression after the form of Hebrew superlatives, in which the emphatic word is twice repeated. Lit., exceedingly unto excess. The use of such cumulative expressions is common with Paul. See, for example, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span>, lit., much more better; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:37">Romans 8:37</span>, abundantly the conquerors; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:20">Ephesians 3:20</span>, exceeding abundantly, etc. Note how the words are offset : for a moment, eternal; light, weight; affliction, glory.</p>
