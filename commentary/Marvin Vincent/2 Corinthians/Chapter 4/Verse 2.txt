Dishonesty [της αισχυνης] . Rev., more correctly, shame. Compare Ephesians 5:12. Craftiness [πανουργια] . See on Luke 20:23. Handling deceitfully [δολουντες] . Only here in the New Testament. Primarily, to ensnare; then to corrupt. Used of adulterating gold, wine, etc. See on which corrupt, ch. 2 17. This verb has a narrower meaning than the one used there [καπηλευειν] ; for, while that means also to corrupt, it adds the sense for gain 's sake. The Vulgate renders both by the same word, adulterantes. Compare Dante : "Thus did Sabellius, Arias, and those fools Who have been even as swords unto the Scriptures In rendering distorted their straight faces." " Paradiso, " 13, 128 - 130.
