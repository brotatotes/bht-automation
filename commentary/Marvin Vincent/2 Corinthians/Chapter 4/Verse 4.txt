The God of this world [ο θεος του αιωνος τουτου] . The phrase occurs only here. Compare Ephesians 2:2; Ephesians 6:12; John 12:31; John 14:30. Satan is called God in the rabbinical writings. "The first God is the true God; but the second God is Samuel." " The matron said, 'Our God is greater than thy God; for when thy God appeared to Moses in the bush, he hid his face; when, however, he saw the serpent, which is my God, he fled. " ' The light [τον φωτισμον] . Only here and ver. 6. Lit., the illumination, act of enlightening. Image of God. Compare Colossians 1:15; John 17:5; Philippians 2:6; Philippians 3:21. Christ 's light is also God 's. Compare Hebrews 1:3, Rev., effulgence (ajpaugasma, compare aujgasai shine, in this passage). Theodoret says : "The effulgence is both from the fire and with the fire, and has the fire as its cause, yet is not divided from the fire; for whence comes the fire, thence also comes the effulgence." Shine [αυγασαι] . Only here in the New Testament. From aujgh brightness, which also occurs but once, Acts 20:11, daybreak. In classical Greek of the sun especially. Rev., dawn is legitimate as a translation, but hardly here, since Paul is going back to the figure of ch. 3 18.
