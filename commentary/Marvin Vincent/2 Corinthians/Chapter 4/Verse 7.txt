<p>This treasure. The divine light which is the guide and inspiration of the apostolic ministry. </p>
<p>In earthen vessels [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν οστρακινοις σκευεσιν] </span></span>. The adjective occurs only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:10">2 Timothy 2:10</span>. Herodotus says of the king of Persia : "The great king stores away the tribute which he receives after this fashion : he melts it down, and, while it is in a liquid state, runs it into earthen vessels, which are afterward removed, leaving the metal in a solid mass" (iii., 96). Stanley cites the story of a Rabbi who was taunted with his mean appearance by the emperor 's daughter, and who replied by referring to the earthen vessels in which her father kept his wines. At her request the wine was shifted to silver vessels, whereupon it turned sour. Then the Rabbi observed that the humblest vessels contained the highest wisdom. The idea of light in earthen vessels is, however, best illustrated in the story of the lambs and pitchers of Gideon, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:7">Jude 1:7</span>:16. In the very breaking of the vessel the light is revealed. </p>
<p>Excellency [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερβολη] </span></span>. Lit., a throwing beyond. Hence preeminence, excellence. See on exceeding, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:13">Romans 7:13</span>. Rev. renders exceeding greatness. The reference is to the fullness of power apparent in the apostolic ministry. </p>
<p>Of God - of us [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του θεου - εξ ημων] </span></span>. The A. V. misses the difference between the two expressions. Of God is belonging to God; God 's property : from [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span>] is proceeding from ourselves. Rev., of God - from ourselves.</p>
