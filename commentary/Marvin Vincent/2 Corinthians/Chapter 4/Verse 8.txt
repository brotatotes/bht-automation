Troubled [θλιβομενοι] . See on tribulation, Matthew 13:21. The verb also has the meaning of to straiten, contract, as Matthew 7:14, where teqlimmenh, A. V. narrow, is properly rendered by Rev. straitened. Distressed [στενοχωρουμενοι] . Only here and ch. 6 12. From stenov narrow, and cwrov a space. Hence cramped. The A. V. gives no suggestion of the figurative paradox. We are pressed closely, yet not cramped. Rev., pressed on every side, yet not straitened. Perplexed [απορουμενοι] . From aj not, and porov a passage. Lit., to be unable to find a way out. In despair [εξαπορουμενοι] . Rev., very neatly, rendered unto despair. The word expresses an advance of thought on perplexed, yet on the same line. We are perplexed, but not utterly perplexed. The play between the Greek words cannot be rendered.
