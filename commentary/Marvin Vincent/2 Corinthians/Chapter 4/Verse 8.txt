<p>Troubled [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλιβομενοι] </span></span>. See on tribulation, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:21">Matthew 13:21</span>. The verb also has the meaning of to straiten, contract, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:14">Matthew 7:14</span>, where teqlimmenh, A. V. narrow, is properly rendered by Rev. straitened. Distressed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στενοχωρουμενοι] </span></span>. Only here and ch. 6 12. From stenov narrow, and cwrov a space. Hence cramped. The A. V. gives no suggestion of the figurative paradox. We are pressed closely, yet not cramped. Rev., pressed on every side, yet not straitened. </p>
<p>Perplexed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απορουμενοι] </span></span>. From aj not, and porov a passage. Lit., to be unable to find a way out. </p>
<p>In despair [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαπορουμενοι] </span></span>. Rev., very neatly, rendered unto despair. The word expresses an advance of thought on perplexed, yet on the same line. We are perplexed, but not utterly perplexed. The play between the Greek words cannot be rendered.</p>
