Persecuted - forsaken [διωκομενοι - εγκαταλειπομενοι] . Rev., for persecuted, pursued, the primary meaning of the verb, thus giving vividness to the figure. Forsaken, lit., left behind in (some evil plight). The figure is, pursued by enemies, but not left to their power : left in the lurch. Cast down - destroyed [καταβαλλομενοι - απολλυμενοι] . This carries on the previous figure. Though the pursuers overtake and smite down, yet are we not killed. Rev., smitten down. In all these paradoxes the A. V. fails to bring out the metaphors.
