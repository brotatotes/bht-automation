<p>After the flesh [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα σαρκα] </span></span>. "He who knows no man after the flesh, has, for example, in the case of the Jew, entirely lost sight of his Jewish origin; in that of the rich man, of his riches; in that of the learned of his learning; in that of the slave, of his servitude" (Alford). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:28">Galatians 3:28</span>. </p>
<p>Yea though [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ει και] </span></span>. Not with a climactic force, as A. V., and not with the emphasis on Christ, but on have known. The proper sense will be brought out in reading by emphasizing have. We know no man henceforth after the flesh : even if we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now, etc. Paul refers to his knowledge of Christ before his conversion, a hearsay knowledge, confined to reports of His personal appearance, His deeds, His relations to the Jews, His alleged crime and punishment. When the glorified Christ first spoke to him out of heaven, he asked, "Who art thou?" Compare to reveal His Son in me, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:16">Galatians 1:16</span>.</p>
