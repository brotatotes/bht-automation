A new creature [καινη κτισις] . Or creation. Compare Galatians 6:15. The word ktisiv is used in three senses in the New Testament. The act of creating, as Romans 1:20. The sum of created things, as Revelation 3:14; Mark 13:19. A created thing or creature, as Romans 8:39. The Rabbins used the word of a man converted from idolatry. "He who brings a foreigner and makes him a proselyte is as if he created him." Old things [τα αρχαια] . Rev., correctly, the old things. See on 1 John 2:7, and Revelation 12:9. Passed away [παρηλθεν] . Lit., passed by. So Luke 18:37; Mark 6:48. As here, James 1:10; Matthew 5:8; Matthew 24:34, etc. Behold. As if contemplating a rapidly shifting scene. As in a flash, old things vanish, and all things become new.
