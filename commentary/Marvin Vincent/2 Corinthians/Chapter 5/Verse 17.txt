<p>A new creature [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινη κτισις] </span></span>. Or creation. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:15">Galatians 6:15</span>. The word ktisiv is used in three senses in the New Testament. The act of creating, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>. The sum of created things, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:19">Mark 13:19</span>. A created thing or creature, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:39">Romans 8:39</span>. The Rabbins used the word of a man converted from idolatry. "He who brings a foreigner and makes him a proselyte is as if he created him." </p>
<p>Old things [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα αρχαια] </span></span>. Rev., correctly, the old things. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:7">1 John 2:7</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span>. </p>
<p>Passed away [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρηλθεν] </span></span>. Lit., passed by. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:37">Luke 18:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:48">Mark 6:48</span>. As here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:10">James 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:8">Matthew 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:34">Matthew 24:34</span>, etc. </p>
<p>Behold. As if contemplating a rapidly shifting scene. As in a flash, old things vanish, and all things become new.</p>
