<p>Naked [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυμνοι] </span></span>. Without a body. The word was used by Greek writers of disembodied spirits. See the quotation from Plato's "Gorgias" in note on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:20">Luke 12:20</span>; also "Cratylus," 403, where, speaking of Pluto, Socrates says : "The foolish fears which people have of him, such as the fear of being always with him after death, and of the soul denuded [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυμνη</span></span>] of the body going to him." Stanley cites Herodotus' story of Melissa, the Corinthian queen, who appeared to her husband after death, entreating him to burn dresses for her as a covering for her disembodied spirit (v., 92). The whole expression, being clothed - naked is equivalent to we shall not be found naked because we shall be clothed.</p>
