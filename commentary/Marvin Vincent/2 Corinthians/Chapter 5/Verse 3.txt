If so be [ει γε] . Assuming that. Being clothed. Compare Job 10:11. Naked [γυμνοι] . Without a body. The word was used by Greek writers of disembodied spirits. See the quotation from Plato's "Gorgias" in note on Luke 12:20; also "Cratylus," 403, where, speaking of Pluto, Socrates says : "The foolish fears which people have of him, such as the fear of being always with him after death, and of the soul denuded [γυμνη] of the body going to him." Stanley cites Herodotus' story of Melissa, the Corinthian queen, who appeared to her husband after death, entreating him to burn dresses for her as a covering for her disembodied spirit (v., 92). The whole expression, being clothed - naked is equivalent to we shall not be found naked because we shall be clothed.
