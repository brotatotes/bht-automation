<p>Ye Corinthians. The readers are addressed by name in only two other epistles, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:1">Galatians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:15">Philippians 4:15</span>. </p>
<p>Is enlarged [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπλατυνται] </span></span>. Only here, ver. 13, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:5">Matthew 23:5</span>, where it is used of widening the phylacteries. From platuv broad. Quite common in the Septuagint, and with various shades of meaning, but usually rendered enlarge. Of worldly prosperity, "waxed fat," <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+32:15">Deuteronomy 32:15</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:27">Genesis 9:27</span>. Of pride, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+11:16">Deuteronomy 11:16</span>. Of deliverance in distress, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+4:1">Psalms 4:1</span>. Expand with joy, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+19:32">Psalms 19:32</span>. The idea of enlargement of heart in the sense of increased breadth of sympathy and understanding, as here, is also expressed in the Old Testament by other words, as concerning Solomon, to whom God gave largeness of heart, Sept., cuma outpouring. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:5">Isaiah 60:5</span>.</p>
