Concord [συμφωνησις] . Only here in the New Testament. From sun together, fwnh voice. Primarily of the concord of sounds. So the kindred sufwnia, A. V., music, see on Luke 14:25. Compare sumfwnov with consent, 1 Corinthians 7:5; and sumfwnew to agree, Matthew 18:19; Luke 5:36, etc. Belial [βελιαρ] . Beliar. Belial is a transcript of the Hebrew, meaning worthlessness or wickedness. The Septuagint renders it variously by transgressor, impious, foolish, pest. It does not occur in the Septuagint as a proper name. The form Beliar, which is preferred by critics, is mostly ascribed to the Syriac pronunciation of Belial, the change of l into r being quite common. Others, however, derive from Belyar, Lord of the forest. Here a synonym for Satan. Stanley remarks that our associations with the word are colored by the attributes ascribed to Belial by Milton (" Paradise Lost, " B. 2.), who uses the word for sensual profligacy.
