He saith, etc. From Isaiah 49:8, after Septuagint. The Hebrew is : "In the time of favor I answer thee, and in the day of salvation I succor thee." The words are addressed to the servant of Jehovah, promising to invest him with spiritual power, that he may be a light to Israel and to others. Paul, taking the words in their messianic sense, urges that now is the time when God thus dispenses His favor to Christ, and through Him to men. The application turns on the words acceptable time; a time in which God receives. As He receives, receive ye Him. The accepted time [καιρος ευπροσδεκτος] . Rev., acceptable. Paul uses for the simple adjective of the Septuagint a compound "well - received," which is stronger, and which occurs mostly in his own writings. See Romans 14:16, Romans 14:31; 1 Peter 2:5; and compare acceptable year, Luke 4:19.
