<p>Deceivers. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:2">2 Corinthians 4:2</span>. The opinions concerning Paul as a deceiver are mirrored in the Clementine Homilies and Recognitions, spurious writings, ascribed to Clement of Rome, but emanating from the Ebionites, a Judaizing sect, in the latter half of the second century. In these Paul is covertly attacked, though his name is passed over in silence. His glory as the apostle to the Gentiles is passed over to Peter. The readers are warned, in the person of Peter, to beware of any teacher who does not conform to the standard of James, and come with witnesses (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:1">2 Corinthians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:12">2 Corinthians 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:12-18">2 Corinthians 10:12-18</span>). Paul is assailed under the guise of Simon Magus, and with the same words as those in this passage, deceiver and unknown.</p>
