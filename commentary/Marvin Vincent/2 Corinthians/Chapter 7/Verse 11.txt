Sorrowed [λυπηθηναι] . Rev., correctly, were made sorry. The verb is in the passive voice, and is so rendered by the A. V. in ver. 9, but, inconsistently, sorrowed in the next clause. Carefulness [σπουδην] . See on diligence, Romans 12:8. Rev., earnest care. Clearing of yourselves [απολογιαν] . See on 1 Peter 3:15. Exculpation or self - defense from complicity with the incestuous person by their neglect and refusal to humble themselves. Indignation [αγανακτησιν] . Only here in the New Testament. Compare the kindred verb ajganaktew to be indignant, Matthew 20:24; Mark 10:14, etc. Revenge [εκδικησιν] . An unfortunate rendering, because of the personal feeling of vindictiveness which attaches to the popular usage. Rev. avenging is little, if any, better. It is rather meting out of justice; doing justice to all parties. See on Luke 18:3; Luke 21:22. The word has, however, the sense of requital (see on Romans 12:19; compare 2 Thessalonians 1:8), and carries with it, etymologically, the sense of vindication, as Luke 18:7, 2 Corinthians 7:0:8Bengel remarks that the six results of godly sorrow fall into pairs : clearing and indignation relating to the disgrace of the Church; fear and longing (vehement desire) to the apostle; zeal and avenging to the offender.
