<p>Sorrowed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυπηθηναι] </span></span>. Rev., correctly, were made sorry. The verb is in the passive voice, and is so rendered by the A. V. in ver. 9, but, inconsistently, sorrowed in the next clause. </p>
<p>Carefulness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπουδην] </span></span>. See on diligence, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span>. Rev., earnest care. </p>
<p>Clearing of yourselves [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολογιαν] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:15">1 Peter 3:15</span>. Exculpation or self - defense from complicity with the incestuous person by their neglect and refusal to humble themselves. </p>
<p>Indignation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγανακτησιν] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. Compare the kindred verb ajganaktew to be indignant, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:24">Matthew 20:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:14">Mark 10:14</span>, etc. </p>
<p>Revenge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκδικησιν] </span></span>. An unfortunate rendering, because of the personal feeling of vindictiveness which attaches to the popular usage. Rev. avenging is little, if any, better. It is rather meting out of justice; doing justice to all parties. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:3">Luke 18:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:22">Luke 21:22</span>. The word has, however, the sense of requital (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:19">Romans 12:19</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:8">2 Thessalonians 1:8</span>), and carries with it, etymologically, the sense of vindication, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:7">Luke 18:7</span>, </p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:0">2 Corinthians 7:0</span>:8Bengel remarks that the six results of godly sorrow fall into pairs : clearing and indignation relating to the disgrace of the Church; fear and longing (vehement desire) to the apostle; zeal and avenging to the offender.</p>
