<p>Our care for you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την σπουδην ημων την υπερ υμων] </span></span>. The correct text reverses the pronouns and reads your care for us. This difficult passage means that while Paul did desire the punishment and reformation of the offender, and the vindication of the wronged party, his main object was that the fidelity and zeal of the Church toward God should be manifested, as it was (ver. 11). This would appear in the manifestation of their zealous interest for him as God 's minister. He states this as if it were his only object. Manifest unto you is rather among you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς] </span></span>, as in ch. 1 12; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:7">1 Corinthians 16:7</span>.</p>
