Repentance [μετανοιαν] . See on the kindred verb repent, Matthew 3:2, and compare on Matthew 21:29. Repentance is different from regret of ver. 8, indicating a moral change, as is shown by the next clause. Ye might receive damage [ζημιωθητε] . Rev., might suffer loss. See on Matthew 16:26; Luke 9:25. This somewhat obscure sentence means that the salutary moral results of the apostle 's letter compensated for the sorrow which it caused. The epistle which won them to repentance was no damage to them.
