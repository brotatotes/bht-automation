We do you to wit [γνωριζομεν] . An obsolete, though correct rendering. Do is used in the sense of cause or make, as Chaucer : "She that doth me all this woe endure." To wit is to know : Anglo - Saxon, witan; German, wissen; English, wit. So "Legend of King Arthur :" " Now go thou and do me to wit (make me to know) what betokeneth that noise in the field. " Rev., we make known. Trial of affliction [δοκιμη θλιψεως] . Rev., better, proof. See on experience, Romans 5:4. In much affliction, which tried and proved their christian character, their joy and liberality abounded. Deep [κατα βαθους] . An adverbial expression : their poverty which went down to the depths. Liberality [απλοτητος] . Or singleness. See on simplicity, Romans 12:8. It is better to throw the verse into two parallel clauses, instead of making abundance of joy and deep poverty the joint subject of abounded. Render : How that in much proof of affliction was the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches, etc.
