<p>We do you to wit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωριζομεν] </span></span>. An obsolete, though correct rendering. Do is used in the sense of cause or make, as Chaucer : "She that doth me all this woe endure." </p>
<p>To wit is to know : Anglo - Saxon, witan; German, wissen; English, wit. So "Legend of King Arthur :" " Now go thou and do me to wit (make me to know) what betokeneth that noise in the field. " Rev., we make known. Trial of affliction [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμη θλιψεως] </span></span>. Rev., better, proof. See on experience, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:4">Romans 5:4</span>. In much affliction, which tried and proved their christian character, their joy and liberality abounded. </p>
<p>Deep [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα βαθους] </span></span>. An adverbial expression : their poverty which went down to the depths. </p>
<p>Liberality [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απλοτητος] </span></span>. Or singleness. See on simplicity, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span>. It is better to throw the verse into two parallel clauses, instead of making abundance of joy and deep poverty the joint subject of abounded. Render : How that in much proof of affliction was the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches, etc.</p>
