If there be first a willing mind [ει η προθυμια προκειται] . The error of the A. V. consists in regarding pro in prokeitai as indicating priority in time; be first; whereas it signifies position, before one; as "the hope, or the race, or the joy which is set before us." Hebrews 6:18; Hebrews 12:1, Hebrews 12:2; or "the example which is set forth," Jude 1:7. Hence Rev., correctly, if the readiness is there.
