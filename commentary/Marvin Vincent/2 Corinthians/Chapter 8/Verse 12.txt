<p>If there be first a willing mind [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ει η προθυμια προκειται] </span></span>. The error of the A. V. consists in regarding pro in prokeitai as indicating priority in time; be first; whereas it signifies position, before one; as "the hope, or the race, or the joy which is set before us." <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:18">Hebrews 6:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span>; or "the example which is set forth," <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:7">Jude 1:7</span>. Hence Rev., correctly, if the readiness is there.</p>
