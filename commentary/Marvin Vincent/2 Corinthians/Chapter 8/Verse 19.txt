<p>With this grace [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη χαριτι ταυτη] </span></span>. An obscure rendering, not much bettered by Rev. Grace is ambiguous. The reference is, of course, to the contribution as a work of love; cariv being used in the sense of benefaction or bounty. Paul says that the brother was appointed as his fellow - traveller in the matter of this bounty; in the prosecution of this kindly act. For appointed, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:41">Acts 10:41</span>.</p>
