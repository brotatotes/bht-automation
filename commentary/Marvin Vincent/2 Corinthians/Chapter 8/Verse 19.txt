With this grace [εν τη χαριτι ταυτη] . An obscure rendering, not much bettered by Rev. Grace is ambiguous. The reference is, of course, to the contribution as a work of love; cariv being used in the sense of benefaction or bounty. Paul says that the brother was appointed as his fellow - traveller in the matter of this bounty; in the prosecution of this kindly act. For appointed, see on Acts 14:23; Acts 10:41.
