Avoiding this [στελλομενοι τουτο] . The verb, which occurs only here and 2 Thessalonians 3:6, means to arrange or provide for. As preparation involves a getting together of things, it passes into the meaning of collect, gather : then contract, as the furling of sails; so, to draw back, draw one's self away, as 2 Thessalonians 3:6. Connect with we have sent, ver. 18. Compare ch. 12 17, 18, where it appears that he had been charged with collecting money for his own purposes. 150 Abundance [αδροτητι] . Only here in the New Testament. Lit., thickness, and so, of the vigor or strength of the human body or of plants. Thus Hesiod speaks of the ears of corn nodding in their thickness. Herodotus : "When the harvest was ripe or full grown, [αδρος] , he (Alyattes) marched his army into Milesia" (i. 17). Homer of Patroclus : "His soul departed, leaving behind his strength (aJdrothta," 151 "Iliad," 16. 857). Herodotus uses it of thickly - falling snow (iv. 31). In the Septuagint it is used of the rich or great, 1 Kings 1:9, princes (A. V., men of Judah); 2 Kings 10:6, great men. The A. V. abundance is better than Rev. bounty, which, though properly implying abundance, is currently taken as synonymous with gift. The reference is to the large contribution.
