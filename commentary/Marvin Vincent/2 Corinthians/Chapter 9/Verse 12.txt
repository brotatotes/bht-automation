Service [λειτουργιας] . Also rendered ministry or ministration (A. V. and Rev.), as Luke 1:23; Hebrews 8:6; Hebrews 9:21. See on Luke 1:23. The word is used of this same contribution, Romans 14:7. Supplieth [εστιν προσαναπληρουσα] . Lit., fills up by adding to. Only here and ch. 11 9. Supplementing what the saints lack. Through many thanksgivings. The need of the poor is filled, like an empty vessel, to the brim, and the supply overflows in the thanksgiving which it calls out. Thus christian beneficence does a double work, in giving relief and in generating thankfulness.
