<p>Sufficiency [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυταρκειαν] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:6">1 Timothy 6:6</span>. The kindred adjective aujtarkhv A. V., content, occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:11">Philippians 4:11</span> (see note). The word properly means self - sufficiency, and is one of those which show Paul 's acquaintance with Stoicism, and the influence of its vocabulary upon his own. It expressed the Stoic conception of the wise man as being sufficient in himself, wanting nothing and possessing everything. 152 Here, not in the sense of sufficiency of worldly goods, but of that moral quality, bound up with self - consecration and faith, which renders the new self in Christ independent of external circumstances.</p>
