Deceivers [πλανοι] . See on we deceive ourselves, 1 John 1:8. Are entered into [εξηλθαν εις] . Rev., are gone forth into. The A. V. follows the reading eijshlqon entered into. The tense is the aorist, strictly rendered, went forth. It may indicate a particular crisis, at which they went forth from the Christian society. Who confess not [οι μη ομολογουντες] . The article with the participle describes the character of this class of deceivers, and does not merely assert a definite fact concerning them. Compare Mark 14:41, "other women which came up with Him" [αι συνσνσβασαι] . Confess. See on Matthew 7:23; Matthew 10:32. Is come [ερχομενον] . Wrong. The verb is in the present participle, coming, which describes the manhood of Christ as still being manifested. See on 1 John 3:5. In 1 John 4:2 we have the manifestation treated as a past fact by the perfect tense, ejlhluqo. ta has come. Rev., that Jesus Christ cometh. So in 1 Thessalonians 1:10, thv ojrghv thv ejrcomenhv is the wrath which is coming; which has already begun its movement and is advancing : not merely, as A. V., the wrath to come, which makes it wholly a future event. See on lingereth, 2 Peter 2:3. An antichrist [ο αντιχριστος] Rev, rendering the definite article, the antichrist. See on 1 John 2:18.
