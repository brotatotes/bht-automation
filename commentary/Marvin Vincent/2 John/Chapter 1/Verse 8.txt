Look to yourselves that [βλεπετε εαυτους ινα] . %Ina in order that, marks the intent of the caution. See on John 14:13. We lose [απολεσωμεν] . The best texts read ajpoleshte, ye lose. So Rev, with destroy in margin. For the meanings of the verb see on Luke 9:25. We receive [απολαβωμεν] . The best texts read ajpolabhte ye receive. The compounded preposition ajpo, has the force of back : receive back from God. Reward [μισθον] . See on 2 Peter 2:13, and compare Matthew 5:12; John 4:36; 1 Corinthians 3:8; Revelation 11:18; Revelation 22:12.
