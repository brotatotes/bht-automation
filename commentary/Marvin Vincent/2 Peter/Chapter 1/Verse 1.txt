<p>Simon Peter. Note the addition of Simon, and see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span>. The best - attested orthography is Symeon, which is the form of his name in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:14">Acts 14:14</span>, where the account probably came from him. This also is the Hebraic form of the name found in the Septuagint, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+29:33">Genesis 29:33</span>, and elsewhere. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+7:7">Revelation 7:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:25">Luke 2:25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:34">Luke 2:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:30">Luke 3:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>. The combined name, Simon Peter, is found <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:8">Luke 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:6">John 13:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:2">John 20:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15">John 21:15</span>, and elsewhere, though in these instances it is given as Simon; Symeon occurring only in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:14">Acts 14:14</span>. While his name is given with greater familiarity than in the first epistle, his official title, servant and apostle, is fuller. This combination, servant and apostle, occurs in no other apostolic salutation. The nearest approach to it is <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:1">Titus 1:1</span>. </p>
<p>Of Jesus Christ. The word Christ never occurs in the second epistle without Jesus; and only in this instance without some predicate, such as Lord, Savior. </p>
<p>To them that have obtained (toiv lacousin). Lit., obtained by lot. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:9">Luke 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:24">John 19:24</span>. In the sense which it has here it is used by Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:17">Acts 1:17</span>) of Judas, who had obtained part of this ministry. In this sense it occurs only in that passage and here. </p>
<p>Like precious [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισοτιμον] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. The word should be written like - precious. Compare precious in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:19">1 Peter 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:4">1 Peter 2:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:6">1 Peter 2:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:7">1 Peter 2:7</span>. Not the same in measure to all, but having an equal value and honor to those who receive it, as admitting them to the same Christian privileges. With us. Most probably the Jewish Christians, of whom Peter was one. Professor Salmond remarks, "There is much to show how alien it was to primitive Christian thought to regard Gentile Christians as occupying in grace the self - same platform with Christians gathered out of the ancient church of God." See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:17">Acts 11:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:9-11">Acts 14:9-11</span>. </p>
<p>Savior. Frequently applied to Christ in this epistle, but never in the first.</p>
