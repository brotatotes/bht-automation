This also is the Hebraic form of the name found in the Septuagint, Genesis 29:33, and elsewhere. Compare Revelation 7:7; Luke 2:25, Luke 2:34; Luke 3:30; Acts 13:1. The combined name, Simon Peter, is found Luke 5:8; John 13:6; John 20:2; John 21:15, and elsewhere, though in these instances it is given as Simon; Symeon occurring only in Acts 14:14.

Not the same in measure to all, but having an equal value and honor to those who receive it, as admitting them to the same Christian privileges. With us. Most probably the Jewish Christians, of whom Peter was one. Professor Salmond remarks, "There is much to show how alien it was to primitive Christian thought to regard Gentile Christians as occupying in grace the self - same platform with Christians gathered out of the ancient church of God." See Acts 11:17; Acts 14:9-11. Savior. Frequently applied to Christ in this epistle, but never in the first.
