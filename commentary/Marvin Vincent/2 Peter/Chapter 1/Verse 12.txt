I will not be negligent. The A. V. follows the reading oujk ajmelhsw, which it renders correctly. The better reading, however, is mellhsw, I intend, or, as often in classical Greek, with a sense of certainty - I shall be sure, which Rev. adopts, rendering I shall be ready. The formula occurs in but one other passage, Matthew 24:6, where it is translated by the simple future, ye shall hear, with an implied sense, as ye surely will hear. Ye know [ειδοτας] . Lit., knowing. Compare 1 Peter 1:18. Established [εστηριγμενους] . See on 1 Peter 5:10. Perhaps the exhortation, "strengthen thy brethren," may account for his repeated used of this word and its derivatives. Thus, unstable [αστηρικτοι] ; steadfastness [στηριγμου] , 2 Peter 3:16, 2 Peter 3:17. In the present truth [εν τη παρουση αληθεια] . i e., the truth which is present with you through the instruction of your teachers; not the truth at present under consideration. See on ver. 9; and compare the same phrase in Colossians 1:6, rendered, is come unto you.
