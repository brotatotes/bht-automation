<p>I will not be negligent. The A. V. follows the reading oujk ajmelhsw, which it renders correctly. The better reading, however, is mellhsw, I intend, or, as often in classical Greek, with a sense of certainty - I shall be sure, which Rev. adopts, rendering I shall be ready. The formula occurs in but one other passage, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:6">Matthew 24:6</span>, where it is translated by the simple future, ye shall hear, with an implied sense, as ye surely will hear. Ye know [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδοτας] </span></span>. Lit., knowing. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18">1 Peter 1:18</span>. </p>
<p>Established [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστηριγμενους] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:10">1 Peter 5:10</span>. Perhaps the exhortation, "strengthen thy brethren," may account for his repeated used of this word and its derivatives. Thus, unstable [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αστηρικτοι] </span></span>; steadfastness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηριγμου] </span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:16">2 Peter 3:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:17">2 Peter 3:17</span>. </p>
<p>In the present truth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη παρουση αληθεια] </span></span>. i e., the truth which is present with you through the instruction of your teachers; not the truth at present under consideration. See on ver. 9; and compare the same phrase in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:6">Colossians 1:6</span>, rendered, is come unto you.</p>
