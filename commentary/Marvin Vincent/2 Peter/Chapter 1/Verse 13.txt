A figurative expression for the body, used also by Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:4">2 Corinthians 5:4</span>, though he employs the shorter kindred word skhnov. Peter also has the same mixture of metaphors which Paul employs in that passage, viz., building and clothing. See next verse. Peter's use of tabernacle is significant in connection with his words at the transfiguration, " Let us make three tabernacles (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:4">Matthew 17:4</span>). The word, as well as the entire phrase, carries the idea of brief duration - a frail tent, erected for a night. Compare ver. 14. </p>
