<p>Shortly I must put off this my tabernacle [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταχινη εστιν η αποθωσις του σκηνωματος μου] </span></span>. Lit., quick is the putting off of my tabernacle. Rev., the putting off of my tabernacle cometh swiftly. Possibly in allusion to his advanced age. Putting off is a metaphor, from putting off a garment. So Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:3">2 Corinthians 5:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:4">2 Corinthians 5:4</span>, being clothed, unclothed, clothed upon. The word occurs, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:21">1 Peter 3:21</span>, and is used by Peter only. Cometh swiftly, implying the speedy approach of death; though others understand it of the quick, violent death which Christ prophesied he should die. "Even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me." See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:18">John 21:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:19">John 21:19</span>. Compare, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:36">John 13:36</span>, and note the word follow in both passages. "Peter had now learnt the full force of Christ 's sayings, and to what end the following of Jesus was to bring him" (Lumby). </p>
<p>Hath shewed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδηλωσεν] </span></span>. But the tense is the aorist, pointing back to a definite act at a past time (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:18">John 21:18</span>). Hence, shewed me, or, as Rev., signified. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:11">1 Peter 1:11</span>, did signify.</p>
