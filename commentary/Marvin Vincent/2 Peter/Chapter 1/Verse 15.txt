<p>Ye may be able [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχειν υμας] </span></span>. Lit., that you may have it. A similar use of have, in the sense of to be able, occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:8">Mark 14:8</span>. The same meaning is also foreshadowed in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:25">Matthew 18:25</span>, had not to pay; and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:6">John 8:6</span>, have to accuse. </p>
<p>Decease [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξοδον] </span></span>. Exod. is a literal transcript of the word, and is the term used by Luke in his account of the transfiguration. "They spake of his decease." It occurs only once elsewhere, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:22">Hebrews 11:22</span>, in the literal sense, the departing or exodus of the children of Israel. "It is at least remarkable," says Dean Alford, "that, with the recollection of the scene on the mount of transfiguration floating in his mind, the apostle should use so close together the words which were there also associated, tabernacle and decease. The coincidence should not be forgotten in treating of the question of the genuineness of the epistle." </p>
<p>Call to remembrance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνημνη ποιεισθαι] </span></span>. The phrase occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. In classical Greek, to make mention of. An analogous expression is found, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:9">Romans 1:9</span>, mneian poioumai, I make mention. See, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:16">Ephesians 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:2">1 Thessalonians 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:4">Philippians 1:4</span>. Some render it thus here, as expressing Peter's desire to make it possible for his readers to report these things to others. Rev., to call these things to remembrance.</p>
