<p>Came [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηνεχθη] </span></span>. Lit., was born or brought. See on vv. 17, 18. </p>
<p>Holy men of God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιοι θεου ανθρωποι] </span></span>. The best texts omit holy, and read ajpo qeou, from God. Render, as Rev., men spake from God. </p>
<p>Moved [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερομενοι] </span></span>. The same verb as came. Lit., being born along. It seems to be a favorite word with Peter, occurring six times in the two epistles. </p>
