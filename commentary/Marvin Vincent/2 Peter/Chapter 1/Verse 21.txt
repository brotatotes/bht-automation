Came [ηνεχθη] . Lit., was born or brought. See on vv. 17, 18. Holy men of God [αγιοι θεου ανθρωποι] . The best texts omit holy, and read ajpo qeou, from God. Render, as Rev., men spake from God. Moved [φερομενοι] . The same verb as came. Lit., being born along. It seems to be a favorite word with Peter, occurring six times in the two epistles.
