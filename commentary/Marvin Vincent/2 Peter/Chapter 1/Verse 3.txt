<p>Hath granted [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεδωρημενης] </span></span>. This is the only word which Peter and Mark alone have in common in the New Testament; a somewhat singular fact in view of their intimate relations, and of the impress of Peter upon Mark's gospel : yet it tells very strongly against the theory of a forgery of this epistle. The word is stronger than the simple didwmi, to give, meaning to grant or bestow as a gift. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:45">Mark 14:45</span>. </p>
<p>Godliness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευσεβειαν] </span></span>. Used only by Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:12">Acts 3:12</span>), and in the Pastoral Epistles. It is from euj, well, and sebomai, to worship, so that the radical idea is worship rightly directed. Worship, however, is to be understood in it etymological sense, worth - ship, or reverence paid to worth, whether in God or man. So Wycliffe's rendering of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:2">Matthew 6:2</span>, "that they be worshipped of men;" and "worship thy father and thy mother," <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:19">Matthew 19:19</span>. In classical Greek the word is not confined to religion, but means also piety in the fulfilment of human relations, like the Latin pietas. Even in classical Greek, however, it is a standing word for piety in the religious sense, showing itself in right reverence; and is opposed to dussebeia, ungodliness, and ajnosiothv, profaneness. "The recognition of dependence upon the gods, the confession of human dependence, the tribute of homage which man renders in the certainty that he needs their favor - all this is eujsebeia, manifest in conduct and conversation, in sacrifice and prayer." (Nagelsbach, cited by Cremer). This definition may be almost literally transferred to the Christian word. It embraces the confession of the one living and true God, and life corresponding to this knowledge. See on ver. 2. </p>
<p>Called [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλεσαντος] </span></span>. Also used of the divine invitation, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:21">1 Peter 2:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:9">1 Peter 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:10">1 Peter 5:10</span>. </p>
<p>To glory and virtue [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδια δοξη και αρετη] </span></span>. Lit., and properly, by his own glory and virtue, though some read dia doxhv kai ajrethv, through glory and virtue. Rev. adopts the former. The meaning is much the same in either case. </p>
<p>His own [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδια] </span></span>. Of frequent occurrence in Peter, and not necessarily with an emphatic force, since the adjective is sometimes used merely as a possessive pronoun, and mostly so in Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:1">1 Peter 3:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:5">1 Peter 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:16">2 Peter 2:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:22">2 Peter 2:22</span>, etc.). </p>
<p>Virtue. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>. Used by Peter only, with the exception of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:8">Philippians 4:8</span>. The original classical sense of the word had no special moral import, but denoted excellence of any kind - bravery, rank, nobility; also, excellence of land, animals, things, classes of persons. Paul seems to avoid the term, using it only once. </p>
<p>On glory and virtue Bengel says, "the former indicates his natural, the latter his moral, attributes."</p>
