<p>Beside this [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτο τουτο] </span></span>. Wrong. Render, for this very cause, as Rev. Lit., this very thing. Just as ti, what? has come to mean why? So the strengthened demonstrative acquires the meaning of wherefore, for this very cause. </p>
<p>Giving all diligence [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπουδην πασαν παρεισενεγκαντες] </span></span>. The verb occurs only here in New Testament, and means, literally, to bring in by the side of : adding your diligence to the divine promises. So Rev., adding on your part. </p>
<p>Add to your faith, etc. The A. V. is entirely wrong. The verb rendered add [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιχορηγησατε</span></span>] is derived from corov, a chorus, such as was employed in the representation of the Greek tragedies. The verb originally means to bear the expense of a chorus, which was done by a person selected by the state, who was obliged to defray all the expenses of training and maintenance. In the New Testament the word has lost this technical sense, and is used in the general sense of supplying or providing. The verb is used by Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:10">2 Corinthians 9:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:5">Galatians 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:19">Colossians 2:19</span>), and is rendered minister (A. V.), supply (Rev.); and the simple verb corhgew, minister, occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:11">1 Peter 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:10">2 Corinthians 9:10</span>. Here the Rev., properly, renders supply. </p>
<p>To your faith [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη πιστει] </span></span>. The A. V. exhorts to add one virtue to another; but the Greek, to develop one virtue in the exercise of another : "an increase by growth, not by external junction; each new grace springing out of, attempting, and perfecting the other." Render, therefore, as Rev. In your faith supply virtue, and in your virtue knowledge, etc. </p>
<p>Virtue. See on ver. 3, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>. Not in the sense of moral excellence, but of the energy which Christians are to exhibit, as God exerts his energy upon them. As God calls us by his own virtue (ver. 3), so Christians are to exhibit virtue or energy in the exercise of their faith, translating it into vigorous action.</p>
