<p>Be in you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαρχοντα] </span></span>. Rev., are yours; following the sense of possession which legitimately belongs to the verb; as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:21">Matthew 19:21</span>, that thou hast; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:3">1 Corinthians 13:3</span>, goods. In the sense of being the verb is stronger than the simple einai, to be; denoting being which is from the beginning, and therefore attaching to a person as a proper characteristic; something belonging to him, and so running into the idea of rightful possession as above. </p>
<p>Barren [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αργους] </span></span>. From aj, not, and ergon, work. Hence, more correctly, as Rev., idle. Compare "idle word" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:36">Matthew 12:36</span>); "standing idle" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:3">Matthew 20:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:6">Matthew 20:6</span>); also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:13">1 Timothy 5:13</span>. The tautology, barren and unfruitful, is thus avoided. </p>
<p>In the knowledge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις] </span></span>. Rev., more correctly, unto. The idea is not idleness in the knowledge, but idleness is pressing on and developing toward and finally reaching the knowledge. With this agrees the compound ejpignwsin, the constantly increasing and finally full knowledge.</p>
