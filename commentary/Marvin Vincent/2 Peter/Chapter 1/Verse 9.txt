But [γαρ] . Wrong. Render as Rev., for. He that lacketh these things [ω μη παρεστιν ταυτα] . Lit., to whom these things are not present. Note that a different word is used here from that in ver. 8, are yours, to convey the idea of possession. Instead of speaking of the gifts as belonging to the Christian by habitual, settled possession, he denotes them now as merely present with him. Blind [τυφλος] . Illustrating Peter's emphasis on sight as a medium of instruction. See Introduction. And cannot see afar off [μυωπαζω] . Only here in New Testament. From muw, to close, and wy, the eye. Closing or contracting the eyes like short - sighted people. Hence, to be short - sighted. The participle being short - sighted is added to the adjective blind, defining it; as if he had said, is blind, that is, short - sighted spiritually; seeing only things present and not heavenly things. Compare John 9:41. Rev. renders, seeing only what is near. And hath forgotten [ληθην λαβων] . Lit., having taken forgetfulness. A unique expression, the noun occurring only here in the New Testament. Compare a similar phrase, 2 Timothy 1:5, uJpomnhsin labwn, having taken remembrance : A. V., when I call to remembrance : Rev., having been reminded of. Some expositors find in the expression a suggestion of a voluntary acceptance of a darkened condition. This doubtful, however. Lumby thinks that it marks the advanced years of the writer, since he adds to failure of sight the failure of memory, that faculty on which the aged dwell more than on sight. That he was purged [του καθαρισμου] . Rev., more literally, the cleansing.
