<p>But. Introducing a contrast with those who spake by the Holy Ghost (ch. 1 21). </p>
<p>There were [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενοντο] </span></span>. Rev., better, there arose. </p>
<p>There shall be. Note that Peter speaks of them as future, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:4">Jude 1:4</span>) as present. </p>
<p>False teachers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψευδοδιδασκαλοι] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. </p>
<p>Who [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιτινες] </span></span>. Of that kind or class which, etc. </p>
<p>Privily shall bring in [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεισαξουσιν] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. The kindred adjective occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:4">Galatians 2:4</span>, "false brethren privily brought in" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεισακτους] </span></span>. The metaphor is of spies or traitors introducing themselves into an enemy 's camp. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:4">Jude 1:4</span>, crept in unawares. The verb means, literally, to bring [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγειν</span></span>] into [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>] by the side of [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα] </span></span>. </p>
<p>Damnable heresies [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρεσεις απωλειας] </span></span>. Lit., heresies of destruction. Rev., destructive heresies. Heresy is a transcript of airesiv, the primary meaning of which is choice; so that a heresy is, strictly, the choice of an opinion contrary to that usually received; thence transferred to the body of those who profess such opinions, and therefore a sect. So Rev., in margin, sects of perdition. Commonly in this sense in the New Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:17">Acts 5:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:5">Acts 14:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:22">Acts 28:22</span>), though the Rev. has an odd variety in its marginal renderings. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:14">Acts 24:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:19">1 Corinthians 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:20">Galatians 5:20</span>. The rendering heretical doctrines seems to agree better with the context; false teachers bringing in sects is awkward. </p>
<p>Denying. A significant word from Peter. </p>
<p>The Lord [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεσποτην] </span></span>. In most cases in the New Testament the word is rendered master, the Rev. changing Lord to master in every case but two - <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:29">Luke 2:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:24">Acts 4:24</span>; and in both instances putting master in margin, and reserving Lord for the rendering of kuriov. In three of these instances the word is used in direct address to God; and it may be asked why the Rev. changes Lord to Master in the text of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+6:10">Revelation 6:10</span>, and retains Lord in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:29">Luke 2:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:24">Acts 4:24</span>. In five out of the ten occurrences of the word in the New Testament it means master of the household. Originally, it indicates absolute, unrestricted authority, so that the Greeks refused the title to any but the gods. In the New Testament despothv and kuriov are used interchangeably of God, and of masters of servants. </p>
<p>Swift [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταχινην] </span></span>. Used by Peter only. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:14">2 Peter 1:14</span>.</p>
