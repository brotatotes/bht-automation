Power and might [ισχυι και δυναμει] . Rev., might and power. The radical idea of ijscuv, might, is that of indwelling strength, especially as embodied : might which inheres in physical powers organized and working under individual direction, as an army : which appears in the resistance of physical organisms, as the earth, against which one dashes himself in vain : which dwells in persons or things, and gives them influence or value : which resides in laws or punishments to make them irresistible. This sense comes out clearly in the New Testament in the use of the word and of its cognates. Thus, "Love the Lord thy God with all thy strength" (Mark 12:30) : "according to the working of his mighty power" (Ephesians 1:19). So the kindred adjective ijscurov. "A strong man" (Matthew 12:29) : a mighty famine (Luke 14:14) : his letters are powerful (2 Corinthians 10:10) : a strong consolation (Hebrews 6:18) : a mighty angel (Revelation 18:21). Also the verb iJscuw. "It is good for nothing" (Matthew 5:13) : "shall not be able" (Luke 13:24) : "I can do all things" (Philippians 4:13) : "availeth much" (James 5:16). Dunamiv is rather ability, faculty : not necessarily manifest, as ijscuv : power residing in one by nature. Thus ability (Matthew 25:15) : virtue (Mark 5:30) : power (Luke 24:29; Acts 1:8; 1 Corinthians 2:4) : "strengthen of sin" (1 Corinthians 14:56). So of moral vigor. "Strengthened with might in the inner man" (Ephesians 3:16) : "with all might (Colossians 1:11). It is, however, mostly power in action, as in the frequent use of dunameiv for miracles, mighty works, they being exhibitions of divine virtue. Thus" power unto salvation "(Romans 1:16) : the kingdom coming in power" (Mark 9:1) : God himself called power - "the right hand of the power" (Matthew 26:64), and so in classical Greek used to denote the magistrates or authorities. Also of the angelic powers (Ephesians 1:21; Romans 8:38; 1 Peter 3:22). Generally, then, it may be said that while both words include the idea of manifestation or of power in action, ijscuv emphasizes the outward, physical manifestations, and dunamiv the inward, spiritual or moral virtue. Plato (" Protagoras, "350) draws the distinction thus :" I should not have admitted that the able [δυνατους] are strong [ισχυρους] , though I have admitted that the strong are able. For there is a difference between ability [δυναμιν] and strength [ισχυν] . The former is given by knowledge as well as by madness or rage; but strength comes from nature and a healthy state of the body. Aristotle (" Rhet., "1, 5) says" strength [ισχυς] is the power of moving another as one wills; and that other is to be moved either by drawing or pushing or carrying or pressing or compressing; so that the strong [ο ισχυρος] is strong for all or for some of these things. " Railing judgment. Compare Jude 1:9; Zechariah 3:1, Zechariah 3:2.
