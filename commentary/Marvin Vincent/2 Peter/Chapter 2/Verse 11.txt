<p>Power and might [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυι και δυναμει] </span></span>. Rev., might and power. The radical idea of ijscuv, might, is that of indwelling strength, especially as embodied : might which inheres in physical powers organized and working under individual direction, as an army : which appears in the resistance of physical organisms, as the earth, against which one dashes himself in vain : which dwells in persons or things, and gives them influence or value : which resides in laws or punishments to make them irresistible. This sense comes out clearly in the New Testament in the use of the word and of its cognates. Thus, "Love the Lord thy God with all thy strength" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:30">Mark 12:30</span>) : "according to the working of his mighty power" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:19">Ephesians 1:19</span>). So the kindred adjective ijscurov. "A strong man" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:29">Matthew 12:29</span>) : a mighty famine (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:14">Luke 14:14</span>) : his letters are powerful (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>) : a strong consolation (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:18">Hebrews 6:18</span>) : a mighty angel (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+18:21">Revelation 18:21</span>). Also the verb iJscuw. "It is good for nothing" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:13">Matthew 5:13</span>) : "shall not be able" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:24">Luke 13:24</span>) : "I can do all things" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:13">Philippians 4:13</span>) : "availeth much" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:16">James 5:16</span>). </p>
<p>Dunamiv is rather ability, faculty : not necessarily manifest, as ijscuv : power residing in one by nature. Thus ability (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:15">Matthew 25:15</span>) : virtue (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:30">Mark 5:30</span>) : power (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:29">Luke 24:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:8">Acts 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:4">1 Corinthians 2:4</span>) : "strengthen of sin" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:56">1 Corinthians 14:56</span>). So of moral vigor. "Strengthened with might in the inner man" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:16">Ephesians 3:16</span>) : "with all might (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:11">Colossians 1:11</span>). It is, however, mostly power in action, as in the frequent use of dunameiv for miracles, mighty works, they being exhibitions of divine virtue. Thus" power unto salvation "(<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>) : the kingdom coming in power" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:1">Mark 9:1</span>) : God himself called power - "the right hand of the power" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:64">Matthew 26:64</span>), and so in classical Greek used to denote the magistrates or authorities. Also of the angelic powers (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21">Ephesians 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:38">Romans 8:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22">1 Peter 3:22</span>). Generally, then, it may be said that while both words include the idea of manifestation or of power in action, ijscuv emphasizes the outward, physical manifestations, and dunamiv the inward, spiritual or moral virtue. Plato (" Protagoras, "350) draws the distinction thus :" I should not have admitted that the able [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυνατους</span></span>] are strong [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυρους] </span></span>, though I have admitted that the strong are able. For there is a difference between ability [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμιν</span></span>] and strength [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυν] </span></span>. The former is given by knowledge as well as by madness or rage; but strength comes from nature and a healthy state of the body. Aristotle (" Rhet., "1, 5) says" strength [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυς</span></span>] is the power of moving another as one wills; and that other is to be moved either by drawing or pushing or carrying or pressing or compressing; so that the strong [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ισχυρος</span></span>] is strong for all or for some of these things.
