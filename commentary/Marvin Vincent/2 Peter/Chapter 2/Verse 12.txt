As natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed. This massing of epithets is characteristic of Peter. Natural [φυσικα] , Rev., mere animals, should be construed with made, or as Rev., born [γεγεννημενα] . Brute [αλογα] , lit., unreasoning or irrational. Rev., without reason. Compare Acts 25:27. Beasts [ζωα] . Lit., living creatures, from zaw, to live. More general and inclusive than beasts, since it denotes strictly all creatures that live, including man. Plato even applies it to God himself. Hence Rev., properly, creatures. To be taken and destroyed [εις αλωσιν και, φθοραν] . Lit., for capture and destruction. Destruction twice in this verse, and with a cognate verb. Render the whole, as Rev., But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed. Speak evil [βλασφεμουντες] . Participle. Rev., rightly, railing. Compare vv. 10, 11. And shall utterly perish in their own corruption [εν τη φθορα αυτων και φθαρησονται] . There is a play upon the words, which the Rev. reproduces by rendering, "shall in their destroying surely be destroyed." The and, which in the A. V. connects this and the preceding sentence, is rather to be taken with shall be destroyed, as emphasizing it, and should be rendered, as Rev., surely, or as others, even or also. Compare on the whole verse Jude 1:10.
