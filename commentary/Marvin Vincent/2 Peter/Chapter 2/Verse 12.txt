<p>As natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed. This massing of epithets is characteristic of Peter. Natural [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσικα] </span></span>, Rev., mere animals, should be construed with made, or as Rev., born [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγεννημενα] </span></span>. Brute [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλογα] </span></span>, lit., unreasoning or irrational. Rev., without reason. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:27">Acts 25:27</span>. Beasts [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωα] </span></span>. Lit., living creatures, from zaw, to live. More general and inclusive than beasts, since it denotes strictly all creatures that live, including man. Plato even applies it to God himself. Hence Rev., properly, creatures. To be taken and destroyed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις αλωσιν και, φθοραν] </span></span>. Lit., for capture and destruction. Destruction twice in this verse, and with a cognate verb. Render the whole, as Rev., But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed. </p>
<p>Speak evil [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλασφεμουντες] </span></span>. Participle. Rev., rightly, railing. Compare vv. 10, 11. </p>
<p>And shall utterly perish in their own corruption [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη φθορα αυτων και φθαρησονται] </span></span>. There is a play upon the words, which the Rev. reproduces by rendering, "shall in their destroying surely be destroyed." The and, which in the A. V. connects this and the preceding sentence, is rather to be taken with shall be destroyed, as emphasizing it, and should be rendered, as Rev., surely, or as others, even or also. Compare on the whole verse <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:10">Jude 1:10</span>.</p>
