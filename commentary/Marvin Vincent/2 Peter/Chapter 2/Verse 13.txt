<p>And shall receive [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κομιουμενοι] </span></span>. Lit., being about or destined to receive. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:9">1 Peter 1:9</span>, and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span>. Some good texts read ajdikoumenoi, suffering wrong. So Rev., suffering wrong as the hire of wrong - doing. </p>
<p>Reward of unrighteousness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθον αδικιας] </span></span>. Misqov is hire, and so is rendered in Rev. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:8">Matthew 20:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:7">Luke 10:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:36">John 4:36</span>. It also has in classical Greek the general sense of reward, and so very often in the New Testament, in passages where hire or wages would be inappropriate. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:12">Matthew 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1">Matthew 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:41">Matthew 10:41</span>. Hire would seem to be better here, because of the reference to Balaam in ver. 15, where the word occurs again and requires that rendering. The phrase misqov, reward or wages of iniquity, occurs only here and in Peter's speech concerning Judas (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:18">Acts 1:18</span>), where the Rev. retains the rendering of the A. V., reward of iniquity. It would have been better to render wages of iniquity in both places. Iniquity and unrighteousness are used in English almost synonymously; though, etymologically, iniquity emphasizes the idea of injustice (inaequus), while unrighteousness (non - rightness) is more general, implying all deviation from right, whether involving another's interests or not. This distinction is not, however, observed in the Rev., where the rendering of adikia, and of the kindred adjective adikov, varies unaccountably, if not capriciously, between unrighteous and unjust. As they that count it pleasure to riot [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδονην ηγουμενοι τρυφην] </span></span>. The as of the A. V. is needless. The discourse proceeds from ver. 13 by a series of participles, as far as following (ver. 15). Literally the passage runs, counting riot a pleasure. </p>
<p>Riot [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρυφην] </span></span>. Meaning rather daintiness, delicacy, luxuriousness. Even the Rev. revel is almost too strong. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:25">Luke 7:25</span>, the only other passage where the word occurs, and where the Rev. retains the A. V., live delicately. So, also, Rev. substitutes, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:5">James 5:5</span>, lived delicately for lived in pleasure. </p>
<p>In the daytime. Compare Peter's words <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:15">Acts 2:15</span>; also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:7">1 Thessalonians 5:7</span>. </p>
<p>Spots [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπιλοι] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:27">Ephesians 5:27</span>. Compare the kindred participle spotted (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:23">Jude 1:23</span>), and defileth (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:0">James 3:0</span>; 6). </p>
<p>Blemishes [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωμοι] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. The negatives of the two terms spots and blemishes occur at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:19">1 Peter 1:19</span>. </p>
<p>Sporting themselves [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντρυφωντες] </span></span>. From trufh, luxuriousness. See on riot. Rev., revelling. </p>
<p>With their own deceivings [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ταις απαταις αυτων] </span></span>. The Rev., however, follows another reading, which occurs in the parallel passage <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:12">Jude 1:12</span> ajgapaiv, love - feasts, the public banquets instituted by the early Christians, and connected with the celebration of the Lord 's Supper. Rev. renders revelling in their love - feasts, though the American Committee insist on deceivings. On the abuses at these feasts, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:20-22">1 Corinthians 11:20-22</span>. For auJtwn, their own, the best texts read aujtwn, their. While they feast with you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνευωχουμενοι] </span></span>. The word originally conveys the idea of sumptuous feasting, and is appropriate in view of the fact to which Peter alludes, that these sensualists converted the love - feast into a revel. Compare Paul 's words, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:21">1 Corinthians 11:21</span>, "one is hungry and another drunken." This seems to favor the reading ajgapaiv. The word occurs only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:12">Jude 1:12</span>.</p>
