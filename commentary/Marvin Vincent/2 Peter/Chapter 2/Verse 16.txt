Was rebuked [ελεγξιν εσχεν] . Lit., had a rebuke. The word for rebuke only here in New Testament. For his iniquity [ιδιας παρανομιας] . Rev., his own transgression. His own, see on ch. 2 Peter 1:3. Transgression, from para, contrary to, and nomov, law. Only here in New Testament. Compare the kindred verb paranomew, also occurring but once, Acts 23:3, where see note on contrary to the law. The dumb ass. Inserting an article not in the text, and omitted by Rev. Ass [υποζυγιον] . Lit., beast of burden. An animal subjected to the yoke. From uJpo, beneath, and zugon, a yoke. See on Matthew 21:5. Speaking [φθεγξαμενον] . The verb is found in Peter only, here and ver. 18, and in Acts 4:18, a Petrine narrative. It is well chosen, however. The verb denotes the utterance of a sound or voice, not only by man, but by any animal having lungs. Hence, not only of men's articulate cries, such as a battle - shout, but of the neigh of the horse, the scream of the eagle, the croak of a raven. It is also applied to sounds made by inanimate things, such as thunder, a trumpet, a lyre, the ring of an earthen vessel, showing whether it is cracked or not. Schmidt (" Synonymik ") says that it does not indicate any physical capability on the part of the man, but describes the sound only from the hearer's stand - point. In view of this general sense of the verb, the propriety is apparent of the defining phrase, with man's voice. Forbad [εκωλυσεν] . Rather, hindered, or, as Rev., stayed. Compare Acts 8:36; Romans 1:13, Rev. Madness [παραφρονιαν] . Only here in New Testament. But compare the kindred verb parafronew (2 Corinthians 11:23), in the phrase, "I speak as a fool." From para, beside, and frhn, the mind; and so equivalent to the phrase, beside one's self.
