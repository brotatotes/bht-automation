<p>Was rebuked [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγξιν εσχεν] </span></span>. Lit., had a rebuke. The word for rebuke only here in New Testament. </p>
<p>For his iniquity [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιας παρανομιας] </span></span>. Rev., his own transgression. His own, see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:3">2 Peter 1:3</span>. Transgression, from para, contrary to, and nomov, law. Only here in New Testament. Compare the kindred verb paranomew, also occurring but once, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:3">Acts 23:3</span>, where see note on contrary to the law. </p>
<p>The dumb ass. Inserting an article not in the text, and omitted by Rev. Ass [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποζυγιον] </span></span>. Lit., beast of burden. An animal subjected to the yoke. From uJpo, beneath, and zugon, a yoke. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:5">Matthew 21:5</span>. Speaking [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθεγξαμενον] </span></span>. The verb is found in Peter only, here and ver. 18, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:18">Acts 4:18</span>, a Petrine narrative. It is well chosen, however. The verb denotes the utterance of a sound or voice, not only by man, but by any animal having lungs. Hence, not only of men's articulate cries, such as a battle - shout, but of the neigh of the horse, the scream of the eagle, the croak of a raven. It is also applied to sounds made by inanimate things, such as thunder, a trumpet, a lyre, the ring of an earthen vessel, showing whether it is cracked or not. Schmidt (" Synonymik ") says that it does not indicate any physical capability on the part of the man, but describes the sound only from the hearer's stand - point. In view of this general sense of the verb, the propriety is apparent of the defining phrase, with man's voice. </p>
<p>Forbad [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκωλυσεν] </span></span>. Rather, hindered, or, as Rev., stayed. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:36">Acts 8:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:13">Romans 1:13</span>, Rev. </p>
<p>Madness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραφρονιαν] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. But compare the kindred verb parafronew (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span>), in the phrase, "I speak as a fool." From para, beside, and frhn, the mind; and so equivalent to the phrase, beside one's self.</p>
