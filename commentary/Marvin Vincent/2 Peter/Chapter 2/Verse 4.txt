The angels. No article. Angels. So Rev. Compare Jude 1:6. Cast them down to hell [ταρταρωσας] . Only here in New Testament. From Tartarov, Tartarus. It is strange to find Peter using this Pagan term, which represents the Greek hell, though treated here not as equivalent to Gehenna, but as the place of detention until the judgment. Chains of darkness [σειραις ζοφου] . Seira is a cord or band, sometimes of metal. Compare Septuagint, Proverbs 5:22; Wisd. of Sol 17:2, 18. The best texts, however, substitute siroiv or seiroiv, pits or caverns. Sirov originally is a place for storing corn. Rev., pits of darkness. Of darkness [ζοφου] . Peculiar to Peter and Jude. Originally of the gloom of the nether world, So Homer : "These halls are full Of shadows hastening down to Erebus Amid the gloom [υπο ζοφον] ." Odyssey, 20, 355. When Ulysses meets his mother in the shades, she says to him : "How didst thou come, my child, a living man, Into this place of darkness ? [υπο ζοφον] ." Odyssey, 11, 155. Compare Jude 1:13. So Milton : "Here their prison ordained In utter darkness, and their portion set As far removed from God and light of heaven As from the center thrice to the utmost pole." Paradise Lost, 1, 71 - 74. And Dante : "That air forever black." Inferno, 3, 329. "Upon the verge I found me Of the abysmal valley dolorous That gather thunder of infinite ululations. Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous, So that by fixing on its depths my sight Nothing whatever I discerned therein." Inferno, 4, 7, 12. "I came unto a place mute of all light." Inferno, 5, 28. To be reserved [τηρουμενους] . Lit., being reserved. See on 1 Peter 1:4, "reserved in heaven."
