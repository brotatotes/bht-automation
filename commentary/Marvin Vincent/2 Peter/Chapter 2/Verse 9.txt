Godly [ευσεβεις] . Used by Peter only. Compare Acts 10:2, Acts 10:7. The reading at Acts 22:12, is eujlabhv, devout. See on ch. 2 Peter 1:3. Temptation [πειρασμου] . See on 1 Peter 1:6. To reserve [τηρειν] . See on 1 Peter 1:4. Rev., keep, is not an improvement. To be punished [κολαζομενους] . Only here and Acts 4:21, where the narrative probably came from Peter. The participle here is, lit., being punished, and therefore the A. V. is wrong. Rev., rightly, under punishment. Compare Matthew 25:46.
