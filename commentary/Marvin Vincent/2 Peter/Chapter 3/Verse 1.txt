<p>Pure minds [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειλικρινη διανοιαν] </span></span>. The latter word is singular, not plural. Hence, as Rev., mind. The word rendered pure is often explained tested by the sunlight; but this is very doubtful, since eilh, to which this meaning is traced, means the heat, and not the light of the sun. Others derive it from the root of the verb eiJlissw, to roll, and explain it as that which is separated or sifted by rolling, as in a sieve. In favor of this etymology is its association in classical Greek with different words meaning unmixed. The word occurs only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:10">Philippians 1:10</span>. The kindred noun eijlikrineia, sincerity, is found <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:8">1 Corinthians 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span>. Rev., here, sincere. </p>
<p>Mind [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διανοιαν] </span></span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:13">1 Peter 1:13</span>; and see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:30">Mark 12:30</span>.</p>
