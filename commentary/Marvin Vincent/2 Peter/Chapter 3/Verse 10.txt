<p>The day of the Lord. Compare the same phrase in Peter's sermon, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:20">Acts 2:20</span>. It occurs only in these two passages and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:2">1 Thessalonians 5:2</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:8">1 Corinthians 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:14">2 Corinthians 1:14</span>. </p>
<p>As a thief. Omit in the night. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:43">Matthew 24:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:2">1 Thessalonians 4:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:4">1 Thessalonians 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+3:3">Revelation 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+16:15">Revelation 16:15</span>. </p>
<p>With a great noise [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ροιζηδον] </span></span>. An adverb peculiar to Peter, and occurring only here. It is a word in which the sound suggest the sense (rhoizedon); and the kindred noun, rJoizov, is used in classical Greek of the whistling of an arrow; the sound of a shepherd 's pipe; the rush of wings; the plash of water; the hissing of a serpent; and the sound of filing. The elements [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοιχεια] </span></span>. Derived from stoicov, a row, and meaning originally one of a row or series; hence a component or element. The name for the letters of the alphabet, as being set in rows. Applied to the four elements - fire, air, earth, water; and in later times to the planets and signs of the zodiac. It is used in an ethical sense in other passages; as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:3">Galatians 4:3</span>, "elements or rudiments of the world." Also of elementary teaching, such as the law, which was fitted for an earlier stage in the world 's history; and of the first principles of religious knowledge among men. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:8">Colossians 2:8</span>, of formal ordinances. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span>. The kindred verb stoicew, to walk, carries the idea of keeping in line, according to the radical sense. Thus, walk according to rule (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:16">Galatians 6:16</span>); walkest orderly (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:24">Acts 21:24</span>). So, too, the compound sustoicew, only in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:25">Galatians 4:25</span>, answereth to, lit., belongs to the same row or column with. The Greek grammarians called the categories of letters arranged according to the organs of speech sustoiciai. Here the word is of course used in a physical sense, meaning the parts of which this system of things is composed. Some take it as meaning the heavenly bodies, but the term is too late and technical in that sense. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span>, the powers of the heaven. </p>
<p>Shall melt [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυθησονται] </span></span>. More literally, as Rev., shall be dissolved. With fervent heat [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυσουμενα] </span></span>. Lit., being scorched up.</p>
