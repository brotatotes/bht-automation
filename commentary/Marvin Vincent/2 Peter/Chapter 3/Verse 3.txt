<p>Scoffers walking [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμπαικται πορευομενοι] </span></span>. This is the reading followed by A. V. But the later texts have added ejmpaigmonh, in mockery, occurring only here, though a kindred word for mockings [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμπαιγμων</span></span>] is found <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:36">Hebrews 11:36</span>. This addition gives a play upon the words; and so Rev., "Mockers shall come with mockery, walking," etc.</p>
