<p>From the beginning of the creation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ αρχης κτισεως] </span></span>. Not a common phrase. It occurs only <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:6">Mark 10:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:19">Mark 13:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>. Fell asleep [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκοιμηθησαν] </span></span>. A literal and correct translation of the word, which occurs frequently in the New Testament, but only here in Peter. Some have supposed that the peculiarly Christian sense of the word is emphasized ironically by these mockers. It is used, however, in classical Greek to denote death. The difference between the pagan and the Christian usage lies in the fact that, in the latter, it was defined by the hope of the resurrection, and therefore was used literally of a sleep, which, though long, was to have an awaking. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:60">Acts 7:60</span>.</p>
