<p>This they willingly are ignorant of [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λανθανει αυτους τουτο θελοντας] </span></span>. Lit., this escapes them of their own will. Rev., this they wilfully forget. </p>
<p>The heavens were. But the Greek has not article. Render, there were heavens. So, too, not the earth, but an earth, as Rev. </p>
<p>Standing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεστωσα] </span></span>. Incorrect; for the word is, literally, standing together; i e., compacted or formed. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:17">Colossians 1:17</span>, consist. Rev., compacted. </p>
<p>Out of the water. Again no article. Render out of water; denoting not the position of the earth, but the material or mediating element in the creation; the waters being gathered together in one place, and the dry land appearing. Or, possibly, with reference to the original liquid condition of the earth - without form and void. </p>
<p>In the water [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι υδατος] </span></span>. Omit the article. Dia has its usual sense here, not as Rev., amidst, but by means of. Bengel : "The water served that the earth should consist." Expositors are much divided as to the meaning. This is the view of Huther, Salmond, and, substantially, Alford.</p>
