Is not slack [ου βραδυνει] . Only here and 1 Timothy 3:15. The word is literally to delay or loiter. So Septuagint, Genesis 43:10, "except we had lingered." Alford's rendering, is not tardy, would be an improvement. The word implies, besides delay, the idea of lateness with reference to an appointed time. Come [χωρησαι] . Move on, or advance to.
