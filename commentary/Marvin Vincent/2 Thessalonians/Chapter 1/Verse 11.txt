<p>Wherefore [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ο] </span></span>. Better, to which end. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:29">Colossians 1:29</span>. The end is, "that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God," ver. 5. The same thought is continued in ver. 11. </p>
<p>Count - worthy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιωση] </span></span>.

Your calling [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της κλησεως] </span></span>. Including both the act and the end of the Christian calling.

<p>All the good pleasure of his goodness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασαν ευδοκιαν αγαθωσυνης] </span></span>. Wrong. Paul does not mean all the goodness which God ts pleased to bestow, but the delight of the Thessalonians in goodness. He prays that God may perfect their pleasure in goodness. So Weizsacker, die Freude an allem Guten. The Rev. desire for eujdokian is infelicitous, and lacks support. Agaqwsunh goodness (P. see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:19">Romans 3:19</span>) is never predicated of God in N. T. In LXX, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ne+9:25">Nehemiah 9:25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ne+9:35">Nehemiah 9:35</span>. Eudokia good pleasure, delight, is a purely Biblical word. As related to one's self, it means contentment, satisfaction : see Sir. 29 23; Ps. of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="so+3:4">Song of Solomon 3:4</span>; 16 12. As related to others, good will, benevolence. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:5">Ephesians 1:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:9">Ephesians 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:15">Philippians 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:13">Philippians 2:13</span>; Ps. of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="so+8:39">Song of Solomon 8:39</span>.</p>
