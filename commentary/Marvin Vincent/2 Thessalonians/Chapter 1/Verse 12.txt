<p>The name [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ονομα] </span></span>. In no case where it is joined with Jesus, or Christ, or Lord Jesus, does it mean the title or dignity. 33 Paul follows O. T. usage, according to which the name of the Lord is often used for all that the name covers; so that the name of the Lord = the Lord himself. </p>
<p>ADDITIONAL NOTE ON oleqron aijwnion eternal destruction, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:9">2 Thessalonians 1:9</span>. </p>
<p>Aiwn transliterated eon, is a period of time of longer or shorter duration, having a beginning and an end, and complete in itself. Aristotle (peri oujranou, 1 9, 15) says : "The period which includes the whole time of each one's life is called the eon of each one." Hence it often means the life of a man, as in Homer, where one's life [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιων</span></span>] is said to leave him or to consume away (Il 5:685; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ob+1:5">Obadiah 1:5</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ob+1:160">Obadiah 1:160</span>). It is not, however, limited to human life; it signifies any period in the course of events, as the period or age before Christ; the period of the millenniam; the mytho - logical period before the beginnings of history. The word has not "a stationary and mechanical value" (De Quincey). It does not mean a period of a fixed length for all cases. There are as many eons as entities, the respective durations of which are fixed by the normal conditions of the several entities. There is one eon of a human life, another of the life of a nation, another of a crow's life, another of an oak's life. The length of the eon depends on the subject to which it is attached. </p>
<p>It is sometimes translated world; world representing a period or a series of periods of time. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:32">Matthew 12:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:40">Matthew 13:40</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:49">Matthew 13:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:70">Luke 1:70</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:20">1 Corinthians 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21">Ephesians 1:21</span>. Similarly oiJ aijwnev the worlds, the universe, the aggregate of the ages or periods, and their contents which are included in the duration of the world. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:11">1 Corinthians 10:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:26">Hebrews 9:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:3">Hebrews 11:3</span>. </p>
<p>The word always carries the notion of time, and not of eternity. It always means a period of time. Otherwise it would be impossible to account for the plural, or for such qualifying expressions as this age, or the age to come. It does not mean something endless or everlasting. To deduce that meaning from its relation to ajei is absurd; for, apart from the fact that the meaning of a word is not definitely fixed by its derivation, ajei does not signify endless duration. When the writer of the Pastoral Epistles quotes the saying that the Cretans are always [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αει</span></span>] liars (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:12">Titus 1:12</span>), he surely does not mean that the Cretans will go on Iying to all eternity. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:51">Acts 7:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:11">2 Corinthians 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:10">2 Corinthians 6:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:10">Hebrews 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:15">1 Peter 3:15</span>. Aei means habitually or continually within the limit of the subject's life. In our colloquial dialect everlastingly is used in the same way. "The boy is everlastingly tormenting me to buy him a drum." </p>
<p>In the New Testament the history of the world is conceived as developed through a succession of eons. A series of such eons precedes the introduction of a new series inaugurated by the Christian dispensation, and the end of the world and the second coming of Christ are to mark the beginning of another series. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:11">Ephesians 3:11</span>. Paul contemplates eons before and after the Chuistian era. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21">Ephesians 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:7">Ephesians 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:9">Ephesians 3:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:21">Ephesians 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:11">1 Corinthians 10:11</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:26">Hebrews 9:26</span>. He includes the series of eons in one great eon, oJ aijwn twn aijwnwn the eon of the eons (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:21">Ephesians 3:21</span>); and the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews describes the throne of God as enduring unto the eon of the eons (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:8">Hebrews 1:8</span>). The plural is also used, eons of the eons, signifying all the successive periods which make up the sum total of the ages collectively. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:27">Romans 16:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:5">Galatians 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:20">Philippians 4:20</span>, etc. This plural phrase is applied by Paul to God only. The adjective aijwniov in like manner carries the idea of time. Neither the noun nor the adjective, in themselves, carry the sense of endless or everlasting. They may acquire that sense by their connotation, as, on the other hand, ajidiov, which means everlasting, has its meaning limited to a given point of time in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:6">Jude 1:6</span>. Aiwniov means enduring through or pertaining to a period of time. Both the noun and the adjective are applied to limited periods. Thus the phrase eijv ton aijwna, habitually rendered forever, is often used of duration which is limited in the very nature of the case. See, for a few out of many instances, LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:6">Exodus 21:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:9">Exodus 29:9</span>; xxxii. 13; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jos+14:9">Joshua 14:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+8:13">1 Samuel 8:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+25:46">Leviticus 25:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+14:17">Deuteronomy 14:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ch+28:4">1 Chronicles 28:4</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:19">Matthew 21:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:8">John 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:13">1 Corinthians 8:13</span>. The same is true of aijwniov. Out of 150 instances in LXX, four - fifths imply limited duration. For a few instances see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:4">Genesis 48:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+10:8">Numbers 10:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:15">Numbers 14:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+22:28">Proverbs 22:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jon+2:6">Jonah 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="hab+3:6">Habakkuk 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:17">Isaiah 61:17</span>. Words which are habitually applied to things temporal or material can not carry in themselves the sense of endlessness. Even when applied to God, we are not forced to render aijwniov everlasting. Of course the life of God is endless; but the question is whether, in describing God as aijwniov,. it was intended to describe the duration of his being, or whether some different and larger idea was not contemplated. That God lives longer than men, and lives on everlastingly, and has lived everlastingly, are, no doubt, great and significant facts; yet they are not the dominant or the most impressive facts in God 's relations to time. God 's eternity does not stand merely or chiefly for a scale of length. It is not primarily a mathematical but a moral fact. The relations of God to time include and imply far more than the bare fact of endless continuance. They carry with them the fact that God transcends time; works on different principles and on a vaster scale than the wisdom of time provides; oversteps the conditions and the motives of time; marshals the successive eons fronn a point outside of time, on lines which run out into his own measureless cycles, and for sublime moral ends which the creature of threescore and ten years cannot grasp and does not even suspect. </p>
<p>There is a word for everlasting if that idea is demanded. That aijwniov occurs rarely in the New Testament and in LXX does not prove that its place was taken by aijwniov. It rather goes to show that less importance was attached to the bare idea of everlastingness than later theological thought has given it. Paul uses the word once, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>, where he speaks of "the everlasting power and divinity of God." In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:26">Romans 16:26</span> he speaks of the eternal God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του αιωνιου θεου] </span></span>; but that he does not mean the everlasting God is perfectly clear from the context. He has said that "the mystery" has been kept in silence in times eternal [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρονοις αιωνιοις] </span></span>, by which he does not mean everlasting times, but the successive eons which elapsed before Christ was proclaimed. God therefore is described as the God of the eons, the God who pervaded and controlled those periods before the incarnation. To the same effect is the title oJ basileuv twn aijwnwn the King of the eons, applied to God in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:17">1 Timothy 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+14:3">Revelation 14:3</span>; comp. Tob. 13 6, 10. The phrase pro cronwn aijwniwn before eternal times (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:2">Titus 1:2</span>), cannot mean before everlasting times. To say that God bestowed grace on men, or promised them eternal life before endless times, would be absurd. The meaning is of old, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:70">Luke 1:70</span>. The grace and the promise were given in time, but far back in the ages, before the times of reckoning the eons. Zwh aijwniov eternal life, which occurs 42 times in N. T., but not in LXX, is not endless life, but life pertaining to a certain age or eon, or continuing during that eon. I repeat, life may be endless. The life in union with Christ is endless, but the fact is not expressed by aijwniov. Kolasiv aijwniov, rendered everlasting punishment (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:46">Matthew 25:46</span>), is the punishment peculiar to an eon other than that in which Christ is speaking. In some cases zwh aijwniov does not refer specifically to the life beyond time, but rather to the eon or dispensation of Messiah which succeeds the legal dispensation. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:16">Matthew 19:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:39">John 5:39</span>. John says that zwh aijwniov is the present possession of those who believe on the Son of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:47">John 6:47</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:64">John 6:64</span>. The Father 's commandment is zwh aijwviov, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:50">John 12:50</span>; to know the only true God and Jesus Christ is zwh aijwniov, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>. </p>
<p>Bishop Westcott very justly says, commenting upon the terms used by John to describe life under different aspects : "In considering these phrases it is necessary to premise that in spiritual things we must guard against all conclusions which rest upen the notions of succession and duration. 'Eternal life ' is that which St. Paul speaks of as hJ ontwv zwh the life which is life indeed, and hJ zwh tou qeou the life of God. It is not an endless duration of being in time, but being of which time is not a measure. We have indeed no powers to grasp the idea except through forms and images of sense. These must be used, but we must not transfer them as realities to another order." 34 Thus, while aijwniov carries the idea of time, though not of endlessness, there belongs to it also, more or less, a sense of quality. Its character is ethical rather than mathematical. The deepest significance of the life beyond time lies, not in endlessness, but in the moral quality of the eon into which the life passes. It is comparatively unimportant whether or not the rich fool, when his soul was required of him (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:20">Luke 12:20</span>), entered upon a state that was endless. The principal, the tremendous fact, as Christ unmistakably puts it, was that, in the new eon, the motives, the aims, the conditions, the successes and awards of time counted for nothing. In time, his barns and their contents were everything; the soul was nothing. In the new life the soul was first and everything, and the barns and storehouses nothing. The bliss of the sanctified does not consist primarily in its endlessness, but in the nobler moral conditions of the new eon, - the years of the holy and eternal God. Duration is a secondary idea. When it enters it enters as an accompaniment and outgrowth of moral conditions. In the present passage it is urged that oleqron destruction points to an unchangeable, irremediable, and endless condition. If this be true, if oleqrov is extinction, then the passage teaches the annihilation of the wicked, in which case the adjective aijwniov is superfluous, since extinction is final, and excludes the idea of duration. But oleqrov does not always mean destruction or extinction. Take the kindred verb ajpollumi to destroy, put an end to, or in the middle voice, to be lost, to perish. Peter says, "the world being deluged with water, perished" (ajpolountai <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:6">2 Peter 3:6</span>); but the world did not become extinct, it was renewed. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:11">Hebrews 1:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:12">Hebrews 1:12</span> quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+102:0">Psalms 102:0</span>, we read concerning the heavens and the earth as compared with the eternity of God, "they shall perish" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολουνται] </span></span>. But the perishing is only preparatory to change and renewal. "They shall be changed" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλαγησονται] </span></span>. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+51:6">Isaiah 51:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+51:16">Isaiah 51:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:17">Isaiah 65:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:22">Isaiah 66:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:13">2 Peter 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:1">Revelation 21:1</span>. Similarly, "the Son of man came to save that which was lost" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολωλος] </span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:10">Luke 19:10</span>. Jesus charged his apostles to go to the lost [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολωλοτα</span></span>] sheep of the house of Israel, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:6">Matthew 10:6</span>, comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:24">Matthew 14:24</span>. "He that shall lose [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολεση</span></span>] his life for my sake shall find it," <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:25">Matthew 16:25</span>. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:6">Luke 14:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:9">Luke 14:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:32">Luke 14:32</span>. </p>
<p>In this passage the word destruction is qualified. It is "destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power," at his second coming, in the new eon. In other words, it is the severance, at a given point of time, of those who obey not the gospel from the presence and the glory of Christ. Aiwniov may therefore describe this severance as continuing during the millennial eon between Christ 's coming and the final judgment; as being for the wicked prolonged throughout that eon and characteristic of it, or it may describe the severance as characterizing or enduring through a period or eon succeeding the final judgment, the extent of which period is not defined. In neither case is aijwniov to be interpreted as everlasting or endless. </p>
