<p>Traditions [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδοσεις] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:2">1 Corinthians 11:2</span>. Not emphasizing a distinction between written and oral tradition. Tradition, in the scriptural sense, may be either written or oral. It implies on the part of a teacher that he is not expressing his own ideas, but is delivering or handing over [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδωμι</span></span>] a message received from some one else. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23">1 Corinthians 11:23</span>. The prominent idea of paradosiv is therefore that of an authority external to the teacher. Comp. by word nor by letter, ver. 2.</p>
