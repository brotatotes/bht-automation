<p>Mystery of iniquity [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυστηριον της ανομιας] </span></span>. Better, of lawlessness. The phrase is unique in N. T. and o LXX Mystery is found in various combinations, as mystery of the kingdom of heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:11">Matthew 13:11</span>; of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1">1 Corinthians 2:1</span> : of his will, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:9">Ephesians 1:9</span> : of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:4">Ephesians 3:4</span> : of the gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:19">Ephesians 6:19</span> : of faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:9">1 Timothy 3:9</span> : of godliness, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span> : of the seven stars <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span> : of the woman, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+17:7">Revelation 17:7</span>. A mystery does not lie in the obscurity of a thing, but in its secrecy. It is not in the thing, but envelops it. Applied to a truth, it signifies a truth once hidden but now revealed or to be revealed; a truth which without special revelation would be unknown. It is almost universally found in connection with words signifying publication or revelation. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:11">Matthew 13:11</span>. The mystery of lawlessness is the mass of lawlessness yet hidden, but which is to reveal itself in the person and power of Antichrist. The position of the word is emphatic, emphasising the concealed character of the evil power. </p>
<p>Only [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονον] </span></span>. The sentence is elliptical : "only we must wait," or "only it must work in secret, until he that letteth," etc. For a similar instance see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:10">Galatians 2:10</span>. The collocation of A. V. is wrong. </p>
<p>Letteth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεχων] </span></span>. The same word as restraineth, ver. 6. Let is old English for hipder, prevent. Often in Chaucer. </p>
<p>"May I him lette of that?" (prevent him from it). Troil. and Cress. ii. 732. </p>
<p>"And bothe in love y - like sore they brente (burned) That noon or alle hir (their) frendes might hit lette." Legend of Good Women, 731. </p>
<p>So Shakespeare : </p>
<p>"What lets but one may enter?" Two Gentlemen of Verona, 3 1. </p>
<p>"I'll make a ghost of him that lets me." Hamlet 1 4. </p>
<p>"The flesh resisteth the work of the Holy Ghost in our hearts, and lets it." - Latimer, Serm.</p>
