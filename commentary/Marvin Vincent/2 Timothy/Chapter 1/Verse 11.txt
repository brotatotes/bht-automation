A teacher of the Gentiles [διδασκαλος εθνων] . Omit of the Gentiles. Comp. 1 Timothy 2:7, from which the words were probably transferred when the three Epistles were jointly edited. Paul calls himself an apostle, and describes himself as preaching [κηρυσσων] ; but he nowhere calls himself didaskalov a teacher, although he uses didaskein to teach, of himself, 1 Corinthians 4:17; Colossians 1:28. He also uses didach teaching, of matter given by him to the converts, Romans 6:17; Romans 16:17; 1 Corinthians 14:6. He distinguishes between the apostle and the teacher, 1 Corinthians 12:28; Ephesians 4:11.
