I am not ashamed. Comp. verse 8, and Romans 1:16. Whom I have believed [ω πεπιστευκα] . Or, in whom I have put my trust. See on John 1:12; John 2:22; Romans 4:5. Able [δυνατος] . Often used with a stronger meaning, as 1 Corinthians 1:26, mighty; Acts 25:5, oiJdunatoi the chief men : as a designation of God, oJ dunatov the mighty one, Luke 1:49; of preeminent ability or power in something, as of Jesus, dunatov ejn ergw kai logw mighty in deed and word, 50 24 19 of spiritual agencies, "The weapons of our warfare are dunata mighty," etc., 2 Corinthians 10:4. Very often in LXX That which I have committed [την παραθηκην μου] . More correctly, that which has been committed unto me : my sacred trust. The meaning of the passage is that Paul is convinced that God is strong to enable him to be faithful to his apostolic calling, in spite of the sufferings which attend it, until the day when he shall be summoned to render his final account. The paraqhkh or thing committed to him was the same as that which he had committed to Timothy that; he might teach others (1 Timothy 6:20). It was the form of sound words (verse 13); that which Timothy had heard from Paul (chapter 2 Timothy 2:2); that fair deposit verse 14). It was the gospel to which Paul had been appointed verse 11); which had been intrusted to him (1 Timothy 1:11; Titus 1:3; comp. 1 Corinthians 9:17; Galatians 2:7; 1 Thessalonians 2:4). The verb paratiqenai to commit to one's charge is a favorite with Luke. See Luke 12:48; Acts 20:32. Sums deposited with a Bishop for the use of the church were called paraqhkai thv ejkklhsiav trust - funds of the church. In the Epistle of the pseudo - Ignatius to Hero (7) we read : "Keep my deposit [παραθηκην] which I and Christ have committed [παρθεμεθα] to you. I commit [παρατιθημι] to you the church of the Antiochenes." That day (ejkeinhn thn hJmeran). The day of Christ 's second appearing. See on 1 Thessalonians 5:2. In this sense the phrase occurs in the N. T. Epistles only chapter 2 Timothy 1:18; 2 Timothy 4:8; 2 Thessalonians 1:10; but often in the Gospels, as Matthew 7:22; Matthew 26:29; Mark 13:32, etc. The day of the Lord 's appearing is designated by Paul as hJ hJmera, absolutely, the day, Romans 13:12; 1 Corinthians 3:13; 1 Thessalonians 5:4 : hJmera tou kuriou the day of the Lord, 1 Corinthians 1:8; 2 Corinthians 1:14; 1 Thessalonians 5:2; 2 Thessalonians 2:2 : the day of Jesus Christ or Christ, Philippians 1:6, Philippians 1:10; Philippians 2:16 : the day when God shall judge, Romans 2:16 : the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, Romans 2:5 : the day of redemption, Ephesians 4:30.
