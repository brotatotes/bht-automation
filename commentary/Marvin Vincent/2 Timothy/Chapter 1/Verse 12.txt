The meaning of the passage is that Paul is convinced that God is strong to enable him to be faithful to his apostolic calling, in spite of the sufferings which attend it, until the day when he shall be summoned to render his final account. The paraqhkh or thing committed to him was the same as that which he had committed to Timothy that; he might teach others (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:20">1 Timothy 6:20</span>). It was the form of sound words (verse 13); that which Timothy had heard from Paul (chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:2">2 Timothy 2:2</span>); that fair deposit verse 14).

Sums deposited with a Bishop for the use of the church were called paraqhkai thv ejkklhsiav trust - funds of the church. In the Epistle of the pseudo - Ignatius to Hero (7) we read : "Keep my deposit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραθηκην</span></span>] which I and Christ have committed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρθεμεθα</span></span>] to you.
