<p>Greatly desiring [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιποθων] </span></span>. Better, longing. Pastorals only here. Quite frequent in Paul. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:11">Romans 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:2">2 Corinthians 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:14">2 Corinthians 9:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:8">Philippians 1:8</span>, etc. The compounded preposition ejpi does not denote intensity, as A. verse greatly, but direction. Comp. chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:9">2 Timothy 4:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:21">2 Timothy 4:21</span>. Being mindful of thy tears [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεμνημενος σου των δακρυων] </span></span>. The verb, mimnhskesqai in Paul, only <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:2">1 Corinthians 11:2</span>. In Pastorals only here. The words give the reason for the longing to see Timothy. The allusion is probably to the tears shed by Timothy at his parting from Paul. 133 One is naturally reminded of the parting of Paul with the Ephesians elders at Miletus (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17">Acts 20:17</span> ff., see especially verse 37). Holtzmann remarks that Paul 's discourse on that occasion is related to this passage as program to performance. Bonds await the apostle (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:23">Acts 20:23</span>), and Paul appears as a prisoner (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:8">2 Timothy 1:8</span>). He must fulfill his course <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:24">Acts 20:24</span>); here he has fulfilled it (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:7">2 Timothy 4:7</span>). He bids the overseers take heed to the flock, for false teachers will arise in the bosom of the church (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:29">Acts 20:29</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:30">Acts 20:30</span>); these letters contain directions for the guidance of the flock, and denunciations of heretical teachers. </p>
<p>That I may be filled with joy. Const. with longing to see you.</p>
