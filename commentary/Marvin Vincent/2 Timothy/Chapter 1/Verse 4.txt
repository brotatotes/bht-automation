Greatly desiring [επιποθων] . Better, longing. Pastorals only here. Quite frequent in Paul. See Romans 1:11; 2 Corinthians 5:2; 2 Corinthians 9:14; Philippians 1:8, etc. The compounded preposition ejpi does not denote intensity, as A. verse greatly, but direction. Comp. chapter 2 Timothy 4:9, 2 Timothy 4:21. Being mindful of thy tears [μεμνημενος σου των δακρυων] . The verb, mimnhskesqai in Paul, only 1 Corinthians 11:2. In Pastorals only here. The words give the reason for the longing to see Timothy. The allusion is probably to the tears shed by Timothy at his parting from Paul. 133 One is naturally reminded of the parting of Paul with the Ephesians elders at Miletus (Acts 20:17 ff., see especially verse 37). Holtzmann remarks that Paul 's discourse on that occasion is related to this passage as program to performance. Bonds await the apostle (Acts 20:23), and Paul appears as a prisoner (2 Timothy 1:8). He must fulfill his course Acts 20:24); here he has fulfilled it (2 Timothy 4:7). He bids the overseers take heed to the flock, for false teachers will arise in the bosom of the church (Acts 20:29, Acts 20:30); these letters contain directions for the guidance of the flock, and denunciations of heretical teachers. That I may be filled with joy. Const. with longing to see you.
