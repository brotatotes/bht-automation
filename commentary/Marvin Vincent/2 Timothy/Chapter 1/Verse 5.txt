The writer's thought is probably not confined to Christian faith, but has in view the continuity of Judaism and Christianity. In verse 3 he speaks of serving God from his forefathers. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:14">Acts 24:14</span> Paul is represented as saying that even as a Christian he serves the God of his fathers, believing all things contained in the law and the prophets. </p>
<p>Dwelt [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωκησεν] </span></span>. Paul uses the verb with sin, the divine Spirit, God, the word of Christ, but nowhere with faith. The phrase faith dwells in, N. T. o. According to Paul, Christians are or stand in faith; but faith is not represented as dwelling in them.

The writer merely means that faith had already dwelt in Timothy's grandmother and mother before it did in him. How much farther back his believing ancestry went he does not say.
