Who hath saved us. Salvation is ascribed to God. See on our Savior, l Tim 1:1. Called [καλεσαντος] . Comp. 1 Timothy 6:12, and see Romans 8:30; Romans 9:11; 1 Corinthians 1:9; Galatians 1:6; 1 Thessalonians 2:12. It is Paul 's technical term for God 's summoning men to salvation. In Paul the order is reversed : called, saved. With a holy calling [λκησει αγια] . Klhsiv, calling, often in Paul; but the phrase holy calling only here. In Paul, klhsiv sometimes as here, with the verb kalein to call, as 1 Corinthians 7:20; Ephesians 4:1, Ephesians 4:4. Purpose [προθεσιν] . See on Acts 11:23; Romans 9:11. Grace which was given [χαριν την δοθεισαν] . Comp. Romans 12:3, Romans 12:6; Romans 14:15; 1 Corinthians 3:10; Ephesians 3:8; Ephesians 4:7. The phrase only here in Pastorals Before the world began [προ χρονων αιωνιων] . See additional note on 2 Thessalonians 1:9. In Pastorals the phrase only here and Titus 1:2. Not in Paul. Lit. before eternal times. If it is insisted that aijwniov means everlasting, this statement is absurd. It is impossible that anything should take place before everlasting times. That would be to say that there was a beginning of times which are from everlasting. Paul puts the beginnings of salvation in God 's purpose before the time of the world (1 Corinthians 2:7; 1 Peter 1:20); and Christ 's participation in the saving counsels of God prior to time, goes with the Pauline doctrine of Christ 's preexistence. The meaning, therefore, of this phrase is rightly given in A. V. : before the world began, that is, before time was reckoned by aeons or cycles. Then, in that timeless present, grace was given to us in God 's decree, not actually, since we did not exist. The gift planned and ordered in the eternal counsels is here treated as an actual bestowment.
