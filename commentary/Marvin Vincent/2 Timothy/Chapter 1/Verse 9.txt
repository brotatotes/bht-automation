<p>Who hath saved us. Salvation is ascribed to God. See on our Savior, l Tim 1:1. </p>
<p>Called [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλεσαντος] </span></span>. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:12">1 Timothy 6:12</span>, and see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:30">Romans 8:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:11">Romans 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:9">1 Corinthians 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:12">1 Thessalonians 2:12</span>. It is Paul 's technical term for God 's summoning men to salvation. In Paul the order is reversed : called, saved. </p>
<p>With a holy calling [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λκησει αγια] </span></span>. Klhsiv, calling, often in Paul; but the phrase holy calling only here. In Paul, klhsiv sometimes as here, with the verb kalein to call, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:20">1 Corinthians 7:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:4">Ephesians 4:4</span>. Purpose [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προθεσιν] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:23">Acts 11:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:11">Romans 9:11</span>. </p>
<p>Grace which was given [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριν την δοθεισαν] </span></span>. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:3">Romans 12:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:6">Romans 12:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:15">Romans 14:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:10">1 Corinthians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:7">Ephesians 4:7</span>. The phrase only here in Pastorals </p>
<p>Before the world began [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ χρονων αιωνιων] </span></span>. See additional note on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:9">2 Thessalonians 1:9</span>. In Pastorals the phrase only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:2">Titus 1:2</span>. Not in Paul. Lit. before eternal times. If it is insisted that aijwniov means everlasting, this statement is absurd. It is impossible that anything should take place before everlasting times. That would be to say that there was a beginning of times which are from everlasting. Paul puts the beginnings of salvation in God 's purpose before the time of the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span>); and Christ 's participation in the saving counsels of God prior to time, goes with the Pauline doctrine of Christ 's preexistence. The meaning, therefore, of this phrase is rightly given in A. V. : before the world began, that is, before time was reckoned by aeons or cycles. Then, in that timeless present, grace was given to us in God 's decree, not actually, since we did not exist. The gift planned and ordered in the eternal counsels is here treated as an actual bestowment.</p>
