<p>Rightly dividing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορθοτομουντα] </span></span>. N. T. o. o Class. In LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:6">Proverbs 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+11:5">Proverbs 11:5</span>; both times in the sense of directing the way. From ojrqov straight and temnein to cut. Hence, to cut straight, as paths; to hold a straight course; generally, to make straight; to handle rightly. Vulg. recte tractare. The thought is that the minister of the gospel is to present the truth rightly, not abridging it, not handling it as a charlatan (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span>), not making it a matter of wordy strife verse 14), but treating it honestly and fully, in a straightforward manner. Various homiletic fancies have been founded on the word, as, to divide the word of truth, giving to each hearer what he needs : or, to separate it into its proper parts : or, to separate it from error : or, to cut straight through it, so that its inmost contents may be laid bare. Others, again, have found in it the figure of dividing the bread, which is the office of the household steward; or of dividing the sacrificial victims; or of cutting a straight furrow with the plough.</p>
