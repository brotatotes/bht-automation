The church has its being in the contents of" the sound teaching "(1 Timothy 1:10), which is" according to godliness "(1 Timothy 6:3), and which is deposited in it." The mystery of godliness "is intrusted to it (1 Timothy 3:16). Its servants possess" the mystery of the faith "(1 Timothy 3:9). In 1 Corinthians 3:11, Christ is represented as" the chief corner - stone. "In Ephesians 2:20, the church is built" upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, "with Christ as the corner - stone, and grows into a" holy temple [ναον] in the Lord. " Here, the church itself is the foundation, and the building is conceived as a great dwelling - house. While the conception of the church here does not contradict that of Paul, the difference is apparent between it and the conception in Ephesians, where the church is the seat of the indwelling and energy of the Holy Spirit.

The purity of the church is indispensable to its security. The Lord knoweth them that are his [εγνω κυριος τους οντας αυτου] . The first inscription : God knows his own. Comp. Numbers 16:5; 1 Corinthians 13:12. For egnw knoweth, see on Galatians 4:9. Them that are his, his ejklektoi chosen; see verse 10; Titus 1:1; Romans 8:33; Colossians 3:12; 1 Peter 2:9; Revelation 17:14. Not, however, in any hard, predestinarian sense. 138 Comp.

The salvation bestowed by grace is to be "carried out" (Philippians 2:12) by man with the aid of grace (Romans 6:8-19; 2 Corinthians 6:1). What this includes and requires appears in Philippians 3:10; Philippians 4:1-7; Ephesians 4:13-16, Ephesians 4:22 ff.; Colossians 2:6, Colossians 2:7.
