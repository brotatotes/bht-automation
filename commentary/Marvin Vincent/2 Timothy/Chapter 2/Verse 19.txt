<p>Nevertheless [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεντοι] </span></span>. Mostly in John. o P. Only here in Pastorals. The foundation of God standeth sure [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο στερεος θεμελιος του θεου εστηκεν] </span></span>. Wrong. Stereov sure is attributive, not predicative.

The mystery of godliness "is intrusted to it (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>). Its servants possess" the mystery of the faith "(<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:9">1 Timothy 3:9</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:11">1 Corinthians 3:11</span>, Christ is represented as" the chief corner - stone. "In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>, the church is built" upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, "with Christ as the corner - stone, and grows into a" holy temple [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναον</span></span>] in the Lord. " Here, the church itself is the foundation, and the building is conceived as a great dwelling - house. While the conception of the church here does not contradict that of Paul, the difference is apparent between it and the conception in Ephesians, where the church is the seat of the indwelling and energy of the Holy Spirit.
