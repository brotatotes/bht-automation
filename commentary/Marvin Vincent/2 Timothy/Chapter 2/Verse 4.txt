<p>That warreth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατευομενος] </span></span>. Better, when engaged in warfare. Rev. no soldier on service. In Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:7">1 Corinthians 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:3">2 Corinthians 10:3</span>. In Pastorals only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span>. </p>

T., biov means either means of subsistence, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:44">Mark 12:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:43">Luke 8:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:17">1 John 3:17</span>; or course of life, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:14">Luke 8:14</span>. Biov P o. </p>
<p>Him who hath chosen him to be a soldier [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω στρατολογησαντι] </span></span>. N. T. o. o LXX Better, enrolled him as a soldier.</p>
