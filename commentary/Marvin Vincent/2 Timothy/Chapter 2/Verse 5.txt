T. o. o LXX Paul uses ajgwnizesqai (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:25">1 Corinthians 9:25</span>), which appears also in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:10">1 Timothy 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:12">1 Timothy 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:7">2 Timothy 4:7</span>. For masteries is superfluous. Rev. contend in the games; but the meaning of the verb is not limited to that. It may mean to contend in battle; and the preceding reference to the soldier would seem to suggest that meaning here. The allusion to crowning is not decisive in favor of the Rev. rendering. Among the Rom. crowns were the highest distinction for service in war. The corona triumphalis of laurel was presented to a triumphant general; and the corona obsidionalis was awarded to a general by the army which he had saved from a siege or from a shameful capitulation. It was woven of grass which grew on the spot, and was also called corona graminea. The corona myrtea or ovatio, the crown of bay, was worn by the general who celebrated the lesser triumph or ovatio. The golden corona muralis, with embattled ornaments, was given for the storming of a wall; and the corona castrensis or vallaris, also of gold, and ornamented in imitation of palisades, was awarded to the soldier who first climbed the rampart of the enemy 's camp. </p>

According to the law of military service which requires him to abandon all other pursuits. So the law of the ministerial office requires that the minister shall not entangle himself with secular pursuits. If he fulfills this requirement, he is not to trouble himself about his worldly maintenance, for it is right that he should draw his support from his ministerial labor : nay, he has the first right to its material fruits.</p>
