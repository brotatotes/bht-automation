Remember that Jesus Christ - was raised, etc. Incorrect. Rend. remember Jesus Christ raised from the dead. Mnhmoneue remember, only here in Pastorals : often in Paul. Egeirein to raise, very often in N. T., but only here in Pastorals. The perfect passive participle [εγηγερμενον] only here. The perfect marks the permanent condition - raised and still living. Of the seed of David. Not referring to Christ 's human descent as a humiliation in contrast with his victory over death [εγηγερμενον] , but only marking his human, visible nature along with his glorified nature, and indicating that in both aspects he is exalted and glorified.

Romans 2:16; Romans 16:25, and see 1 Corinthians 14:1; 1 Corinthians 2:0 Gal 11:7; Galatians 1:11; Galatians 2:2; 1 Timothy 1:11.
