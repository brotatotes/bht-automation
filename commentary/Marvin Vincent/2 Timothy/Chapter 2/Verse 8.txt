<p>Remember that Jesus Christ - was raised, etc. Incorrect. Rend. remember Jesus Christ raised from the dead. Mnhmoneue remember, only here in Pastorals : often in Paul. Egeirein to raise, very often in N. T., but only here in Pastorals. The perfect passive participle [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγηγερμενον</span></span>] only here. The perfect marks the permanent condition - raised and still living. Of the seed of David. Not referring to Christ 's human descent as a humiliation in contrast with his victory over death [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγηγερμενον] </span></span>, but only marking his human, visible nature along with his glorified nature, and indicating that in both aspects he is exalted and glorified. See the parallel in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:3">Romans 1:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>, which the writer probably had in mind, and was perhaps trying to imitate. It is supposed by some that the words Jesus Christ - seed of David were a part of a confessional formula. </p>
