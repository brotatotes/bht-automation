<p>Perfect [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτιος] </span></span>. N. T. o. LXX Rev. complete; but the idea is rather that of mutual, symmetrical adjustment of all that goes to make the man : harmonious combination of different qualities and powers. Comp. katartisiv perfecting, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:9">2 Corinthians 13:9</span> : katartismov perfecting (as accomplished), <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:12">Ephesians 4:12</span> : katartisai make perfect or bring into complete adjustment, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:21">Hebrews 13:21</span>. </p>
<p>Thoroughly furnished [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηρτισμενος] </span></span>. The same root as artiov. It fills out the idea artiov; fitted out. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:5">Acts 11:5</span> (note). o Class. </p>
<p>Unto all good works [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς παν εργον αγαθον] </span></span>. More correctly, every good work. Any writing which can produce such profitable results vindicates itself as inspired of God. It is to be noted that the test of the divine inspiration of Scripture is here placed in its practical usefulness. </p>
