<p>Demas. A contraction of Demetrius or Demarchus. He is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+4:13">Colossians 4:13</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:24">Philippians 1:24</span>. It is supposed that he was a Thessalonian. On leaving Paul he went to Thessalonica; and in Philemon his name is mentioned next to that of Aristarchus the Thessalonian. That no epithet is attached to his name in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+4:14">Colossians 4:14</span> (comp. " Luke the beloved physician ") may be a shadow of Demas's behavior mentioned here, in case Colossians was written later than 2nd Timothy. </p>
