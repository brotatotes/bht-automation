Demas. A contraction of Demetrius or Demarchus. He is mentioned Colossians 4:13 and Philippians 1:24. It is supposed that he was a Thessalonian. On leaving Paul he went to Thessalonica; and in Philemon his name is mentioned next to that of Aristarchus the Thessalonian. That no epithet is attached to his name in Colossians 4:14 (comp. " Luke the beloved physician ") may be a shadow of Demas's behavior mentioned here, in case Colossians was written later than 2nd Timothy. Hath forsaken [εγκατελειπεν] . In Pastorals here and verse 16. See on 2 Corinthians 4:9. The compounded preposition ejn indicates a condition or circumstances in which one has been left, as the common phrase left in the lurch. Comp. Germ. im Stiche. Having loved [αγαπησας] . The participle is explanatory, because he loved. This present world [τον νυν αιωνα] . See on 1 Timothy 6:17. Contrast love his appearing, verse 8. Crescens [κρησκης] . N. T. o. Unknown. Galatia [γαλατιαν] . Most probably Galatia. See Introd. to Galatians. Eusebius (H. E. 3 4) says : "Paul testifies that Crescens was sent to Gaul [γαλλιαν] ." Tischendorf adopts this reading. Dalmatia [δαλματιαν] . Part of the country known generally as Illyricum, along the eastern coast of the Adriatic. See Romans 14:19.
