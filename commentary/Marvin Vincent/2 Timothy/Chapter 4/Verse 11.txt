Luke. See Intro. to Luke. His connection with Paul appears first in Acts 16:10. He remained at Philippi after Paul 's departure, and was there seven years later, when Paul revisited the city (Acts 20:5, Acts 20:6). He accompanied Paul to Jerusalem (Acts 21:15), after which we lose sight of him until he appears at Caesarea (Acts 27:2), whence he accompanies Paul to Rome. He is mentioned Colossians 4:14 and Philippians 1:24. Take [αναλαβων] . In N. T. mostly in Acts. See on Acts 23:31, and comp. Acts 20:13, Acts 20:14. Mark. Mentioned Colossians 4:10; Philippians 1:24; 1 Peter 5:13. Probably John Mark (Acts 12:12, Acts 12:25; Acts 14:37), called the cousin of Barnabas (Col 6:10). The first mention of him since the separation from Paul (Acts 14:39) occurs in Colossians and Philemon. He is commended to the church at Colossae. In 1st Peter he sends salutations to Asia. In both Colossians and Philemon his name appears along with that of Demas. In Colossians he is named shortly before Luke and along with Aristarchus who does not appear here. He (Mark) is about to come to Asia where 2nd Timothy finds him. The appearance in Colossians of Aristarchus with Mark and of Demas with Luke is probably the point of connection with the representation in 2nd Timothy.
