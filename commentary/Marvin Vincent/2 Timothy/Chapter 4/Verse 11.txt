<p>Luke. See Intro. to Luke. His connection with Paul appears first in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:10">Acts 16:10</span>. He remained at Philippi after Paul 's departure, and was there seven years later, when Paul revisited the city (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:5">Acts 20:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:6">Acts 20:6</span>). He accompanied Paul to Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:15">Acts 21:15</span>), after which we lose sight of him until he appears at Caesarea (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:2">Acts 27:2</span>), whence he accompanies Paul to Rome. He is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+4:14">Colossians 4:14</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:24">Philippians 1:24</span>. </p>

<p>Mark. Mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:24">Philippians 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:13">1 Peter 5:13</span>. Probably John Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:12">Acts 12:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:25">Acts 12:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:37">Acts 14:37</span>), called the cousin of Barnabas (Col 6:10). The first mention of him since the separation from Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:39">Acts 14:39</span>) occurs in Colossians and Philemon. He is commended to the church at Colossae. In 1st Peter he sends salutations to Asia. In both Colossians and Philemon his name appears along with that of Demas. In Colossians he is named shortly before Luke and along with Aristarchus who does not appear here. He (Mark) is about to come to Asia where 2nd Timothy finds him. The appearance in Colossians of Aristarchus with Mark and of Demas with Luke is probably the point of connection with the representation in 2nd Timothy. </p>
