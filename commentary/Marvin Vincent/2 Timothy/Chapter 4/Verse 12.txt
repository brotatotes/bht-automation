<p>The books [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιβλια] </span></span>. Biblov or, biblion was the term most widely used by the Greeks for book or volume. The usual derivation is from, bublov the Egyptian papyrus. Comp. Lat. liber "the inner bark of a tree," also "book." 147 Pliny (Nat. Hist. 13 11) says that the pith of the papyrus plant was cut in slices and laid in rows, over which other rows were laid crosswise, and the whole was massed by pressure.

The Latin name was membrana, and also pergamena or pergamina, from Pergamum in Mysia where it was extensively manufactured, and from which it was introduced into Greece. As to the character and contents of these documents which Timothy is requested to bring, we are of course entirely ignorant. 148</p>
