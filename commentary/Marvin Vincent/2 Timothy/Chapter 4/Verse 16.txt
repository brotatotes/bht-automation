<p>At my first answer [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη πρωτη μου απολογια] </span></span>. Apologia defense in a judicial trial. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:16">Acts 25:16</span>. Also against private persons, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:3">1 Corinthians 9:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:11">2 Corinthians 7:11</span>. Defense of the gospel against its adversaries, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:7">Philippians 1:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:16">Philippians 1:16</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:15">1 Peter 3:15</span> (note). It is impossible to decide to what this refers. On the assumption of a second imprisonment of Paul (see Introduction) it would probably refer to a preliminary hearing before the main trial. It is not improbable that the writer had before his mind the situation of Paul as described in Philippians since this Epistle shows at many points the influence of the Philippians letter. It should be noted, however, that ajpologia in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:7">Philippians 1:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:16">Philippians 1:16</span>, has no specific reference to Paul 's trial, but refers to the defense of the gospel under any and all circumstances. In any case, the first Romans imprisonment cannot be alluded to here. On that supposition, the omission of all reference to Timothy's presence and personal ministry at that time, and the words about his first defense, which must have taken place before Timothy left Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:19-23">Philippians 2:19-23</span>) and which is here related as a piece of news, are quite inexplicable. </p>
<p>Stood with me [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεγενετο] </span></span>. As a patron or an advocate. The verb mostly in Luke and Acts : once in Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:3">1 Corinthians 16:3</span> : only here in Pastorals. It means to place one's self beside; hence, to come to, and this latter sense is almost universal in N. T. In the sense of coming to or standing by one as a friend, only here. </p>
<p>Be laid to their charge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοις λογισθειη] </span></span>. Mostly in Paul : only here in Pastorals. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3">Romans 4:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:5">Romans 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:5">1 Corinthians 13:5</span>.</p>
