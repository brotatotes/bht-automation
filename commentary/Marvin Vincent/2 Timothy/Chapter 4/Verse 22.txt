<p>Reprove [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγξον] </span></span>. Rather, convict of their errors.

<p>Rebuke [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτιμησον] </span></span>. In Pastorals only here. o P. Mostly in the Synoptic Gospels, where it is frequent. It has two meanings : rebuke, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:26">Matthew 8:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:3">Luke 17:3</span>, and charge, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:16">Matthew 12:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:20">Matthew 16:20</span>, commonly followed by ina that or legwn saying (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:31">Matthew 20:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:25">Mark 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:12">Mark 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:30">Mark 8:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:35">Luke 4:35</span>), but see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:21">Luke 9:21</span>. The word implies a sharp, severe rebuke, with, possibly, a suggestion in some cases of impending penalty [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιμη] </span></span>; charge on pain of. This might go to justify the rendering of Holtzmann and von Soden, threaten. To charge on pain of penalty for disobedience implies a menace, in this case of future judgment. </p>

Pash, every possible exhibition of long, suffering, etc. For doctrine Rend. teaching. The combination is Suggestive. Long - suffering is to be maintained against the temptations to anger presented by the obstinacy and perverseness of certain hearers; and such are to be met, not merely with rebuke, but also with sound and reasonable instruction in the truth. So Calvin : "Those who are strong only in fervor and sharpness, but are not fortified with solid doctrine, weary themselves in their vigorous efforts, make a great noise, rave,... make no headway because they build without foundation." Men will not be won to the truth by scolding's. They should understand what they hear, and learn by perceive why they are rebuked " (Bahnsen).

<p>Sound doctrine [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της υγιαινουσης διδασκαλιας] </span></span>. Or healthful teaching. The A. V. overlooks the article which is important. The teaching plays a prominent part in these Epistles, and signifies more than teaching in general. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:10">1 Timothy 1:10</span>. </p>

The demand creates the supply. The hearers invite and shape their own preachers. If the people desire a calf to worship, a ministerial calf - maker is readily found. "The master of superstition is the people, and in all superstition wise men follow fools" (Bacon, Ess. 17). </p>
