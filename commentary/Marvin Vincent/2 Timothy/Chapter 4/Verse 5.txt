<p>Watch thou [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ νηφε] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:6">1 Thessalonians 5:6</span>, and on ajnanhywsin recover, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:26">2 Timothy 2:26</span>. </p>
<p>Endure afflictions [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακοπαθησον] </span></span>. Or suffer hardship. See on chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:9">2 Timothy 2:9</span>, and comp. chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:5">2 Timothy 4:5</span>. </p>
<p>Of an evangelist [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιστου] </span></span>. Here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:8">Acts 21:8</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>. In the last passage, a special function, with apostles, prophets, pastors, and teachers. A traveling, minister whose work was not confined to a particular church. So Philip, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:5-13">Acts 8:5-13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:26-40">Acts 8:26-40</span>. A helper of the apostles. An apostle, as such, was an evangelist (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:17">1 Corinthians 1:17</span>), but every evangelist was not an apostle. In The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (about 100 A. D.) it is prescribed that an apostle shall not remain in one place longer than two days, and that when he departs he shall take nothing with him except enough bread to last until his next station (chapter. 11). Make full proof of thy ministry [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την διακονιαν σου πληροφορησον] </span></span>. Better, fulfill or fully perform. In Pastorals only here and verse 17 See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:1">Luke 1:1</span>. In LXX once, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ec+8:11">Ecclesiastes 8:11</span>, is fully persuaded. Only in this passage in the active voice. Comp. plhrwsantev thn diakonian having fulfilled their ministration, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:25">Acts 12:25</span> : ejplhrou ton dromon was fulfilling his course, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:25">Acts 13:25</span>, and ton dromon I have finished the course, verse 7.
