<p>Beloved. Compare the plural, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:21">1 John 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:7">1 John 4:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:11">1 John 4:11</span>. </p>
<p>I wish above all things [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περι παντων ευχομαι] </span></span>. Wrong. This sense of peri is contrary to New Testament usage. The preposition means concerning. So Rev. "I pray that in all things thou mayst prosper." Eucomai I pray or wish, occurs only here in John's writings, and not often elsewhere. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:29">Acts 26:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:16">James 5:16</span>. </p>
<p>Mayst prosper [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευοδουσθαι] </span></span>. Lit., have a prosperous journey. From ejn well, and oJdov a way. In this original sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:10">Romans 1:10</span>. The word occurs only three times in the New Testament. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:2">1 Corinthians 16:2</span>. Be in health [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υγιαινειν] </span></span>. Used in the New Testament both in a physical and moral sense. The former is found only here and in Luke's Gospel. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:31">Luke 5:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:10">Luke 7:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:27">Luke 14:27</span>. Paul uses it of soundness in faith or doctrine. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:10">1 Timothy 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:3">1 Timothy 6:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:13">2 Timothy 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:2">Titus 2:2</span>. Here of Gaius' bodily health, as is shown by soul in the next clause. </p>
<p>Soul [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:30">Mark 12:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:46">Luke 1:46</span>. The soul [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span>] is the principle of individuality, the seat of personal impressions. It has a side in contact with both the material and the spiritual element of humanity, and is thus the mediating organ between body and spirit. Its meaning, therefore, constantly rises above life or the living individual, and takes color from its relation to either the emotional or the spiritual side of life, from the fact of its being the seat of the feelings, desires, affections, aversions, and the bearer and manifester of the divine life - principle [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα] </span></span>. Consequently yuch is often used in our sense of heart (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:46">Luke 1:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:35">Luke 2:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:24">John 10:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:2">Acts 14:2</span>); and the meanings of yuch soul and pneuma spirit, occasionally approach each other very closely. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:27">John 12:27</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:33">John 11:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:18">1 Corinthians 16:18</span>. Also both words in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:47">Luke 1:47</span>. In this passage yuch soul, expresses the soul regarded as moral being designed for everlasting life. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:19">Hebrews 6:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:39">Hebrews 10:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:17">Hebrews 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:11">1 Peter 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:19">1 Peter 4:19</span>. John commonly uses the word to denote the principle of the natural life. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:15">John 10:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:37">John 13:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:13">John 14:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:16">1 John 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+8:9">Revelation 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+12:11">Revelation 12:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+16:3">Revelation 16:3</span>.</p>
