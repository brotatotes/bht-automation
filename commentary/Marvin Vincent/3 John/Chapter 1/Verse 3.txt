<p>Rejoiced greatly. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:4">2 John 1:4</span>. </p>
<p>Brethren came [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομενων αδελφων] </span></span>. Lit., coming. The present participle denotes coming from time to time, and not coming on a single occasion, which would require the aorist. On brethren, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:9">1 John 2:9</span>. Thou walkest in truth. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8">1 John 1:8</span>. for the phrase walk in, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:6">2 John 1:6</span>. Thou is emphatic, suggesting a contrast with less faithful ones, as Diotrephes, ver. 9.</p>
