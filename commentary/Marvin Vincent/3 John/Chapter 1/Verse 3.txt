Rejoiced greatly. See on 2 John 1:4. Brethren came [ερχομενων αδελφων] . Lit., coming. The present participle denotes coming from time to time, and not coming on a single occasion, which would require the aorist. On brethren, see on 1 John 2:9. Thou walkest in truth. See on 1 John 1:8. for the phrase walk in, see on 2 John 1:6. Thou is emphatic, suggesting a contrast with less faithful ones, as Diotrephes, ver. 9.
