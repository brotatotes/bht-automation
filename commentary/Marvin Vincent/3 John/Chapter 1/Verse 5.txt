<p>Thou doest faithfully [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστον ποιεις] </span></span>. Rev., thou doest a faithful work. A third interpretation is thou givest a pledge or guaranty, and a fourth, akin to this, thou makest sure. The Rev. is best. There is no parallel to justify the third and fourth. 73 Thou doest [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργαση] </span></span>. Or lit., according to the eymology, workest (ergon work). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:9">James 2:9</span>. The distinction between this verb and others signifying to do, such as poiein, prassein, dran, which last does not occur in the New Testament, is not sharply maintained in Attic Greek. In certain connections the difference between them is great, in others, it is hardly perceptible. On poiein and pra. ssein, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:21">John 3:21</span>. 'Ergazomai, like prassein, contemplates the process rather than the end of action, carrying the ideas of continuity and repetition. It means to labor, to be active, to perform, with the idea of continued exertion, and therefore is used of servants, or of those who have an assigned business or office. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:28">Matthew 21:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:26">Matthew 25:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:14">Luke 13:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:17">John 5:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:27">John 6:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:4">John 9:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span>. For the phrase ejrgash eijv thou doest toward (Rev.), see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:10">Matthew 26:10</span>. </p>
<p>And to strangers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και εις τους ξενους] </span></span>. The best texts read, instead of eijv touv to the (strangers), touto, that; so that the sentence is, literally, "to them that are brethren, and that strangers." For the phrase and that, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:6">1 Corinthians 6:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:28">Philippians 1:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span>.</p>
