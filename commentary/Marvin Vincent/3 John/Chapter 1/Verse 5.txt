Thou doest faithfully [πιστον ποιεις] . Rev., thou doest a faithful work. A third interpretation is thou givest a pledge or guaranty, and a fourth, akin to this, thou makest sure. The Rev. is best. There is no parallel to justify the third and fourth. 73 Thou doest [εργαση] . Or lit., according to the eymology, workest (ergon work). See on James 2:9. The distinction between this verb and others signifying to do, such as poiein, prassein, dran, which last does not occur in the New Testament, is not sharply maintained in Attic Greek. In certain connections the difference between them is great, in others, it is hardly perceptible. On poiein and pra. ssein, see on John 3:21. 'Ergazomai, like prassein, contemplates the process rather than the end of action, carrying the ideas of continuity and repetition. It means to labor, to be active, to perform, with the idea of continued exertion, and therefore is used of servants, or of those who have an assigned business or office. See Matthew 21:28; Matthew 25:26; Luke 13:14; John 5:17; John 6:27; John 9:4; 1 Thessalonians 2:9. For the phrase ejrgash eijv thou doest toward (Rev.), see Matthew 26:10. And to strangers [και εις τους ξενους] . The best texts read, instead of eijv touv to the (strangers), touto, that; so that the sentence is, literally, "to them that are brethren, and that strangers." For the phrase and that, compare 1 Corinthians 6:6; Philippians 1:28; Ephesians 2:8.
