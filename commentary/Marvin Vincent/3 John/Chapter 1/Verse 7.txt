<p>For His Name's sake [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ του ονοματος] </span></span>. His is supplied by the A. V. It is not in the text. Rev., correctly, for the sake of the Name. The Name (Jesus Christ) is used thus absolutely in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:41">Acts 5:41</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:7">James 2:7</span>. For a similar absolute use of the way, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:2">Acts 4:2</span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span>. </p>
<p>Taking nothing of [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν λαμβανοντες απο] </span></span>. For the phrase taking of, or from, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>. </p>
<p>The Gentiles [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνικων] </span></span>. This word occurs elsewhere only in the Gospel of Matthew. The more common word is eqnh, which is the reading of the Tex. Rec. here : ejqnwn. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:32">Luke 2:32</span>.</p>
