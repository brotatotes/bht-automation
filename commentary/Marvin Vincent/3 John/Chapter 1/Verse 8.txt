<p>To receive [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολαμβανειν] </span></span>. The best texts read uJpolambanein to support; i e., to welcome with the provision of hospitality. Rev., welcome. The verb means, originally, to take underneath in order to raise. Hence, to support. Figuratively, to take upon the mind, to suppose, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:43">Luke 7:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:15">Acts 2:15</span> : to take up or follow in speech; hence to answer, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:30">Luke 10:30</span>. Fellow - helpers to the truth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεργοι τη αληθεια] </span></span>. Lit., fellow - workers. The expression is explained in two ways : either fellow - workers with the teachers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοιουτους συχη</span></span>] in support of the truth; or fellow - workers with the truth. Adopt the latter, as Rev. 74</p>
