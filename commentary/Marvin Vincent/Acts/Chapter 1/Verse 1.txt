<p>The former [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον πρωτον] </span></span>. Lit., the first. Luke refers to his Gospel. Treatise [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογον] </span></span>. Or narrative. </p>
<p>Began [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρξατο] </span></span>. This is interpreted in two ways. Either, (1), as a simple historical statement equivalent to "all that Jesus did and taught." In favor of this is the fact that the synoptists often record that which is done or said according to its moment of commencement, thus giving vividness to the account. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:20">Matthew 11:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:22">Matthew 26:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:37">Matthew 26:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:7">Mark 6:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:19">Mark 14:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:38">Luke 8:38</span>, etc. According to this explanation the word serves "to recall to the recollection from the Gospel all the several incidents and events, up to the ascension, in which Jesus had appeared as doer and teacher" (Meyer). Or, (2), as indicating that the Gospel contains the beginning, and the Acts of the Apostles the continuation, of the doings and teachings of Jesus. "The earthly life of Jesus, concluded with the ascension, has its fruit and continued efficacy; and his heavenly life, commencing with the ascension, has its manifestation and proof in the acts and experiences of the apostles and first churches. The history of the Church was under the immediate control of the exalted Redeemer, and may justly be considered as the continuation in heaven of the work which he had begun on earth" (Baumgarten and Gloag). </p>
<p>While the truth and importance of this statement are admitted, it is objected that such an intention on Luke's part would have been more clearly intimated, and not left to be inferred from a single doubtful phrase. As regards Luke's intention, I think the first explanation is more likely to be correct. The second, however, states a truth, the value and importance of which cannot be overestimated, and which should be kept in mind constantly in the study of the book of Acts. This is well put by Bernard (" Progress of Doctrine in the New Testament, "Lect. 4) :" Thus the history which follows is linked to, or (may I not rather say) welded with, the past; and the founding of the Church in the earth is presented as one continuous work, begun by the Lord in person, and perfected by the same Lord through the ministry of men.... 'The former treatise ' delivered to us, not all that Jesus did and taught, but 'all that Jesus began to do and teach until the day when he was taken up. ' The following writings appear intended to give us, and do, in fact, profess to give us, that which Jesus continued to do and teach after the day in which he was taken up. "</p>
