An upper room [το υπερωον] . With the article, denoting some well - known place of resort. It was the name given to the room directly under the flat roof.

Abode [ησαν καταμενοντες] . The participle and finite verb, denoting continuance or habitual residence. Hence more correctly, as Rev., "where they were abiding."
