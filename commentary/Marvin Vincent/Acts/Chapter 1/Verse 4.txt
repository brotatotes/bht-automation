Being assembled together [συναλιζομενος] . From sun, together, and aJlhv thronged or crowded. Both the A. V. and Rev. give eating together in margin, following the derivation from sun, together, and alv salt : eating salt together, and hence generally of association at table. Commanded [παρηγγειλεν] . Originally to pass on or transmit; hence, as a military term, of passing a watchword or command; and so generally to command To wait for [περιμενειν] . Only here in New Testament. The promise [επαγγελιαν] . Signifying a free promise, given without solicitation. This is the invariable sense of the word throughout the New Testament, and this and its kindred and compound words are the only words for promise in the New Testament. 'Upiscneomai, meaning to promise in response to a request, does not occur; and oJmologew, Matthew 14:7, of Herod promising Salome, really means to acknowledge his obligation for her lascivious performance. See note there. Not many days hence [ου μετα πολλας ταυτας ημερας] . Lit., not after many of these days. Not after many, but after a few.
