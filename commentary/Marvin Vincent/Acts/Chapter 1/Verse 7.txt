The times - the seasons [χρονους - καιρους] . Rev. properly omits the article. The former of these words, time absolutely, without regard to circumstances; the latter, definite periods, with the idea of fitness. His own [τη ιδια] . Stronger than the simple possessive pronoun. The adjective means private, personal. Often used adverbially in the phrase kat' ijdian, apart, privately. See Matthew 17:1; Matthew 24:3.
