<p>The times - the seasons [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρονους - καιρους] </span></span>. Rev. properly omits the article. The former of these words, time absolutely, without regard to circumstances; the latter, definite periods, with the idea of fitness. His own [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη ιδια] </span></span>. Stronger than the simple possessive pronoun. The adjective means private, personal. Often used adverbially in the phrase kat' ijdian, apart, privately. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:1">Matthew 17:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:3">Matthew 24:3</span>.</p>
