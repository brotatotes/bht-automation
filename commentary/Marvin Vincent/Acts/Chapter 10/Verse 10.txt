<p>Very hungry [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσπεινος] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. </p>
<p>Would have eaten [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηθελε γευσασθαι] </span></span>. Rev., correctly, desired to eat. Geuesqai is rendered both to eat and to taste, more frequently the latter. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:34">Matthew 27:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:9">John 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:3">1 Peter 2:3</span>; and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:11">Acts 20:11</span>. He fell into a trance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεπεσεν επ αυτον εκστασις] </span></span>. Lit., an ecstasy fell upon him. The best texts, however, read ejgeneto, came upon him, or happened to him. See on astonishment, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:42">Mark 5:42</span>. Luke alone employs the word in this sense of ecstasy or trance.</p>
