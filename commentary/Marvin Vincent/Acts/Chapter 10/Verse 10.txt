Very hungry [προσπεινος] . Only here in New Testament. Would have eaten [ηθελε γευσασθαι] . Rev., correctly, desired to eat. Geuesqai is rendered both to eat and to taste, more frequently the latter. See Matthew 27:34; John 2:9; 1 Peter 2:3; and compare Acts 20:11. He fell into a trance [επεπεσεν επ αυτον εκστασις] . Lit., an ecstasy fell upon him. The best texts, however, read ejgeneto, came upon him, or happened to him. See on astonishment, Mark 5:42. Luke alone employs the word in this sense of ecstasy or trance.
