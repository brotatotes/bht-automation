<p>Worshipped [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεκυνησεν] </span></span>. An unfortunate translation, according to modern English usage, but justified by the usage of earlier English, according to which to worship meant simply to honor. Worship is worthship, or honor paid to dignity or worth. This usage survives in the expressions worshipful and your worship. In the marriage - service of the English Church occurs the phrase, "With my body I thee worship." So Wycliffe renders <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:19">Matthew 19:19</span>, "Worship thy father and thy mother;" and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:26">John 12:26</span>, "If any man serve me, my Father shall worship him." Here the meaning is that Cornelius paid reverence by prostrating himself after the usual oriental manner.</p>
