<p>Were called Christians [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρηματισαι χριστιανους] </span></span>. The former of these two words, rendered were called, meant, originally, to transact business, to have dealings with; thence, in the course of business, to give audience to, to answer, from which comes its use to denote the responses of an oracle; a divine advice or warning. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:22">Acts 10:22</span>; and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:12">Matthew 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:7">Hebrews 11:7</span>. Later, it acquires the meaning to bear a name; to be called, with the implication of a name used in the ordinary transactions and intercourse of men; the name under which one passes. 18 This process of transition appears in the practice of naming men according to their occupations, as, in English, "John the Smith," " Philip the Armorer; " a practice which is the origin of many familiar family names, such as Butler, Carpenter, Smith, Cooper. Compare in New Testament Alexander the coppersmith (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:14">2 Timothy 4:14</span>); Matthew the publican (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:3">Matthew 10:3</span>); Luke the physician (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+4:14">Colossians 4:14</span>); Erastus the chamberlain (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span>); Rahab the harlot (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:31">Hebrews 11:31</span>). In the same line is the use of the word calling, to denote one's business. The meaning of the word in this passage is illustrated by <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:3">Romans 7:3</span>. The disciples were called. They did not assume the name themselves. It occurs in only three passages in the New Testament : here; ch. 26 28; and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:16">1 Peter 4:16</span>; and only in the last - named passage is used by a Christian of a Christian. The name was evidently not given by the Jews of Antioch, to whom Christ was the interpretation of Messiah, and who would not have bestowed that name on those whom they despised as apostates. The Jews designated the Christians as Nazarenes (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:5">Acts 24:5</span>), a term of contempt, because it was a proverb that nothing good could come out of Nazareth (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:47">John 1:47</span>). The name was probably not assumed by the disciples themselves; for they were in the habit of styling each other believers, disciples, saints, brethren, those of the way. It, doubtless, was bestowed by the Gentiles. Some suppose that it was applied as a term of ridicule, and cite the witty and sarcastic character of the people of Antioch, and their notoriety for inventing names of derision; but this is doubtful. The name may have been given simply as a distinctive title, naturally chosen from the recognized and avowed devotion of the disciples to Christ as their leader. The Antiochenes mistook the nature of the name, not understanding its use among the disciples as an official title - the Anointed - but using it as a personal name, which they converted into a party name.</p>
