Mischief [ραδιουργιας] . Only here in New Testament. Originally, ease or facility in doing; hence readiness in turning the hand to anything, bad or good; and so recklessness, unscrupulousness, wickedness. A kindred word (rJadiourghma, lewdness, Rev., villainy) occurs at ch. 18 14. Right ways. Or straight, possibly with an allusion to Elymas' crooked ways.
