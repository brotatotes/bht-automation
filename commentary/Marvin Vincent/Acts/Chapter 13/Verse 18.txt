<p>Suffered he their manners [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετροποφορησεν] </span></span>. From propov, fashion or manner, and forew, to bear or suffer. The preferable reading, however, is ejtrofoforhsen; from trofov, a nurse; and the figure is explained by, and probably was drawn from, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+1:31">Deuteronomy 1:31</span>. The American revisers properly insist on the rendering, as a nursing - father bare he them.</p>
