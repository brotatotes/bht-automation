<p>Next [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταξυ] </span></span>. The word commonly means intermediate, and hence is explained by some as referring to the intermediate week. But the meaning is fixed by ver. 44; and though the word does not occur in the New Testament elsewhere in the sense of next, it has that meaning sometimes in later Greek.</p>
