<p>Of Jupiter [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του διος] </span></span>. Properly, the Jupiter, the tutelary deity of Lystra. It is unnecessary to supply temple, as Rev. The God himself was regarded as present in his temple. </p>
<p>The gates [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυλωνας] </span></span>. What gates are intended is uncertain. Some say, the city gates; others, the temple gates; and others, the doors of the house in which Paul and Barnabas were residing. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:13">Acts 12:13</span>.</p>
