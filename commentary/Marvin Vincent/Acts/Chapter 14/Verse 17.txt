Rains. Jupiter was Lord of the air. He dispensed the thunder and lightning, the rain and the hail, the rivers and tempests. "All signs and portents whatever, that appear in the air, belong primarily to him, as does the genial sign of the rainbow" (Gladstone, " Homer and the Homeric Age "). The mention of rain is appropriate, as there was a scarcity of water in Lycaonia. Food. Mercury, as the God of merchandise, was also the dispenser of food. "No one can read the speech without once more perceiving its subtle and inimitable coincidence with his (Paul 's) thoughts and expressions. The rhythmic conclusion is not unaccordant with the style of his most elevated moods; and besides the appropriate appeal to God 's natural gifts in a town not in itself unhappily situated, but surrounded by a waterless and treeless plain, we may naturally suppose that the 'filling our hearts with food and gladness ' was suggested by the garlands and festive pomp which accompanied the bulls on which the people would afterward have made their common banquet" (Farrar, " Life and Work of Paul "). For the coincidences between this discourse and other utterances of Paul, compare ver. 15, and 1 Thessalonians 1:9; ver. 16, and Romans 3:25; Acts 17:30; ver. 17, and Romans 1:19, Romans 1:20.
