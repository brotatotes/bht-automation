<p>Elders [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτεπους] </span></span>. For the general superintendence of the church. The word is synonymous with ejpiskopoi, overseers or bishops (see on visitation, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:12">1 Peter 2:12</span>). Those who are called elders, in speaking of Jewish communities, are called bishops, in speaking of Gentile communities. Hence the latter term prevails in Paul 's epistles. </p>
