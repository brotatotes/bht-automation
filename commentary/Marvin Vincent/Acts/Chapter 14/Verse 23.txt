Ordained [χειροτονησαντες] . Only here and 2 Corinthians 8:19. Rev., more correctly, appointed. The meaning ordain is later. See on ch. Acts 10:41. Elders [πρεσβυτεπους] . For the general superintendence of the church. The word is synonymous with ejpiskopoi, overseers or bishops (see on visitation, 1 Peter 2:12). Those who are called elders, in speaking of Jewish communities, are called bishops, in speaking of Gentile communities. Hence the latter term prevails in Paul 's epistles. Commended [παρεθεντο] . See on set before, Luke 9:16; and commit, 1 Peter 4:19.
