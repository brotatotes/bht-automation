<p>Assault [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορμη] </span></span>. Too strong, as is also the Rev., onset. In case an actual assault had been made, it would have been absurd for Luke to tell us that "they were ware of it." It is rather the purpose and intention of assault beginning to assume the character of a movement. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:4">James 3:4</span>. To stone. Paul says he was stoned once (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:25">2 Corinthians 11:25</span>). This took place at Lystra (see ver. 19).</p>
