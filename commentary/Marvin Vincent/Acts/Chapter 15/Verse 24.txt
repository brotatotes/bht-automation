<p>Subverting [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανασκευαζοντες] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament, and not found either in the Septuagint or in the Apocrypha. Originally, it means to pack up baggage, and so to carry away; hence, to dismantle or disfurnish. So Thucydides (4, 116) relates that Brasidas captured Lecythus, and then pulled it down and dismantled it [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανασκευασας] </span></span>. From this comes the more general meaning to lay waste, or ravage. The idea here is that of turning the minds of the Gentile converts upside down; throwing them into confusion like a dismantled house. </p>
<p>We gave no commandment [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου διεστειλαμεθα] </span></span>. The word originally means to put asunder; hence, to distinguish, and so of a commandment or injunction, to distinguish and emphasize it. Therefore implying express orders, and so always in the New Testament, where it is almost uniformly rendered charge. The idea here is, then, "we gave no express injunction on the points which these Judaizers have raised."</p>
