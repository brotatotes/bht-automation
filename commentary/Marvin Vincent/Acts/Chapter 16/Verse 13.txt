Out of the city [εξω της πολεως] . The best texts read pulhv, the gate. River. Probably the Gangas or Gangites. Where prayer was wont to be made [ου ενονιζετο προσευχη ειναι] . The best texts read ejnomizomen proseuchn, where we supposed there was a place of prayer. The number of Jews in Philippi was small, since it was a military and not a mercantile city; consequently there was no synagogue, but only a proseucha, or praying - place, a slight structure, and often open to the sky. It was outside the gate, for the sake of retirement, and near a stream, because of the ablutions connected with the worship.
