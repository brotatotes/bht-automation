He took [παραλαβων] . Strictly, "took them along with [παρα] him :" to some other part of the prison. Washed their stripes [ελουσεν απο των πληγων] . Properly, "washed them from [απο] their stripes." The verb louein expresses the bathing of the entire body (Hebrews 10:23; Acts 9:37; 2 Peter 2:22); while niptein commonly means the washing of a part of the body (Matthew 6:17; Mark 8:3; John 13:5). The jailer bathed them; cleansing them from the blood with which they were besprinkled from the stripes.
