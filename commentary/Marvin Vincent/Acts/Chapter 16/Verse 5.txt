<p>Were established [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστερεουντο] </span></span>. Rather, were strengthened. Another word is used for established. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:22">Acts 14:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:32">Acts 14:32</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:41">Acts 14:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:23">Acts 18:23</span>. There is a difference, moreover, between being strengthened and established. See 1 Peter verse 10.</p>
