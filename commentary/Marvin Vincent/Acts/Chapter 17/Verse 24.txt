<p>The world [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον κοσμον] </span></span>. Originally, order, and hence the order of the world; the ordered universe. So in classical Greek. In the Septuagint, never the world, but the ordered total of the heavenly bodies; the host of heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+4:19">Deuteronomy 4:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+17:3">Deuteronomy 17:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+24:21">Isaiah 24:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:26">Isaiah 40:26</span>). Compare, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+17:6">Proverbs 17:6</span>, and see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:6">James 3:6</span>. In the apocryphal books, of the universe, and mainly in the relation between God and it arising out of the creation. Thus, the king of the world (2 Macc. 7 9); the creator or founder of the world (2 Maec. 7 23); the great potentate of the world (2 Macc. 12 15). In the New Testament : 1. In the classical and physical sense, the universe (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:25">John 21:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>, etc.). 2. As the order of things of which man is the center (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:38">Matthew 13:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15">Mark 16:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:25">Luke 9:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:21">John 16:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12">Ephesians 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:7">1 Timothy 6:7</span>). 3. Humanity as it manifests itself in and through this order (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:7">Matthew 18:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:6">2 Peter 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:19">Romans 3:19</span>). Then, as sin has entered and disturbed the order of things, and made a breach between the heavenly and the earthly order, which are one in the divine ideal - 4. The order of things which is alienated from God, as manifested in and by the human race : humanity as alienated from God, and acting in opposition to him (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:10">John 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:31">John 12:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:18">John 14:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:19">John 14:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:21">1 Corinthians 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:15">1 John 2:15</span>, etc.). The word is used here in the classical sense of the visible creation, which would appeal to the Athenians. Stanley, speaking of the name by which the Deity is known in the patriarchal age, the plural Elohim, notes that Abraham, in perceiving that all the Elohim worshipped by the numerous clans of his race meant one God, anticipated the declaration of Paul in this passage (" Jewish Church, "1, 25). Paul 's statement strikes at the belief of the Epicureans, that the world was made by" a fortuitous concourse of atoms, " and of the Stoics, who denied the creation of the world by God, holding either that God animated the world, or that the world itself was God. </p>
<p>Made with hands [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειροποιητοις] </span></span>. Probably pointing to the magnificent temples above and around him. Paul 's epistles abound in architectural metaphors. He here employs the very words of Stephen, in his address to the Sanhedrim; which he very probably heard. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:48">Acts 7:48</span>.</p>
