<p>The Areopagite. One of the judges of the court of Areopagus. Of this court Curtius remarks : "Here, instead of a single judge, a college of twelve men of proved integrity conducted the trial. If the accused had an equal number of votes for and against him, he was acquitted. The Court on the hill of Ares is one of the most ancient institutions of Athens, and none achieved for the city an earlier or more widely spread recognition. The Areopagitic penal code was adopted as a norm by all subsequent legislators" (" History of Greece, " 1, 307). </p>
