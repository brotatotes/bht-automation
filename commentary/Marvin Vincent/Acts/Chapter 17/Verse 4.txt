<p>Chief women. The position of women in Macedonia seems to have been exceptional. Popular prejudice, and the verdict of Grecian wisdom in its best age, asserted her natural inferiority. The Athenian law provided that everything which a man might do by the counsel or request of a woman should be null in law. She was little better than a slave. To educate her was to advertise her as a harlot. Her companions were principally children and slaves. In Macedonia, however, monuments were erected to women by public bodies; and records of male proper names are found, in Macedonian inscriptions, formed on the mother's name instead of on the father 's. Macedonian women were permitted to hold property, and were treated as mistresses of the house. These facts are born out by the account of Paul 's labors in Macedonia. In Thessalonica, Beroea, and Philippi we note additions of women of rank to the church; and their prominence in church affairs is indicated by Paul 's special appeal to two ladies in the church at Philippi to reconcile their differences, which had caused disturbance in the church, and by his commending them to his colleagues as women who had labored with him in the Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:2">Philippians 4:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:3">Philippians 4:3</span>).</p>
