Rulers of the city [πολιταρχας] . Another illustration of Luke's accuracy. Note that the magistrates are called by a different name from those at Philippi. Thessalonica was not a colony, but a free city (see on colony, ch. 16 12), and was governed by its own rulers, whose titles accordingly did not follow those of Roman magistrates. The word occurs only here and verse 8, and has been found in an inscription on an arch at Thessalonica, where the names of the seven politarchs are mentioned. The arch is thought by antiquarians to have been standing in Paul 's time.
