<p>Lately [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσφατως] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament, though the kindred adjective, rendered new, is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:20">Hebrews 10:20</span>. It is derived from fenw, to slay, and the adjective means, originally, lately slain; thence, fresh, new, recent. It is quite common in medical writings in this sense.</p>
