<p>Eloquent [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογιος] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. The word is used in Greek literature in several senses. As logov means either reason or speech, so this derivative may signify either one who has thought much, and has much to say, or one who can say it well. Hence it is used : 1. Of one skilled in history. Herodotus, for example, says that the Heliopolitans are the most learned in history [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογιωτατοι</span></span>] of all the Egyptians. 2. Of an eloquent person. An epithet of Hermes or Mercury, as the God of speech and eloquence. 3. Of a learned; person generally. There seems hardly sufficient reason for changing the rendering of the A. V. (Rev., learned), especially as the scripture - learning of Apollos is specified in the words mighty in the scriptures, and his superior eloquence appears to have been the reason why some of the Corinthians preferred him to Paul.
