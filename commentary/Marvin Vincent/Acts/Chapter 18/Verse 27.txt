<p>Exhorting [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προτρεψαμενοι] </span></span>. Originally, to turn forward, as in flight. Hence, to impel or urge. The word may apply either to the disciples at Corinth, in which case we must render as A. V., or to Apollos himself, as Rev., encouraged him. I prefer the former. Hackett very sensibly remarks that Apollos did not need encouragement, as he was disposed to go. </p>
<p>Helped [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεβαλετο] </span></span>. The radical sense of the word is to throw together : hence, to contribute; to help; to be useful to. He threw himself into the work along with them. On different senses of the word, see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:19">Luke 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:31">Luke 14:31</span>; and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:15">Acts 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:18">Acts 27:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:27">Acts 28:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:14">Acts 20:14</span>. Through grace. Grace has the article, the special grace of God imparted. Expositors differ as to the connection; some joining through grace with them which had believed, insisting on the Greek order of the words; and others with helped, referring to grace conferred on Apollos. I prefer the latter, principally for the reason urged by Meyer, that "the design of the text is to characterize Apollos and his work, and not those who believed."</p>
