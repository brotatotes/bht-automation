Mightily [ευτονως] . See on Luke 23:10. Convinced [διακατηλεγχετο] . Only here in New Testament. See on tell him his fault, Matthew 18:15. The compound here is a very strong expression for thorough confutation. Confute (Rev.) is better than convince. Note the prepositions. He confuted them thoroughly [δια] , against [κατα] all their arguments.
