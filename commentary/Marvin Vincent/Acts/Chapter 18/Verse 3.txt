All the Rabbinical authorities in Christ 's time, and later; were working at some trade. Hillel, Paul 's teacher, was a wood - cutter, and his rival, Shammai, a carpenter. It is recorded of one of the celebrated Rabbis that he was in the habit of discoursing to his students from the top of a cask of his own making, which he carried every day to the academy. </p>
<p>Tent - makers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνοποιοι] </span></span>. Not weavers of the goat 's - hair cloth of which tents were made, which could easily be procured at every large town in the Levant, but makers of tents used by shepherds and travelers. It was a trade lightly esteemed and poorly paid.</p>
