Was pressed in the spirit [συνειχετο τω πνευματι] . Instead of spirit the best texts read logw, by the word. On pressed or constrained, see note on taken, Luke 4:38. The meaning is, Paul was engrossed by the word. He was relieved of anxiety by the arrival of his friends, and stimulated to greater activity in the work of preaching the word.
