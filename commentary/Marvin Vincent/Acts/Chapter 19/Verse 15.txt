I know - I know [γινωσκω - επισταμαι] . There is a purpose in using two different words to denote the demon 's recognition of the Divine Master and of the human agent, though it is not easy to convey the difference in a translation. It is the difference between an instinctive perception or recognition of a supreme power and the more intimate knowledge of a human agent. A divine mystery would invest Jesus, which the demon would feel, though he could not penetrate it. His knowledge of a man would be greater, in his own estimation at least. The difference may be given roughly, thus : "Jesus I recognize, and Paul I am acquainted with." Overcame them [κατακυριευσας] . The best texts read both of them, which would imply that only two of the seven were concerned in the exorcism. Rev, better, mastered, thus giving the force of kuriov, master, in the composition of the verb.
