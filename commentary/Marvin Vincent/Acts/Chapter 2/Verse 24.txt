Pains [ωδινας] . The meaning is disputed. Some claim that Peter followed the Septuagint mistranslation of Psalms 18:5, where the Hebrew word for snares is rendered by the word used here, pains; and that, therefore, it should be rendered snares of death; the figure being that of escape from the snare of a huntsman. Others suppose that death is represented in travail, the birth - pangs ceasing with the delivery; i e., the resurrection. This seems to be far - fetched, though it is true that in classical Greek the word is used commonly of birth - throes. It is better, perhaps, on the whole, to take the expression in the sense of the A. V., and to make the pains of death stand for death generally.
