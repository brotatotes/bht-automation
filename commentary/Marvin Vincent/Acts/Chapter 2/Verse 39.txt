<p>Afar off [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις μακραν] </span></span>. Lit., unto a long way. Referring probably to the Gentiles, who are described by this phrase both in the Old and New Testaments. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+6:15">Zechariah 6:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:11-13">Ephesians 2:11-13</span>. Peter knew the fact that the Gentiles were to be received into the Church, but not the mode. He expected they would become Christians through the medium of the Jewish religion. It was already revealed in the Old Testament that they should be received, and Christ himself had commanded the apostles to preach to all nations. </p>
<p>Shall call [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκαλεσηται] </span></span>. Rev. gives the force of prov, to : "shall call unto him."</p>
