<p>Began. Bringing into prominence the first impulse of the act. See on began, ch. 1 1. </p>
<p>With other tongues [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετεραις γλωσσαις] </span></span>. Strictly different, from their native tongues, and also different tongues spoken by the different apostles. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:24">Matthew 6:24</span>. </p>
<p>Gave [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιου] </span></span>. A graphic imperfect; kept giving them the language and the appropriate words as the case required from time to time. It would seem that each apostle was speaking to a group, or to individuals. The general address to the multitude followed from the lips of Peter. </p>
<p>Utterance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποφθεγγεσθαι] </span></span>. Used only by Luke and in the Acts. Lit., to utter. A peculiar word, and purposely chosen to denote the clear, loud utterance under the miraculous impulse. It is used by later Greek writers of the utterances of oracles or seers. So in the Septuagint, of prophesying. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ch+25:1">1 Chronicles 25:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+32:2">Deuteronomy 32:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+10:2">Zechariah 10:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+13:19">Ezekiel 13:19</span>.</p>
