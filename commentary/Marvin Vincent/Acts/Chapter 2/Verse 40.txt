Other [ετεροις] . And various. Did he testify [διεμαρτυρετο] . The preposition dia gives the force of solemnly, earnestly. Save yourselves [σωθητε] . More strictly, be ye saved. Untoward [σκολιας] . Lit., crooked. Toward in earlier English meant docile, apt. The opposite is froward (fromward). So Shakespeare : "'Tis a good hearing when children are toward, But a harsh hearing when women are froward." Taming of the Shrew, 5, 2. "Spoken like a toward prince." 3 Henry VI, 2, 2. Untoward, therefore, meant intractable, perverse. So Shakespeare : "What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?" K. John, 1, 1. "And if she be froward, Then hast thou taught Horensio to be untoward." Taming of the Shrew, 4, 5. Compare Deuteronomy 32:5.
