<p>Fellowship [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνια] </span></span>. From koinov, common. A relation between individuals which involves a common interest and a mutual, active participation in that interest and in each other. The word answers to the Latin communio, from communis, common. Hence, sometimes rendered communion, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:16">1 Corinthians 10:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:0">1 Corinthians 9:0</span> Corinthians <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:14">1 Corinthians 13:14</span>. Fellowship is the most common rendering. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:5">Philippians 1:5</span> : "your fellowship in the gospel," signifying co - operation in the widest sense; participation in sympathy, suffering, and labor. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3">1 John 1:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:6">1 John 1:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span>. Occasionally it is used to express the particular form which the spirit of fellowship assumes; as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:26">Romans 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:16">Hebrews 13:16</span>, where it signifies the giving of alms, but always with an emphasis upon the principle of Christian fellowship which underlies the gift. </p>
<p>Breaking [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλασει] </span></span>. Used by Luke only, and only in the phrase breaking of bread. The kindred verb klazw or klaw, to break, occurs often, but, like the noun, only of breaking bread. Hence used to designate the celebration of the Lord 's Supper. </p>
<p>Prayers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσευχαις] </span></span>. Always of prayer to God. Compare on dehseiv, prayers, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:33">Luke 5:33</span>; and besought, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:38">Luke 8:38</span>.</p>
