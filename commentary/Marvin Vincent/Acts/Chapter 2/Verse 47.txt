<p>Such as should be saved [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους σωζομενους] </span></span>. Lit., as Rev., those that were being saved. The rendering of the A. V. would require the verb to be in the future, whereas it is the present participle. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18">1 Corinthians 1:18</span>. Salvation is a thing of the present, as well as of the past and future. The verb is used in all these senses in the New Testament. Thus, we were saved (not are, as A.

"Godliness, righteousness, is life, is salvation. And it is hardly necessary to say that the divorce of morality and religion must be fostered and encouraged by failing to note this, and so laying the whole stress either on the past or on the future - on the first call, or on the final change. It is, therefore, important that the idea of salvation as a rescue from sin, through the knowledge of God in Christ, and therefore a progressive condition, a present state, should not be obscured, and we can but regret such a translation as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:47">Acts 2:47</span>, 'The Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved, ' where the Greek implies a different idea" (Lightfoot, " on a Fresh Revision of the New Testament "). </p>
