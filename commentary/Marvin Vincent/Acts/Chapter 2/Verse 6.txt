When this was noised abroad [γενομενης δε της φωνης τευτης] . Wrong. Lit., And this sound having taken place. Rev., correctly, when this sound was heard. The sound of the rushing wind. Were confounded [συνεχυθη] . Lit., was poured together; so that confound (Latin, confundere) is the most literal rendering possible. Used only by Luke and in the Acts. Compare Acts 19:32; Acts 21:31. Heard [ηκουον] . Imperfect, were hearing. Language [διαλεκτω] . Rather, dialect; since the foreigners present spoke, not only different languages, but different dialects of the same language. The Phrygians and Pamphylians, for instance, both spoke Greek, but in different idioms; the Parthians, Medes, and Elamites all spoke Persian, but in different provincial forms.
