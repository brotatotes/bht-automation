<p>Amazed and marvelled [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξισταντο και εθαυμαζον] </span></span>. The former word denotes the first overwhelming surprise. The verb is literally to put out of place; hence, out of one's senses. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:21">Mark 3:21</span> : "He is beside himself." The latter word, marvelled, denotes the continuing wonder; meaning to regard with amazement, and with a suggestion of beginning to speculate on the matter. </p>
<p>Galilaeans. Not regarded as a sect, for the name was not given to Christians until afterward; but with reference to their nationality. They used a peculiar dialect, which distinguished them from the inhabitants of Judaea. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:70">Mark 14:70</span>. They were blamed for neglecting the study of their language, and charged with errors in grammar and ridiculous mispronunciations.</p>
