<p>To spend time [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρονοτριβησαι] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. The word carries the suggestion of a waste of time, being compounded with tribw, to rub; to wear out by rubbing. The sense is nearly equivalent to our expression, fritter away time.</p>
