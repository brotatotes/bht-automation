Repentance toward God. Repentance has the article : the repentance which is due to God. So, also, faith : the faith which is due toward Christ, as the advocate and mediator. Acts 20:29Bound in the spirit. In his own spirit. Constrained by an invincible sense of duty. Not by the Holy Spirit, which is mentioned in the next verse and distinguished by the epithet the Holy. Acts 20:23Testifieth [διαμαρτυρεται] . The compound verb signifies full, clear testimony. Not by internal intimations of the Spirit, but by prophetic declarations "in every city." Two of these are mentioned subsequently, at Tyre and Caesarea (ch Acts 21:4, Acts 21:11).
