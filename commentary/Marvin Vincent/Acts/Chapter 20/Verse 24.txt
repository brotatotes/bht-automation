But none of these things move me, neither count I, etc. The best texts omit neither count I, and render, I esteem my life of no account, as if it were precious to myself. Dear [τιμιαν] . Of value; precious. Course [δρομον] . A favorite metaphor of Paul, from the race - course. See 1 Cor. ix. 24 - 27; Philippians 3:14; 2 Timothy 4:7.
