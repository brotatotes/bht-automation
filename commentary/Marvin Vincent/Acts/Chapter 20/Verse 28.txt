To yourselves and to all the flock. To yourselves first, that you may duly care for the flock. Compare 1 Timothy 4:16. Overseers [επισκοπους] . Denoting the official function of the elders, but not in the later ecclesiastical sense of bishops, as implying an order distinct from presbyters or elders. The two terms are synonymous. The elders, by virtue of their office, were overseers. 26 To feed [ποιμαινειν] . See on Matthew 2:6. The word embraces more than feeding; signifying all that is included in the office of a shepherd : tending, or shepherding. Purchased [περιεποιησατο] . Only here and 1 Timothy 3:13. See on peculiar people, 1 Peter 2:9. The verb means, originally, to make [ποιεω] to remain over and above [περι] : hence to keep or save for one's self; to compass or acquire.
