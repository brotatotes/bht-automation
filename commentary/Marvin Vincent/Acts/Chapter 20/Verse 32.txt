<p>I commend. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:19">1 Peter 4:19</span>. </p>
<p>Build you up. A metaphor in constant use by Paul, and preserved in the words edify, edification (Latin, aedes, "a house" and facere, "to make ") by which oijkodomew and its kindred words are frequently rendered. In old English the word edify was used in its original sense of build. Thus Wycliffe renders <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:22">Genesis 2:22</span>," The Lord God edified the rib which he took of Adam, into a woman. " </p>
<p>So, too, Spenser : </p>
<p>"a little wide There was a holy temple edified." Faerie Queene, 1, 1, 34.</p>
