I have shewed you all things [παντα υπεδειξα υμιν] . The verb means to shew by example. Thus Luke 6:47, "I will shew you to whom he is like," is followed by the illustration of the man who built upon the rock. So Acts 9:16. God will shew Paul by practical experience how great things he must suffer. The kindred noun uJpodeigma is always rendered example or pattern. See John 13:15; James 5:10, etc.; and note on 2 Peter 2:6. Rev., correctly, In all things I gave you an example. As I have done. To help [αντιλαμβανεσθαι] . See on Luke 1:54. He said [αυτος ειπε] . Rev., more strictly, "he himself said." This saying of Jesus is not recorded by the Evangelists, and was received by Paul from oral tradition. The speech of Paul to the Ephesian elders "bears impressed on it the mark of Paul 's mind : its ideas, its idioms, and even its very words are Pauline; so much so as to lead Alford to observe that we have probably the literal report of the words spoken by Paul. 'It is, ' he remarks, 'a treasure - house of words, idioms, and sentences peculiar to the apostle himself" ' (Gloag).
