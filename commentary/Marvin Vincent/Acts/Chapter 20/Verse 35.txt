<p>I have shewed you all things [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα υπεδειξα υμιν] </span></span>. The verb means to shew by example. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:47">Luke 6:47</span>, "I will shew you to whom he is like," is followed by the illustration of the man who built upon the rock. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:16">Acts 9:16</span>. God will shew Paul by practical experience how great things he must suffer. The kindred noun uJpodeigma is always rendered example or pattern. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:15">John 13:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:10">James 5:10</span>, etc.; and note on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:6">2 Peter 2:6</span>. Rev., correctly, In all things I gave you an example. </p>
<p>As I have done. </p>
<p>To help [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιλαμβανεσθαι] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:54">Luke 1:54</span>. </p>
<p>He said [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος ειπε] </span></span>. Rev., more strictly, "he himself said." This saying of Jesus is not recorded by the Evangelists, and was received by Paul from oral tradition. </p>
<p>The speech of Paul to the Ephesian elders "bears impressed on it the mark of Paul 's mind : its ideas, its idioms, and even its very words are Pauline; so much so as to lead Alford to observe that we have probably the literal report of the words spoken by Paul. 'It is, ' he remarks, 'a treasure - house of words, idioms, and sentences peculiar to the apostle himself" ' (Gloag).</p>
