<p>The window. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:25">Acts 9:25</span>. The windows of an Eastern house are closed with lattice - work, and usually reach down to the floor, resembling a door rather than a window. They open, for the most part, to the court, and not to the street, and are usually kept open on account of the heat. </p>
<p>Fallen into a deep sleep [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταφερομενος υπνω βαθει] </span></span>. Lit., born down by, etc. A common Greek phrase for being over come by sleep. In medical language the verb was more frequently used in this sense, absolutely, than with the addition of sleep. In this verse the word is used twice : in the first instance, in the present participle, denoting the corning on of drowsiness - falling asleep; and the second time, in the aorist participle, denoting his being completely overpowered by sleep. Mr. Hobart thinks that the mention of the causes of Eutychus' drowsiness - the heat and smell arising; from the numerous lamps, the length of the discourse, and the lateness of the hour - are characteristic of a physician 's narrative.

<p>Dead [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεκρος] </span></span>. Actually dead. Not as dead, or for dead.</p>
