<p>Took up our carriages [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποσκευασαμενοι] </span></span>. The verb means to pack up and carry off, or simply to pack or store away. Hence, some explain that Paul packed and stored the greater part of his luggage in Caesarea. The best texts, however, read ejpiskeuasamenoi, having equipped ourselves. Carriages is used in the old English sense, now obsolete, of that which is carried, baggage. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+17:22">1 Samuel 17:22</span>, A. V.</p>
