<p>The Egyptian. A false prophet, who, in the reign of Nero, when Felix was governor of Judaea, collected a multitude of thirty thousand, whom he led from the wilderness to the Mount of Olives, saying that the walls of Jerusalem would fall down at his command and give them free entrance to the city. Felix with an army dispersed the multitude, and the Egyptian himself escaped. There is a discrepancy in the number of followers as stated by Josephus (30, 000) and as stated by the commandant here (4, 000). It is quite possible, however, that Josephus alludes to the whole rabble, while Lysias is referring only to the armed followers. </p>
<p>Madest an uproar. Better, as Rev., stirred up to sedition. The rendering of the A. V. is too vague. The verb means to unsettle or upset, and the true idea is given in the A. V. of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:6">Acts 17:6</span>, have turned the world upside down. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:12">Galatians 5:12</span>, and kindred words in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:7">Mark 14:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:19">Luke 23:19</span>. That were murderers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των σικαριων] </span></span>. The A. V. is too general, and overlooks the force of the article, which shows that the word refers to a class. Rev., rightly, the assassins. The word, which occurs only here, and notably on the lips of a Roman officer, is one of those Latin words which "followed the Roman domination even into those Eastern provinces of the empire which, unlike those of the West, had refused to be Latinized, but still retained their own language" (Trench, "Synonyms "). The Sicarii were so called from the weapon which they used - the sica, or short, curved dagger. Josephus says :" There sprang up in Jerusalem another description of robbers called Sikars, who, under the broad light of day, and in the very heart of the city, assassinated men; chiefly at the festivals, however, when, mixing among the crowd, with daggers concealed under their cloaks, they stabbed those with whom they were at variance. When they fell, the murderers joined in the general expressions of indignation, and by this plausible proceeding remained undetected "(" Jewish War," 100 13). The general New Testament term for murderer is foneuv (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:7">Matthew 22:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:14">Acts 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:4">Acts 28:4</span>, etc.).</p>
