<p>Mean [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασημου] </span></span>. Lit., without a mark or token [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημα] </span></span>. Hence used of uncoined gold or silver : of oracles which give no intelligible response : of inarticulate voices : of disease without distinctive symptoms. Generally, as here, undistinguished, mean. There is a conscious feeling of patriotism in Paul 's expression.</p>
