<p>Finding disciples [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανευροντες τους μαθητας] </span></span>. The verb means to discover after search; and the article, the disciples, refers to the disciples who lived and were recognized members of the church there. The A. V. overlooks both the preposition and the article. The verb might be rendered strictly by our common phrase, "having looked up the disciples." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:16">Luke 2:16</span>. A small number of disciples is implied in verse 5.</p>
