<p>Stood [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστας] </span></span>. More correctly, as Rev., "standing by [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι] </span></span>." Receive thy sight [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβλεψον] </span></span>. Better, look up. See the following words : I looked up upon him. The word admits of both translations, to look up and to recover sight. </p>
<p>I looked up upon him. Some unite both meanings here : I looked up with recovered sight. So Rev., in margin.</p>
