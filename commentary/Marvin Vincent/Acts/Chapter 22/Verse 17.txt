<p>I was in a trance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεσθαι με εν εκστασει] </span></span>. Rev., more correctly, I fell into a trance; the verb meaning to become, rather than the simple to be. On trance, see note on astonishment, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:42">Mark 5:42</span>; and compare note on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:10">Acts 10:10</span>.</p>
