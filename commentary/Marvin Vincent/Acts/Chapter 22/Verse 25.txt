Bound him with thongs (proeteinan aujton toiv iJmasin). Against the rendering of the A. V. is the word proeteinan, they stretched forward, in allusion to the position of the victim for scourging, and the article with thongs; "the thongs," with reference to some well - known instrument. If the words referred simply to binding him, with thongs would be superfluous. It is better, therefore, to take thongs as referring to the scourge, consisting of one or more lashes or cords, a sense in which it occurs in classical Greek, and to render stretched him out for (or before) the thongs. The word is used elsewhere in the New Testament of a shoe - latchet (Mark 1:7; Luke 3:16; John 1:27). Roman. See on ch. Acts 16:37.
