Exercise myself [ασκω] . Originally, to work raw material, to form : hence, to practice, exercise, discipline; and so, in ecclesiastical language, to mortify the body. Of the kindred adjective ajskhtikov, our word ascetic is a transcript. Void of offense [αποσκοπον] . Lit., without stumbling; unshaken. The word is used thus in a passive sense here, as in Philippians 1:10. In 1 Corinthians 10:32, it occurs in the active sense of giving offense to others, causing them to stumble.
