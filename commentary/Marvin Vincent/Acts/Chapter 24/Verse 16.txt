<p>Exercise myself [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασκω] </span></span>. Originally, to work raw material, to form : hence, to practice, exercise, discipline; and so, in ecclesiastical language, to mortify the body. Of the kindred adjective ajskhtikov, our word ascetic is a transcript. </p>
<p>Void of offense [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποσκοπον] </span></span>. Lit., without stumbling; unshaken. The word is used thus in a passive sense here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:10">Philippians 1:10</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:32">1 Corinthians 10:32</span>, it occurs in the active sense of giving offense to others, causing them to stumble.</p>
