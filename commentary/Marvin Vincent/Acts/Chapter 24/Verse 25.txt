<p>Righteousness, temperance, the judgment to come. Three topics which bore directly upon the character of Felix. Tacitus says of him that he "exercised the authority of a king with the spirit of a slave;" and that, by reason of the powerful influence at his command, "he supposed he might perpetrate with impunity every kind of villainy." He had persuaded his wife Drusilla to forsake her husband and marry him. He had employed assassins to murder the high - priest Jonathan, and might well tremble at the preaching of the judgment to come. Temperance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγκρατεια</span></span>] is, properly, self - control; holding the passions in hand. </p>
<p>Trembled [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμφοβος γενομενος</span></span>] Lit., having become in fear. Rev., better, was terrified. </p>
<p>For this time [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το νυν εχον] </span></span>. Or, for the present. Very literally, as to what has itself now.</p>
