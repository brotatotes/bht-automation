<p>Very worthy deeds [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατορθωματων] </span></span>. From katorqow, to set upright. Hence, a success consequent on right judgment; a right action. The best texts, however, read diorqwmatwn, settings right; amendments. Thus the sentence reads, literally, obtaining much peace through thee, and amendments taking place for this nation through thy providence, we accept, etc. </p>
<p>Providence [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προνοιας] </span></span>. Forethought. Previdentia Augusti (the providence of the emperor) was a common title on the coins of the emperors.</p>
