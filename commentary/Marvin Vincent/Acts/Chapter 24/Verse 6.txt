To profane [βεβηλωσαι] . The word is akin to bhlov, threshold, and bainw, to step; and its fundamental idea, therefore, is that of overstepping the threshold of sacred places. The word profane is the Latin pro fanurn, in front of the sanctuary; that which is kept outside the fane because unholy. We laid hold. The best texts omit all after these words as far as by examining.
