<p>Saints [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των αγιων] </span></span>. Lit., the holy ones. Paul did not call the Christians by this name when addressing the Jews, for this would have enraged them; but before Agrippa he uses the word without fear of giving offense. On this word agiov, holy, which occurs over two hundred times in the New Testament, it is to be noted how the writers of the Greek scriptures, both in the New Testament and, what is more remarkable, in the Septuagint, bring it out from the background in which it was left by classical writers, and give preference to it over words which, in pagan usage, represented conceptions of mere externality in religion. Even in the Old Testament, where externality is emphasized, agiov is the standard word for holy. 28 Gave my voice [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηνεγκα ψηφον] </span></span>. Lit., laid down my vote. See on counteth, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:28">Luke 14:28</span>. Some suppose that Paul here refers to casting his vote as a member of the Sanhedrim; in which case he must have been married and the father of a family. But this there is no reason for believing (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:7">1 Corinthians 7:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:8">1 Corinthians 7:8</span>); and the phrase may be taken as expressing merely moral assent and approval.</p>
