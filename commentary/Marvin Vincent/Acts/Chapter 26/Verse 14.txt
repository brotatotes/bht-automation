<p>It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. Or, goads. The sharp goad carried in the ploughman's hand, against which the oxen kick on being pricked. The metaphor, though not found in Jewish writings, was common in Greek and Roman writings. Thus, Euripides (" Bacchae, "791) :" Being enraged, I would kick against the goads, a mortal against a God. "Plautus (" Truculentus, 4, 2, 55) :" If you strike the goads with your fists, you hurt your hands more than the goads. "" Who knows whether at that moment the operation of ploughing might not be going on within sight of the road along which the persecutor was traveling? (Howson," Metaphors of St. Paul ").</p>
