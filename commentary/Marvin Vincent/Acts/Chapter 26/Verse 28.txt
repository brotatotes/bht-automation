Almost thou persuadest [εν ολιγω με πειθεις] . Lit., in a little thou persuadest. The rendering almost must be rejected, being without sufficient authority. The phrase, in a little, is adverbial, and means in brief; summarily. We may supply pains or talk. "With little pains, or with a few words." The words are ironical, and the sense is, "You are trying to persuade me offhand to be a Christian." Thou persuadest [πειθεις] is rather, thou art for persuading; thou attemptest to persuade; a force which both the present and the imperfect sometimes have. 29
