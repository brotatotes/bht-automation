I perceive [θεωρω] . As the result of careful observation. See on Luke 10:18. Hurt [υβρεως] . The word literally means insolence, injury, and is used here metaphorically : insolence of the winds and waves, "like our 'sport' or 'riot ' of the elements" (Hackett). Some take it literally, with presumption, as indicating the folly of undertaking a voyage at that season; but the use of the word in verse 21 is decisive against this. Damage [ζημιας] . Better, as Rev., loss. Hurt and damage (A. V.) is tautological. See on the kindred verb, notes on lose, Matthew 16:26, and cast away, Luke 9:25.
