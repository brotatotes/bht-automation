<p>I perceive [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεωρω] </span></span>. As the result of careful observation. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:18">Luke 10:18</span>. </p>
<p>Hurt [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υβρεως] </span></span>. The word literally means insolence, injury, and is used here metaphorically : insolence of the winds and waves, "like our 'sport' or 'riot ' of the elements" (Hackett). Some take it literally, with presumption, as indicating the folly of undertaking a voyage at that season; but the use of the word in verse 21 is decisive against this. </p>
<p>Damage [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζημιας] </span></span>. Better, as Rev., loss. Hurt and damage (A. V.) is tautological. See on the kindred verb, notes on lose, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:26">Matthew 16:26</span>, and cast away, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:25">Luke 9:25</span>.</p>
