Not commodious [ανευθετου] . Lit., not well situated. Lieth toward the southwest and northwest [βλεποντα κατα λιβα και κατα χωρον] . Instead of lieth, Rev., literally and correctly, renders looking. The difference between the Rev. and A. V., as to the points of the compass, turns on the rendering of the preposition kata The words southwest and northwest mean, literally, the southwest and northwest winds. According to the A. V., kata means toward, and has reference to the quarter from which these winds blow. According to the Rev., kata means down : "looking down the southwest and northwest winds," i e., in the direction toward which they blow, viz., northeast and southeast. This latter view assumes that Phenice and Lutro are the same, which is uncertain. For full discussion of the point, see Smith, "Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul;" Hackett, "Commentary on Acts;" Conybeare and Howson, "Life and Epistles of St. Paul."
