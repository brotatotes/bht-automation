There arose against it [εβαλε κατ αυτης] . Against what? Some say, the island of Crete; in which case they would have been driven against the island, whereas we are told that they were driven away from it. Others, the ship. It is objected that the pronoun aujthv, it, is feminine, while the feminine noun for ship [ναυς] is not commonly used by Luke, but rather the neuter, ploion. I do not think this objection entitled to much weight. Luke is the only New Testament writer who uses nauv (see verse 41), though he uses it but once; and, as Hackett remarks, "it would be quite accidental which of the terms would shape the pronoun at this moment, as they were both so familiar." A third explanation refers the pronoun to the island of Crete, and renders, "there beat down from it." This is grammatical, and according to a well - known usage of the preposition. The verb ballw is also used intransitively in the sense of to fall; thus Homer (" Iliad, "11, 722), of a river falling into the sea. Compare Mark 4:37 :" the waves beat [επεβαλλεν] into the ship; "and Luke 14:12 :" the portion of goods that falleth [επιβαλλον] to me. " The rendering of the Rev. is, therefore, well supported, and, on the whole, preferable : there beat down from it. It is also according to the analogy of the expression in Luke 8:23, there came down a storm. See note there, and on Matthew 8:24. A tempestuous wind [ανεμος τυφωνικος] . Lit., a typhonic wind. The word tufwn means a typhoon, and the adjective formed from it means of the character of a typhoon. Euroclydon [ευροκλυδων] . The best texts read Eujrakulwn, Euraquilo : i e., between Eurus, "the E. S. E. wind," and Aquilo, "the north - wind, or, strictly, N. 1/3 E." Hence, E. N. E.
