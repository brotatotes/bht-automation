<p>There arose against it [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβαλε κατ αυτης] </span></span>. Against what? Some say, the island of Crete; in which case they would have been driven against the island, whereas we are told that they were driven away from it. </p>
<p>Others, the ship. It is objected that the pronoun aujthv, it, is feminine, while the feminine noun for ship [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναυς</span></span>] is not commonly used by Luke, but rather the neuter, ploion. I do not think this objection entitled to much weight. Luke is the only New Testament writer who uses nauv (see verse 41), though he uses it but once; and, as Hackett remarks, "it would be quite accidental which of the terms would shape the pronoun at this moment, as they were both so familiar." A third explanation refers the pronoun to the island of Crete, and renders, "there beat down from it." This is grammatical, and according to a well - known usage of the preposition. The verb ballw is also used intransitively in the sense of to fall; thus Homer (" Iliad, "11, 722), of a river falling into the sea. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:37">Mark 4:37</span> :" the waves beat [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεβαλλεν</span></span>] into the ship; "and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:12">Luke 14:12</span> :" the portion of goods that falleth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιβαλλον</span></span>] to me. " The rendering of the Rev. is, therefore, well supported, and, on the whole, preferable : there beat down from it. It is also according to the analogy of the expression in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:23">Luke 8:23</span>, there came down a storm. See note there, and on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:24">Matthew 8:24</span>. </p>
<p>A tempestuous wind [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεμος τυφωνικος] </span></span>. Lit., a typhonic wind. The word tufwn means a typhoon, and the adjective formed from it means of the character of a typhoon. </p>
<p>Euroclydon [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευροκλυδων] </span></span>. The best texts read Eujrakulwn, Euraquilo : i e., between Eurus, "the E. S. E. wind," and Aquilo, "the north - wind, or, strictly, N. 1/3 E." Hence, E. N. E.</p>
