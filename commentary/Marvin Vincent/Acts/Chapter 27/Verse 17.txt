Helps [βοηθειαις] . Any apparatus on hand for the purpose : ropes, chains, etc. Undergirding [υποζωννυντες] . In modern nautical language, frapping : passing cables or chains round the ship 's hull in order to support her in a storm. Mr. Smith (" Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul ") cites the following from the account of the voyage of Captain George Back from the arctic regions in 1837 : "A length of the stream chain - cable was passed under the bottom of the ship four feet before the mizzen - mast, hove tight by the capstan, and finally immovably fixed to six ringbolts on the quarter - deck. The effect was at once manifest by a great diminution in the working of the parts already mentioned; and, in a less agreeable way, by impeding her rate of sailing." Quicksands [την συρτιν] . The rendering of the A. V. is too general. The word is a proper name, and has the article. There were two shoals of this name - the "Greater Syrtis" (Syrtis Major), and the "Smaller Syrtis" (Syrtis Minor). It was the former upon which they were in danger of being driven; a shallow on the African coast, between Tripoli and Barca, southwest of the island of Crete. Strake sail [χαλασαντες το σκευος] . Lit., as Rev., lowered the gear. See on goods, Matthew 12:29. It is uncertain what is referred to here. To strike sail, it is urged, would be a sore way of running upon the Syrtis, which they were trying to avoid. It is probably better to understand it generally of the gear connected with the fair - weather sails. "Every ship situated as this one was, when preparing for a storm, sends down upon deck the 'top - hamper, ' or gear connected with the fair - weather sails, such as the topsails. A modern ship sends down top - gallant masts and yards; a cutter strikes her topmast when preparing for a gale" (Smith, "Voyage," etc.). The stormsails were probably set.
