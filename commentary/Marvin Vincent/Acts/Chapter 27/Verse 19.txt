<p>Tackling [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκευην] </span></span>. The word means equipment, furniture. The exact meaning here is uncertain. Some suppose it to refer to the main - yard; an immense spar which would require the united efforts of passengers and crew to throw overboard. It seems improbable, however, that they would have sacrificed so large a spar, which, in case of shipwreck, would support thirty or forty men in the water. The most generally received opinion is that it refers to the furniture of the ship - beds, tables, chests, etc.</p>
