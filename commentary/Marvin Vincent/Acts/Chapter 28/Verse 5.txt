The beast [το θηριον] . Luke uses the word in the same way as the medical writers, who employed it to denote venomous serpents, and particularly the viper; so much so that an antidote, made chiefly from the flesh of vipers, was termed qhriakh. A curious bit of etymological history attaches to this latter word. From it came the Latin theriaca, of which our treacle [μολασσεσ] is a corruption. Treacle, therefore, is originally a preparation of viper 's flesh, and was used later of any antidote. Thus Coverdale's translation of Jeremiah 8:22 has, "There is no more treacle in Gilead." Gurnall (" Christian in Complete Armor ") says : "The saints ' experiences help them to a sovereign treacle made of the scorpion 's own flesh (which they through Christ have slain), and that hath a virtue above all other to expel the venom of Satan 's temptations from the heart." So Jeremy Taylor : "We kill the viper and make treacle of him."
