Swollen [πιμπρασθαι] . Only here in New Testament. The usual medical word for inflammation. Looked [προσδοκωντων] . Occurring eleven times in Luke, and only five times in the rest of the New Testament. Frequent in medical writers, to denote expectation of the fatal result of illness. No harm [μηδεν ατοπον] . Lit., nothing out of place. The word atopov occurs three times in Luke, and only once elsewhere in the New Testament (2 Thessalonians 3:2). Used by physicians to denote something unusual in the symptoms of disease and also something fatal or deadly as here. Rev., nothing amiss. Compare Luke 23:41; and Acts 25:5, where the best texts insert the word. Said [ελεγον] . The imperfect, denoting current talk. A God. "Observe," says Bengel, "the fickleness of human reasoning. He is either an assassin, say they, or a God. So, at one time bulls, at another stones" (Acts 14:13, Acts 14:19).
