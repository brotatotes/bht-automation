<p>Swollen [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιμπρασθαι] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. The usual medical word for inflammation. </p>
<p>Looked [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσδοκωντων] </span></span>. Occurring eleven times in Luke, and only five times in the rest of the New Testament. Frequent in medical writers, to denote expectation of the fatal result of illness. </p>
<p>No harm [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν ατοπον] </span></span>. Lit., nothing out of place. The word atopov occurs three times in Luke, and only once elsewhere in the New Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:2">2 Thessalonians 3:2</span>). Used by physicians to denote something unusual in the symptoms of disease and also something fatal or deadly as here. Rev., nothing amiss. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:41">Luke 23:41</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:5">Acts 25:5</span>, where the best texts insert the word. </p>
<p>Said [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγον] </span></span>. The imperfect, denoting current talk. </p>
<p>A God. "Observe," says Bengel, "the fickleness of human reasoning. He is either an assassin, say they, or a God. So, at one time bulls, at another stones" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:13">Acts 14:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:19">Acts 14:19</span>).</p>
