Sick [συνεχομενον] . Lit., taken or holden. See on taken, Luke 4:38. Fever [πυρετοις] . Lit., fevers. This peculiarly medical use of the plural is confined to Luke in the New Testament. It denotes successive and varying attacks of fever. Bloody flux [δυσεντερια] . Only here in New Testament. Our word dysentery is nearly a transcript of it. Hippocrates often speaks of the two complaints in combination. Healed [ιασατο] . See on Luke 6:19.
