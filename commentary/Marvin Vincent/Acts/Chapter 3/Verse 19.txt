<p>Be converted [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστρεψατε] </span></span>. Not a good rendering, because the verb is in the active voice. Better as Rev., turn again. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:32">Luke 22:32</span>. Blotted out [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαλειφθηναι</span></span>] Forgiveness of sins under the figure of the erasure of hand - writing. The word is used thus in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:0">Psalms 51:0</span> (Sept. 1.), 1; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+43:25">Isaiah 43:25</span>. Also at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:14">Colossians 2:14</span>. In classical Greek the verb is opposed to ejggrafein, to enter a name. So Aristophanes : "They do things not to be born, entering [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγγραφοντες</span></span>] some of us, and others, erasing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαλειφοντες</span></span>] up and down, twice or thrice" (" Peace, " 1180). More especially with reference to an item in an account. </p>
<p>When [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως αν] </span></span>. Wrong. Render in order that, or that (so there may come), as Rev. </p>
<p>Times [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιροι] </span></span>. Better, seasons. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:7">Acts 1:7</span>. </p>
<p>Of refreshing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναψυξεως] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. The word means cooling, or reviving with fresh air. Compare the kindred verb, to wax cold, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:12">Matthew 24:12</span>, and see note. </p>
<p>Presence [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσωπου] </span></span>. Lit., the face.</p>
