Leaping up [εξαλλομενος] . Strictly, leaping forth. Only here in New Testament. Used in medical language of the sudden starting of a bone from the socket, of starting from sleep, or of the sudden bound of the pulse. Walked [περιεπατει] . The imperfect. Correctly, as Rev., began to walk; or, perhaps, continued walking about, testing his newly acquired power. The medical notes of the case are, that the disease was congenital, had lasted over forty years (ch. 4 22), and the progressive steps of the recovery - leaped up, stood, walked.
