<p>Boldness. See on freely, ch. 2 29. </p>
<p>Perceived [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλαβομενοι] </span></span>. The word, meaning originally to seize upon or lay hold of, occurs frequently in the New Testament in different phases of this original sense. Thus, to apprehend or grasp, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:18">Ephesians 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:12">Philippians 3:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:13">Philippians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:30">Romans 9:30</span> : of seizure by a demon, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:18">Mark 9:18</span> : of something coming upon or overtaking, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:35">John 12:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:4">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span> : of comprehending, grasping mentally, as here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:34">Acts 10:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:25">Acts 25:25</span>. </p>
<p>Unlearned [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγραμματοι] </span></span>. Or, very literally, unlettered. With special reference to Rabbinic culture, the absence of which was conspicuous in Peter's address. </p>
<p>Ignorant [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιωται] </span></span>. Originally, one in a private station, as opposed to one in office or in public affairs. Therefore one without professional knowledge, a layman; thence, generally, ignorant, ill - informed; sometimes plebeian, common. In the absence of certainty it is as well to retain the meaning given by the A. V., perhaps with a slight emphasis on the want of professional knowledge. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:16">1 Corinthians 14:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:23">1 Corinthians 14:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:24">1 Corinthians 14:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:6">2 Corinthians 11:6</span>. </p>
<p>Took knowledge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεγινωσκον] </span></span>. Or recognized. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:10">Acts 3:10</span>.</p>
