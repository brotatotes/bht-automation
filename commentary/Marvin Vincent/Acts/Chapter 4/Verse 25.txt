<p>Rage [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφρυαξαν] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. Originally, to neigh or snort like a horse. Of men, to give one's self haughty airs, and to act and speak insolently. Philo describes a proud man as "walking on tiptoe, and bridling [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρυαττομενος] </span></span>, with neck erect like a horse."</p>
