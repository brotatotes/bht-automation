Servant [παιδος] . See on ch. Acts 3:13. Rage [εφρυαξαν] . Only here in New Testament. Originally, to neigh or snort like a horse. Of men, to give one's self haughty airs, and to act and speak insolently. Philo describes a proud man as "walking on tiptoe, and bridling [φρυαττομενος] , with neck erect like a horse."
