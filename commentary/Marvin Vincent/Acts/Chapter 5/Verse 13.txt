<p>The rest. Unbelievers, deterred by the fate of Ananias from uniting themselves to the church under false pretenses. </p>
<p>Join himself [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολλασθαι] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:15">Luke 14:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:11">Luke 10:11</span>. In all but two instances (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:9">Romans 12:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:17">1 Corinthians 6:17</span>), the word implies a forced, unnatural, or unexpected union. Thus Philip would not, without a special command, have "joined himself" to the chariot of the Ethiopian prince (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:29">Acts 8:29</span>). Saul 's attempt to join himself to the apostles was regarded by them with suspicion (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:26">Acts 9:26</span>); and the fact that certain persons "clave to" Paul in Athens is expressly contrasted with the attitude of the citizens at large. The sense of an unnatural union comes out clearly in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:16">1 Corinthians 6:16</span>.</p>
