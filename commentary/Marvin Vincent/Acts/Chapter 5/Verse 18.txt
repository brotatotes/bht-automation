<p>In the common prison [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τηρησει δημοσια] </span></span>. Incorrect. Thrhsiv is not used in the sense of prison, but is an abstract term meaning ward or keeping, as in ch. 4 3. There is no article, moreover. Note, too, that another word is used for the prison in the next verse [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της φυλακης] </span></span>. Rev., therefore, correctly, in public ward.</p>
