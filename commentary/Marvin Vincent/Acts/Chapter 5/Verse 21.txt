Early in the morning [υπο τον ορθρον] . 'Upo, beneath, is often used in the sense of just about, or near. Orqron is from ornumi, to cause to arise : the dawn. See on Luke 24:1. Render as Rev., about daybreak. Taught [εδιδασκον] . Imperfect : began teaching. The council [συνεδριον] . The Sanhedrim. The senate [γερουσιαν] . From gerwn, an old man, like the Latin senatus, from senex, old. Taking on very early an official sense, the notion of age being merged in that of dignity. Thus in Homer gerontev are the chiefs who form the king's council. Compare the Latin patres, fathers, the title used in addressing the Roman senate. The word in this passage is the name of the Spartan assembly, Gerousia, the assembly of elders, consisting of thirty members, with the two kings. "The well - known term," as Meyer remarks, "is fittingly transferred from the college of the Greek gerontes to that of the Jewish presbyters." They summoned, not only those elders of the people who were likewise members of the Sanhedrim, but the whole council (all the senate) of the representatives of the people. Prison [δεσμωτηριον] . Still another word for prison. Compare vv. 18, 19. Rev., prison - house. The different words emphasize different aspects of confinement. Thrhsiv is keeping, as the result of guarding. See on ver. Acts 5:18Fulakh emphasizes the being put under guard, and desmwthrion the being put in bonds.
