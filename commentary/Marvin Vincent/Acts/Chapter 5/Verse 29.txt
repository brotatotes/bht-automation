<p>We ought [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δει] </span></span>. Stronger, we must. </p>
<p>To obey [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθαρχειν] </span></span>. Not often used in the New Testament to express obedience, the most common word being uJpakouw. Sometimes peiqw is used. But this word, in itself, is the only one of the several in use which expresses the conception of obedience exclusively. 'Upakouein is to obey as the result of listening to another : peiqesqai is to obey as the result of persuasion. This is the special term for the obedience which one owes to authority [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχη] </span></span>. It occurs four times in the New Testament : <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:29">Acts 5:29</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:32">Acts 5:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:21">Acts 27:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:1">Titus 3:1</span>; and in every case, of obedience to established authority, either of God or of magistrates. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:21">Acts 27:21</span>, where it is used of the ship 's officers hearkening to Paul 's admonition not to loose from Crete, Paul speaks of his admonition as divinely inspired; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:10">Acts 27:10</span>. In ch. 4 19, Peter and John say hearken [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουειν] </span></span>. That is a mere listening to or considering the proposition made to them. This is a deliberate course of action.</p>
