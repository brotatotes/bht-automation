<p>Suborned [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεβαλον] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. The verb originally means to put under, as carpets under one's feet; hence, to put one person in place of another; to substitute, as another's child for one's own; to employ a secret agent in one's place, and to instigate or secretly instruct him.</p>
