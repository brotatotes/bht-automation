<p>They stirred up the people [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεκινησαν τον λαον] </span></span>. The verb occurs only here in the New Testament. It implies to stir up as a mass, to move them together [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν] </span></span>. This is the first record of the hostility of the people toward the disciples. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:47">Acts 2:47</span>. </p>
<p>Caught [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνηρπασαν] </span></span>. Used by Luke only. Better as Rev., seized. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:29">Luke 8:29</span>.</p>
