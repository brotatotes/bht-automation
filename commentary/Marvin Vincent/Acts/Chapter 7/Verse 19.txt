<p>Dealt subtilely [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατασοφισαμενος] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. Lit., to employ cunning against. See on sofov, wise, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:13">James 3:13</span>. </p>
<p>So that they cast out [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του ποιειν εκθετα] </span></span>. Lit., make exposed. The verb ejktiqhmi, to set out, or place outside, is not uncommon in classical Greek for the exposure of a new - born child. Thus Herodotus, of Cyrus, exposed in infancy : "The herdsman's wife entreated him not to expose [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκθειναι</span></span>] the babe" (1, 112). The rendering of the A. V., "so that they cast out," is correct, expressing the result, and not Pharaoh 's design. </p>
<p>Young children [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βρεφη] </span></span>. Incorrect. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:2">1 Peter 2:2</span>. Rev., rightly babes. </p>
<p>Live [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωογονεισθαι</span></span>] Or, be preserved alive. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:33">Luke 17:33</span>.</p>
