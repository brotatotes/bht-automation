Took up [ανειλετο] . Used among Greek writers of taking up exposed children; also of owning new - born children. So Aristophanes : "I exposed (the child) and some other woman, having taken it, adopted [ανειλετο] it" (" Clouds, " 531). There is no reason why the meaning should be limited to took him up from the water (as Gloag).
