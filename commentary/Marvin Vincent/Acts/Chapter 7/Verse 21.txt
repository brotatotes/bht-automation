<p>Took up [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανειλετο] </span></span>. Used among Greek writers of taking up exposed children; also of owning new - born children. So Aristophanes : "I exposed (the child) and some other woman, having taken it, adopted [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανειλετο</span></span>] it" (" Clouds, " 531). There is no reason why the meaning should be limited to took him up from the water (as Gloag).</p>
