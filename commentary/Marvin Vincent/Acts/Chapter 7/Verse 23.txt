It came into his heart [ανεβη επι την καρδιαν] . Lit., "it arose into his heart." " There may be something in the depth of the soul which afterward emerges and ascends from that sea into the heart as into an island "(Bengel). The expression is imitated from the Hebrew, and occurs in the Septuagint :" The ark shall not come to mind; " lit., go up into the heart (Jeremiah 3:16). See, also, Jeremiah 32:35; Isaiah 65:17.
