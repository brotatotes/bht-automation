<p>I have seen, I have seen [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδων ειδον] </span></span>. Lit., having seen I saw. A Hebraism. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:7">Exodus 3:7</span> (Sept.). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:28">Jude 1:28</span> : utterly drive them out; lit., removing did not utterly remove. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:4">Jude 1:4</span>:9 : going I will go; i e., I will surely go. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+37:8">Genesis 37:8</span> : reigning shalt thou reign; i e., shalt thou indeed reign. So Rev. here, "I have surely seen."</p>
