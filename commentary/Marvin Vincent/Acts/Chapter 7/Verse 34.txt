I have seen, I have seen [ιδων ειδον] . Lit., having seen I saw. A Hebraism. See Exodus 3:7 (Sept.). Compare Jude 1:28 : utterly drive them out; lit., removing did not utterly remove. Jude 1:4:9 : going I will go; i e., I will surely go. Genesis 37:8 : reigning shalt thou reign; i e., shalt thou indeed reign. So Rev. here, "I have surely seen."
