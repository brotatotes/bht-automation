<p>The Most High. In contrast with heathen gods, who were confined to their temples. </p>
<p>Temples made with hands [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειροποιητοις ναοις] </span></span>. The best texts omit naoiv, temples. The meaning is more general : in things made with hands. The expression is, however, used of a sanctuary in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+16:12">Isaiah 16:12</span> : "Moab shall come to his sanctuary [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα χειροποιητα] </span></span>." The phrase work, or works of men's hands, is common in the Old Testament of idols.
