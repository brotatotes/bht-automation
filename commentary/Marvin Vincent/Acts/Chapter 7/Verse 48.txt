The Most High. In contrast with heathen gods, who were confined to their temples. Temples made with hands [χειροποιητοις ναοις] . The best texts omit naoiv, temples. The meaning is more general : in things made with hands. The expression is, however, used of a sanctuary in Isaiah 16:12 : "Moab shall come to his sanctuary [τα χειροποιητα] ." The phrase work, or works of men's hands, is common in the Old Testament of idols. See Deuteronomy 4:28; 2 Kings 19:18; 2 Chronicles 32:19; Psalms 115:4. Compare Mark 14:58; Ephesians 2:11; Hebrews 9:11, Hebrews 9:24; 2 Corinthians 5:1.
