<p>Inheritance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κληρονομιαν] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:4">1 Peter 1:4</span>. </p>
<p>Not so much as to set his foot on [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε βημα ποδος] </span></span>. Lit., not even the stepping of a foot. From the original meaning, a pace or step, which occurs only here in the New Testament, comes the sense of a step considered as a raised place or seat, and hence a tribune or judgment - seat, which is its meaning in every other passage of the New Testament. </p>
<p>Possession [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατασχεσιν] </span></span>. Only here and ver. 45. See on keep, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:15">Luke 8:15</span>. It denotes a permanent possession.</p>
