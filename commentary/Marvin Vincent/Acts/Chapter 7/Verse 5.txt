Inheritance [κληρονομιαν] . See on 1 Peter 1:4. Not so much as to set his foot on [ουδε βημα ποδος] . Lit., not even the stepping of a foot. From the original meaning, a pace or step, which occurs only here in the New Testament, comes the sense of a step considered as a raised place or seat, and hence a tribune or judgment - seat, which is its meaning in every other passage of the New Testament. Possession [κατασχεσιν] . Only here and ver. 45. See on keep, Luke 8:15. It denotes a permanent possession.
