Who [οιτινες] . Stronger than the simple relative who, and emphasizing their sin by contrast with their privileges : inasmuch as ye were those who received, etc. By the disposition of angels [εις διαταγας αγγελων] . Lit., unto ordinances of angels. Eijv means with reference to. Disposition [διαταγη] is used by A. V. in the sense of arrangement, as we say a general disposed his troops. The word occurs only here and Romans 13:2, where it is rendered ordinance. The kindred verb diatassw occurs often, mostly in the sense of command or appoint. See Matthew 11:1; Luke 3:13. In 1 Corinthians 11:34, it is translated set in order. The reference is most probably to the Jewish tradition that the law was given through the agency of angels. See Deuteronomy 32:2. Compare Psalms 68:17. Paul expressly says that the law was administered by the medium of angels (Galatians 3:19). Compare the word spoken by angels (Hebrews 2:2). Render, therefore, as Rev., as it was ordained by angels.
