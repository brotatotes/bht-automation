<p>Who [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιτινες] </span></span>. Stronger than the simple relative who, and emphasizing their sin by contrast with their privileges : inasmuch as ye were those who received, etc. </p>
<p>By the disposition of angels [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις διαταγας αγγελων] </span></span>. Lit., unto ordinances of angels. Eijv means with reference to. Disposition [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαταγη</span></span>] is used by A. V. in the sense of arrangement, as we say a general disposed his troops. The word occurs only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:2">Romans 13:2</span>, where it is rendered ordinance. The kindred verb diatassw occurs often, mostly in the sense of command or appoint. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:1">Matthew 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:13">Luke 3:13</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:34">1 Corinthians 11:34</span>, it is translated set in order. The reference is most probably to the Jewish tradition that the law was given through the agency of angels. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+32:2">Deuteronomy 32:2</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:17">Psalms 68:17</span>. Paul expressly says that the law was administered by the medium of angels (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19">Galatians 3:19</span>). Compare the word spoken by angels (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span>). Render, therefore, as Rev., as it was ordained by angels.</p>
