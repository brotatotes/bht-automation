<p>In the gall [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις χολην] </span></span>. Lit., into. Thou hast fallen into and continuest in. Gall, only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:34">Matthew 27:34</span>. Gall of bitterness is bitter enmity against the Gospel. </p>
<p>Bond of iniquity [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνδεσμον αδικιας] </span></span>. Thou hast fallen into iniquity as into fetters. The word sundesmon denotes a close, firm bond [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν, τογετηερ] </span></span>. It is used of the bond of Christian peace (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:3">Ephesians 4:3</span>); of the close compacting of the church represented as a body (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:19">Colossians 2:19</span>); and of love as the bond of perfectness (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:14">Colossians 3:14</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+58:6">Isaiah 58:6</span>.</p>
