Used sorcery [μαγευων] . Only here in New Testament. One of the wizards so numerous throughout the East at that time, and multiplied by the general expectation of a great deliverer and the spread of the Messianic notions of the Jews, who practiced upon the credulity of the people by conjuring and juggling and soothsaying. Bewitched [εξιστων] . Better as Rev., amazed. See on ch. Acts 2:7.
