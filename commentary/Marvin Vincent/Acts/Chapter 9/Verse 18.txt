There fell - scales [απεπεσον - λεπιδες] . Both words occur only here in the New Testament. In Paul 's own account of his conversion in ch. 26. he does not mention his blindness : in ch. 22. he mentions both the blindness and the recovery of sight, but not the particular circumstances which Luke records. The mention of the scales, or incrustations, such as are incidental to ophthalmia, is characteristic of the physician, and ajpopiptein, to fall off, was used technically by medical writers of the falling of scales from the skin, and of particles from diseased parts of the body. "We may suppose that Luke had often heard Paul relate how he felt at that moment" (Hackett).
