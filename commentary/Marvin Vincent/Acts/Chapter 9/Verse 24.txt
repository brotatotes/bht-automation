V. wherever it occurs, viz., ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:3">Acts 20:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:19">Acts 20:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:30">Acts 23:30</span>; but properly changed by Rev., in every case, to plot. "Laying await" refers rather to the execution of the plot than to the plot itself. </p>
<p>Watched. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:2">Mark 3:2</span>. Imperfect : they were or kept watching, day and night.</p>
