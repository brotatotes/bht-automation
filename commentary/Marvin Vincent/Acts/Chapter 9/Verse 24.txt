Laying await [επιβουλη] . So rendered by A. V. wherever it occurs, viz., ch. Acts 20:3, Acts 20:19; Acts 23:30; but properly changed by Rev., in every case, to plot. "Laying await" refers rather to the execution of the plot than to the plot itself. Watched. See on Mark 3:2. Imperfect : they were or kept watching, day and night.
