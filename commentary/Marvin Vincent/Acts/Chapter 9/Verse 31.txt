The churches. The best texts read the church; embracing all the different churches throughout the three provinces of Palestine. Edified. Or build up. Comfort [παρακλησει] . From parakalew, to call toward or to one's side for help. The word is rendered in the New Testament both exhortation and consolation. Compare Acts 13:15; Romans 12:8; 2 Corinthians 8:17; Hebrews 12:5; and Luke 2:25 (see note); 2 Thessalonians 2:16; Matthew 5:4. In some passages the meaning is disputed, as Philippians 2:1, where, as in 1 Corinthians 14:3, it is joined with paramuqion or paramuqia, the meaning of which also varies between incentive and consolation or assuagement. Here exhortation is the rendering approved by the best authorities, to be construed with was multiplied : was multiplied by the exhortation of the Holy Ghost; i e., by the Holy Spirit inspiring the preachers, and moving the hearts of the hearers.
