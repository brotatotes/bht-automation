<p>Strengthened [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμουμενοι] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament, but found in Septuagint. The compound (ejndunamow to make strong) is frequent in Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:20">Romans 4:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:10">Ephesians 6:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:13">Philippians 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:12">1 Timothy 1:12</span>. </p>

<p>With joyfulness. Compare ver. 24; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2">James 1:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:3">James 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:13">1 Peter 4:13</span>. Some connect with giving thanks, ver. 12, and this is favored by the construction of the previous clauses : in every good work bearing fruit : with all power strengthened : with joy giving thanks. But Paul is not always careful to maintain the symmetry of his periods. The idea of joy is contained in thanksgiving, which would make the emphatic position of with joy inexplicable; besides which we lose thus the idea of joyful endurance (ver. 24) and of joyful suffering expressing itself in thanksgiving. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:3">Romans 5:3</span>.</p>
