<p>Forgiveness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεσιν] </span></span>. See on remission, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>; forgiven, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:15">James 5:15</span>. Forgiveness defines redemption. Lightfoot's suggestion is very interesting that this precise definition may convey an allusion to the perversion of the term ajpolutrwsiv by the Gnostics of a later age, and which was possibly foreshadowed in the teaching of the Colossian heretics. The Gnostics used it to signify the result of initiation into certain mysteries. Lightfoot quotes from Irenaeus the baptismal formula of the Marcosians 186 "into unity and redemption [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολυτρωσιν</span></span>] and communion of powers." The idea of a redemption of the world, and (in a perverted form) of the person and work of Christ as having part in it, distinctively marked the Gnostic schools. That from which the world was redeemed, however; was not sin, in the proper sense of the term, but something inherent in the constitution of the world itself, and therefore due to its Creator. </p>
