<p>The image [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εικων] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span>. For the Logos (Word) underlying the passage, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>. Image is more than likeness which may be superficial and incidental. It implies a prototype, and embodies the essential verity of its prototype. Compare in the form of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</span> (note), and the effulgence of the Father 's glory, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>. Also <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>. </p>
<p>Of the invisible God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του θεου του αορατου] </span></span>. Lit., of the God, the invisible. Thus is brought out the idea of manifestation which lies in image. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span>. </p>
<p>The first born of every creature [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτοτοκος πασης κτισεως] </span></span>. Rev., the first - born of all creation. For first - born, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>; for creation, on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:17">2 Corinthians 5:17</span>. As image points to revelation, so first - born points to eternal preexistence. Even the Rev. is a little ambiguous, for we must carefully avoid any suggestion that Christ was the first of created things, which is contradicted by the following words : in Him were all things created. The true sense is, born before the creation. Compare before all things, ver. 17. This fact of priority implies sovereignty. He is exalted above all thrones, etc., and all things are unto [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>] Him, as they are elsewhere declared to be unto God. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:27">Psalms 89:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>.</p>
