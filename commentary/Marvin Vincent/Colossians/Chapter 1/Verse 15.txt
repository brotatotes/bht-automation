The image [εικων] . See on Revelation 13:14. For the Logos (Word) underlying the passage, see on John 1:1. Image is more than likeness which may be superficial and incidental. It implies a prototype, and embodies the essential verity of its prototype. Compare in the form of God, Philippians 2:6 (note), and the effulgence of the Father 's glory, Hebrews 1:3. Also 1 John 1:1. Of the invisible God [του θεου του αορατου] . Lit., of the God, the invisible. Thus is brought out the idea of manifestation which lies in image. See on Revelation 13:14. The first born of every creature [πρωτοτοκος πασης κτισεως] . Rev., the first - born of all creation. For first - born, see on Revelation 1:5; for creation, on 2 Corinthians 5:17. As image points to revelation, so first - born points to eternal preexistence. Even the Rev. is a little ambiguous, for we must carefully avoid any suggestion that Christ was the first of created things, which is contradicted by the following words : in Him were all things created. The true sense is, born before the creation. Compare before all things, ver. 17. This fact of priority implies sovereignty. He is exalted above all thrones, etc., and all things are unto [εις] Him, as they are elsewhere declared to be unto God. Compare Psalms 89:27; Hebrews 1:2.
