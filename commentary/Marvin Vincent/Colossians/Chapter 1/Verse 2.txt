<p>Colossae. The form of the name appears to have been both Kolossai and Kolassai, the former being probably the earlier. </p>
<p>The city was in Phrygia, in the valley of the Lycus, about ten or twelve miles beyond Laodicaea and Hierapolis. The region is volcanic, and the earthquakes common to large portions of Asia Minor are here peculiarly severe. The tributaries of the Lyous carried calcareous matter which formed everywhere deposits of travertine, said to be among the most remarkable formations of this character in the world. "Ancient monuments are buried, fertile lands overlaid, river - beds choked up, and streams diverted, fantastic grottos and cascades and arches of stone formed by this strange, capricious power, at once destructive and creative, working silently and relentlessly through long ages. Fatal to vegetation, these incrustations spread like a stony shroud over the ground. gleaming like glaciers on the hillside, they attract the eye of the traveler at a distance of twenty miles, and form a singularly striking feature in scenery of more than common beauty and impressiveness" (Lightfoot). </p>
<p>The fertility of the region was nevertheless great. The fine sheep, and the chemical qualities of the streams which made the waters valuable for dyeing purposes, fostered a lively trade in dyed woolen goods. All the three cities were renowned for the brilliancy of their dyes. </p>
<p>Colossae stood at the junction of the Lycus with two other streams, on a highway between eastern and western Asia, and commanding the approaches to a pass in the Cadmus mountains. Both Herodotus and Xenophon speak of it as a prosperous and great city; but in Paul 's time its glory had waned. Its site was at last completely lost, and was not identified until the present century. Its ruins are insignificant. Paul never visited either of the three cities. The church at Colossae was the least important of any to which Paul 's epistles were addressed. </p>
<p>To the saints. A mode of address which characterizes Paul 's later epistles. The word is to be taken as a noun, and not construed as an adjective with faithful brethren : to the holy and faithful brethren. </p>
<p>And faithful brethren in Christ. Or believing brethren. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:1">Ephesians 1:1</span>. There is no singling out of the faithful brethren from among others who are less faithful. </p>
<p>Our Father. The only instance in which the name of the Father stands in the opening benediction of an epistle without the addition and Jesus Christ.</p>
