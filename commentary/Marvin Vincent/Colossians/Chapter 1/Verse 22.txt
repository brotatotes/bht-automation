<p>Body of His flesh. Which consisted of flesh; without which there could have been no death (see next clause). </p>
<p>To present [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραστησαι] </span></span>. Purpose of the reconciliation. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:30">Romans 8:30</span>. See on shewed himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:3">Acts 1:3</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span>, where it is used of presenting a sacrifice. 192 Holy, unblamable, unreprovable [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιους, αμωμους, ανεγκλητους] </span></span>. Holy, see on saints, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+3:7">Revelation 3:7</span>. The fundamental idea of the word is separation unto God and from worldly defilement. </p>
<p>Unblamable, Rev. much better, without blemish. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:27">Ephesians 5:27</span>; and see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:19">1 Peter 1:19</span>, and blemishes, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:13">2 Peter 2:13</span>. Unreprovable, not only actually free from blemish, but from the charge of it. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:8">1 Corinthians 1:8</span>, and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:14">1 Timothy 6:14</span>. </p>
<p>In His sight [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεωπιον αυοτυ] </span></span>. Rev., before Him. Him refers to God, not Christ. Whether the reference is to God 's future judgment or to His present approval, can hardly be determined by the almost unexceptional usage of katenwpion before, in the latter sense, as is unquestionably the case in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>. The simple ejnwpion before, is used in the former sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:9">Luke 12:9</span>. Emprosqen before, occurs in both senses. The reference to the future judgment seems the more natural as marking the consummation of the redemptive work described in vers. 20 - 22. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:27">Ephesians 5:27</span>, which corresponds with the figure of the bride, the Lamb 's wife, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span> sqq. This view is further warranted by the following words, if ye continue, etc., the final presentation being dependent on steadfastness. 193</p>
