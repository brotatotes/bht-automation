For grounded, see on settle, 1 Peter 5:10; compare Luke 6:48, Luke 6:49; Ephesians 3:17. Settled, from edra a seat. Rev., steadfast.

The one implies greater respect to the foundation by which believers are supported; but settled suggests inward strength which believers themselves possess." Moved away [μετακινουμενοι] . The present participle signifying continual shifting. Compare 1 Corinthians 14:58. To every creature [εν παση κτισει] . Rev, correctly, in all creation. See on 2 Corinthians 5:17, and compare ver. 15.
