<p>Continue in the faith [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιμενετε τη πιστει. ] </span></span>. The verb means to stay at or with [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι] </span></span>. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:24">Philippians 1:24</span>, to abide by the flesh. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1">Romans 6:1</span>. The faith is not the gospel system (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:7">Acts 6:7</span>), but the Colossians' faith in Christ. Your faith would be better. </p>
<p>Grounded and settled [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεθελεωμενοι και εδραιοι] </span></span>. For grounded, see on settle, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:10">1 Peter 5:10</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:48">Luke 6:48</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:49">Luke 6:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:17">Ephesians 3:17</span>. Settled, from edra a seat. Rev., steadfast. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:37">1 Corinthians 7:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:58">1 Corinthians 14:58</span>, the only other passages where it occurs. Compare eJdraiwma ground, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:15">1 Timothy 3:15</span>. Bengel says : "The former is metaphorical, the latter more literal. The one implies greater respect to the foundation by which believers are supported; but settled suggests inward strength which believers themselves possess." </p>
<p>Moved away [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετακινουμενοι] </span></span>. The present participle signifying continual shifting. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:58">1 Corinthians 14:58</span>. </p>
<p>To every creature [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν παση κτισει] </span></span>. Rev, correctly, in all creation. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:17">2 Corinthians 5:17</span>, and compare ver. 15.</p>
