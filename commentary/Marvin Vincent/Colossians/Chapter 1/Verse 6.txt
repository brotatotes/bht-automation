<p>Which is come unto you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του παροντος εις υμας] </span></span>. Lit., which is present unto you. Has come and is present. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:7">Luke 11:7</span>, "are with me into bed." </p>
<p>In all the world. Hyperbolical. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:8">Romans 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:8">1 Thessalonians 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:6">Acts 17:6</span>. Possibly with a suggestion of the universal character of the Gospel as contrasted with the local and special character of false Gospels. Compare ver. 23. </p>
<p>And bringeth forth fruit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και εστι καρποφορουμενον] </span></span>. Lit., and is bearing fruit. The text varies. The best texts omit and. Some join esti is with the previous clause, as it is in all the world, and take bearing fruit as a parallel participle. So Rev. Others, better, join is with the participle, "even as it is bearing fruit." This would emphasize the continuous fruitfulness of the Gospel. The middle voice of the verb, of which this is the sole instance, marks the fruitfulness of the Gospel by its own inherent power. Compare the active voice in ver. 10, and see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:28">Mark 4:28</span>, " the earth bringeth forth fruit aujtomath of herself, self - acting. For a similar use of the middle, see show, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:7">Ephesians 2:7</span>; worketh, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:6">Galatians 5:6</span>. </p>

"It makes wood as well" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαχλαρεν] </span></span>.</p>
