<p>I would that ye knew [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω υμας ειδεναι</span></span>] : Paul 's more usual form of expression is, I would not have you to be ignorant. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:13">Romans 1:13</span>. What great conflict I have [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλικον αγωνα εχω] </span></span>. Rev., how greatly I strive. Hlikon what great, only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:5">James 3:5</span>. Conflict, continuing the metaphor of ch. 1 29. Here of inward conflict, anxiety, prayer, as ch. 4 12. </p>
<p>Laodicaea. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>. </p>
<p>And for as many as [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και οσοι] </span></span>. Including all who come under the same category as the Colossians and Laodicaeans. Hence equivalent to all who, like yourselves, have not seen, etc. See, for a similar usage, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:6">Acts 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+18:17">Revelation 18:17</span>. Indicating that the Colossians and Laodicaeans were both personally unknown to Paul.</p>
