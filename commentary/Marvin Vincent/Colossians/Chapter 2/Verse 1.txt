Rev., how greatly I strive. Hlikon what great, only here and James 3:5. Conflict, continuing the metaphor of ch. 1 29. Here of inward conflict, anxiety, prayer, as ch. 4 12. Laodicaea. See on Revelation 3:14. And for as many as [και οσοι] . Including all who come under the same category as the Colossians and Laodicaeans.
