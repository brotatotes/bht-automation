<p>Buried [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνταφεντες] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>. The aorist tense puts the burial as contemporaneous with the circumcision. Ye were circumcised when ye were buried, etc. </p>
<p>In baptism [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω βαπτισματι ορ βαπτισμω] </span></span>. The article, the baptism points to the familiar rite, or may have the force of your. </p>
<p>Wherein also [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ω και] </span></span>. Referring to baptism, not to Christ. </p>
<p>Ye were raised with Him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνηγερθητε] </span></span>. The burial and the raising are both typified in baptism. The raising is not the resurrection to eternal life at Christ 's second coming, but the moral resurrection to a new life.

<p>Through the faith of the operation of God. Not the faith which God works, but your faith in God 's working : faith in God 's energy as displayed in Christ 's resurrection. Hence the emphasis which is laid on faith in the resurrection. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:4">1 Corinthians 14:4</span> (note); <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:9">Romans 10:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:19">Ephesians 1:19</span>. vers. 11, 12 should be compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:2-6">Romans 6:2-6</span>.</p>
