Buried [συνταφεντες] . See on Romans 6:4. The aorist tense puts the burial as contemporaneous with the circumcision. Ye were circumcised when ye were buried, etc. In baptism [εν τω βαπτισματι ορ βαπτισμω] . The article, the baptism points to the familiar rite, or may have the force of your. Wherein also [εν ω και] . Referring to baptism, not to Christ. Ye were raised with Him [συνηγερθητε] . The burial and the raising are both typified in baptism. The raising is not the resurrection to eternal life at Christ 's second coming, but the moral resurrection to a new life. This corresponds with the drift of the entire passage, with the figurative sense of buried, and with Romans 6:4, which is decisive. Through the faith of the operation of God. Not the faith which God works, but your faith in God 's working : faith in God 's energy as displayed in Christ 's resurrection. Hence the emphasis which is laid on faith in the resurrection. See 1 Corinthians 14:3, 1 Corinthians 14:4 (note); Romans 10:9; Ephesians 1:19. vers. 11, 12 should be compared with Romans 6:2-6.
