Therefore. Conclusion from the canceling of the bond. The allusions which follow (vers. 16 - 19) are to the practical and theoretical forms of the Colossian error, as in vers. 9 - 15; excessive ritualism, asceticism, and angelic mediation. Judge [κρινετω] . Sit in judgment. Meat - drink [βρωσει - ποσει] . Properly, eating, drinking, as 1 Corinthians 8:4; but the nouns are also used for that which is eaten or drunk, as John 4:32 (see note); John 6:27, John 6:55; Romans 14:17. For the subject - matter compare Romans 14:17; 1 Corinthians 8:8; Hebrews 9:10, and note on Mark 7:19. The Mosaic law contained very few provisions concerning drinks. See Leviticus 10:9; Leviticus 11:34, Leviticus 11:36; Numbers 6:3. Hence it is probable that the false teachers had extended the prohibitions as to the use of wine to all Christians. The Essenes abjured both wine and animal food. In respect [εν μερει] . See on 2 Corinthians 3:10. Lit., in the division or category. Holyday [εορτης] . Festival or feast - day. The annual festivals. The word holyday is used in its earlier sense of a sacred day. New moon [νουμηνιας] . Only here in the New Testament. The monthly festivals. The festival of the new moon is placed beside the Sabbath, Isaiah 1:13; Ezekiel 46:1. The day was celebrated by blowing of trumpets, special sacrifices, feasting, and religious instruction. Labor was suspended, and no national or private fasts were permitted to take place. The authorities were at great pains to fix accurately the commencement of the month denoted by the appearance of the new moon. Messengers were placed on commanding heights to watch the sky, and as soon as the new moon appeared, they hastened to communicate it to the synod, being allowed even to travel on the Sabbath for this purpose. The witnesses were assembled and examined, and when the judges were satisfied the president pronounced the words it is sanctified, and the day was declared new moon. Sabbath days [σαββατων] . The weekly festivals. Rev., correctly, day, the plural being used for the singular. See on Luke 4:31; Acts 20:7. The plural is only once used in the New Testament of more than a single day (Acts 17:2). The same enumeration of sacred seasons occurs 1Ch 33:31; 2 Chronicles 2:4; 2 Chronicles 31:3; Ezekiel 45:17; Hosea 2:11.
