<p>Ye be dead [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεθανετε] </span></span>. Rev., more correctly, ye died; the aorist tense indicating a definite event. Paul uses the word died in many different relations, expressing that with which death dissolves the connection. Thus, died unto sin, unto self, unto the law, unto the world. </p>
<p>Rudiments of the world. Elementary teachings and practices the peculiar sphere of which is the world. World [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοσμου</span></span>] has its ethical sense, the sum - total of human life in the ordered world, considered apart from, alienated from, and hostile to God, and of the earthly things which seduce from God. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span>. </p>
<p>Are ye subject to ordinances [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δογματιζεσθε] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. Rev., subject yourselves. Better passive, as emphasizing spiritual bondage. Why do ye submit to be dictated to? See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:22">1 Corinthians 1:22</span>, where the imperious attitude of the Jews appears in their demanding credentials of the Gospel as sole possessors of the truth. The ordinances include both those of the law and of philosophy.</p>
