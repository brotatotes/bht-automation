Touch - taste - handle [αψη - γευση - θιγης] . %Aptomai, A. V., touch, is properly to fasten one's self to or cling to. So John 20:17 (note). Frequently rendered touch in the New Testament, and used in most cases of Christ 's touching or being touched by the diseased. To get hands on so as to injure, 1 John 5:18. To have intercourse with, 1 Corinthians 7:1; 2 Corinthians 6:17. Thus, in every case, the contact described exerts a modifying influence, and a more permanent contact or effect of contact is often implied than is expressed by touch. "The idea of a voluntary or conscious effort is often involved." No single English word will express all these phases of meaning. Handle comes, perhaps, as near as any other, especially in its sense of treatment, as when we say that a speaker or writer handles a subject; or that a man is roughly handled by his enemies. This wider and stronger sense does not attach to qigganein A. V., handl
