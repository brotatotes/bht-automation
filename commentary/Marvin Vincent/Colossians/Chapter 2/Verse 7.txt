<p>Rooted - built up [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερριζωμενοι - εποικοδομουμενοι] </span></span>. Note the change of metaphor from the solidity of military array to walking, rooting of a tree, and then to building. The metaphors of rooting and being founded occur together, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:17">Ephesians 3:17</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+1:10">Jeremiah 1:10</span>, ejkrizoun to root out is applied to a kingdom, and the words to build and to plant follow. It must be said that rJizow to cause to take root is often used in the sense of firmness or fixedness without regard to its primary meaning. Built up. The preposition ejpi upon indicates the placing of one layer upon another. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:32">Acts 20:32</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:10-14">1 Corinthians 3:10-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>. note also the change of tenses : having been rooted (perfect participle), being (in process of) built up and strengthened (present participle). </p>
<p>In Him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτω] </span></span>. Rather than upon Him, as might have been expected. In this and in the Ephesian epistle, Christ is represented as the sphere within which the building goes on. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>. The whole upbuilding of the Church proceeds within the compass of Christ 's personality, life, and power. </p>
<p>Thanksgiving [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστια] </span></span>. For Paul 's emphasis on thanksgiving, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21">Romans 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:6">Romans 14:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:11">2 Corinthians 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:15">2 Corinthians 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:11">2 Corinthians 9:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:12">2 Corinthians 9:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:20">Ephesians 5:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:1">1 Timothy 2:1</span>, etc. Eujcaristov thankful, eujcaristein to give thanks, eujcaristia thanksgiving, are found only in Paul 's writings.</p>
