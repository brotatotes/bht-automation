<p>Peace of Christ. Which comes from Christ. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:27">John 14:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:14">Ephesians 2:14</span>. </p>
<p>Rule [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βραβευετω] </span></span>. Lit., be umpire. Only here in the New Testament. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>. The previous references to occasions for meekness, long - suffering, forbearance, forgiveness, etc., indicate a conflict of passions and motives in the heart. Christ is the one who adjusts all these, so that the metaphorical sense is appropriate, as in ch. 2 18. </p>
<p>Called in one body. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:4">Ephesians 4:4</span>. So that ye are in one body according to your call.</p>
