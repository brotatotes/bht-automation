Masters [κυριοις] . See on Lord, 2 Peter 2:1, and Matthew 21:3. Kuriov Lord and despothv master came to be used interchangeably in the New Testament, though originally the latter involved such authority as is implied in our use of despot, or in the relation of a master to a slave. The Greeks applied despothv only to the gods. With eye - service [εν οφθαλμοδουλειαις] . Only here and Ephesians 6:6. The word seems to have been coined by Paul. Men pleasers [ανθρωπαρεσκοι] . Only here and Ephesians 6:6. Compare Plato : "And this art he will not attain without a great deal of trouble, which a good man ought to undergo, not for the sake of speaking and acting before men, but in order that he may be able to say what is acceptable to God, and always to act acceptably to Him as far as in him lies. For there is a saying of wiser men than ourselves, that a man of sense should not try to please his fellow - servants (at least this should not be his first object), but his good and noble masters" " Phaedrus, " 273). Singleness [απλοτητι] . See on Romans 12:8. Without duplicity or doubleness. Fearing the Lord [τον κυριον] . The one Master contrasted with the masters [κυριοις] according to the flesh. The parallel in Ephesians 6:5, has as unto Christ.
