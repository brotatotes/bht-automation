Laboring fervently [αγωνιζομενος] . Rev., striving. See on ch. Colossians 1:29; Colossians 2:1. Compare Romans 14:30. Perfect [τελειοι] . See on 1 Corinthians 2:6, 1 Corinthians 2:7; ch. 1 28. Complete [πεπληροφορημενοι] . See on most surely believed, Luke 1:1; and compare full assurance, ch. 2 2. Rev., fully assured. In all the will [εν παντι θεληματι] . Lit., in every will. Will means the thing willed, as Luke 12:47; James 5:3 James 5:0; 1 Thessalonians 5:18. Hence used sometimes in the plural, as Acts 13:22, shall do all my will [θεληματα] , i e., perform all the things willed by me. Ephesians 2:3, desires, strictly willings. So here the sense is, everything willed by God. The connection is apparently with staqhte ye may stand. For a similar construction see John 8:44; Romans 5:2; 1 Corinthians 14:1; 1 Corinthians 16:13. As Meyer observes, this connection gives stand both a modal definition (perfect and fully assured) and a local definition (in all the will).
