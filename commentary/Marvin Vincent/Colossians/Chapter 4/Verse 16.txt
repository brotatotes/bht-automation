<p>The epistle from Laodicaea [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την εκ λαοδικειας] </span></span>. That is, the letter left at Laodicaea, and to be obtained by you from the church there. This letter cannot be positively identified. The composition known as the Epistle to the Laodicaeans is a late and clumsy forgery, existing only in Latin MSS., and made up chiefly of disconnected passages from Philippians, with a few from other epistles. 208</p>
