<p>Tychicus. Mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:21">Ephesians 6:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:12">2 Timothy 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:12">Titus 3:12</span>. </p>
<p>Minister [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονος] </span></span>. Probably to Paul himself. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>. Scarcely in the official sense of deacon. </p>
<p>Fellow - servant [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνδουλος] </span></span>. Used by Paul only here and ch. 1 7, of Epaphras. By this term he designates Tychicus as, in common with himself, a servant of Jesus Christ. Probably not with a strict, but with a quasi official reference.</p>
