Tychicus. Mentioned Acts 20:4; Ephesians 6:21; 2 Timothy 4:12; Titus 3:12. Minister [διακονος] . Probably to Paul himself. Compare Acts 19:22; Acts 20:4. Scarcely in the official sense of deacon. Fellow - servant [συνδουλος] . Used by Paul only here and ch. 1 7, of Epaphras. By this term he designates Tychicus as, in common with himself, a servant of Jesus Christ. Probably not with a strict, but with a quasi official reference.
