In Him. Resuming emphatically : in Christ. We have obtained an inheritance [εκληρωθημεν] . Only here in the New Testament. From klhrov a lot. Hence the verb means literally to determine, choose, or assign by lot. From the custom of assigning portions of land by lot, klhrov acquires the meaning of that which is thus assigned; the possession or portion of land. So often in the Old Testament. See Sept., Numbers 34:14; Deuteronomy 3:18; Deuteronomy 14:4, etc. An heir [κληρονομος] is originally one who obtains by lot. The A. V. here makes the verb active where it should be passive. The literal sense is we were designated as a heritage. So Rev., correctly, were made a heritage. Compare Deuteronomy 4:20, a people of inheritance [λαον εγκληρον] . Also Deuteronomy 32:8, Deuteronomy 32:9.
