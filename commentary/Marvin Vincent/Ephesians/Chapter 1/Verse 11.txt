<p>In Him. Resuming emphatically : in Christ. </p>
<p>We have obtained an inheritance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκληρωθημεν] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. From klhrov a lot. Hence the verb means literally to determine, choose, or assign by lot. From the custom of assigning portions of land by lot, klhrov acquires the meaning of that which is thus assigned; the possession or portion of land. So often in the Old Testament. See Sept., <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+34:14">Numbers 34:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+3:18">Deuteronomy 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+14:4">Deuteronomy 14:4</span>, etc. An heir [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κληρονομος</span></span>] is originally one who obtains by lot. The A. V. here makes the verb active where it should be passive. The literal sense is we were designated as a heritage. So Rev., correctly, were made a heritage. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+4:20">Deuteronomy 4:20</span>, a people of inheritance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαον εγκληρον] </span></span>. Also <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+32:8">Deuteronomy 32:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+32:9">Deuteronomy 32:9</span>.</p>
