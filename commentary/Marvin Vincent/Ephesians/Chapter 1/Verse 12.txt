<p>Who first trusted [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους προηλπικοτας] </span></span>. In apposition with we [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σηουλδ βε] </span></span>. So Rev., we who had, etc., trusted, more properly hoped; and first trusted is ambiguous. We refers to Jewish Christians, and the verb describes their messianic hope before [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ</span></span>] the advent of Christ. Hence Rev., correctly, we who had (have) before hoped. In Christ should be "in the Christ," as the subject of messianic expectation and not as Jesus, for whom Christ had passed into a proper name. It is equivalent to in the Messiah. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>.</p>
