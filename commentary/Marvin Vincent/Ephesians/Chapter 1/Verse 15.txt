Your faith [την καθ υμας πιστιν] . The Greek phrase is nowhere else used by Paul. Lit., as Rev., the faith which is among you. Expositors endeavor to make a distinction between this and Paul 's common phrase hJ pistiv uJmwn your faith, but they differ widely, and the distinction is at best doubtful. Love. Omit. Unto all the saints [την εις παντας τους αγιους] . Lit., that which is toward all, etc. Love being omitted, this refers to faith : faith which displays its work and fruits toward fellow Christians. See on Philippians 1:5, Ephesians 1:0:6Compare work of faith, 1 Thessalonians 1:3. Though love is not mentioned, yet faith works by love. Galatians 5:6.
