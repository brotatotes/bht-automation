Exceeding [υπερβαλλον] . Compounds with uJper over, beyond, are characteristic of Paul 's intensity of style, and mark the struggle of language with the immensity of the divine mysteries, and the opulence of the divine grace. See ver. 21; Ephesians 3:20; 2 Corinthians 4:17, etc. According to the working of His mighty power [κατα την ενεργειαν του κρατους της ισχυος αυτου] . The A. V. frequently impairs the force of a passage by combining into a single conception two words which represent distinct ideas; translating two nouns by an adjective and a noun. Thus Philippians 3:21, vile body, glorious body, for body of humiliation, body of glory : Romans 8:21, glorious liberty, for liberty of the glory : 2 Corinthians 4:4, glorious gospel, for gospel of the glory : Colossians 1:11, glorious power, for power of the glory : 1 Peter 1:14, obedient children, for children of obedience : 2 Peter 2:14, cursed children, for children of cursing. So here, mighty power, for strength of might. The idea is thus diluted, and the peculiar force and distinction of the separate words is measurably lost. Rev., correctly, working of the strength of His might. For working, see on Colossians 1:29. For strength and might, see on 2 Peter 2:11; John 1:12. Strength [κρατους] is used only of God, and denotes relative and manifested power. Might [ισχυος] . is indwelling strength. Working [ενεργειαν] is the active, efficient manifestation of these. Hence we have here God 's indwelling power, which inheres in the divine nature (strength); the relative quality or measure of this power (might); and the efficient exertion of the divine quality (working). The phrase, according to the working of the strength, etc., is to be connected with the exceeding greatness of His power. The magnitude of God 's power toward believers is known in the operation of the strength of His might.
