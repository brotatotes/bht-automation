Which is His body [ητις] . The double relative is explanatory, seeing it is : by which I mean. Body, a living organism of which He is the head. See on Colossians 1:18. The fullness. See on John 1:16; Romans 11:12; Colossians 1:19. That which is filled. The Church, viewed as a receptacle. Compare ch. 3 10. That filleth all in all (ta panta ejn pasin plhroumenou). Better, that filleth all things with all things. The expression is somewhat obscure. All things are composed of elements. Whatever things exist, God from His fullness fills with all those elements which belong to their being or welfare. The whole universe is thus filled by Him.
