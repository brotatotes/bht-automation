<p>Blessed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευλογητος] </span></span>. Placed first in the clause for emphasis, as always in the corresponding Hebrew in the Old Testament. The verb is commonly omitted - blessed the God. In the New Testament used of God only. The perfect participle of the verb, eujloghmenov blessed, is used of men. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span>. The word differs from that used in the Beatitudes, makariov. which denotes character, while this word denotes repute. Lit., well - spoken of. </p>
<p>God and Father of our Lord, etc. Some object to this rendering on the ground that the phrase God of Christ is unusual, occurring nowhere in Paul, except ver. 17 of this chapter. Such render, God who is also the Father, etc. But Christ of God is found <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:46">Matthew 27:46</span>; and my God, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:17">John 20:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span>. Compare, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:23">1 Corinthians 3:23</span>; and the phrase is undoubted in ver. 17. </p>
<p>Hath blessed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευλογησας] </span></span>. Kindred with eujloghtov blessed. </p>
<p>Spiritual [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικη] </span></span>. Another leading word. Spirit and spiritual occur thirteen times. Paul emphasizes in this epistle the work of the divine Spirit upon the human spirit. Not spiritual as distinguished from bodily, but proceeding from the Holy Spirit. Note the collocation of the words, blessed, blessed, blessing. </p>
<p>In the heavenly places [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις επουρανιοις] </span></span>. Another keyword; one of the dominant thoughts of the epistle being the work of the ascended Christ. Places is supplied, the Greek meaning in the heavenlies. Some prefer to supply things, as more definitely characterizing spiritual blessing. But in the four other passages where the phrase occurs, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:6">Ephesians 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span>, the sense is local, and ejpouraniov heavenly, is local throughout Paul 's epistles. The meaning is that the spiritual blessings of God are found in heaven and are brought thence to us. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:20">Philippians 3:20</span>.</p>
