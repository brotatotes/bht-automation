<p>Wherein He hath abounded [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ης επερισσευσεν] </span></span>. Rev., correctly, which He made to abound. The verb is used both transitively and intransitively in the New Testament. The transitive use belongs mainly to later Greek. Compare, for the transitive sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:12">Matthew 13:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:15">2 Corinthians 4:15</span>. </p>
<p>In all wisdom and prudence [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν παση σοφια και φρονησει] </span></span>. For wisdom, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:33">Romans 11:33</span>. For prudence, on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:17">Luke 1:17</span>. The latter is an attribute or result of wisdom, concerned with its practical applications. Both words refer here to men, not to God : the wisdom and prudence with which He abundantly endows His followers. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:9">Colossians 1:9</span>. All wisdom is, properly, every kind of wisdom.</p>
