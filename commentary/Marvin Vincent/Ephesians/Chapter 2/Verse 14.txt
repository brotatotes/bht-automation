<p>Our peace [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ειρηνη ημων] </span></span>. Christ is similarly described in abstract terms in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:30">1 Corinthians 1:30</span>; wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:27">Colossians 1:27</span>, hope of glory. Christ is thus not merely our peace - maker, but our very peace itself. </p>
<p>Both [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα αμφοτερα] </span></span>. Lit., the both. The neuter gender shows that Jews and Gentiles are conceived by the writer merely as two facts. The masculine is used in vers. 15, 16. </p>
<p>Hath broken down [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυσας] </span></span>. Lit, loosened or dissolved. Rev., giving the force of the aorist tense, brake down. The participle has an explanatory force, in that He brake down. </p>
<p>The middle - wall of partition [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μεσοτοιχον του φραγμου] </span></span>. Lit., the middle wall of the fence or hedge. The wall which pertained to the fence; the fact of separation being emphasized in wall, and the instrument of separation in fence. The hedge was the whole Mosaic economy which separated Jew from Gentile. Some suppose a reference to the stone screen which bounded the court of the Gentiles in the temple.</p>
