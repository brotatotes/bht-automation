Having abolished in His flesh the enmity [την εχθραν εν τη σαρκι αυτου καταργησας] . The enmity immediately follows the middle wall of partition, and should be rendered in apposition with and as defining it, and as dependent on brake down, not on abolished : the middle wall which was the enmity. It is used abstractly, as peace in ver. 14. The enmity was the result and working of the law regarded as a separative system; as it separated Jew from Gentile, and both from God. See Romans 3:20; Romans 4:15; Romans 5:20; Romans 7:7-11. For abolished, see on cumbereth, Luke 13:7, and make without effect, Romans 3:3. The law of commandments contained in ordinances [τον νομον των εντολων εν δογμασιν] . The law, etc., depends in construction on having abolished, and is not in apposition with the enmity, as A. V. The middle wall of partition, the enmity, was dissolved by the abolition of the law of commandments. Construe in His flesh with having abolished. Law is general, and its contents are defined by commandments, special injunctions, which injunctions in turn were formulated in definite decrees. Render the entire passage : brake down the middle - wall of partition, even the enmity, by abolishing in His flesh the law of commandments contained in ordinances. For to make [ινα κτιση] . Rev., that He might create. See on created, ver. Ephesians 2:10The work was to be a new creation on a new foundation. In Himself. As the medium of reconciliation. Of the twain one new man [τους δυο εις ενα καινον ανθρωπον] . The Greek is livelier : make the two into one new man. Kainon new, emphasizes the new quality; not newness in point of time. See on Matthew 26:29.
