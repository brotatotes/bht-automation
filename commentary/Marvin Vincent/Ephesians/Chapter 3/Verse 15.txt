<p>Of whom [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ ου] </span></span>. After whom. </p>
<p>The whole family [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασα πατρια</span></span>] Rev., more correctly, every family. Patria is, more properly, a group of families - all who claim a common pathr. father. Family, according to our usage of the term, would be oikov house. The Israelites were divided into tribes [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλαι] </span></span>, and then into patpiai, each deriving its descent from one of Jacob 's grandsons; and these again into oikoi houses. So Joseph was both of the house [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικου</span></span>] and family [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατριας</span></span>] of David. We find the phrase oikoi patriwn houses of the families, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:3">Exodus 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+1:2">Numbers 1:2</span>. The word occurs only three times in the New Testament : here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:4">Luke 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:25">Acts 3:25</span>. In the last - named passage it is used in a wide, general sense, of nations. Family is perhaps the best translation, if taken in its wider meaning of a body belonging to a common stock - a clan. Fatherhood (Rev., in margin), following the Vulgate paternitas, means rather the fact and quality of paternity. Observe the play of the words, which can scarcely be reproduced in English, pater, patria. </p>
<p>In heaven and earth. To the angelic hosts and the tribes of men alike, God is Father. There may be a suggestion of the different ranks or grades of angels, as principalities, thrones, powers, etc. See ver. 10. "Wherever in heaven or in earth beings are grouped from their relation to a father, the name they bear in each case is derived from the Father" (Riddle).</p>
