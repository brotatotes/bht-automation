Inward man : compare outward man, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:16">2 Corinthians 4:16</span>. It is the rational and moral I; the essence of the man which is conscious of itself as a moral personality. In the unregenerate it is liable to fall under the power of sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span>); and in the regenerate it needs constant renewing and strengthening by the Spirit of God, as here.
