<p>Exceeding abundantly [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερεκπερισσου] </span></span>. Only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:10">1 Thessalonians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:13">1 Thessalonians 5:13</span>. Superabundantly. One of the numerous compounds of uJper beyond, over and above, of which Paul is fond. Of twenty - eight words compounded with this preposition in the New Testament, Paul alone uses twenty. For the order and construction, see next note. </p>
<p>Above all [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ παντα] </span></span>. These words should not be connected with that, as A. V. and Rev. : "above all that we ask," etc. They form with do an independent clause. The next clause begins with exceedingly above, and is construed with w=n that which we ask, etc. Read the whole, "Unto Him who is able to do beyond all, exceedingly above that which," etc.</p>
