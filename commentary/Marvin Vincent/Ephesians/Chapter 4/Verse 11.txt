Compare 1 Corinthians 3:5, "ministers as the Lord gave;" also 1 Corinthians 3:21, 1 Corinthians 3:22. The distinguishing features of an apostle were, a commission directly from Christ : being a witness of the resurrection : special inspiration : supreme authority : accrediting by miracles : unlimited commission to preach and to found churches. Prophets. Preachers and expounders under the immediate influence of the Spirit, and thus distinguished from teachers. 1 Corinthians 12:10. Evangelists. Traveling missionaries. Pastors and teachers. Pastors or shepherds. The verb poimainw to tend as a shepherd, is often used in this sense. See on 1 Peter 5:2; Matthew 2:6. The omission of the article from teachers seems to indicate that pastors and teachers are included under one class. The two belong together. No man is fit to be a pastor who cannot also teach, and the teacher needs the knowledge which pastoral experience gives.
