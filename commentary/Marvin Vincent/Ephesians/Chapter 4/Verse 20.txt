Have not learned [ουχ εμαθετε] . Rev., giving the force of the aorist tense, did not learn; at the time of your conversion, when you were instructed in Christ 's precepts. The phrase learn Christ occurs nowhere else. Christ does not stand for the doctrine of Christ; but Christ is the subject of His own message. See ver. 21.
