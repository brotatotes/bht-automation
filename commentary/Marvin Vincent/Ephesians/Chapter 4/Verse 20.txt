<p>Have not learned [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ εμαθετε] </span></span>. Rev., giving the force of the aorist tense, did not learn; at the time of your conversion, when you were instructed in Christ 's precepts. The phrase learn Christ occurs nowhere else. Christ does not stand for the doctrine of Christ; but Christ is the subject of His own message. See ver. 21.</p>
