Falsehood [το ψευδος] . Lit., the lie; used abstractly. See on John 8:44. Members one of another. Compare Romans 12:5; 1 Corinthians 12:12-27. Chrysostom says : "Let not the eye lie to the foot, nor the foot to the eye. If there be a deep pit, and its mouth covered with reeds shall present to the eye the appearance of solid ground, will not the eye use the foot to ascertain whether it is hollow underneath, or whether it is firm and resists? Will the foot tell a lie, and not the truth as it is? And what, again, if the eye were to spy a serpent or a wild beast, will it lie to the foot ?"
