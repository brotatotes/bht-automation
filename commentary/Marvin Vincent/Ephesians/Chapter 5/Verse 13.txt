<p>All things [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα παντα] </span></span>. More literally, they all, or all of them; the secret sins just mentioned. </p>
<p>That are reproved [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγχομενα] </span></span>. Lit., being reproved. Rev., when they are reproved. Reproved is to be taken in the same literal sense as in ver. 11, and not metaphorically in the sense of being demonstrated by light, or brought to light, which is almost synonymous with are made manifest. By the light. Connect with are made manifest, not with are reproved. Whatsoever doth make manifest is light [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν το φανερουμενον φως εστιν] </span></span>. Wrong. The A. V. renders doth make manifest, as in the middle voice, but the verb is in the passive voice. It occurs nearly fifty times in the New Testament, and never as middle. Hence Rev., correctly, everything that is made manifest. </p>
<p>Is light. A general proposition, going to show that manifestation can come only through light. Whatever is revealed in its true essence by light is of the nature of light. It no longer belongs to the category of darkness. Manifestation is a law of good and evil alike. That which is of the truth seeks the light and cometh to the light. That which is evil avoids the light, and loves darkness better than light, but none the less is brought to the light and appears in its own light. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:20">John 3:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:21">John 3:21</span>. This truth is embodied in another form in the parable of the Tares. Growth is manifestation. By suffering the tares to grow, their difference from the wheat, which at first is not apparent, is fully revealed.</p>
