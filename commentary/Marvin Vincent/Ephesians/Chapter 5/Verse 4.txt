<p>Filthiness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αισχροτης] </span></span>. Obscenity. </p>
<p>Foolish talking [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωρολογια] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. Talk which is both foolish and sinful. Compare corrupt communication, ch. 4 29. It is more than random or idle talk. "Words obtain a new earnestness when assumed into the ethical terminology of Christ 's school. Nor, in seeking to enter fully into the meaning of this one, ought we to leave out of sight the greater emphasis which the words fool, foolish, folly obtain in Scripture than elsewhere they have or can have" (Trench). </p>
<p>Jesting [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευτραπελια] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. From euj well or easily, prepw to turn. That which easily turns and adapts itself to the moods and conditions of those with whom it may be dealing at the moment. From this original sense of versatility it came to be applied to morals, as timeserving, and to speech with the accompanying notion of dissimulation. Aristotle calls it chastened insolence. The sense of the word here is polished and witty speech as the instrument of sin; refinement and versatility without the flavor of Christian grace. "Sometimes it is lodged in a sly question, in a smart answer, in a quirkish reason, in shrewd intimation, in cunningly diverting or cleverly retorting an objection : sometimes it is couched in a bold scheme of speech, in a tart irony, in a lusty hyperbole, in a startling metaphor, in a plausible reconciling of contradictions, or in acute nonsense.... Sometimes an affected simplicity, sometimes a presumptuous bluntness giveth it being.... Its ways are unaccountable and inexplicable, being answerable to the numberless rovings of fancy and windings of language" (Barrow, Sermon 14, "Against Foolish Talking and Jesting." The whole passage is well worth reading).</p>
