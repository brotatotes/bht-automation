Take the helmet of salvation [την περικεφαλαιαν του σωτηριου δεξασθε] . Compare Isaiah 59:17; 1 Thessalonians 5:8. Take is a different word from that used in vers. 13, 16. It is receive as from God. The meaning is the helmet which is salvation. The protection for the head. The helmet was originally of skin, strengthened with bronze or other metal, and surmounted with a figure adorned with a horsehair crest. It was furnished with a visor to protect the face. Sword of the Spirit [μαχαιραν του πνευματος] . See on Revelation 6:4. The word of God serves both for attack and to parry the thrusts of the enemy. Thus Christ used it in His temptation. It is the sword of the Spirit, because the Spirit of God gives it and inspires it. The Spirit's aid is needed for its interpretation. Compare John 14:10; Hebrews 4:12, in which latter passage the image is sacrificial. Word of God [ρημα θεου] . See on Luke 1:37. See Luke 3:2; Luke 4:4; Romans 10:17; Hebrews 6:5; Hebrews 11:3.
