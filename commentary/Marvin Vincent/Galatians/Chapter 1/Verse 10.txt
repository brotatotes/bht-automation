<p>For do I now persuade [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτι γαρ - πειθω] </span></span>. For introduces a justification of the severe language just used. The emphasis is on now, which answers to now in verse 9. I have been charged with conciliating men. Does this anathema of mine look like it? Is it a time for conciliatory words now, when Judaising emissaries are troubling you (verse 7) and persuading you to forsake the true gospel ? Persuade signifies conciliate, seek to win over. </p>
<p>Or God. Persuade or conciliate God is an awkward phrase; but the expression is condensed, and persuade is carried forward from the previous clause. This is not uncommon in Paul 's style : See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:5">Philippians 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:15">Ephesians 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</span>, where morfh form, applied to God, is probably the result of morfhn doulou form of a servant (verse 7) on which the main stress of the thought lies.</p>
