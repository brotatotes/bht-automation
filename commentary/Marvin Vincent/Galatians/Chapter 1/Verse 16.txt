<p>To reveal his Son in me [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαλυψαι τον υιον αυτου εν εμοι] </span></span>. In N. T. ajpokaluptein to reveal is habitually used with the simple dative of the subject of the revelation, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span>. Once with eijv unto, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:18">Romans 8:18</span> : with ejn in of the sphere in which the revelation takes place, only here, unless <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span> be so explained; but there ejn is probably instrumental. Render ejn here by the simple in : in my spirit, according to the familiar N. T. idea of God revealing himself, living and working in man's inner personality. See, for instance, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:19">Romans 1:19</span>; verse 5; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10">Romans 8:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:25">1 Corinthians 14:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:5">1 John 2:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:14">1 John 2:14</span>, etc. Lightfoot explains, to reveal his Son by or through me to others. But apart from the doubtful use of ejn, this introduces prematurely the thought of Paul 's influence in his subsequent ministry. He is speaking of the initial stages of his experience. </p>
<p>Immediately [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευθεως] </span></span>. Connect only with I conferred not, etc. Not with the whole sentence down to Arabia. Paul is emphasising the fact that he did not receive his commission from men. As soon as God revealed his Son in me, I threw aside all human counsel. </p>
<p>Conferred [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσανεθεμην] </span></span>. P o. and only in Galatians. Rare in Class. The verb ajnatiqenai means to lay upon; hence intrust to. Middle voice, to intrust one's self to; to impart or communicate to another. The compounded preposition prov implies more than direction; rather communication or relation with, according to a frequent use of prov. The whole compound then, is to put one's self into communication with. Wetstein gives an example from Diodorus, De Alexandro, 1Jo 17:116, where the word is used of consulting soothsayers. </p>
<p>Flesh and blood. Always in N. T. with a suggestion of human weakness or ignorance.
