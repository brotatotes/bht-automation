<p>Went I up [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηλθον] </span></span>. Comp. verse 18. Only in this chapter, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:3">John 6:3</span>.

In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:22">Acts 18:22</span> the verb is used absolutely of going to Jerusalem.

<p>Arabia. It is entirely impossible to decide what Paul means by this term, since the word was so loosely used and so variously applied. Many think the Sinaitic peninsula is meant (Stanley, Farrar, Matheson, Lightfoot). Others, the district of Auranitis near Damascus (Lipsius, Conybeare and Howson, Lewin, McGiffert). Others again the district of Arabia Petraea.</p>
