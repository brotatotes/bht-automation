<p>Regions [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλιματα] </span></span>. P o. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:10">2 Corinthians 11:10</span>. Klima, originally an inclination or slope of ground : the supposed slope of the earth from the equator to the pole. The ancient geographers ran imaginary parallel lines from the equator toward the pole, and the spaces or zones or regions between these lines, viewed in their slope or inclination toward the pole, were klimata. The word came to signify the temperature of these zones, hence our climate. In Chaucer's treatise on the Astrolabe, chapter 39 is headed "Description of the Meridional Lyne, of Longitudes and Latitudes of Cities and Towns from on to another of Clymatz." He says : "The longitude of a clymat is a lyne imagined fro est to west, y - lyke distant by - twene them alle. The latitude of a clymat is a lyne imagined fro north to south the space of the erthe, fro the byginning of the firste clymat unto the verrey ende of the same clymat, even directe agayns the pole artik." In poetical language, "climes" is used for regions of the earth, as Milton : </p>
<p>"Whatever clime the sun's bright circle warms." </p>
<p>Syria and Cilicia. Syria, in the narrower sense, of the district of which Antioch was the capital : not the whole Roman province of Syria, including Galilee and Judaea. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:2">Luke 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:3">Acts 20:3</span>. This district was the scene of Paul 's first apostolic work among the Gentiles. Cilicia was the southeasterly province of Asia Minor, directly adjoining Syria, from which it was separated by Mt. Pierius and the range of Amanus. It was bordered by the Mediterranean on the south. It was Paul 's native province, and its capital was Tarsus, Paul 's birthplace.</p>
