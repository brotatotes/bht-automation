Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:9">Luke 18:9</span>, of those who were characteristically self - righteous. For trouble in the sense of disturbing faith and unsettling principle, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:10">Galatians 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:24">Acts 14:24</span>. Not necessarily, as Lightfoot, raising seditions.</p>
