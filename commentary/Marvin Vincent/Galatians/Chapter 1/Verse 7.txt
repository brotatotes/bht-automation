Another [αλλο] . A different gospel is not another gospel. There is but one gospel. But [ει μη] . Rev. only. As if he had said, "there is no other gospel, but there are some who trouble you with a different kind of teaching which they offer as a gospel." Some that trouble [οι ταρασσοντες] . The article with the participle marks these persons as characteristically troublesome - the troublers. Comp. Luke 18:9, of those who were characteristically self - righteous. For trouble in the sense of disturbing faith and unsettling principle, see Galatians 5:10; Acts 14:24. Not necessarily, as Lightfoot, raising seditions.
