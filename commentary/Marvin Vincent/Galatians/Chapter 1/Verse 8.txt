We. See on 1 Thessalonians 1:2. Angel from heaven [αγγελος εξ ουρανου] . The phrase only here. "Angels in heaven or the heavens," Matthew 22:30; Mark 12:25; Mark 13:32. "Angels of the heavens," Matthew 24:36. Other than that [παρ ο] . Roman Catholic interpreters insist that par' should be rendered contrary to, though the Vulg. gives praeterquam besides. Some Protestant interpreters insist on besides as being against supplementing the gospel with traditions. The explanation is found in the previous words, a different gospel. Any gospel which is different from the one gospel, is both beside and contrary to. Accursed [αναθεμα] . See on Romans 9:3, and offerings, Luke 21:5. Comp. katara, curse and ejpikataratov cursed, Galatians 3:13. In LXX always curse, except Leviticus 27:28, and the apocryphal books, where it is always gift or offering. By Paul always curse : see Romans 9:3; 1 Corinthians 12:3; 1 Corinthians 16:22. The sense of excommunication, introduces by patristic writers, does not appear in New Testament.
