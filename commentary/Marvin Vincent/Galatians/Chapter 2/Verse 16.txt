<p>Justified [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιουται] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20">Romans 3:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:26">Romans 3:26</span>. The meaning to declare or pronounce righteous cannot be consistently carried through Paul 's writings in the interest of a theological fiction of imputed righteousness. See, for example, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:11">1 Corinthians 6:11</span>; and all passages where the word is used to describe justification by works of the law, as here, chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:11">Galatians 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:4">Galatians 5:4</span>. If one is a real righteousness, founded upon his conformity to the law. Why is the righteousness of faith any less a real righteousness ? </p>
<p>By the works of the law [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ εργων νομου] </span></span>. Lit. out of the works, etc. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20">Romans 3:20</span>. Works are characteristic of a legal dispensation. Paul often puts "works" alone as representing legal righteousness. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:2">Romans 4:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:6">Romans 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:11">Romans 9:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:32">Romans 9:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:6">Romans 11:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:9">Ephesians 2:9</span>. </p>
<p>But by faith [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη] </span></span>. As the Greek stands, it would read, "Is not justified by the works of the law save through faith." So, unfortunately, Rev. This would mean, as the Romish interpreters, not through works of the law except they be done through faith in Christ, and would ascribe justification to works which grow out of faith. Paul means that justification is by faith alone. The use of ejan mh is to be thus explained : A man is not justified by the works of the law : (he is not justified) except by faith in Jesus Christ. Ean mh retains its exceptive force, but the exception refers only to the verb. Comp. eij mh in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:4">Matthew 12:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:26">Luke 4:26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:27">Luke 4:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:19">Galatians 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:27">Revelation 21:27</span>. </p>
