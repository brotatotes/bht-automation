Who seemed to be pillars [οι δοκουντες στυλοι ειναι] . Better, who are in repute as pillars.

A token of alliance in the apostolic office of preaching and teaching. The giving of the right hand in pledge was not a distinctively Jewish custom. It appears as early as Homer. Deissmann cites an inscription from Pergamum, 98 B. 100, in which the Pergamenes offer to adjust the strife between Sardes and Ephesus, and send a mediator dounai tav ceirav eijv sullusin to give hands for a treaty. See dexian or dexiav didonai 1 Macc. 6 58; 11 50, 62; 2 Macc. 11 26; 12 11; 13 22; and dex. lambanein to receive right hand or hands, 1 Macc. 11 66; 13 50; 2 Macc. 12 12; 14 19. 50 The custom prevailed among the Persians, from whom it may have passed to the Jews. See Joseph. Antiq. 18 9, 3. Images of right hands clasped were sometimes exchanged in token of friendship (see Xen. Anab. 2 4, 1). Tacitus (Hist. 1 54) says : "The state of the Lingones had sent, according to an ancient institution, right hands, as gifts to the legions, a signal token of good will." On Roman coins often appear two hands joined, with various inscriptions, as Exercituum Fides; Concordia; Consensus. To give the hand in confirmation of a promise occurs Ezekiel 10:19. In Isaiah 61:8, God swears by his right hand.
