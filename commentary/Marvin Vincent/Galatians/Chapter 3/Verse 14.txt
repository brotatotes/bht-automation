<p>That we might receive, etc. The second ina is parallel with the first. The deliverance from the curse results not only in extending to the Gentiles the blessing promised to Abraham, but in the impartation of the Spirit to both Jews and Gentiles through faith. The eujlogia blessing is not God 's gift of justification as the opposite of the curse; for in vv. 10, 11, justification is not represented as the opposite of the curse, but as that by which the curse is removed and the blessing realized. The content of the curse is death, verse 13. The opposite of the curse is life. The subject of the promise is the life which comes through the Spirit.
