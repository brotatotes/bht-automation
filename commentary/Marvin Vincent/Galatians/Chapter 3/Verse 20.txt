<p>Now a mediator is not a mediator of one [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε μεσιτης ενος ουκ εστιν] </span></span>. Observe, </p>
<p>1. De is explanatory, not antithetic. The verse illustrates the conception of mediator. </p>
<p>2. The article, the mediator, has a generic force : the mediator according to the general and proper conception of his function. Comp. the apostle (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:12">2 Corinthians 12:12</span>); the shepherd, the good (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>). </p>
<p>3. Enov of one, is to be explained by the following ei=v, so that it is masculine and personal. </p>
<p>We are not to supply party or law. The meaning is : the conception of mediator does not belong to an individual considered singly. One is not a mediator of his single self, but he is a mediator between two contracting parties; in this case between God and the people of Israel, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+26:46">Leviticus 26:46</span>; thus differing from Christ, who is called the mediator of a new covenant (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:6">Hebrews 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:24">Hebrews 12:24</span>). The new covenant, the gospel, was not a contract. Accordingly verse 20 serves to define the true conception of a mediator, and through this definition to make clearer the difference between the law, which required a mediator, and the promise, which is the simple expression of God 's will. The very idea of mediation supposes two parties. The law is of the nature of a contract between God and the Jewish people. The validity of the contract depends on its fulfillment by both parties. Hence it is contingent, not absolute. </p>
<p>But God is one [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε θεος εις αστιν] </span></span>. God does not need a mediator to make his promise valid. His promise is not of the nature of a contract between two parties. His promise depends on his own individual decree. He dealt with Abraham singly and directly, without a mediator. The dignity of the law is thus inferior to that of the promise.</p>
