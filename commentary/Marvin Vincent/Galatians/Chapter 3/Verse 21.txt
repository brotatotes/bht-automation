<p>Against the promises [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα των επαγγελιων] </span></span>. Does it follow from the difference between the law and the promises that they are in antagonism? Paul supposes this objection on the part of a Jewish Christian. </p>
<p>God forbid [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη γενοιτο] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:4">Romans 3:4</span>. This could only be true in case the law gave life, for life must come either through the promises or through the law. If the law is against the promises, and makes them invalid, it follows that life must come through the law, and therefore righteousness, without which there is no life, would verily [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οντως] </span></span>, just as the Judaisers claim, be through the law. </p>
<p>By the law. Tisch., Rev. T., Weiss, retain ejk nomou from, resulting from the law. WH. read ejn nomw in the law. The meaning is substantially the same with either reading : in the one case proceeding from, in the other residing in the law.</p>
