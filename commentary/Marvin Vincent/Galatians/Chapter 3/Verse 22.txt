Hath concluded [συνεκλεισεν] . Better, hath shut up, as a jailer. Only in Paul, with the exception of Luke 5:6. Frequent in LXX Not included with others, but confined as within an enclosure, as Luke 5:6, of the net enclosing the fish. Comp. Exodus 14:3; Joshua 6:1; Joshua 1:0 Macc. 4 31. Scripture, in its divine utterances on the universality and guilt of sin, is conceived as a jailer who shuts all up in sin as in a prison. Comp. Romans 3:10-19; Romans 11:32. All [τα παντα] .

That which is represented through a personification as the act of Scripture, is the act of God, according to a definite purpose that the promise should be inherited by believers only, through faith in Jesus Christ. The promise [η επαγγελια] . That is, the thing promised; the inheritance, verse 18. By faith [εκ πιστεως] . Const. with the promise, not with might be given. The promised gift which is the result of faith. The false teachers claimed that it was the result of works. To them that believe [τοις πιστευουσιν] . Not tautological. Even the Judaisers held that salvation was intended for believers, but also that legal obedience was its procuring cause; against which Paul asserts that it is simply for those that believe.
