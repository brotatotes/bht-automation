<p>But it is not true that the law gives life, for the law, according to scripture, condemned all alike. </p>
<p>The scripture [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η γραφη] </span></span>. Scripture is personified. See on verse 8. Hath concluded [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεκλεισεν] </span></span>. Better, hath shut up, as a jailer. Only in Paul, with the exception of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:6">Luke 5:6</span>. Frequent in LXX Not included with others, but confined as within an enclosure, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:6">Luke 5:6</span>, of the net enclosing the fish. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:3">Exodus 14:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jos+6:1">Joshua 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jos+1:0">Joshua 1:0</span> Macc. 4 31. Scripture, in its divine utterances on the universality and guilt of sin, is conceived as a jailer who shuts all up in sin as in a prison. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:10-19">Romans 3:10-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:32">Romans 11:32</span>. </p>
<p>All [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα παντα] </span></span>. Neuter, all things collectively : = all men. For the neuter in a similar comprehensive sense, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:27">1 Corinthians 1:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20">Colossians 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span>. </p>
<p>That [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα] </span></span>. In order that. That which is represented through a personification as the act of Scripture, is the act of God, according to a definite purpose that the promise should be inherited by believers only, through faith in Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>The promise [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η επαγγελια] </span></span>. That is, the thing promised; the inheritance, verse 18. </p>
<p>By faith [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ πιστεως] </span></span>. Const. with the promise, not with might be given. The promised gift which is the result of faith. The false teachers claimed that it was the result of works. </p>
<p>To them that believe [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις πιστευουσιν] </span></span>. Not tautological. Even the Judaisers held that salvation was intended for believers, but also that legal obedience was its procuring cause; against which Paul asserts that it is simply for those that believe.</p>
