Schoolmaster [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδαγωγος π</span></span>] is an error. The word means an overseer or guardian. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:15">1 Corinthians 9:15</span>. Tutor (Rev.) is defensible on the ground of etymology, tueri to look upon, thence to guard.

<p>CHAPTER IV </p>
<p>The last words of chapter iii, "heirs according to the promise," are now further discussed. It is shown that the capability of heirship, which was first conferred through Christ, could not enter earlier into the history of mankind, because mankind was still in its minority; and its majority, its sonship, was first entered upon through Christ. The way of the law was not, as the Jews supposed, a direct way to the fulfillment of the divine promise. At the same time, it did not utterly lead away from the true goal. It was a roundabout way to it. Sabatier (l' Apotre Paul) observes : "The law is neither absolutely identical with the promise, nor absolutely opposed to it. It is not the negation of the promise, but is distinct from it and subordinate to it. Its final purpose lies in the promise itself. It is an essential but transitional element in the historical development of humanity. It must disappear on attaining its goal. 'Christ is the end of the law. '" But why was this way necessary? Why did not God open the way of faith leading to the inheritance of the promise immediately after the promise was given? The answer to this was indicated in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:24-26">Galatians 3:24-26</span>. It is now given more fully.</p>
