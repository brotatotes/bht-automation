<p>So foolish. Explained by what follows. Has your folly reached such a pitch as to reverse the true order of things? Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:46">1 Corinthians 14:46</span>. Having begun. [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εναρξαμενοι] </span></span>. P o. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:6">Philippians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6">2 Corinthians 8:6</span>. Having commenced your Christian life. The verb is common in Class. in the sense of the beginning a sacrifice or other religious ceremony; but it is not likely that any such figurative suggestion is attached to it here, as Lightfoot. </p>
<p>In the Spirit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματι] </span></span>. Or, by means of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit, as the inspirer and regulator of the life. </p>
<p>Are ye made perfect [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτελεισθε] </span></span>. The word is found in connection with ajnarcesqai to begin, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6">2 Corinthians 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:6">Philippians 1:6</span>. The A. V. and Rev. render here in the passive voice. The active voice, always in N. T. with the object expressed, means to bring to completion. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:28">Romans 14:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:1">2 Corinthians 7:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:6">Philippians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>. The passive only <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:9">1 Peter 5:9</span>. It is true that the verb in the middle voice is not found in either N. T. or LXX; but it is not uncommon in Class. and answers better to the middle ajnarxamenoi having begun. It implies more than bringing to an end; rather to a consummation. Rend. : having begun in the spirit are ye coming to completion in the flesh ? The last phrase has an ironical tinge, suggesting the absurdity of expecting perfection on the Jewish basis of legal righteousness. The present tense indicates that they have already begun upon this attempt. </p>
<p>The flesh. The worldly principle or element of life, represented by the legal righteousness of the Jew.</p>
