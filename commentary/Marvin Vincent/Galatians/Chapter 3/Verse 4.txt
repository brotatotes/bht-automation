<p>Have ye suffered [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαθετε] </span></span>. Or, did ye suffer. The exact sense is doubtful. By some it is held that the reference is to sufferings endured by the Galatian Christians either through heathen persecutions or Judaising emissaries. There is, however, no record in this Epistle or elsewhere of the Galatians having suffered special persecutions on account of their Christian profession. Others take the verb in a neutral sense, have ye experienced, or with a definite reference to the experience of benefits. In this neutral sense it is used in Class. from Homer down, and is accordingly joined with both kakwv evilly, and eu well. Paul habitually used it in the sense of suffering evil, and there is no decisive instance, either in N. T. or LXX, of the neutral sense. In Class., where it is used of the experience of benefits, it is always accompanied by some qualifying word. When it stands alone it signifies to suffer evil. The evidence on the whole makes very strongly for the meaning suffer; in which case the reference is, probably, to the annoyances suffered from Judaising Christians. It must be said, on the other hand, that a reference to such annoyances seems far - fetched. If we could translate did ye experience (so Weizsacker, Lipsius, Sieffert), the reference would be to the impartation of the gifts of the Spirit. </p>
<p>In vain [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εικη] </span></span>. So that ye have fallen from the faith and missed the inheritance of suffering and the rich fruitage of your spiritual gifts. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:10-12">Matthew 5:10-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:17">2 Corinthians 4:17</span>. </p>
<p>If it be yet in vain [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ει γε και εικη] </span></span>. The A. V. misses the force of the particles. Kai should be closely joined with eijkh, with the sense of really. If, that is, it be really in vain.</p>
