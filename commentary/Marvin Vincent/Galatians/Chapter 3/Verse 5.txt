<p>Therefore [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν] </span></span>. Resumes the thought of verse 2 (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+3:4">Leviticus 3:4</span> being, practically, parenthetical), in order to adduce the example of Abraham as a proof of justification by faith. The thought of verse 2 is further emphasized. The gift of the Spirit, and the bestowment of miraculous powers, is a purely divine operation in believers, which is not merited by legal works, but can be received and experienced only through the message of faith. </p>
<p>He that ministereth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο επιχορηγων] </span></span>. Or supplieth. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:10">2 Corinthians 9:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:19">Colossians 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5">2 Peter 1:5</span>. The idea of abundant supply (Lightfoot), if conveyed at all, resides, not in the preposition ejpi, which indicates direction, but in the simple verb, which is used of abundant, liberal supply. He that ministereth is God. </p>
<p>Worketh [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργων] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:13">1 Thessalonians 2:13</span>. </p>
<p>Miracles [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμεις] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:20">Matthew 11:20</span>. Either miracles, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:2">Mark 6:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:10">1 Corinthians 12:10</span>, or miraculous powers, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:6">1 Corinthians 12:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:13">Philippians 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>. The analogy of these latter passages favors the second meaning. </p>
<p>Among you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υμιν] </span></span>. So, if dunameiv is explained as miracles. If miraculous powers, render in you.</p>
