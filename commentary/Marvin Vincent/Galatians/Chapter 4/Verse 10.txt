<p>Ye observe [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρατηρεισθε] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:2">Mark 3:2</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:12">John 18:12</span>, and comp. Joseph. Ant 3:5, 5, parathrein tav eJbdomadav to watch the weeks. The word denotes careful, scrupulous observance, an intent watching lest any of the prescribed seasons should be overlooked. A merely legal or ritual religion always develops such scrupulousness. Days. Sabbaths, fast - days, feast - days, new moons. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:5">Romans 14:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:6">Romans 14:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:16">Colossians 2:16</span>. </p>
<p>Months. Sacred months. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:23">Isaiah 66:23</span>. In the preexilic time the months were mostly not named but numbered first, second, third, etc., and this usage appears also in the post - exilic writings of the O. T. Only four months had special names : the first, Abib, the ear month, which marked the beginning of harvest (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:4">Exodus 13:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:15">Exodus 23:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:18">Exodus 34:18</span>) : the second, Sif or Z? the flower month (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+6:1">1 Kings 6:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+6:37">1 Kings 6:37</span>) : the seventh, Ethanum, the month of streaming rivers fed by the autumnal rains (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:2">1 Kings 8:2</span>) : the eighth, Bul, the month of rain (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+6:38">1 Kings 6:38</span>). In the post - exilic time names for all the months came into use, the most of which appear in the Palmyrene inscriptions and among the Syrians. According to the Talmud, the returning Jews brought these names from Babylon. The names of all are found in a month table discovered at Nineveh. N?n corresponds to Abib (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ne+2:1">Nehemiah 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="es+3:7">Esther 3:7</span>), answering to the latter part of March and April. Jjar answered to Ziv (Targ. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ch+30:2">2 Chronicles 30:2</span>), our May. Tisri to Ethanim, the seventh month of the ecclesiastical, and the first of the civil year, corresponding to October. Marcheschwan (see Joseph. Ant 1:3, 3) answered to Bul and November. Tisri, being the seventh or sabbatical month, was peculiarly sacred, and the fourth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σιςαν, υνε] </span></span>, fifth (Ab, August), and tenth (Tebeth, January) were distinguished by special fasts. Times [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιρους] </span></span>. Better, seasons. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:1">Matthew 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span>, and comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+23:4">Leviticus 23:4</span>. The holy, festal seasons, as Passover Pentecost, Feast of Tabernacles. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ch+8:13">2 Chronicles 8:13</span>. </p>
<p>Years [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενιαυτους] </span></span>. Sabbatical years, occurring every seventh year. Not years of Jubilee, which had ceased to be celebrated after the time of Solomon.</p>
