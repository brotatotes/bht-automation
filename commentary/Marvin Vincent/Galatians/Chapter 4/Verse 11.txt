<p>I am afraid of you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβουμαι υμας] </span></span>. Not a felicitous translation, though retained by Rev. Rather, "I am afraid for you or concerning you." The second uJmav is not attracted into the principal clause so as to read, "I am afraid lest I have bestowed labor," etc. The two clauses are distinct. I am afraid about you : then the reason for the fear is added, lest I have bestowed, etc. </p>
<p>Upon you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις υμας] </span></span>. Lit. into you. The labor, though in vain, had born directly upon its object. See the same phrase <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:6">Romans 16:6</span>. </p>
<p>In vain [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εικη] </span></span>. Comp. chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:4">Galatians 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:2">1 Corinthians 14:2</span>, and eijv to no purpose, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:16">Philippians 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:1">2 Corinthians 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:2">Galatians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:5">1 Thessalonians 3:5</span>. After all my labor, you may return to Judaism. Luther says : "These words of Paul breathe tears."</p>
