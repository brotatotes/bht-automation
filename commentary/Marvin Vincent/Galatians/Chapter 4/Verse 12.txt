Be as I am [γινεσθε ως εγω] . Better, become as I am; free from the bondage of Jewish ordinances. I am as ye are [καγω ως εγω] . Rather, I became. Supply ejgenomhn or gegona. Become as I am, for I became a Gentile like you. Comp. Philippians 3:7, Philippians 3:8. For the phrase ginesqai wJv to become as, see Matthew 6:16; Romans 9:29; 1 Corinthians 4:13; 1 Corinthians 9:20-22. Ye have not injured me at all [ουδεν με ηδικησατε] . This translation misses the force of the aorist, and conveys a wrong impression, that Paul, up to this time, had received no wrong at the hands of the Galatians. This was not true. The reference is to his earlier relations with the Galatians, and is explained by vv. 13, 14. Rend. ye did not injure me at all. Ye did not injure me then, do not do so now.
