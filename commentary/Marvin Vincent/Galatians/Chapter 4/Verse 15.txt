Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? [που ουν ο μακαρισμος υμων] . Makarismov, P o. Comp. Romans 4:6, Romans 4:9. Not blessedness, but pronouncing blessed, felicitation. "What had become of your self gratulation on my presence and teaching?" Ye spake of is an attempt to render uJmwn. Better, "Where is then that gratulation of yours?" I bear you record [μαρτυρω] . Better, witness. Bear record is common in A. V. for bear witness. Record is used both of a person, as God is my record, Philippians 1:8; I call God for a record, 1 Corinthians 1:23, and in the sense of evidence or testimony. So Shaks. Richard 2 1 1 30 : "First, Heaven be the record to my speech." Plucked out [εξορυξαντες] . Lit. dug out. Only here, and Mark 2:4, of digging up the roof in order to let down the paralytic before Jesus. Your own eyes [τους οφθαλμους υμων] . Better, your eyes. Eyes, as most treasured possessions. Comp. Psalms 17:8; Proverbs 7:2; Zechariah 2:8. Some have found here evidence that Paul was afflicted with disease of the eyes. See Dr. John Brown's Horae Subsecivae. Accordingly they explain these words, "You would have given me your own eyes to replace mine." But uJmwn is unemphatic, your. All attempts to connect the passage with Paul 's "thorn in the flesh" (2 Corinthians 7:7) are to be dismissed as fanciful.
