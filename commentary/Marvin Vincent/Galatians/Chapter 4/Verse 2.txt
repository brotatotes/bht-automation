A general term, covering all to whom supervision of the child is intrusted, and should not be limited to paidagwgov (chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:24">Galatians 3:24</span>). See 2 Macc. 11 1; 13 2; 14 2. </p>
<p>Govenors [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικονομους</span></span>] Better stewards. Lat. dispensatores. More special than guardians, signifying those who had charge of the heir's property. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:1">Luke 16:1</span>. In later Greek it was used in two special senses : </p>
<p>1. The slave whose duty it was to distribute the rations to the other slaves : so <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:42">Luke 12:42</span>. </p>
<p>2. The land - steward : so <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:1">Luke 16:1</span>.

The dispensator in the Roman household had charge of the accounts and made the payments (see Cicero, ad Att 11 1; Juv. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:91">James 1:91</span>).

<p>The time appointed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προθεσμιας] </span></span>. N. T. o. o LXX In Athenian law the term limited for bringing actions and prosecutions. Proqesmiav nomov a statute of limitations. It was also applied to the time allowed a defendant for paying damages, after the expiration of which, if he had not paid, he was called uJperhmerov, or ejkproqesmov, or uJperproqesmov one who had gone over his day of payment. Whether Paul 's figure assumes that the father is dead or living is a point which does not affect his argument. It is not easy to decide. As Alford justly remarks : "the antitype breaks through the type and disturbs it, as is the case wherever the idea of inheritance is spiritualised." Proqesmia an appointed time for the termination of the minority, would seem to imply that the father is conceived as living; since, if he were dead, that matter would be regulated by statute. 67</p>
