<p>Because ye are sons [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτι] </span></span>. For oti in this sense at the beginning of a clause see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:7">Romans 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:15">1 Corinthians 12:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:19">John 14:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:29">John 20:29</span>. The emphasis is on sons. The spirit would not be given is ye were not sons. Others take oti as demonstrative, as a proof that ye are sons; but examples of such usage are wanting. It is not a proof of the fact of sonship that the apostle is giving, but a consequence of it. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:16">Romans 8:16</span>, where the witness of the Spirit attests the sonship. </p>
<p>The Spirit of his Son. The Holy Spirit which animated Jesus in his human life, and which, in the risen Christ, is the life - principle of believers. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:45">1 Corinthians 14:45</span>, and comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9-11">Romans 8:9-11</span>. The Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10">Romans 8:10</span>, where Paul uses Spirit of God, Spirit of Christ and Christ as convertible terms. The phrase Spirit of Jesus Christ only <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:19">Philippians 1:19</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:34">John 3:34</span> Christ is represented as dispensing the Spirit. He is fully endowed with the Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:10">Mark 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:32">John 1:32</span>) : he sends the Spirit from the Father to the disciples, and he is the burden of the Spirit's testimony (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:9">John 16:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:10">John 16:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:15">John 16:15</span>). The Paraclete is given in answer to Christ 's prayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16">John 14:16</span>). Christ identifies his own coming and presence with those of the Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:17">John 14:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:18">John 14:18</span>). Paul identifies him personally with the Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:17">2 Corinthians 3:17</span>). </p>
<p>Our hearts. Note the interchange of persons : we might receive, ye are sons, our hearts. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:4">Romans 7:4</span>. </p>
<p>Crying [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραζον] </span></span>. A strong word, expressing deep emotion. The verb originally represents the sound of a croak or harsh scream; thence, generally, an inarticulate cry; an exclamation of fear or pain. The cry of an animal. So Aristoph. Knights, 1017, of the barking of a dog : 285, 287, of two men in a quarrel, trying to bawl each other down : Frogs, 258, of the croaking of frogs. This original sense appears in N. T. usage, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:26">Matthew 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:23">Matthew 14:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:50">Matthew 27:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:5">Mark 5:5</span>, etc., and is recognized even where the word is used in connection with articulate speech, by adding to it the participles legwn, legontev saying, or didaskwn teaching. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:22">Matthew 14:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:11">Mark 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:28">John 7:28</span>, etc. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:47">Mark 10:47</span> the inarticulate cry and the articulate utterance are distinguished. At the same time, the word is often used of articulate speech without such additions, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:48">Mark 10:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:9">Mark 11:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:13">Mark 14:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:14">Mark 14:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:39">Luke 18:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:60">Acts 7:60</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:34">Acts 19:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>. It falls into more dignified association in LXX, where it is often used of prayer or appeal to God, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:3">Jude 1:3</span>:9, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:15">Jude 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:4">Jude 1:4</span>:3; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:6">Jude 1:6</span>:7; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+21:2">Psalms 21:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+21:5">Psalms 21:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+27:1">Psalms 27:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+54:16">Psalms 54:16</span>; and in N. T., where it is applied to solemn, prophetic utterance, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:27">Romans 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span>, and is used of Jesus himself, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:28">John 7:28</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:44">John 12:44</span>, and of the Holy Spirit, as here. The Spirit gives the inspiration of which the believer is the organ. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span> the statement is inverted. The believer cries under the power of the Spirit. </p>
<p>Abba, Father. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:36">Mark 14:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>. O pathr the Father, is not added in order to explain the Aramaic Abba for Greek readers. Rather the whole phrase Abba oJ pathr had passed into the early Christian prayers, the Aramaic title by which Christ addressed his Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:36">Mark 14:36</span>) being very early united with the Greek synonym. Such combinations of Hebrew and Greek addresses having the same meaning were employed in rabbinical writings. Comp. also <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+9:11">Revelation 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span>.</p>
