Over against their filial freedom in Christ, Paul sets their lapse into subjection to the elements of the world (verse 3). Knew not God. See on 2 Thessalonians 1:8. Ye did service [εδουλευσατε] . Better, were in bondage or were slaves. By nature [φυσει] . Not denying their existence (comp. 1 Corinthians 8:5) but their deity. Emphasis on by nature. Comp. 1 Corinthians 10:20.
