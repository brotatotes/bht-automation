In the liberty wherewith. This is according to the reading th ejleuqeria h=. Different connections are proposed, as with stand fast, as A. V. : or with the close of chapter 4, as, "we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free with the freedom with which Christ freed us" : or, "of her who is free with the freedom with which," etc. But h= wherewith must be omitted. A new clause begins with th ejleuqeria. Rend. for freedom did Christ set us free. For, not with freedom. It is the dative of advantage; that we might be really free and remain free. Comp. verse 13, and John 8:36. Made (us) free [ηλευθερωσεν] . With the exception of John 8:32, John 8:36, only in Paul. Stand fast [στηκετε] . Used absolutely, as 2 Thessalonians 2:15. Mostly in Paul. See on 1 Thessalonians 3:8. 1 Thessalonians 3:8 1 Thessalonians 3:0 Be not entangled [μη ενεχεσθε] . Or, held ensnared. By Paul only here and 2 Thessalonians 1:4. Lit. to be held within. For an elliptical usage see on Mark 6:19. Yoke [ζυγω] . Metaphorical, of a burden or bondage. Comp. Matthew 11:29, Matthew 11:30; Acts 14:10; 1 Timothy 6:1. Similarly LXX, Genesis 27:40; Leviticus 26:13; 2 Chronicles 10:4, 2 Chronicles 10:9, 2 Chronicles 10:10, 2 Chronicles 10:11, 2 Chronicles 10:14. So always in N. T. except Revelation 6:5, where it means a pair of scales. See note, and comp. Leviticus 19:35, Leviticus 19:36; Proverbs 11:1; Proverbs 16:11; Hosea 12:7.
