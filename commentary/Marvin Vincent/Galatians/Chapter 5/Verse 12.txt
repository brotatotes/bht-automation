Paul says in effect : "These people are disturbing you by insisting on circumcision. I would that they would make thorough work of it in their own case, and, instead of merely amputating the foreskin, would castrate themselves, as heathen priests do. Perhaps that would be even a more powerful help to salvation." With this passage should be compared Philippians 3:2, Philippians 3:3, also aimed at the Judaisers : "Beware of the concision" [την κατατομην] , the word directing attention to the fact that these persons had no right to claim circumcision in the true sense. Unaccompanied by faith, love, and obedience, circumcision was no more than physical mutilation. They belonged in the category of those referred to in Leviticus 21:5. Comp. Paul 's words on the true circumcision, Romans 2:28, Romans 2:29; Philippians 3:3; Colossians 2:11. Which trouble [αναστατουντες] . Only here in Paul, and twice elsewhere, Acts 17:6; Acts 21:38. o LXX Stronger than tarassein disturb. Rather to upset or overthrow. The usual phrase in Class. is ajnastaton poiein to make an upset.
