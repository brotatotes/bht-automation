<p>They were cut off [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκοψονται] </span></span>. More correctly, would cut themselves off. Perhaps the severest expression in Paul 's Epistles. It turns on the practice of circumcision. Paul says in effect : "These people are disturbing you by insisting on circumcision. I would that they would make thorough work of it in their own case, and, instead of merely amputating the foreskin, would castrate themselves, as heathen priests do. Perhaps that would be even a more powerful help to salvation." With this passage should be compared <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:2">Philippians 3:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3">Philippians 3:3</span>, also aimed at the Judaisers : "Beware of the concision" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την κατατομην] </span></span>, the word directing attention to the fact that these persons had no right to claim circumcision in the true sense. Unaccompanied by faith, love, and obedience, circumcision was no more than physical mutilation. They belonged in the category of those referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+21:5">Leviticus 21:5</span>. Comp.
