<p>For [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ] </span></span>. Well may I speak thus strongly of those who thus overthrow your whole polity and enslave you, for ye are called for freedom. </p>
<p>Unto liberty [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ ελευθερια] </span></span>. Better, for freedom. See on unto uncleanness, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:7">1 Thessalonians 4:7</span>. Epi marks the intention. </p>
<p>Only [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονον] </span></span>. For a similar use of the word, qualifying or limiting a general statement, comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:39">1 Corinthians 7:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:10">Galatians 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:27">Philippians 1:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</span>. </p>
<p>Brethren. Rev. rightly puts the word at the end of the verse. The position is unusual. It would seem as if Paul intended to close this severs letter with an assurance that the "foolish Galatians" were still his brethren : They are addressed as "brethren," chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:12">Galatians 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:11">Galatians 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:1">Galatians 6:1</span>. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:24">1 Corinthians 16:24</span>. </p>
<p>Use not liberty [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ελευθεριαν] </span></span>. Use is not in the Greek. We may supply hold or make or turn. </p>
<p>Occasion [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφορμην] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8">Romans 7:8</span>. Almost exclusively in Paul. To the flesh [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη σαρκι] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5">Romans 7:5</span>. The flesh here represents lovelessness and selfishness. Christian freedom is not to be abused for selfish ends. Paul treats this subject at length in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:0">1 Corinthians 8:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:25">Romans 12:25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:26">Romans 12:26</span>. Individual liberty is subject to the law of love and mutual service. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:16">1 Peter 2:16</span>. </p>
<p>By love [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια της αγαπης] </span></span>. Or through love, through which faith works (ver. 6).</p>
