For [γαρ] . Well may I speak thus strongly of those who thus overthrow your whole polity and enslave you, for ye are called for freedom. Unto liberty [επ ελευθερια] . Better, for freedom. See on unto uncleanness, 1 Thessalonians 4:7. Epi marks the intention. Only [μονον] . For a similar use of the word, qualifying or limiting a general statement, comp. 1 Corinthians 7:39; Galatians 2:10; Philippians 1:27; 2 Thessalonians 2:7. Brethren. Rev. rightly puts the word at the end of the verse. The position is unusual. It would seem as if Paul intended to close this severs letter with an assurance that the "foolish Galatians" were still his brethren : They are addressed as "brethren," chapter Galatians 4:12; Galatians 5:11; Galatians 6:1. Comp. 1 Corinthians 16:24. Use not liberty [την ελευθεριαν] . Use is not in the Greek. We may supply hold or make or turn. Occasion [αφορμην] . See on Romans 7:8. Almost exclusively in Paul. To the flesh [τη σαρκι] . See on Romans 7:5. The flesh here represents lovelessness and selfishness. Christian freedom is not to be abused for selfish ends. Paul treats this subject at length in 1 Corinthians 8:0; Romans 12:25, Romans 12:26. Individual liberty is subject to the law of love and mutual service. Comp. 1 Peter 2:16. By love [δια της αγαπης] . Or through love, through which faith works (ver. 6).
