Walk [περιπατειτε] . Frequent in a metaphorical sense for habitual conduct. See Mark 7:5; John 8:12; Acts 21:21; Romans 6:4; Romans 8:4; 1 Corinthians 3:3; Philippians 3:18. Never by Paul in the literal sense. In the Spirit [πνευματι] . Rather, by the Spirit, as the rule of action. Comp. Galatians 6:16; Philippians 3:16; Romans 4:12. Fulfill [τελεσητε] . Bring to fulfillment in action. See on do the law, ver. 3. The lust [επιθυμιαν] . Frequent in Paul, and usually in a bad sense; but see Philippians 1:23; 1 Thessalonians 2:17, and comp. Luke 22:15. The phrase lust or lusts of the flesh occurs also Ephesians 2:3; 2 Peter 2:18; 1 John 2:16. It means, not the mere sensual desire of the physical nature, but the desire which is peculiar to human nature without the divine Spirit.
