The question is, which of these two powers shall prevail. If the Spirit, then you are free men, no longer under the law. Comp. Romans 6:11, Romans 6:14. Under the law [υπο νομον] . The Mosaic law. We might have expected, from what precedes, under the flesh. But the law and the flesh are in the same category. Circumcision was a requirement of the law, and was a work of the flesh. The ordinances of the law were ordinances of the flesh (Hebrews 9:10, Hebrews 9:13); the law was weak through the flesh (Romans 8:3). See especially, Galatians 3:2-6. In Philippians 3:3 ff. Paul explains his grounds for confidence in the flesh as his legal righteousness. The whole legal economy was an economy of the flesh as distinguished from the Spirit.
