<p>If ye be circumcised [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν περιτεμνησθε] </span></span>. Better, receive circumcision. The verb does not mean that they have already been circumcised.

<p>Christ will profit you nothing. Circumcision is the sign of subjection to the Jewish "yoke" - the economy of the law. The question with the Galatians was circumcision as a condition of salvation. See chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:3">Galatians 2:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:5">Galatians 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:1">Acts 14:1</span>. It was a choice between salvation by law and salvation by Christ. The choice of the law involved the relinquishment of Christ. Comp. chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:21">Galatians 2:21</span>. Chrysostom says : "He who is circumcised is circumcised as fearing the law : but he who fears the law distrusts the power of grace : and he who distrusts gains nothing from that which he distrusts."</p>
