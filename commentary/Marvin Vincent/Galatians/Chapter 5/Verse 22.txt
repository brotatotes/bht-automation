<p>The fruit of the Spirit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο καρπος του πνευματος] </span></span>. The phrase N. T. o. Fruit, metaphorical, frequent in N. T., as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:8">Matthew 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:16">Matthew 7:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:36">John 4:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:8">John 14:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:13">Romans 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:21">Romans 6:21</span>, etc. We find fruit of light (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:9">Ephesians 5:9</span>); of righteousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:11">Philippians 1:11</span>); of labor (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:22">Philippians 1:22</span>); of the lips (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:15">Hebrews 13:15</span>).

<p>Love [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπη] </span></span>. Comp. love of the Spirit, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:30">Romans 14:30</span>. In Class. filein is the most general designation of love, denoting an inner inclination to persons or things, and standing opposed to misein or ejcqairein to hate. It occasionally acquires from the context a sensual flavor, as Ho<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ob+1:0">Obadiah 1:0</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ob+1:18">Obadiah 1:18</span> 325; Hdt 4:176, thus running into the sense of ejran which denotes sensual love. It is love to persons and things growing out of intercourse and amenities or attractive qualities. Stergein (not in N. T., LXX, Sir. 17; 17) expresses a deep, quiet, appropriating, natural love, as distinguished from that which is called out by circumstances. Unlike filein, it has a distinct moral significance, and is not applied to base inclinations opposed to a genuine manly nature. It is the word for love to parents, wife, children, king or country, as one's own. Aristotle (Nic. 9 7, 3) speaks of poets as loving [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στεργοντες</span></span>] their own poems as their children. See also Eurip. Med. 87. Agapan is to love out of an intelligent estimate of the object of love. It answers to Lat. diligere, or Germ. schatzen to prize. It is not passionate and sensual as ejran. It is not, like filein, attachment to a person independently of his quality and created by close intercourse. It is less sentiment than consideration. While filein contemplates the person, ajgapan contemplates the attributes and character, and gives an account of its inclination. Agapan is really the weaker expression for love, as that term is conventionally used. It is judicial rather than affectionate. Even in classical usage, however, the distinction between ajgapan and filein is often very subtle, and well - nigh impossible to express. </p>
<p>In N. T. ejpiqumain to desire or lust is used instead of ejran. In LXX ajgapan is far more common than filein. Filein occurs only 16 times in the sense of love, and 16 times in the sense of kiss; while ajgapan is found nearly 300 times. It is used with a wide range, of the love of parent for child, of man for God, of God for man, of love to one's neighbor and to the stranger, of husband for wife, of love for God 's house, and for mercy and truth; but also of the love of Samson for Delilah, of Hosea for his adulterous wife, of Amnon's love for Tamar, of Solomon 's love for strange women, of loving a woman for her beauty. Also of loving vanity, unrighteousness, devouring words, cursing, death, silver. </p>
<p>The noun ajgaph, o Class., was apparently created by the LXX, although it is found there only 19 times. 84 It first comes into habitual use in Christian writings. In N. T. it is, practically, the only noun for love, although compound nouns expressing peculiar phases of love, as brotherly love, love of money, love of children, etc., are formed with filov, as filadelfia, filarguria, filanqrwpia. Both verbs, filein and ajgapan occur, but ajgapan more frequently. The attempt to carry out consistently the classical distinction between these two must be abandoned. Both are used of the love of parents and children, of the love of God for Christ, of Christ for men, of God for men, of men for Christ and of men for men. The love of man for God and of husband for wife, only ajgapan. The distinction is rather between ajgapan and ejpiqumein than between ajgapan and filein. 85 Love, in this passage, is that fruit of the Spirit which dominates all the others. See vv. 13, 14.
