<p>Lipsius makes this verse the beginning of ch. 6. Weizsacker begins that chapter with ver. 26. There seems to be no sufficient reason. Ver. 25 is connected naturally with the immediately preceding line of thought. "Such being your principle of life, adapt your conduct (walk) to it." The hortatory form of ver. 26, and its contents, fall in naturally with the exhortation to walk by the Spirit, and with the reference to biting and devouring, ver. 15, and envyings, ver. 21. The connection of the opening of ch. 6 with the close of ch. 5 is not so manifest; and the address brethren and the change to the second person (vi. 1) seem to indicate a new section. In the Spirit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματι] </span></span>. Better, by the Spirit, the dative being instrumental as ver. 16. </p>
<p>Walk [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοιχωμεν] </span></span>. A different word from that in ver. 16. Only in Paul, except <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:24">Acts 21:24</span>. From stoicov a row. Hence, to walk in line; to march in battle order (Xen. Cyr 6:3, 34).
