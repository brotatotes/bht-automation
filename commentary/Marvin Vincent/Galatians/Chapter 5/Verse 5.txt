For we [ημεις γαρ] . Gar for introduces a proof of the preceding statement, by declaring the contrary attitude of those who continue under the economy of grace. Ye who seek to be justified by the law are fallen from grace; for we, not relying on the law, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness. Through the Spirit [πνευματι] . The Holy Spirit who inspires our faith. Not as Lightfoot, spiritually. The words pneumati ejk pistewv are not to be taken as one conception, the Spirit which is of faith, but present two distinct and coordinate facts which characterize the waiting for the hope of righteousness; namely, the agency of the Holy Spirit, in contrast with the flesh (comp. Romans 7:6; Romans 8:4, Romans 8:15, Romans 8:16; Ephesians 1:13; Ephesians 2:22), and faith in contrast with the works of the law (comp. chapter Galatians 3:3, and see chapter Galatians 2:16; Galatians 3:3; Romans 1:17; Romans 3:22; Romans 9:30; Romans 10:6). By faith [εκ πιστεως] . Const. with wait, not with righteousness. Wait for [απεκδεχομεθα] . Quite often in Paul, and only twice elsewhere, Hebrews 9:28; 1 Peter 3:20. See on Philippians 3:20. The hope of righteousness [επιδα δικαιοσυνης] . Hope for the object of hope, as Romans 8:24; Colossians 1:5; Hebrews 6:18; Titus 2:13. The phrase means that good which righteousness causes us to hope for. Comp. hope of the calling (Ephesians 1:18; Ephesians 4:4) : hope of the gospel (Colossians 1:23). 81
