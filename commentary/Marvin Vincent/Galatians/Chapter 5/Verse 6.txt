<p>Availeth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυει] </span></span>. Has any significance or practical power. The verb in Paul only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:13">Philippians 4:13</span>.

<p>By love [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι αγαπης] </span></span>.
