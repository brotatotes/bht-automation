<p>A little leaven [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μικρα ζυμη] </span></span>. A proverbial warning, which appears also <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:6">1 Corinthians 5:6</span>. It refers, not to the doctrine of the false teachers, but to the false teachers themselves. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:15">Mark 8:15</span>. With the single exception of the parable, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:33">Matthew 13:33</span>, leaven, in Scripture, is always a symbol of evil. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:15">Exodus 12:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:19">Exodus 12:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:3">Exodus 13:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:7">Exodus 13:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:18">Exodus 23:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+2:11">Leviticus 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+16:3">Deuteronomy 16:3</span>. This, however, is no warrant for the nonsense which has been deduced from it, as that Jesus ' parable of the leaven contains a prophecy of the corruption of Christianity. Because leaven in Scripture is habitually the type of corruption, we are "none the less free to use it in a good sense as Christ did. One figure need not always stand for one and the same thing. The devil is 'a roaring lion, ' but Christ is also 'the lion of the tribe of Judah '" (Trench). It is an apt figure of secret, pervading energy, whether bad or good. A new interest is given to the figure by Pasteur's discovery that fermentation is a necessary consequence of the activity and growth of living organisms. 82 A very few of these Judaising intruders are sufficient to corrupt the whole church. </p>
