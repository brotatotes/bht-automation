To make a fair show [ευπροσωπησαι] . N. T. o. o Class. o LXX In the flesh [εν σαρκι] . Qualifying the verb to make a fair show. The whole phrase is well explained by Ellicott : "To wear a specious exterior in the earthly, unspiritual element in which they move."

The desire to make a good appearance irrespective of inward truth and righteousness, is prompted by the unrenewed, fleshly nature, and makes its fair showing in that sphere. They constrain [ουτοι αναγκαζουσιν] . Neither A. V. nor Rev. gives the strong, definitive force of ou=toi. It is these - the Judaising emissaries, that constrain, etc. Comp. ch. Galatians 3:7. Only lest [μονον ινα - μη] . Or, that they may not. Having no other object, or only from the motive that, etc. For the cross [τω σταυρω] . Better, by reason of the cross. Because of preaching a crucified Messiah. See on ch. Galatians 5:11. The Judaisers attempted to cover with the law - the requirement of circumcision - the "offense" of a crucified Messiah.
