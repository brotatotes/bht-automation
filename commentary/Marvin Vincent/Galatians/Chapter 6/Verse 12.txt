<p>To make a fair show [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευπροσωπησαι] </span></span>. N. T. o. o Class. o LXX In the flesh [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν σαρκι] </span></span>. Qualifying the verb to make a fair show. The whole phrase is well explained by Ellicott : "To wear a specious exterior in the earthly, unspiritual element in which they move." 'En sraki is not = among men, nor being carnal, nor as regards fleshly things. The desire to make a good appearance irrespective of inward truth and righteousness, is prompted by the unrenewed, fleshly nature, and makes its fair showing in that sphere. </p>
<p>They constrain [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτοι αναγκαζουσιν] </span></span>. Neither A. V. nor Rev. gives the strong, definitive force of ou=toi. It is these - the Judaising emissaries, that constrain, etc. Comp. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7">Galatians 3:7</span>. </p>
<p>Only lest [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονον ινα - μη] </span></span>. Or, that they may not. Having no other object, or only from the motive that, etc. </p>
<p>For the cross [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω σταυρω] </span></span>. Better, by reason of the cross. Because of preaching a crucified Messiah. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:11">Galatians 5:11</span>. The Judaisers attempted to cover with the law - the requirement of circumcision - the "offense" of a crucified Messiah.</p>
