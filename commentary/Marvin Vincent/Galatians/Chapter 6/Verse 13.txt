<p>Neither they themselves who are circumcised [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε - οι περιτεμνομενοι αυτοι] </span></span>. For neither, translate not even. Const. themselves with keep the law. The persons referred to are the same as those in ver. 12. The participle tells nothing as to the antecedents of these persons, whether Jewish or heathen.

Comp. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:10">Galatians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:3">Galatians 5:3</span>.
