Rule [κανονι] . P o. See on 2 Corinthians 10:13, 2 Corinthians 10:16. 2 Corinthians 10:9 2 Corinthians 10:1 Emphasis on rule not this. Peace be on them [ειρηνη επ αυτους] . The only instance of this formula in N. T. Commonly eijrhnh with the simple dative, peace unto you, as John 20:19, John 20:21; Romans 1:7; 1 Corinthians 1:3; Galatians 1:3, etc. In the Catholic Epistles, with plhqunqeih be multiplied. See 1 Peter 1:2; 2 Peter 1:2; Jude 1:2. Mercy [ελεος] . In the opening salutations of the Pastoral Epistles with grace and peace; also in 2 John 1:3. In Jude 1:2 with peace and love. And upon the Israel of God. The kai and may be simply collective, in which case the Israel of God may be different from as many as walk, etc., and may mean truly converted Jews. Or the kai may be explicative, in which case the Israel of God will define and emphasize as many as, etc., and will mean the whole body of Christians, Jewish and Gentile. In other words, they who walk according to this rule form the true Israel of God. The explicative kai is at best doubtful here, and is rather forced, although clear instances of it may be found in 1 Corinthians 3:5; 1 Corinthians 14:38. It seems better to regard it as simply connective. Then osoi will refer to the individual Christians, Jewish and Gentile, and Israel of God to the same Christians, regarded collectively, and forming the true messianic community.
