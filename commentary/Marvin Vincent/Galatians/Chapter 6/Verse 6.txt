But, although each man is thus individualized as regards his burdens, Christian fellowship in all morally good things is to be maintained between the teacher and the taught. The passage is often explained as an injunction to provide for the temporal wants of Christian teachers. 90 But this is entirely foreign to the course of thought, and isolates the verse from the context on both sides of it. As vv. 1 - 5 refer to moral errors, in all good things has naturally the same reference, as do good in ver. 10 certainly has. The exhortation therefore is, that the disciple should make common cause with the teacher in everything that is morally good and that promotes salvation. The introduction at this point of the relation of disciple and teacher may be explained by the fact that this relation in the Galatian community had been disturbed by the efforts of the Judaising teachers, notably in the case of Paul himself; and this disturbance could not but interfere with their common moral effort and life. Him that is taught [ο κατηχουμενος] . See on Luke 1:4. In the word [τον λογον] . The gospel. Usually in Paul with some qualifying word, as of God. Comp. Acts 4:4; Acts 8:4; Acts 11:19; Acts 14:25; Acts 16:6; 1 Thessalonians 1:6; Colossians 4:3. Communicate [κοινωνειτω] . Hold fellowship with; partake with. Not impart to. The word is used of giving and receiving material aid (Philippians 4:15) : of moral or spiritual participation (Romans 14:27; 1 Timothy 5:22; 2 John 1:11) : of participation in outward conditions (Hebrews 2:14) : in sufferings (1 Peter 4:13).
