Seventh quotation, Psalms 109:0. No one of the angels was ever enthroned at God 's right hand. Sit [καθου] . Or be sitting, as distinguished from ejkaqisen, ver. 3, which marked the act of assuming the place. On my right hand [εκ δεξιων μου] . Lit. "from my right hand." The usual formula is ejn dexia. The genitive indicates moving from the right hand and taking the seat. The meaning is, "be associated with me in my royal dignity." Comp. Daniel 7:13, Daniel 7:14, and the combination of the Psalm and Dan. in Christ 's words, Mark 14:62. Comp. also Matthew 24:30; Acts 2:34; 1 Corinthians 14:25; 1 Peter 3:22.
