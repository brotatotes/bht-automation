<p>Third quotation, marking the relation of angels to the Son. And again, when he bringeth in, etc. [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν δε παλιν εισαγαγη] </span></span>. Const. again with bringe th in. "When he a second time bringeth the first - begotten into the world." Referring to the second coming of Christ. Others explain again as introducing a new citation as in ver. 5; but this would require the reading palin de otan and again, when. In Hebrews, palin, when joined to a verb, always means a second time.

<p><span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:0">Hebrews 1:0</span>:2It will be observed that in this verse, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:8">Hebrews 5:8</span>, God is conceived as spoken of rather than as speaking; the subject of legei saith being indefinite. This mode of introducing citations differs from that of Paul. The author 's conception of the inspiration of Scripture leads him to regard all utterances of Scripture, without regard to their connection, as distinct utterances of God, or the Holy Spirit, or the Son of God; whereas, by Paul, they are designated either as utterances of Scripture in general, or of individual writers. Very common in this Epistle are the expressions, "God saith, said, spake, testifieth," or the like.

<p>The first - begotten [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον πρωτοτοκον] </span></span>. Mostly in Paul and Hebrews.

The comparison implied in the word is not limited to angels. He is the first - born in relation to the creation, the dead, the new manhood, etc. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>. The rabbinical writers applied the title first - born even to God. Philo (De Confus. Ling. § 14) speaks of the Logos as prwtogonov or presbutatov the first - born or eldest son. </p>

The quotation is not found in the Hebrew of the O. T., but is cited literally from LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+32:43">Deuteronomy 32:43</span>. It appears substantially in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+96:7">Psalms 96:7</span>. For the writer of Hebrews the LXX was Scripture, and is quoted throughout without regard to its correspondence with the Hebrew.</p>
