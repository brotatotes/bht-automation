Third quotation, marking the relation of angels to the Son. And again, when he bringeth in, etc. [οταν δε παλιν εισαγαγη] . Const. again with bringe th in. "When he a second time bringeth the first - begotten into the world." Referring to the second coming of Christ. Others explain again as introducing a new citation as in ver. 5; but this would require the reading palin de otan and again, when. In Hebrews, palin, when joined to a verb, always means a second time. See Hebrews 5:12; Hebrews 6:1, Hebrews 1:0:2It will be observed that in this verse, and in Hebrews 5:7, Hebrews 5:8, God is conceived as spoken of rather than as speaking; the subject of legei saith being indefinite. This mode of introducing citations differs from that of Paul. The author 's conception of the inspiration of Scripture leads him to regard all utterances of Scripture, without regard to their connection, as distinct utterances of God, or the Holy Spirit, or the Son of God; whereas, by Paul, they are designated either as utterances of Scripture in general, or of individual writers. Very common in this Epistle are the expressions, "God saith, said, spake, testifieth," or the like. See ch. Hebrews 2:11, Hebrews 2:13; Hebrews 3:7; Hebrews 4:4, Hebrews 4:7; Hebrews 7:21; Hebrews 10:5, Hebrews 10:8, Hebrews 10:15, Hebrews 10:30. Comp. with these Romans 1:17; Romans 2:24; Romans 4:17; Romans 7:7; Romans 9:13; Romans 10:5, Romans 10:16, Romans 10:20, Romans 10:21; Romans 11:2. %Otan eijsagagh whenever he shall have brought. The event is conceived as occurring at an indefinite time in the future, but is viewed as complete. Comp. John 16:4; Acts 24:22. This use of otan with the aorist subjunctive never describes an event or series of events as completed in the past. The first - begotten [τον πρωτοτοκον] . Mostly in Paul and Hebrews. Comp. Romans 8:29; Colossians 1:15, Colossians 1:18; Revelation 1:5. Monogenhv only - begotten (John 1:14, John 1:18; John 3:16, John 3:18; 1 John 4:9, never by Paul) describes the unique relation of the Son to the Father in his divine nature : prwottokov first - begotten describes the relation of the risen Christ in his glorified humanity to man. The comparison implied in the word is not limited to angels. He is the first - born in relation to the creation, the dead, the new manhood, etc. See Colossians 1:15, Colossians 1:18. The rabbinical writers applied the title first - born even to God. Philo (De Confus. Ling. § 14) speaks of the Logos as prwtogonov or presbutatov the first - born or eldest son. And let all the angels of God worship him [και προσκυνησατωσαν αυτω παντες αγγελοι θεου] . Proskunein to worship mostly in the Gospels, Acts, and Apocrypha. In Paul only 1 Corinthians 14:25. Very often in LXX Originally, to kiss the hand to : thence, to do homage to. Not necessarily of an act of religious reverence (see Matthew 9:18; Matthew 20:20), but often in N. T. in that sense. Usually translated worship, whether a religious sense is intended or not : see on Acts 10:25. The quotation is not found in the Hebrew of the O. T., but is cited literally from LXX, Deuteronomy 32:43. It appears substantially in Psalms 96:7. For the writer of Hebrews the LXX was Scripture, and is quoted throughout without regard to its correspondence with the Hebrew.
