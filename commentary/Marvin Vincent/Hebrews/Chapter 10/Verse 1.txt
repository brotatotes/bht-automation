<p>The arrangement of the verse is much disputed. Rend. "The law, with the same sacrifices which they continually renew year by year, can never make the comers thereunto perfect." 217 </p>
<p>A shadow [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκιαν] </span></span>. The emphasis is on this thought. The legal system was a shadow. Skia is a rude outline, an adumbration, contrasted with eijkwn, the archetypal or ideal pattern. Skia does not accurately exhibit the figure itself. Comp. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>. </p>
<p>Of good things to come [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των μελλοντων αγαθων] </span></span>. From the point of view of the law. </p>
<p>The very image of the things [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτην την εικονα των πραγματων</span></span>] For eijkwn image, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>. Pragmatwn things expresses a little more distinctly than mellontwn the idea of facts and realities. </p>
<p>Can [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναται] </span></span>. Dunatai might be expected with oJ nomov the law as the subject. If dunatai, the plural, is retained, the clause the law - image of the things must be taken absolutely, the construction of the sentence breaking off suddenly, and the subject being changed from the law to the priests : "The priests can never," etc. It is better to read dunatai in the singular, with Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort, and Weiss. </p>
<p>Continually [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το διηνεκες] </span></span>. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:3">Hebrews 7:3</span>, and comp. vers. 12, 14. Const. with offer.</p>
