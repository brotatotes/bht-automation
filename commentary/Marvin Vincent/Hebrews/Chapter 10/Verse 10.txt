<p>By the which will [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ω θεληματι] </span></span>. The will of God as fulfilled in Christ. </p>
<p>We are sanctified [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγιασμενοι] </span></span>. Lit. we are having been sanctified; that is, in a sanctified state, as having become partakers of the spirit of Christ. This is the work of the eternal spirit, whose will is the very will of God. It draws men into its own sphere, and makes them partakers of its holiness (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:10">Hebrews 12:10</span>). </p>
<p>Once for all [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφαπαξ] </span></span>. Const. with are sanctified. The sanctification of the Levitical offerings was only temporary, and had to be repeated. Christ 's one offering "perfected forever them that are sanctified" (ver. 14). This thought is elaborated in vers. 11 - 14.</p>
