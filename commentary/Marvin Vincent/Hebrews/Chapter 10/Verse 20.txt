<p>By a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην ενεκαινισεν ημιν οδον προσφατον και ζωσαν] </span></span>. The A. V. is wrong.

The derivation appears to be prov near to, and fatov slain (from pemfamai, the perfect of fenein to kill). According to this the original sense would be newly - slain; and the word was used of one so recently dead as to retain the appearance of life : also, generally, of things which have not lost their character or appearance by the lapse of time; of fishes, fruits, oil, etc., which are fresh; of anger which has not had time to cool. Later the meaning was weakened into new. 220 Note that the contrast is not between a new and an old way, but between a new way and no way.
