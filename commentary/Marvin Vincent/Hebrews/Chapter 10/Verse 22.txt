<p>Let us draw near [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσερχωμεθα] </span></span>. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span>. </p>
<p>With a true heart [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα αληθινης καρδιας] </span></span>. A right and genuine inward attitude toward God. For the phrase comp. LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+38:3">Isaiah 38:3</span>. N. T. o. For ajlhqinhv see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span>, and comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:2">Hebrews 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:24">Hebrews 9:24</span>. A true heart is required to enter the true sanctuary. The phrase means more than in sincerity. Sincerity is included, but with it all that enters into a right attitude toward God as revealed in our Great High Priest, - gladness, freedom, enthusiasm, bold appropriation of all the privileges of sonship. In full assurance of faith [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πληροφορια πιστεως] </span></span>. Full conviction engendered by faith. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:11">Hebrews 6:11</span>. Faith ii the basis of all right relation to God. </p>
<p>Sprinkled from an evil conscience [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρεραντισμενοι - απο συνειδησεως πονηρας] </span></span>. This qualification for a right approach to God is stated typologically. As the priests were sprinkled with the sacrificial blood and washed with water before ministering, so do you who have now the privilege and standing of priests in approaching God, draw near, priestlike, as sharers in an economy which purges the conscience (ch. 9 14), having your consciences purged. Your own hearts must experience the effects of the great sacrifice of Christ, - pardon, moral renewal, deliverance from a legal spirit. On the priesthood of believers see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:6">Exodus 19:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:6">Isaiah 61:6</span>. This idea is dominated in our epistle by that of Christ 's priesthood; but it is not excluded, and is implied throughout. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:15">Hebrews 13:15</span>. For sprinkled, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>. </p>
<p>Bodies washed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λελουσμενοι το σωμα] </span></span>. Also typological. Most, expositors refer to baptism. The most significant passage in that direction is <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:21">1 Peter 3:21</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:26">Ephesians 5:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5">Titus 3:5</span>. It may be, though I doubt if the idea is emphasized. I incline, with Dr. Bruce, to think that it indicates generally the thoroughness of the cleansing process undergone by one who surrenders himself, soul, body, and spirit, to God.</p>
