<p>Of how much [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποσω] </span></span>. Not qualifying ceironov sorer, but the whole clause : "by how much think ye shall he be thought worthy of sorer punishment." </p>
<p>Punishment [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιμωριας] </span></span>. N. T. o. Occasionally in LXX, frequent in Class. Originally assistance; assistance to one who has been wronged; punishment. With no sense of chastisement. It is purely retributive. 221 Trodden under foot [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταπατησας</span></span>] Only here in Hebrews. o P. Frequent in LXX for spoiling, defeating, treating contemptuously. The strong term is purposely selected in order to convey the sense of the fearful outrage involved in forsaking Christ and returning to Judaism. </p>
<p>Hath counted an unholy thing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινον ηγησαμενος] </span></span>. JHgeisqai to count or deem means a conscious judgment resting on a deliberate weighing of the facts. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:10">Romans 12:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:3">Philippians 2:3</span>. Here it implies a deliberate, contemptuous rejection of the gifts of the new covenant. The fundamental idea of koinov is shared by all, public. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:44">Acts 2:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:39">Acts 4:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:4">Titus 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:3">Jude 1:3</span>. Out of this grows the idea of not sacred; not set apart for particular uses by purification, and so (ceremonially) unclean or defiled, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:2">Mark 7:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:5">Mark 7:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:14">Acts 10:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:28">Acts 10:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:8">Acts 11:8</span>. In these cases it is not implied that the thing is defiled or filthy in itself, but only unclean through the absence of that which would set it apart. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:14">Romans 14:14</span>. Here the word admits of two explanations : </p>
<p>(1) that Christ 's blood was counted common, having no more sacred character or specific worth than the blood of any ordinary person; (2) that in refusing to regard Christ 's blood as that of an atoner and redeemer, it was implied that his blood was unclean as being that of a transgressor. The former seems preferable. </p>
<p>There was no specific virtue in Christ 's blood as blood; but a peculiar and unique virtue attached to it as the offering of his eternal spirit (ch. 9 14), as the blood shed in ratification of a sacred covenant established by God, and as having sanctifying virtue. This view is further justified by the combination of blood and spirit, as sources of sanctification allied in the writer's mind. </p>
<p>Hath done despite unto the spirit of grace [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και το πνευμα της χαριτος ενυβρισας] </span></span>. jEnubrizein to insult, N. T. o. The simple verb uJbrizein in Matthew, Luke, Acts, and Pastorals. It will be observed that the work of the Holy Spirit does not receive in this epistle the emphasis which marks it in some other portions of the N. T.</p>
