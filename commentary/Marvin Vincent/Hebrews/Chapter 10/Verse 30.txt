<p>We know him that hath said [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδαμεν γαρ τον ειποντα] </span></span>. The retribution [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιμωρια</span></span>] is certain, because assured by the word of God in Scripture. </p>
<p>Vengeance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκδικησις] </span></span>. An unfortunate translation, since it conveys the idea of vindictiveness which does not reside in the Greek word. It is the full meting out of justice to all parties. The quotation is an adaptation of the LXX of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+32:35">Deuteronomy 32:35</span>. The second citation is literally from LXX of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+32:36">Deuteronomy 32:36</span>.</p>
