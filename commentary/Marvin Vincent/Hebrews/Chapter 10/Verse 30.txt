We know him that hath said [οιδαμεν γαρ τον ειποντα] . The retribution [τιμωρια] is certain, because assured by the word of God in Scripture. Vengeance [εκδικησις] . An unfortunate translation, since it conveys the idea of vindictiveness which does not reside in the Greek word. It is the full meting out of justice to all parties. The quotation is an adaptation of the LXX of Deuteronomy 32:35. The second citation is literally from LXX of Deuteronomy 32:36.
