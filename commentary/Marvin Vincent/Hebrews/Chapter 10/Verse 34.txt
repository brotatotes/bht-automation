<p>For ye had compassion of me in my bonds [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και γαρ τοις δεσμιοις συνεπαθησατε] </span></span>. Entirely wrong, following T. R. toiv desmoiv mou. Rend. "ye had compassion on the prisoners." So Vulg. vinctis compassi estis. The corrupt reading has furnished one of the stock arguments for the Pauline authorship of the Epistle. </p>
<p>Took joyfully [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα χαρας προσεδεξασθε] </span></span>. The verb primarily to receive to one's self, accept, as here. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:2">Luke 14:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:29">Philippians 2:29</span>. Mostly, in N. T. however, to wait for, expect, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:43">Mark 14:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:25">Luke 2:25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:38">Luke 2:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:21">Acts 23:21</span>. </p>
<p>Spoiling [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρπαγην] </span></span>. Only here <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:25">Matthew 23:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:39">Luke 11:39</span>. Allied with aJrpazein to snatch away. </p>
<p>Of your goods [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των υπαρχοντων υμων] </span></span>. The verb uJparceinmeans originally to begin, or begin to be; hence of anything that has begun to be, to come forth, be there; then simply to be. Accordingly the phrase uJparcei moi ti means there is something to me, I have something. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:6">Acts 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:37">Acts 4:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:7">Acts 28:7</span>. Hence ta uJparconta things which are to one; possessions, goods. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:21">Matthew 19:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:27">Matthew 24:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:3">Luke 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:32">Acts 4:32</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:22">Acts 4:22</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:2">Acts 4:2</span> Knowing in yourselves that ye have, etc. [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκοντες εχειν εαυτους] </span></span>. Rend. "knowing that ye yourselves have a better," etc. The A. V. follows T. R. ejn eJautoiv. 223 Ye yourselves in contrast with your spoilers. </p>
<p>Substance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαρξιν] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:45">Acts 2:45</span>. Occasionally in LXX Rend. possession.</p>
