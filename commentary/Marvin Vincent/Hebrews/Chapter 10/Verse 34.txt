For ye had compassion of me in my bonds [και γαρ τοις δεσμιοις συνεπαθησατε] . Entirely wrong, following T. R. toiv desmoiv mou. Rend. "ye had compassion on the prisoners." So Vulg. vinctis compassi estis. The corrupt reading has furnished one of the stock arguments for the Pauline authorship of the Epistle. Took joyfully [μετα χαρας προσεδεξασθε] . The verb primarily to receive to one's self, accept, as here. Comp. Luke 14:2; Philippians 2:29. Mostly, in N. T. however, to wait for, expect, as Mark 14:43; Luke 2:25, Luke 2:38; Acts 23:21. Spoiling [αρπαγην] . Only here Matthew 23:25; Luke 11:39. Allied with aJrpazein to snatch away. Of your goods [των υπαρχοντων υμων] . The verb uJparceinmeans originally to begin, or begin to be; hence of anything that has begun to be, to come forth, be there; then simply to be. Accordingly the phrase uJparcei moi ti means there is something to me, I have something. See Acts 3:6; Acts 4:37; Acts 28:7. Hence ta uJparconta things which are to one; possessions, goods. See Matthew 19:21; Matthew 24:27; Luke 8:3; Acts 4:32. Acts 4:22 Acts 4:2 Knowing in yourselves that ye have, etc. [γινωσκοντες εχειν εαυτους] . Rend. "knowing that ye yourselves have a better," etc. The A. V. follows T. R. ejn eJautoiv. 223 Ye yourselves in contrast with your spoilers. Substance [υπαρξιν] . Only here and Acts 2:45. Occasionally in LXX Rend. possession.
