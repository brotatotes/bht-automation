<p>If they had been mindful [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ει εμνημονευον] </span></span>. In N. T. habitually remember. So invariably in LXX The meaning here is, that if, in their declaration (ver. 14) that they were seeking a country, they had called to mind the country from which they came out, they could have returned thither, so that it is evident that they did not mean that country. 231 To have returned [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακαμψαι] </span></span>. Rend. "to return." Lit. bend their way back again [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα] </span></span>.</p>
