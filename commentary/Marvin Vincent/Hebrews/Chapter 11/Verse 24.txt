Faith in God involves belief in his existence although he is unseen. </p>
<p>Is a rewarder [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθαποδοτης] </span></span>. Note the difference of the verb : not simply exists, but comes to pass as; proves to be, habitually, so that he who approaches God has, through faith, the assurance that his seeking God will result in good to himself.

The verb is used of seeking God, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:11">Romans 3:11</span>. God 's beneficent will and attitude toward the seeker are not always apparent at the first approach. In such cases there is occasion for faith, in the face of delay, that diligent seeking will find its reward. One is reminded of Jesus ' lessons on importunity in seeking God, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:5-10">Luke 11:5-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:1-8">Luke 18:1-8</span>. </p>
<p>He hides himself so wondrously As though there were no God; He is least seen when all the powers Of ill are most abroad. Or he deserts us at the hour The fight is almost lost, And seems to leave us to ourselves Just when we need him most. It is not so, but so It looks; And we lose courage then; And doubts will come if God hath kept His promises to men. " Faber. </p>

<p>Being warned of God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρηματισθεις] </span></span>. Of God is not in the text. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:12">Matthew 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:26">Luke 2:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>; and comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>. </p>
<p>Of things not seen as yet [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περι των μηδεπω βλεπομενων] </span></span>. Const. with eujlabhqeiv, and rend. "by faith Noah, being warned, having reverent care concerning things not seen as yet, prepared an ark," etc. Thus crhmatisqeiv warned is taken absolutely. 230 The things not seen were the well - known contents of the revelation to Noah, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+6:13">Genesis 6:13</span> ff., as apprehended by Noah 's faith. </p>
<p>Moved with fear [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευλαβηθεις] </span></span>. N. T. o. Often in Class. and LXX See on eujlabeia godly fear, ch. 5 7. The A. V. gives the impression that Noah acted under the influence of fright. Rev. improves on this a little by rendering godly fear. The true idea is pious care, a reverent circumspection with regard to things enjoined by God, and as yet unseen, yet confidently expected on the strength of God 's word. </p>
<p>Prepared [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεσκευασεν] </span></span>. Built and equipped. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:3">Hebrews 3:3</span>. An ark [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κιβωτον] </span></span>. Originally, a wooden chest Also of the ark of the covenant in the temple and tabernacle, as ch. 9 4; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+11:19">Revelation 11:19</span> Of Noah 's ark. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:38">Matthew 24:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:27">Luke 17:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:20">1 Peter 3:20</span> Larvax a chest is found in Class. in the same sense. Every classical scholar will recall the charming fragment of Simonides on Danae and her infant son Perseus exposed in an ark : </p>

<p>Also of the ark of Deucalion, the mythic Noah. </p>
<p>By the which [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι ης] </span></span>. By faith : although some refer it to the ark. He condemned the world [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεκρινεν τον κοσμον] </span></span>. His faith was exhibited in building the ark on the mere strength of God 's declaration, while as yet there were no signs of the flood. By his faith thus manifested he announced the condemnation of the world to destruction. World is to be taken as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span>. It is not used in Heb. in the ethical sense so common in John and Paul - the world as alien from God. The meaning of the statement is not that Noah condemned the conduct of his contemporaries by the contrast presented by his own faith, after the analogy of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:41">Matthew 12:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:27">Romans 2:27</span>. </p>
<p>And became heir [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και - εγενετο κληρονομος] </span></span>. This is not an independent clause, but is dependent on di' h=v by which. It is connected by kai with the preceding clause, and the two clauses are parallel, describing the lot of Noah and his family. Became heir is practically = became partaker of. The literal sense of heir must not be pressed. Certainly not "inherited the righteousness of Abel and Enoch." But righteousness came to Noah in virtue of his intimate fellowship with God. Of him as of Enoch, it is said that "he walked with God," <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+6:9">Genesis 6:9</span>. Because of this fellowship he was a son of God and an heir of righteousness. </p>
<p>Of the righteousness which is by faith [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της κατα πιστις δικαιοσυνης] </span></span>. In the O. T. Noah is the first to receive the title of dikaiov righteous, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+6:9">Genesis 6:9</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+14:14">Ezekiel 14:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+14:20">Ezekiel 14:20</span>; Sir. 44 17. Kata pistin, lit. according to faith, comp <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:29">Matthew 9:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:1">Titus 1:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:4">Titus 1:4</span>. Paul has dikaiosunh and dikaiov from or out of faith [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ πιστεως] </span></span>, by faith [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια πιστεως] </span></span>, founded on faith [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι τη πιστει] </span></span>, and of faith [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστεως] </span></span>, none of which are found either in Hebrews or in the Pastorals. Kata pistin signifies according to faith as a standard; but the conception at bottom is not essentially different from Paul 's, unless there be imported into his conception the scholastic fiction of imputed righteousness. Paul, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:0">Romans 4:0</span> is at pains to show that the Christian conception of righteousness by faith has its parallel in Abraham, and that the doctrine of justification by faith is no new thing. Faith is the ground and the germ of righteousness. Our writer here lays down the absolute and universal standard of righteousness for the men of both dispensations - according to faith. Hence, like Paul, he cites the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:4">Habakkuk 2:4</span>. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:38">Hebrews 10:38</span>.</p>
