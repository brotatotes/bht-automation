<p>Neither does this verse belong to the list of historical instances from Genesis, in which men exercised faith. It is merely the first instance presented in O. T. history of an opportunity for the exercise of faith as the assurance and conviction of things not seen. Like ver. 2, it is closely connected with the definition. It contains the exposition of the nature of faith, by showing that in its earliest and most general expression - belief in the creation of the visible universe by God - it is a conviction of something not apprehensible by sense. 225 We understand [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νοουμεν] </span></span>.

In other words, the proposition denied is, that which is seen arose out of visible things.

These things were explained as chaos, the invisible creative powers of God, etc.</p>
