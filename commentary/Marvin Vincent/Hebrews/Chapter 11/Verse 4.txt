Abel offered unto God (Abel proshnegken tw qew). For the phrase see ch. Hebrews 9:14. A more excellent sacrifice [πλειονα θυσιαν] . Greater in value in God 's eyes. For pleiwn in this sense, see ch. Hebrews 3:3; Matthew 6:25; Luke 11:31; Luke 12:23. In Paul never in this sense. Others explain a more abundant sacrifice, referring to the material character of the offerings. See Genesis 4:4. But the difference between the offerings of Abel and Cain, considered in themselves, is largely a matter of speculation, and, as L?n justly remarks, such an interpretation accentuates unduly a purely external feature. 227 By which he obtained witness [δι ης εμαρτυρηθη] . Lit. was witnessed to, as ver. 2. The pronoun which may refer either to the sacrifice or to faith. Better the latter, as is apparent from ver. 2, and probably from ver. 7, although the relation there is somewhat different. Righteous [δικαιος] . Abel is called righteous by Christ himself. Matthew 23:35. Comp. 1 John 3:12. See on Romans 1:17. God testifying of his gifts [μαρτυρουντος επι τοις δωροις αυτου του θεου] . Defining more specifically the general was witnessed to. God bore witness by his acceptance of the gifts. jEpi marks the fact on which the witness was based. Yet speaketh [ετι λαλει] . Comp. Genesis 4:10. Still, although ages have passed since his death. Comp. ch. Hebrews 12:24. Not that his voice still cries to God (so Bleek and others), but that by his faith he still speaks to us in the O. T. Scriptures, though dead. Const. eti yet with lalei speaketh; not with being dead, in the logical sense, "even being dead," as Romans 3:7.
