Paul exhibits faith as the element of personal righteousness in Abraham. In these verses (8 - 22) faith, according to the opening definition in this chapter, is that assurance and conviction of unseen things which caused Abraham and the patriarchs to rely confidently upon the future fulfillment of the divine promises. When he was called to go out - obeyed [καλουμενος εξελθειν υπηκουσεν] . A. V. is wrong. jExelqein to go out should be construed with uJphkousen obeyed, and kaloumenov being called is to be taken absolutely. Kaloumenov, the present participle, indicates Abraham 's immediate obedience to the call : while he was yet being called. Rend. "when he was called obeyed to go out." The infinitive explains the more general obeyed, by specifying that in which his obedience was shown. For the construction, see Acts 14:10; 1 Thessalonians 1:9; Hebrews 5:5. For the narrative, see Genesis 12:1-6, and comp. Acts 7:2-5. Whither he went [που ερχεται] . Note the picturesque continued present tense, "whither he is going," as of Abraham on his journey.
