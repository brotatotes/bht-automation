Wherefore [διο] . Because chastening is thus necessary, and serves for wholesome discipline, and issues in holiness.. Lift up [ανορθωσατε] . Found in Luke 13:13; Acts 14:16 [χιτν] . Occasionally in LXX It signifies to set up, make, erect. In O. T. to establish, as a throne (2 Samuel 7:13, 2 Samuel 7:16); a house (2 Samuel 7:26; 1 Chronicles 17:24); to raise up one who is down (Psalms 145:9; Sir. 11 12). In Acts 14:16, to build anew. By medical writers, to straighten; to set dislocated parts of the body. See Luke 13:13. Luke 13:23 Luke 13:8 The translation here should be more general : not lift up, which is inappropriate to paralyzed knees, but set right; brace. As falling in with the thought of this passage, comp. the LXX of Psalms 17:35, which, for the A. V. "thy gentleness hath made me great," gives "thy discipline hath established me or set me up." See also Psalms 19:8. The hands which hang down [τας παρειμενας χειρας] . Rend. the slackened or weakened hands. Comp. Isaiah 35:3; Sir. 25 23; 2 Samuel 4:1. The verb parienai (only here and Luke 11:42) originally means to let pass, disregard, neglect; thence to relax, loosen. See Clem. Rom. Ad Corinth. 34, who associates it with nwqrov slothful (comp. Hebrews 5:11). And the feeble knees [και τα παραλελυμενα γονατα] . For feeble rend. palsied. See on Luke 5:18.
