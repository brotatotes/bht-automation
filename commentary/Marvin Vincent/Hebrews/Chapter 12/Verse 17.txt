<p>He found no place of repentance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοιας γαρ τοπον ουχ ευρεν] </span></span>. The phrase place of repentance N. T. o. This does not mean that Esau was rendered incapable of repentance, which is clearly contradicted by what follows; nor that he was not able to persuade Isaac to change his mind and to recall the blessing already bestowed on Jacob and give it to him. This is unnatural, forced, and highly improbable. The words place of repentance mean an opportunity to repair by repenting. He found no way to reverse by repentance what he had done. The penalty could not be reversed in the nature of the case. This is clear from Isaac 's words, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:33">Genesis 27:33</span>. </p>
