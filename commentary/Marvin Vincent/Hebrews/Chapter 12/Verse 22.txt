The heavenly Jerusalem. See on Galatians 4:26. The spiritual mountain and city where God dwells and reigns. Comp. Dante Inf 1:128 : "Quivi e la sua cittade, e l'alto seggio." 242 Comp. Psalms 2:6; Psalms 48:2, Psalms 48:3; Psalms 50:2; Psalms 78:68; Psalms 110:2; Isaiah 18:7; Joel 2:32; Micah 4:1, Micah 4:2; Amos 1:2. To an innumerable company of angels (muriasin ajggelwn). On this whole passage (22 - 24) it is to be observed that it is arranged in a series of clauses connected by kai. Accordingly muriasin to myriads or tens of thousands stands by itself, and panhgurei festal assembly goes with ajggelwn angels. Muriav (see Luke 12:1; Acts 19:19; Revelation 5:11; quite often in LXX) is strictly the number ten thousand. In the plural, an innumerable multitude. So A. V. here. Rend. "to an innumerable multitude," placing a comma after muriasin, and connecting of angels with the next clause. This use of muriasin without a qualifying genitive is justified by numerous examples. See Genesis 24:60; Deuteronomy 32:30; Deuteronomy 33:2; 1 Samuel 18:7, 1 Samuel 18:8; Psalms 90:7; Song of Solomon 5:10; Daniel 7:10; Daniel 11:12; Sir. 47 6; 2 Macc. 8 20; Jude 1:14. Ciliadev thousands is used in the same way. See IsaLXX 22; Daniel 7:10
