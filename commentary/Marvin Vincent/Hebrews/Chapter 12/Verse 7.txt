If ye endure chastening [εις παιδειαν υπομενετε] . Rend. "it is for chastening that ye endure." A. V. follows the reading of T. R. eij if. Do not faint at affliction. Its purpose is disciplinary. Paideia is here the end or result of discipline. In ver. 5 it is the process. God dealeth with you as with sons [ως υιοις υμιν προσφερεται ο θεος] . The verb means to bring to : often to bring an offering to the altar, as Matthew 5:23, Matthew 5:24; Matthew 8:4. In the passive voice with the dative, to be born toward one; hence, to attack, assail, deal with, behave toward. See Thucyd. 1 140; Eurip. Cycl. 176; Hdt 7:6. The afflictive dealing of God with you is an evidence that you are sons. What son is he whom the father, etc. [τις υιος] . Some interpreters render, "who is a son whom the father ?" etc. That is, no one is a son who is without paternal chastening. The A. V. is better. The idea expressed by the other rendering appears in the next verse.
