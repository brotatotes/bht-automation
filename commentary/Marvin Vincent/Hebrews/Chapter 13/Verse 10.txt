<p>Those who persist in adhering to the Jewish economy can have no part in the blessing of the new covenant. The two are mutually exclusive. The statement is cast in the mould of the Jewish sacrificial ritual, and in the figure of eating a sacrificial meal. </p>
<p>We have an altar [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχομεν θυσιαστηριον] </span></span>. It is a mistake to try to find in the Christian economy some specific object answering to altar - either the cross, or the eucharistic table, or Christ himself. Rather the ideas of approach to God, - sacrifice, atonement, pardon and acceptance, salvation, - are gathered up and generally represented in the figure of an altar, even as the Jewish altar was the point at which all these ideas converged. The application in this broader and more general sense is illustrated by Ignatius : "If one be not within the altar (ejntov tou qusiasthriou the sacred precinct), he lacketh the bread of God.... Whosoever, therefore, cometh not to the congregation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι το αυτο] </span></span>, he doth thereby show his pride, and hath separated himself," <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:0">Ephesians 5:0</span>. Ignatius here uses the word, not of a literal altar, but of the church. Comp. Trall. 7. Again : "Hasten to come together as to one temple, even God; to one altar, even to one Jesus Christ," Magn. 7. </p>
<p>Of which - to eat [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ ου - φαγειν] </span></span>. The foundation of the figure is the sacrifice of the peace or thank - offering, in which the worshippers partook of the sacrifice. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+7:29-35">Leviticus 7:29-35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+12:6">Deuteronomy 12:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+27:7">Deuteronomy 27:7</span>. The peace - offerings were either public or private. The two lambs offered every year at Pentecost (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+23:19">Leviticus 23:19</span>) were a public offering, and their flesh was eaten only by the officiating priests, and within the holy place. The other public peace - offerings, after the priests had received their share, were eaten by the offerers themselves. Jehovah thus condescended to be the guest of his worshippers. The large scale on which such festivals were sometimes celebrated is illustrated in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+7:63">1 Kings 7:63</span>. In private peace - offerings, the breast of the victim belonged to the Lord, who gave it to the priests (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+7:30">Leviticus 7:30</span>), and the right shoulder was given directly to the priests by Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+7:32">Leviticus 7:32</span>). After the ritual of waving, the entrails were consumed, and the rest was eaten by the priest or the worshippers and their invited guests, among whom were specially included the poor and the Levites. </p>
<p>Right [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσιαν] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:12">John 1:12</span>. </p>
<p>Which serve the tabernacle [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οι τη σκηνη λατρευοντες] </span></span>. This does not mean the priests only, but the worshippers also. Skhnh tabernacle is used figuratively for the whole ceremonial economy. A reference to the priests alone is entirely foreign to the context, and to the whole drift of the discussion which contrasts the privileges of Christians at large (we) with those of Israel at large. The writer is speaking in the present tense, of institutions in operation in his own time, to which tabernacle, in any other than a figurative sense, would be inappropriate. Moreover, latreuein to serve is used throughout the N. T., with the single exception of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>, of the service of the worshipper and not of the priest.</p>
