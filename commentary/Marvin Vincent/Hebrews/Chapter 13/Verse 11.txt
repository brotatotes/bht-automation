<p>The statement that the adherents of the old economy are excluded from the privileges of the new is justified by an illustrative argument drawn from the ceremonies of the Great Day of Atonement. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+16:0">Leviticus 16:0</span>, and comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:7">Hebrews 9:7</span>. Of the victims offered on that occasion neither people nor priest were allowed to eat. The blood of the bullock and of one of the goats was carried into the sanctuary and sprinkled upon the mercy - seat, and afterward on the horns of the great altar outside; and the bodies of the slain animals were burned in a clean place outside of the camp or city. Beasts [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωων] </span></span>. Lit. living creatures. The victims for the Day of Atonement were a bullock and two young goats for sin - offerings, and two rams for burnt - offerings. Only one goat, chosen by lot, was slain; the other served as the scape - goat. Zwon animal is not used elsewhere of a sacrificial victim, either in N. T. or LXX The word in N. T. mostly in Revelation. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+4:6">Revelation 4:6</span>. </p>
<p>Without the camp [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξω της παρεμβολης] </span></span>. Burning without the camp was also required in the case of victims offered at the consecration of the priests, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:14">Exodus 29:14</span>; at the sin - offering for the priest, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+4:11">Leviticus 4:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+4:12">Leviticus 4:12</span>; and at the sin - offering for the congregation, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+4:21">Leviticus 4:21</span>.
