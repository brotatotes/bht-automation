<p>That he might sanctify the people [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα αγιαση τον λαον] </span></span>. Agiazein to sanctify had a peculiar significance to Jews. It meant to set them apart as holy. Hence, the Israelites were called agioi, as separated from other nations and consecrated to God. Our writer extends the application of the word to Christians. For Christ 's work he claims the same efficacy which the Jew claimed for the special call of God to Israel, and for the operation of the Jewish sacrificial system. The office of his atoning work is to sanctify; to make for himself a holy nation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνος αγιον] </span></span>, a people "prepared for the Lord" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:17">Luke 1:17</span>); a true Israel of God. O laov the people, or laov my people, occurs constantly in O. T. as a designation of Israel, and also in N. T. See, in this epistle, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:3">Hebrews 5:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:5">Hebrews 7:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:11">Hebrews 7:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:27">Hebrews 7:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:7">Hebrews 9:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:19">Hebrews 9:19</span>. The N. T. extends the title to all who, under the new dispensation, occupy the position of Israel. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:10">1 Peter 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:10">Luke 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:9">Hebrews 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:10">Hebrews 8:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:30">Hebrews 10:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:25">Hebrews 11:25</span>. </p>
<p>With his own blood [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια του ιδιου αιματος] </span></span>. In contrast with the blood of animal - sacrifices. Comp. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:28">Hebrews 9:28</span>. </p>
<p>Suffered [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαθεν] </span></span>. Used of Christ in Hebrews, 1st Peter, and Acts, but not in Paul, who, however, has paqhmata tou Cristou sufferings of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:5">2 Corinthians 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:10">Philippians 3:10</span> [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου] </span></span>. </p>
<p>Without the gate [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξω της πυλης] </span></span>. Gate is substituted for camp (ver. 11), as more appropriate to a city.</p>
