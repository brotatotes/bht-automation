<p>For here have we no continuing city [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γαρ εχομεν ωδε μενουσαν πολιν] </span></span>. Here, on earth. Continuing city. Let us go forth without the gate to Jesus; for the system which has its center in Jerusalem, the Holy City, is no more ours. We are excluded from its religious fellowship by embracing the faith of him who suffered without the gate. The city itself is not abiding. As a holy city, it is the center and representative of a system of shadows and figures (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9">Hebrews 9:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:23">Hebrews 9:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:24">Hebrews 9:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span>), which is to be shaken and removed, even as is the city itself (xii. 27); <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:13">Hebrews 8:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:10">Hebrews 9:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:9">Hebrews 10:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:18">Hebrews 10:18</span>. If the epistle had been written after the destruction of Jerusalem a reference to that event could hardly have been avoided here. One to come [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την μελλουσαν] </span></span>. Rend. "that which is to come." The heavenly Jerusalem. Comp. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:10">Hebrews 11:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13-16">Hebrews 11:13-16</span>. </p>
<p>The course of thought in vers. 9 - 14 is as follows : Be not carried away with divers and strange teachings, for example, those concerning meats and drinks and sacrificial feasts. It is good that the heart be established, rather than that the body should be ceremonially pure; and that the heart be established by the grace of God in Christ, which alone can give inward peace, a pure conscience, an established rest and security - rather than by the consciousness of having partaken of meats ceremonially clean : for those whose religious life was under the regimen of this ceremonial system derived no permanent profit from it. Not only so, the two systems exclude each other. You cannot hold by the Levitical system and enjoy the blessings of Christian salvation. It is the sacrifice of Christ through which you become partakers of grace. It is impossible to obtain grace through meats; for meats represent the economy which denies Christ; and, by seeking establishment through meats, you exclude yourselves from the economy which is the only vehicle of grace. </p>
<p>Accordingly, we have an altar and a sacrifice from which the votary of Leviticalism is excluded. By the Levitical law it was forbidden to eat the flesh of the victim offered on the Great Day of Atonement; so that, if the Levitical law still holds for you, you cannot partake of the Christian 's atoning victim. The law under which you are prohibits you. According to that law, there is nothing to eat of in an atoning sacrifice, since the body of the victim is burned. Neither priest nor people have anything more to do with it, and, therefore, it is carried outside of the camp or city, outside of the region of O. T. covenant - fellowship. Similarly, so long as you hold by Judaism, participation in Christ 's atoning sacrifice is impossible for you. It is outside your religious sphere, like the body of the victim outside the gate. You cannot eat of our altar. </p>
<p>The blood of the Levitical victim was carried into the holy of holies and remained there. If you seek the benefit of that blood, it must be within the camp, at the Levitical tabernacle or temple. And you cannot have the benefit of Christ 's blood, for that compels you to go outside the gate, where he suffered. According to the O. T. law, you could partake of the benefit of the blood, but you could not eat of the body. Christ 's sacrifice gives you both body and blood as spiritual food; but these you must seek outside of Judaism. Thus, by means of the O. T. ritual itself, it is shown that the Jewish and the Christian systems exclude each other. Christ must be sought outside of the Jewish pale.</p>
