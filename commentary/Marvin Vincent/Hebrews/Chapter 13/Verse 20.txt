Const. with the great shepherd of the sheep. It may be granted that the raising of Christ from the dead, viewed as the consummation of the plan of salvation, was in the sphere of the blood of the covenant; nevertheless, the covenant is nowhere in the N. T. associated with the resurrection, but frequently with death, especially in this epistle. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:28">Matthew 26:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:20">Luke 22:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:16">Hebrews 9:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:17">Hebrews 9:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:20">Hebrews 9:20</span>. The connection of the blood of the covenant with Christ 's pastoral office gives a thoroughly scriptural sense, and one which exactly fits into the context. Christ becomes the great shepherd solely through the blood of the covenant. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>. Through this is brought about the new relation of the church with God described in ch. 8 10 ff. This tallies perfectly with the conception of "the God of peace "; and the great Shepherd will assert the power of the eternal covenant of reconciliation and peace by perfecting his flock in every good work to do his will, working in them that which is well pleasing in his sight. With this agree <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+50:5">Jeremiah 50:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+50:19">Jeremiah 50:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:25">Ezekiel 34:25</span>, and the entire chapter, see especially vers. 12 - 15, 23, 31. In these verses the Shepherd of the Covenant appears as guiding, tending his flock, and leading them into fair and safe pastures. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+63:11-14">Isaiah 63:11-14</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+7:17">Revelation 7:17</span>, see note on poimanei shall shepherd. En aimati" in the blood, " is in virtue of, or in the power of the blood.</p>
