Suffer the word of exhortation [ανεχεσθε του λογου της παρακλησεως] . For "suffer," rend. "bear with." See Acts 18:14; 2 Corinthians 11:1; 2 Timothy 4:3. Do not become impatient at my counsels in this letter. The word of exhortation refers to the entire epistle which he regards as hortatory rather than didactic or consolatory. The phrase only in Acts 13:15. I have written a letter unto you [επεστειλα υμιν] . A. V. supplies a letter. Rend. "I have written unto you." The verb only here, Acts 14:20; Acts 21:25. Lit. to send, not letters only. Sometimes with ejpistolai or ejpistolav letters added, as Nehemiah 6:19; Nehemiah 1:0 Macc. 12 7. In N. T. always of sending a letter. In a few words [δια βραχεων] . There is a suggestion of apology. Do not grow impatient. The letter is short. The phrase N. T. o, but comp. dij ojligwn, 1 Peter 5:12, and ejn ojligw briefly, Ephesians 3:3.
