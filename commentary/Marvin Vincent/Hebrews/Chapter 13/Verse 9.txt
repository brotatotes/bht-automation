Be not carried about [μη παραφερεσθε] . A. V. follows T. R. periferesqe. Rend. "carried away." The present tense indicates a present and active danger. With divers and strange doctrines [διδαχαις ποικιλαις και ξεναις] . For "doctrines" rend. "teachings." These teachings represent various phases of one radical error - the denial of Jesus 's messiahship and of his messianic economy as superseding Judaism and all other means of salvation. Among them the writer's mind would naturally turn to the prescriptions concerning clean and unclean meats and sacrificial festivals. See next clause. These teachings were various as contrasted with the one teaching of the gospel; they were strange as they differed from that teaching. Comp. Galatians 1:6-9. For poikilaiv see on 2 Timothy 3:16. That the heart be established [βεβαιουσθαι την καρδιαν] . There is an emphasis on heart as well as on grace. These strange teachings all emphasized externalism, in contrast with Christianity, which insisted upon the purification of the heart and conscience. The contrast is strongly stated in ch. 9 9, 14, and the Epistle constantly directs the readers to the heart as the true point of contact with God, and the source of all departures from him. See ch. Hebrews 3:8, Hebrews 3:10, Hebrews 3:12, Hebrews 3:15; Hebrews 4:7, Hebrews 4:12; Hebrews 8:10; especially Hebrews 10:22. Hence, the writer says, "it is good that the solid basis of your assurance before God be in the heart, purged from an evil conscience, so that you can draw near to God with a firmly - established confidence, with a true heart, in full assurance of faith" : ch. 10 22; comp. 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 2 Timothy 2:22. With grace, not with meats [χαριτι ου βρωμασιν] . The heart is the proper seat of the work of grace. Free grace is the motive - power of Christ 's sacrifice (2 Corinthians 8:9; Galatians 1:15); it is behind the blood of the new covenant, and is the energetic principle of its saving operation. See Romans 5:2, Romans 5:15; 1 Corinthians 14:10; Ephesians 2:5, Ephesians 2:7, Ephesians 2:8; 2 Thessalonians 2:16; Hebrews 2:9; Hebrews 4:16; Hebrews 10:29. With meats stands for the whole system of ceremonial observances, in contrast with grace, working on the heart. See ch. Hebrews 9:10. This ceremonial system yielded no permanent benefit to those who lived under it. See ch. Hebrews 7:25; Hebrews 9:9, Hebrews 9:13, Hebrews 9:14; Hebrews 10:1, Hebrews 10:2, Hebrews 10:4. Which have not profited them that have been occupied therein [εν οις ουκ ωφεληθησαν οι περιπατουντες] . Lit. in the which they who walked were not profited. Peripatein to walk about is often used to express habitual practice or general conduct of life. See Romans 6:4; 2 Corinthians 10:3; Ephesians 2:10; Colossians 3:7; Colossians 4:5.
