This acknowledgment as brethren the writer represents as prophetically announced by Messiah in Psalms 22:22. The Psalm is the utterance of a sufferer crying to God for help in the midst of enemies. The Psalmist declares that God has answered his prayer, and that he will give public thanks therefore. Unto my brethren [τοις αδελφοις μου] . His brethren in the worshipping assembly. This is applied by our writer to the human brotherhood at large, and Christ is represented as identifying himself with them in thanksgiving. Will I sing praise unto thee [υμνησω σε] . Rare in N. T. Matthew 26:30; Mark 14:26; Acts 16:25. Lit. hymn thee. Often in the Greek liturgies.
