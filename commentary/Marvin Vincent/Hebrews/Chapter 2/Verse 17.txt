Likeness is asserted without qualification. There was a complete and real likeness to humanity, a likeness which was closest just where the traces of the curse of sin were most apparent - in poverty, temptation, and violent and unmerited death. </p>
<p>It behooved [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφειλεν] </span></span>. Indicating an obligation growing out of the position which Christ assumed : something which he owed to his position as the helper of his people. </p>
<p>That he might be a merciful and faithful high priest [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ελεημων γενηται και πιστος αρχιερευς] </span></span>. Rend. that he might be compassionate, and so (in consequence of being compassionate), a faithful high priest. The keynote of the Epistle, the high - priesthood of Christ, which is intimated in ch. 1 3, is here for the first time distinctly struck. Having shown that Christ delivers from the fear of death by nullifying the accusing power of sin, he now shows that he does this in his capacity of high priest, for which office it was necessary that he should be made like unto his human brethren. In the O. T. economy, the fear of death was especially connected with the approach to God of an impure worshipper (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+18:3">Numbers 18:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+18:5">Numbers 18:5</span>). This fear was mitigated or removed by the intervention of the Levitical priest, since it was the special charge of the priest so to discharge the service of the tabernacle that there might be no outbreak of divine wrath on the children of Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+18:5">Numbers 18:5</span>). Genhtai might show himself to be, or prove to be. The idea of compassion as an attribute of priests is not found in the O. T. On the contrary, the fault of the priests was their frequent lack of sympathy with the people (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ho+4:4-9">Hosea 4:4-9</span>). In the later Jewish history, and in N. T. times, the priestly aristocracy of the Sadducees was notoriously unfeeling and cruel. The idea of a compassionate and faithful high priest would appeal powerfully to Jewish readers, who knew the deficiency of the Aaronic priesthood in that particular. Pistov faithful, as an attribute of a priest, appears in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+2:35">1 Samuel 2:35</span>. The idea there is fidelity. He will do all that is in God 's mind. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:2">Hebrews 3:2</span>. This implies trustworthiness. The idea here is, faithful in filling out the true ideal of the priesthood (ch. 5 1, 2), by being not a mere ceremonialist but a compassionate man. </p>
