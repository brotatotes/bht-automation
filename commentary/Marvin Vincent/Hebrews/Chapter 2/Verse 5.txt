The writer's object is to show that the salvation, the new order of things inaugurated by Christ, is in pursuance of the original purpose of creation, to wit, that universal dominion was to pertain to man, and not to angels. The great salvation means lordship of the world to be. This purpose is carried out in Christ, who, in becoming man, became temporarily subject to the earthly dispensation of which angels were the administrators. This was in order that he might acquire universal lordship as man. Being now exalted above angels, he does away with the angelic administration, and, in the world to come, will carry humanity with him to the position of universal lordship. This thought is developed by means of Psalms 8:0. Having set Christ above the angels, the writer must reconcile that claim with the historical fact of Christ 's humiliation in his incarnate state. The Psalm presents a paradox in the antithesis of lower than the angels and all things under his feet. From the Psalm is drawn the statement of a temporary subordination of Christ to angels, followed by his permanent exaltation over them. Hath - put in subjection [υπεταξεν] . The word suggests an economy; not merely subjecting the angels, but arranging or marshaling them under a new order. See 1 Corinthians 14:27, 1 Corinthians 14:28; Ephesians 1:22; Philippians 3:21. The world to come [την οικουμενην την μελλουσαν] . See on ch. Hebrews 1:2. For hJ oijkoumenh the inhabited (land or country) see on Luke 2:1. The world to come means the new order of things inaugurated by the sacrifice of Christ.
