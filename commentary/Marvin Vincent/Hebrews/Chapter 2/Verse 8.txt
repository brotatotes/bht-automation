<p>For [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ] </span></span>. Explanatory. Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet, that is to say, nothing is excepted. That is not put under him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω ανυποτακτον] </span></span>. Lit. "unsubjected to him." The adjective only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:9">1 Timothy 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:6">Titus 1:6</span>. But this ideal is not yet a reality. We see not yet all things subjected to him, but we do see the germinal fulfillment of the prophecy in Jesus ' life, suffering, and death.</p>
