<p>We are made partakers of Christ [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετοχοι γαρ του χριστου γεγοναμεν] </span></span>. Rend. we are become fellows with Christ. For fellows see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:7">Luke 5:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:9">Hebrews 1:9</span>. It marks even a closer relation than "brethren." See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:30">Luke 22:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21">Revelation 3:21</span>. </p>
<p>Beginning of our confidence [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αρχην της υποστασεως] </span></span>. The believing confidence with which we began our Christian life. For uJpostasiv confidence see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>. The Greek fathers render substance; that in virtue of which we are believers. </p>
<p>Unto the end [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεχρι τελους] </span></span>. Better, the consummation. It is more than mere termination. It is the point into which the whole life of faith finally gathers itself up. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:21">Romans 6:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:15">2 Corinthians 11:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:19">Philippians 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:8">Hebrews 6:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:9">1 Peter 1:9</span>.</p>
