<p>CHAPTER IV </p>
<p>Christian salvation, having been presented as lordship over the world to come, and as deliverance from the fear of death, is now to be presented as participation in the rest of God. The purpose of vers. 1 - 11 is to confirm the hope of that rest, and to warn against forfeiting it. There is a possibility of your forfeiting it. The rest of God was proclaimed to your forefathers, but they did not enter into it because of their unbelief. It has been proclaimed to you. You may fail as did they, and for the same reason.</p>
