<p>He that built all things is God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο παντα κατασκευασας θεος] </span></span>. The verb includes not only erection, but furnishing with the entire equipment. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:2">Hebrews 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:10">1 Peter 2:10</span>. The verb o P. The application of built or established to Christ (ver. 3) is guarded against possible misapprehension. Christ is the establisher, but not by any independent will or agency. As the Son he is he that built, but it is as one with God who built all things. The special foundership of Christ does not contradict or exclude the general foundership of God.</p>
