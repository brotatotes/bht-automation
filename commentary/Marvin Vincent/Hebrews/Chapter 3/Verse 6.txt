<p>But Christ. Replacing the human name Jesus, and being the official name which marks his position over the house. </p>
<p>As a son [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως υιος] </span></span>. The fidelity of Moses and the fidelity of Christ are exhibited in different spheres : of Moses in that of servant; of Christ in that of son. </p>
<p>Over his own house [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι τον οικον αυτου] </span></span>. Comp. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:21">Hebrews 10:21</span>, and notice ejpi over his house, and ejn in all his house, of Moses. For "his own house" rend. "his house," referring to God. Reference to Christ would destroy the parallel. It is said by some that the matter of respective positions is irrelevant : that the main point is fidelity, and that therefore it does not matter whether Moses was a son or a servant, provided he was faithful. But the writer evidently feels that Christ 's position as a son enhanced his fidelity. Comp. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:8">Hebrews 5:8</span>. The implication is that Christ 's position involved peculiar difficulties and temptations. </p>
<p>Whose house [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου] </span></span>. God 's house. The church is nowhere called the house of Christ. </p>
<p>We [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις] </span></span>. Even as was the house in which Moses served. The Christian community is thus emphatically designated as the house of God, implying the transitoriness of the Mosaic system.

<p>Hold fast [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατασξωμεν] </span></span>. The verb is used in N. T. as here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:21">1 Thessalonians 5:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:13">Philippians 1:13</span>; of restraining or preventing, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:42">Luke 4:42</span>; of holding back or holding down with an evil purpose, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18">Romans 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</span>; of holding one's course toward, bearing down for, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:40">Acts 27:40</span>. </p>
<p>The confidence and the rejoicing of the hope [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την παρρησιαν και το καυχημα της ελπιδος] </span></span>. The combination confidence and rejoicing N. T. o. Rejoicing or boasting of hope N. T. o, but comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:19">1 Thessalonians 2:19</span>. For parrhsia confidence see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:13">1 Timothy 3:13</span>. The entire group of words, kauchma ground of glorying, kauchsiv act of glorying, and kaucasqai to glory, is peculiarly Pauline. Outside of the Pauline letters kaucasqai occurs only <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:9">James 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:16">James 4:16</span>; kauchsiv only <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:16">James 4:16</span>; and kauchma only here. The thought here is that the condition of being and continuing the house of God is the holding fast of the hope in Christ (ejlpidov of the object of hope) and in the consummation of God 's kingdom in him; making these the ground of boasting, exultantly confessing and proclaiming this hope. There must be, not only confidence, but joyful confidence. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:3">Romans 5:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:12">Ephesians 3:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:13">Ephesians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3">Philippians 3:3</span>. Firm unto the end [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεχρι τελους βεβαιαν] </span></span>. Textually, there is some doubt about these words. Westcott and Hort bracket them. Tischendorf retains, and Weiss rejects them. The latter part of this verse marks the transition to the lesson of the wilderness - life of the exodus; the writer fearing that the fate of the exodus - generation may be repeated in the experience of his readers. We are God 's house if we steadfastly hold fast our Christian hope, and do not lose our faith as Israel did in the wilderness. The exhortation to faith is thrown into the form of warning against unbelief. Faith is the condition of realizing the divine promise.
