Only in such a Sabbath - rest is found the counterpart of God 's rest on the seventh day. For he that is entered into his rest [ο γαρ εισελθων εις την καταπαυσιν αυτου] . Whoever has once entered. 183 His God 's. The aorist marks the completeness of the appropriation - once and for all. He also hath ceased from his own works [και αυτος κατεπαυσεν απο των εργων αυτου] . Omit own. The statement is a general proposition : any one who has entered into God 's rest has ceased from his works. As God did from his [ωσπερ απο των ιδιων ο θεος] . Rend. as God (did) from his own. jIdiwn own signifies more than mere possession. Rather, works peculiarly his own, thus hinting at the perfect nature of the original works of creation as corresponding with God 's nature and bearing his impress. The blessing of the Sabbath - rest is thus put as a cessation from labors. The basis of the conception is Jewish, the rest of the Sabbath being conceived as mere abstinence from labor, and not according to Christ 's conception of the Sabbath, as a season of refreshment and beneficent activity, Mark 2:27; John 5:17. Our writer's conception is not the rabbinical conception of cessation of work, but rather of the cessation of the weariness and pain which accompany human labor. Comp. Revelation 14:13; Revelation 21:4; Luke 11:7; Luke 18:5; Galatians 6:17.
