<p>N.T.oo lxx. Only later Greek. Evidently connected with <span class="_800000"><span style="">τράχηλος</span></span><span style=""> </span>neck <i>throat</i>. The exact metaphor, however, it is impossible to determine. The following are the principal explanations proposed: <i>taken by the throat</i>, as an athlete grasps an adversary; <i>exposed</i>, as a malefactor's neck is bent back, and his face exposed to the spectators; or, as the necks of victims at the altar are drawn back and exposed to the knife. The idea at the root seems to be the bending back of the neck, and the last explanation, better than any other, suits the previous figure of the sword. The custom of drawing back the victim's neck for sacrifice is familiar to all classical students. See Hom. <i>Il</i>. i. 459; ii. 422; Pindar, <i>Ol</i>. xiii. 114. The victim's throat bared to the sacrificial knife is a powerful figure of the complete exposure of all created intelligence to the eye of him whose word is as a two-edged sword.</p>
