<p><span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17-18">Hebrews 2:17-18</span> is now resumed. This and the following verse more naturally form the conclusion of the preceding section than the introduction to the following one.</p>
<p><b>Great high priest (</b><span class="_800000"><span style=""><b>μέγαν</b></span></span><b>)</b></p>
<p>Emphasizing Christ's priestly character to Jewish readers, as superior to that of the Levitical priests. He is holding up the <i>ideal</i> priesthood.</p>
<p><b>Passed into the heavens (</b><span class="_800000"><span style=""><b>διεληλυθότα τοὺς οὐρανούς</b></span></span><b>)</b></p>
<p>Rend. “passed <i>through</i> the heavens.” Through, and up to the throne of God of which he wields the power, and is thus able to fulfill for his followers the divine promise of rest.</p>
<p><b>Jesus the Son of God</b></p>
<p>The name <i>Jesus</i> applied to the high priest is forcible as recalling the historical, human person, who was tempted like his brethren. We are thus prepared for what is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span> concerning his sympathizing character.</p>
