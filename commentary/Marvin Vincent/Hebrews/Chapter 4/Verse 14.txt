He is holding up the ideal priesthood.Passed into the heavens (διεληλυθότα τοὺς οὐρανούς)Rend. “passed through the heavens.” Through, and up to the throne of God of which he wields the power, and is thus able to fulfill for his followers the divine promise of rest.Jesus the Son of GodThe name Jesus applied to the high priest is forcible as recalling the historical, human person, who was tempted like his brethren.
