<p>For unto us was the gospel preached [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και γαρ εσμεν ευηγγελισμενοι] </span></span>. Lit. we have had good tidings proclaimed to us. The translation of the A. V. is unfortunate, since it conveys the technical and conventional idea of preaching the gospel, which is entirely out of place here. The reference is to the special announcement of the rest of God; the glad tidings that God has provided a rest for his people. This announcement was made to the fathers, and signified to them the promise of the rest in Canaan. It has been proclaimed to us, and to us is the announcement of the heavenly rest. The emphasis is on the entire statement, "we have had the good tidings proclaimed to us," rather than on we as contrasted with they. </p>
<p>The word preached [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λογος της ακοης] </span></span>. Lit. the word of the message. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:13">1 Thessalonians 2:13</span>. </p>
<p>Not being mixed with faith in them that heard it [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη συνκεκερασμενους τη πιστει τοις ακουσασιν] </span></span>. Rend. because not incorporated by faith in them that heard. 182 A body of obedient hearers with whom the erring Israelites were not incorporated would be an idea foreign to the discussion. Moreover, in ch. 3 16, the writer has declared that there were practically no believing hearers. He says that although the good tidings were announced to them, they did not profit them. The word did not profit them because it (the word) was not assimilated by faith in those that heard. They did not make the promise of rest their own. Their history was marked by continual renewals and rejections of the promise.</p>
