For we which have believed do enter into rest [εισερχομεθα γαρ εις την καταπαυσιν οι πιστευσαντες] . I say by faith, for, we believers, who embraced the Christian faith when it was offered to us (note the aorist participle), do enter into the rest. jEisercomeqa categorical; not are entering or are on the way to, but entering into the rest is a fact which characterizes us as believers. As he said [καθως ειρηκεν] . We enter in accordance with the saying which follows. As I have sworn - if they shall enter. The statement is somewhat obscure. The meaning is, we (who believed) enter into rest in accordance with God 's declaration that they (who did not believe) should not enter. The point is faith as the condition of entering into the rest. Although the works were finished [καιτοι των εργων γενηθεντων] . This is an awkward and indirect way of saying, "these unbelievers did not enter into God 's rest, although he had provided that rest into which they might have entered." The providing of the rest is implied in the completion of God 's works. The writer assumes the readers' acquaintance with the narrative of the creation in Genesis.
