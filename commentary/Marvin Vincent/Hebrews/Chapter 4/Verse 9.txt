<p>There remaineth therefore a rest [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα απολειπεται σαββατισμος] </span></span>. Remaineth, since in the days of neither Moses, Joshua, or David was the rest appropriated. He passes over the fact that the rest had not been entered into at any later period of Israel 's history. Man's portion in the divine rest inaugurated at creation has never been really appropriated : but it still remaineth. This statement is justified by the new word for "rest" which enters at this point, sabbatismov instead of katapausiv, N. T. o, o LXX, o Class., signifies a keeping Sabbath. The Sabbath rest points back to God 's original rest, and marks the ideal rest - the rest of perfect adjustment of all things to God, such as ensued upon the completion of his creative work, when he pronounced all things good. This falls in with the ground - thought of the Epistle, the restoration of all things to God 's archetype. The sin and unbelief of Israel were incompatible with that rest. It must remain unappropriated until harmony with God is restored. The Sabbath - rest is the consummation of the new creation in Christ, through whose priestly mediation reconciliation with God will come to pass. </p>
