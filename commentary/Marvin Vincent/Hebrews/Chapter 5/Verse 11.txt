<p>From this point the comparison of Christ with Melchisedec would naturally be developed; but the author digresses into a complaint of the imperfect spiritual attainment of his readers, and a remonstrance and admonition extending to the end of ch. 6. </p>
<p>Of whom [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περι ου] </span></span>. Rend. concerning which. Not Melchisedec, but the topic that Christ is a priest after the order of Melchisedec, a topic to which great importance is attached. Can it be imagined that the discussion of such a topic would appeal to a Gentile audience as a reason for not relapsing into paganism? </p>
<p>We have many things to say [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολυς ημιν ο λογος] </span></span>. Lit. the discourse is abundant unto us. We refers to the writer himself. </p>
<p>Hard to be uttered [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυσερμηνευτος λεγειν] </span></span>. Lit. hard of interpretation to speak. The A. V. entirely misses the idea of interpretation. Rev. better, hard of interpretation. Dusermhneutov N. T. o. o LXX o Class. </p>
<p>Ye are dull of hearing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νωθροι γεγονατε ταις ακοαις] </span></span>. Rend. ye have grown dull in your hearing. For ajkoh hearing see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:3">2 Timothy 4:3</span>. The verb implies a deterioration on the hearers' part. Nwqroi only here and ch. 6 12. From nh not and wjqein to push. Hence slow, sluggish. 189 Mostly in later Greek, although Plato uses it much in the same sense as here. "When they have to face study they are stupid [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νωθροι</span></span>] and cannot remember." Theaet. 144 B. In LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+22:29">Proverbs 22:29</span>; Sir. 4 29; 11 12. Sometimes = low, mean, obscure. So in Proverbs, but in Sirach slack, slow.</p>
