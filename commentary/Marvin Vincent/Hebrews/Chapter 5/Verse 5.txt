Thou art my Son is introduced thus in close connection with the call to the priesthood, in recognition of the fact that the priesthood of Christ had its basis in his sonship. "Christ 's priestly vocation ceases to be an accident in his history, and becomes an essential characteristic of his position as Son : sonship, christhood, priestliness, inseparably interwoven" (Bruce).</p>
