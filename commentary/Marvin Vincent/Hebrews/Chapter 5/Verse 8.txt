<p>Though he were a Son [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιπερ ων υιος] </span></span>. For were rend. was. His training for the priesthood involved suffering, even though he was a son. Connect with emaqen learned, not with the preceding clause, which would mean that his position as a son did not exempt him from the obligation to godly fear, which is true as a fact (see ver. 7), but is not the point of emphasis here. </p>
<p>Learned he obedience [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμαθεν την υπακοην] </span></span>. Omit he, since the subject of emaqen learned is ov who, ver. 7. Jesus did not have to learn to obey, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:29">John 8:29</span>; but he required the special discipline of a severe human experience as a training for his office as a high priest who could be touched with the feeling of human infirmities. He did not need to be disciplined out of any inclination to disobedience; but, as Alford puts it, "the special course of submission by which he became perfected as our high priest was gone through in time, and was a matter of acquirement and practice." This is no more strange than his growth in wisdom, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:52">Luke 2:52</span>. Growth in experience was an essential part of his humanity. </p>
<p>By the things which he suffered [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφ ων επαθεν] </span></span>. Or from the things, etc. Note the word - play, emaqen epaqen. So Croesus, addressing Cyrus, says, ta de moi paqhmata, ejonta ajcarista, maqhmata gegonen, "my sufferings, though painful, have proved to be lessons" (Hdt. 1 207) : so Soph. Trach. 142, mht' ejkmaqoiv paqousa "mayst thou not learn by suffering."</p>
