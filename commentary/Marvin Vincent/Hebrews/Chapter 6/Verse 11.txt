We desire [επιθυμουμεν] . Strongly, earnestly. Comp. Matthew 13:17; Luke 22:15. The manifestations just mentioned make the writer desire that they may exhibit more of the spirit which animates their beneficent works. Each [εκαστον] . He is concerned, not only for the body of believers, but for each member. To the full assurance of hope unto the end [προς την πληροφοριαν της ελπιδος αρχι τελους] . That is, we desire that each of you exhibit the same diligence to develop your hope, which is in danger of failing, into full assurance, unto the end of the present season of trial with its happy consummation. Comp. Romans 8:24. For plhroforia see on 1 Thessalonians 1:5, and comp. Romans 4:21; Romans 14:5. It is practically the same whether we translate full development or full assurance. The two meanings coalesce. Hope develops into full assurance.
