The compound verb is well rendered by A. V., since, as distinguished from the simple feugein to flee, it expresses flight to a definite place or person for safety. Hence often used in connection with an altar or a sanctuary. The distinction between the simple and the compound verb is illustrated in Hdt 4:23, where, speaking of the barbarous tribe of the Iyrcae, he says, "Whoever flees [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φευγων</span></span>] and betakes himself for refuge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταφυγη</span></span>] to them, receives wrong from no one."
