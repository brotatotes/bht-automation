If God permit [εανπερ επιτρεπη ο θεος] . The exact formula N. T. o. Comp. 1 Corinthians 16:7; Acts 18:21. Pagan parallels are twn qewn qelontwn if the gods will; qewn ejpitrepontwn the gods permitting, and qewn boulomenwn if the gods desire. An ominous hint is conveyed that the spiritual dullness of the readers may prevent the writer from developing his theme and them from receiving his higher instruction. The issue is dependent on the power which God may impart to his teaching, but his efforts may be thwarted by the impossibility of repentance on their part. No such impossibility is imposed by God, but it may reside in a moral condition which precludes the efficient action of the agencies which work for repentance, so that God cannot permit the desired consequence to follow the word of teaching.
