Indicating that the enlightenment ought to have sufficed to prevent them from falling away; not that it does not admit of repetition. Enlightened, through the revelation of God in Christ, the true light, and through the power of the Spirit. Fwtizein in LXX usually to teach or instruct; see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+108:130">Psalms 108:130</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ki+12:2">2 Kings 12:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ki+17:27">2 Kings 17:27</span>.

There is no ground for explaining the word here of baptism, although the fathers from the time of Justin Martyr used fwtizein and fwtosmov in that sense, and this usage continued down to the Reformation. See Just. Mart. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+1:62">Revelation 1:62</span>. Chrysostom entitled his 59th Homily, addressed to candidates for baptism, prov touv mellontav fwtizesqai to those who are about to be enlightened; and justified this name for baptism by this passage and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:32">Hebrews 10:32</span>. The Peshitto translates this passage, "who have once (for all) descended to baptism." The N. T. gives no example of this usage. 193 Tasted of the heavenly gift [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γευσαμενους της δωρεας της επουρανιου</span></span>] For geusamenouv tasted, comp. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>.

Partakers of the Holy Ghost [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετοχους πνευματος αγιου] </span></span>. "Heavenly gift" emphasizes the heavenly quality of the gift.
