The good word of God [καλον θεου ρημα] . The gospel of Christ as preached. Comp. ch. Hebrews 2:3. To the word are attached life (Acts 5:20); spirit and life (John 6:63); salvation (Acts 11:14); cleansing (Ephesians 5:26); especially the impartation of the Spirit (John 3:0; 34; Acts 5:32; Acts 10:44; Ephesians 6:17; Hebrews 2:4). Powers of the world to come [δυναμεις μελλοντος αιωνος] . Not foretastes of heavenly bliss. The world to come is the world of men under the new order which is to enter with the fulfillment of Christ 's work. See on these last days, ch. 1 2. These powers are characteristic of that period, and in so far as that dispensation is inaugurated here and now, they assert and manifest themselves.
