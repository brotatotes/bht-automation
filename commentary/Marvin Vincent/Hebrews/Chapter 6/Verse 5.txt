<p>The good word of God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλον θεου ρημα] </span></span>. The gospel of Christ as preached. Comp. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:3">Hebrews 2:3</span>. To the word are attached life (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:20">Acts 5:20</span>); spirit and life (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:63">John 6:63</span>); salvation (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:14">Acts 11:14</span>); cleansing (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:26">Ephesians 5:26</span>); especially the impartation of the Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:0">John 3:0</span>; 34; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:32">Acts 5:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:44">Acts 10:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:17">Ephesians 6:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:4">Hebrews 2:4</span>). </p>
<p>Powers of the world to come [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμεις μελλοντος αιωνος] </span></span>. Not foretastes of heavenly bliss. The world to come is the world of men under the new order which is to enter with the fulfillment of Christ 's work. See on these last days, ch. 1 2. These powers are characteristic of that period, and in so far as that dispensation is inaugurated here and now, they assert and manifest themselves.</p>
