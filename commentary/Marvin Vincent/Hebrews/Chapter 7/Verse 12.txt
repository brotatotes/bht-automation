<p>A change [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταθεσις] </span></span>. A transfer to a new basis. Only in Hebrews. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:5">Hebrews 11:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:27">Hebrews 12:27</span>. The inferiority of the Levitical priesthood is inferred from the fact that another priesthood was promised. If perfection was possible at all under the Mosaic economy, it must come through the Levitical priesthood, since that priesthood was, in a sense, the basis of the law. The whole legal system centered in it. The fundamental idea of the law was that of a people united with God. Sin, the obstacle to this ideal union, was dealt with through the priesthood. If the law failed to effect complete fellowship with God, the priesthood was shown to be a failure, and must be abolished; and the change of the priesthood involved the abolition of the entire legal system.</p>
