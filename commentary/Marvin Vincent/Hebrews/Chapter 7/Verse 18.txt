<p>There is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αθετησις μεν γαρ γινεται προαγουσης εντολης] </span></span>. Verily is superfluous. jAqethsiv only here and ch. 9 26; a very few times in LXX : The fundamental idea is the doing away of something established [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θετον] </span></span>. The verb ajqetein to make void, do away with, is common in N. T. and in LXX, where it represents fifteen different Hebrew words, meaning to deal falsely, to make merchandise of, to abhor, to transgress, to rebel, to break an oath, etc. The noun, in a technical, legal sense, is found in a number of papyri from 98 to 271 A. D., meaning the making void of a document. It appears in the formula eijv ajqithsin kai ajkurwsin for annulling and canceling. Proagoushv ejntolhv rend. of a foregoing commandment. The expression is indefinite, applying to any commandment which might be superseded, although the commandment in ver. 16 is probably in the writer's mind. Foregoing, not emphasizing mere precedence in time, but rather the preliminary character of the commandment as destined to be done away by a later ordinance.

<p>For the weakness and unprofitableness thereof [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια το αυτης ασθενες και ανωφελες] </span></span>. Rend. "because of its weakness and unprofitableness."
