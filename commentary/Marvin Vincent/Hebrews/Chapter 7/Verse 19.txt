<p>For the law made nothing perfect [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν γαρ ετελειωσεν ο νομος] </span></span>. Parenthetical. The A. V. overlooks the parenthesis, ignores the connection of bringing in with disannulling, translates de but instead of and, and supplies did; thus making an opposition between the law which made nothing perfect and the bringing in of a better hope, which did make something perfect. What the writer means to say is that, according to the Psalm, there takes place, on the one hand, a disannulling of the preliminary commandment because it was weak and unprofitable, unable to perfect anything, and on the other hand, the introduction of a better hope. The bringing in of a better hope [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεισαγωγη κρειττονος ελπιδος] </span></span>. EpeisagwghN. T. o, o LXX, is "a bringing in upon" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι] </span></span>, upon the ground formerly occupied by the commandment. So Rev., correctly, "a bringing in thereupon." For kpeittwn better, see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4">Hebrews 1:4</span>. The comparison is not between the hope conveyed by the commandment, and the better hope introduced by the gospel, but between the commandment which was characteristic of the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span>) and the hope which characterized the gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2-5">Romans 5:2-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:24">Romans 8:24</span>). </p>
<p>By the which we draw nigh to God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι ης εγγιζομεν τω θεω] </span></span>. Giving the reason why the hope is better. Christianity is the religion of good hope because by it men first enter into intimate fellowship with God. The old priesthood could not effect this. </p>
<p>20 - 24. A third argument to show the inferiority of the old priesthood. It is twofold : </p>
<p>(a) the new priesthood was established with the oath of God; </p>
<p>(b) it is held perpetually by one person, in contrast with the old priesthood which was administered by a succession of priests.</p>
