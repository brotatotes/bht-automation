<p>First being by interpretation King of righteousness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτον μεν ερμηνευομενος βασιλευς δικαιοσυνης] </span></span>. The first designation is the literal interpretation of the Hebrew name. Being interpreted belongs only to this designation. So Joseph Ant 1:10, 2 shmainei de touto basileuv dikaiov "and this (the name Melchisedec) signifies righteous king." And after that also [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επειτα δε και] </span></span>. Then follows a designation derived from his character, king of peace. Supply being; not being interpreted. Salem. Commonly regarded as the site of Jerusalem. It has also been supposed to represent Saleim Salim, mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:23">John 3:23</span>. Jerome says that the place retained that name in his day, and that the ruins of Melchisedec's palace were shown there. 200 The ancient name of Jerusalem was Jebus. Others, again, suppose that Salem is not the name of a place, but is merely the appellation of Melchisedec. The passage in Genesis, however, points to a place, and the writer might naturally have desired to indicate the typical meaning of the city over which Melchisedec reigned.</p>
