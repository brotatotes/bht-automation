<p>For those priests were made [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οι μεν γαρ - εισιν ιερεις γεγονοτες] </span></span>. Rend. for they have been made priests. Lit. are priests, having become such. </p>
<p>Without an oath. Without the taking of an oath by God. Scripture says nothing of an oath of God when he appointed Aaron and his posterity to the priesthood. </p>
<p>But this with an oath [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε μετα ορκωμοσιας] </span></span>. Rend. but he with the taking of an oath. The taking of the oath accompanied [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα</span></span>] the inauguration into the priesthood. </p>
<p>That said [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγοντος] </span></span>. Better, saith. Still says, since the promise is realized in Christ 's priesthood.</p>
