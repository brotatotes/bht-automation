Scripture says nothing of an oath of God when he appointed Aaron and his posterity to the priesthood. But this with an oath [ο δε μετα ορκωμοσιας] . Rend. but he with the taking of an oath. The taking of the oath accompanied [μετα] the inauguration into the priesthood. That said [λεγοντος] . Better, saith. Still says, since the promise is realized in Christ 's priesthood.
