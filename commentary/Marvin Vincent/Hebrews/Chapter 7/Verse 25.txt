It includes every form of Christ 's identifying himself with human interests. 201 The attempt has been made to trace this idea to Philo, who alludes to the logov iJkethv the supplicant Logos, and the logov paraklhtov the advocate - Logos. But the Logos is not treated by Philo as a divine - human personality intervening for men, but as a poetical personification allegorically considered. In one instance the suppliant Logos is the cry of the oppressed Israelites; in another, Moses, as the allegorical representative of the universal reason of mankind. It represents certain functions of human reason and speech. Again, the suppliant is. the visible Cosmos striving to realize its ideal. </p>
