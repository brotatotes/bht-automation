Who needeth not daily (kaq' hJmeran). Apparently inconsistent with ch. 9 7, but the sense is, "who hath no need day by day as the high priest had (year by year) to offer sacrifices," etc. The great point is repetition, whether daily or yearly. 202 Once [εφαπαξ] . Rend. once for all. Contrasted with daily. When he offered up himself [εαυτον ανενεγκας] . A new thought. For the first time Christ appears as victim. Comp. ch. Hebrews 9:12, Hebrews 9:14; Ephesians 5:2.
