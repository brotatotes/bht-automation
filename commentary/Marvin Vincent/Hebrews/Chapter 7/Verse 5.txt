They that are of the sons of Levi who receive, etc. [οι εκ των υιων λευει λαμβανοντες] . Those out of the sons of Levi who become priests. Not those who receive the priesthood from the sons of Levi. Not all Levites were priests, but only those of the house of Aaron. The office of the priesthood [την ιερατιαν] . Only here and Luke 1:9. A commandment [εντολην] . A special injunction, See on James 2:8; Ephesians 2:15. To take tithes [αποδεκατοιν] . See on ver. 4. That is of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham. The people, the brethren of the Levites, are descended from their common ancestor, Abraham, yet the Levites exact tithes from them.
