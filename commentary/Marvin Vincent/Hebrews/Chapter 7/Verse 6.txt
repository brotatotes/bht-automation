But he whose descent is not counted from them [ο δε μη γενεαλογουμενος εξ αυτων] . Lit. he who is not genealogically derived from them : Melchisedec. The verb N. T. o. Received tithes of Abraham. Melchisedec, who has no part in the Levitical genealogy, and therefore no legal right to exact tithes, took tithes from the patriarch himself. Hence he was greater than Abraham. The right of the Levitical priest to receive tithes was only a legal right, conferred by special statute, and therefore implied no intrinsic superiority to his brethren; but Melchisedec, though having no legal right, received tithes from Abraham as a voluntary gift, which implied Abraham 's recognition of his personal greatness. And hath blessed him that had the promises. Melchisedec accepted the position accorded to him by Abraham 's gift of tithes by bestowing on Abraham his blessing, and Abraham recognized his superiority by accepting his blessing. He who had received the divine promises might have been supposed to be above being blessed by any man. The significance of this acceptance is brought out in the next verse.
