In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+40:1">Exodus 40:1</span>, where Moses is commanded to make the tabernacle, God is expressly named. </p>
<p>To make [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτελειν] </span></span>. The margin of Rev. complete may easily convey a wrong idea. The sense is to carry out or execute the plan given to him. For, See [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορα γαρ] </span></span>. Gar for is not a part of the quotation, but is argumentative. Moses was admonished, for God said "See," etc. </p>
<p>That thou make [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησεις] </span></span>. A direct command. "See, thou shalt make." Pattern [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπον] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:3">1 Peter 5:3</span>. The meaning is that, in all essential features, the Levitical system of worship was a copy of a heavenly reality. This was pressed into an absurd literalism by the Rabbins, who held that there were in heaven original models of the tabernacle and of all its appurtenances, and that these were shown to Moses in the Mount. The writer draws out of this vulgar conception the thought that the material tabernacle was an emblem of a spiritual, heavenly sanctuary. The Levitical priests, therefore, serve only a copy and shadow.</p>
