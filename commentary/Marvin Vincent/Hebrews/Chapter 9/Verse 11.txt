<p>The time of reformation introduces a higher sanctuary, a better offering, a more radical salvation. </p>
<p>Having come [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραγενομενος] </span></span>. Having appeared in the world. Only here in Hebrews, and only once in Paul. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:3">1 Corinthians 16:3</span>. Most frequent in Luke and Acts. </p>
<p>Of good things to come [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των γενομενων αγαθων] </span></span>. According to this reading the A. V. is wrong. It should be "of the good things realized," or that have come to pass. The A. V. follows the reading mellontwn about to be. So Tischendorf and Rev. T. Weiss with Westcott and Hort read genomenwn. Blessings not merely prophetic or objects of hope, but actually attained; free approach to God, the better covenant, personal communion with God, the purging of the conscience. </p>
