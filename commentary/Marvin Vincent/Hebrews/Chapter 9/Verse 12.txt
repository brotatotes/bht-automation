<p>By the blood of goats and calves [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι αιματος τραγων και μοσχων] </span></span>. Dia with, as ver. 11. Moscov originally a tender shoot or sprout : then offspring generally. Everywhere in the Bible calf or bullock, and always masculine. </p>
<p>His own blood. The distinction is not between the different bloods, but between the victims. The difference of blood is unimportant. Regarded merely as blood, Christ 's offering is not superior to the Levitical sacrifice. If Christianity gives us only the shedding of blood, even Christ 's blood, it does not give us a real or an efficient atonement. Whatever significance may attach to the blood is derived from something else. See on ver. 14. Once [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφαπαξ] </span></span>. Rend. once for all. </p>
<p>Having obtained eternal redemption [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιωνιαν λυτρωσιν ευραμενος] </span></span>. Having found and won by his act of entrance into the heavenly sanctuary. This is better than to explain " entered the sanctuary after having obtained redemption by his life, death, and resurrection "; for the work of redemption is crowned and completed by Christ 's ascension to glory and his ministry in heaven (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:0">Romans 6:0</span>). Even in the old sanctuary the rite of the Day of Atonement was not complete until the blood had been offered in the sanctuary. Eternal, see or ch. 6 2. Not mere duration is contemplated, but quality; a redemption answering in its quality to that age when all the conditions of time shall be no more : a redemption not ritual, but profoundly ethical and spiritual. Lutrwsin redemption, only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:68">Luke 1:68</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:38">Luke 2:38</span>.

<p>13 - 14. Justifying the preceding words, and answering the question, What has Christ to offer?</p>
