<p>Neither the first testament was dedicated without blood [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε η πρωτη χωρις αιματος ενκεκαινισται] </span></span>. Rend. "neither hath the first (covenant) been inaugurated without blood." There is surely no excuse for inserting testament here, as A. V., since the allusion is clearly to the ratification of a covenant with blood. But further, as this and the verses immediately following are intended to furnish a historical illustration of the statements in vers. 16, 17, we seem forced either to render covenant in those verses, or to assume that the transaction here related was the ratification of a will and testament, or to find our writer guilty of using an illustration which turns on a point entirely different from the matter which he is illustrating. Thus : a testament is of force after men are dead. It has no force so long as the testator is alive. Wherefore, the first covenant was ratified by slaying victims and sprinkling their blood.

V., and not not even, in which case the meaning would be, "not even the first covenant, although its ministries did not perfect the worshipper as touching the conscience," a thought which would be foreign to the point, which is merely the analogy in the matter of death.</p>
