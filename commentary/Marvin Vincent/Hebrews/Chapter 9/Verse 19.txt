T. account. The goat was always for a sin - offering, and the sacrifices on this occasion were oxen, and are described as burnt offerings and sacrifices of peace, Exodus 24:5.

Water, scarlet wool, hyssop - sprinkled the book [υδατος, εριου κοκκινου, υσσωπου αυτο τε το βιβλιον εραντισεν] . None of these are mentioned in the O. T. account, which the writer appears to have filled up from the details of subsequent usage. Comp. the additions in vers. 5, Hebrews 9:10It will also be observed that the sacrifices on the occasion of establishing the law covenant were not made according to the Mosaic ritual. They were offered, not by the priests, but by the young men, Exodus 24:5. For kokkinov scarlet, see on Matthew 27:6. %Usswpov hyssop appears in Exodus 12:22; Leviticus 14:4, Leviticus 14:6, Leviticus 14:49; Numbers 19:6, Numbers 19:18; Psalms 51:9; John 19:29.
