Nor yet that [ου δ ινα] . Supply did he enter. "Nor yet did he enter that he might offer," etc. He should offer himself often [πολλακις προσφερη εαυτον] . His offering did not need repetition like the Levitical sacrifices. Offer himself refers rather to Christ 's entrance into the heavenly sanctuary and presentation of himself before God, than to his offering on the cross. See on ver. 14. The sacrifice on the cross is described by paqein suffer, ver. 26, and is introduced as a distinct thought. The point is that, being once in the heavenly sanctuary, Christ was not compelled to renew often his presentation of himself there, since, in that case, it would be necessary for him to suffer often. Each separate offering would necessitate a corresponding suffering.
