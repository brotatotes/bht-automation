<p>After the second veil [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα το δευτερον καταπετασμα] </span></span>. According to <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+26:31-37">Exodus 26:31-37</span> there were two veils, the one before the door of the tent and the other before the sanctuary. After passing the first veil and entering the tent, the worshipper would see before him the second veil behind which was the holy of holies. The writer calls this also a tabernacle, ver. 2.</p>
