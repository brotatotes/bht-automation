<p>The golden censer [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρυσουν θυμιατηριον] </span></span>. The noun N. T. o. It may mean either censer or altar of incense. In LXX the altar of incense is called qusiasthrion qumiamatov <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:1">Exodus 30:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:27">Exodus 30:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+4:7">Leviticus 4:7</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:11">Luke 1:11</span>. Qumiathrion is used of a censer, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ch+26:19">2 Chronicles 26:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+8:11">Ezekiel 8:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+4:0">Ezekiel 4:0</span> Macc. 7 11. These are the only instances of the word in LXX : accordingly, never in LXX of the altar of incense. Josephus uses it for both. The golden censer is not mentioned in O. T. as a part of the furniture of the holy of holies. The facts of the case then are as follows : </p>
<p>(a) according to <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+31:0">Exodus 31:0</span> the incense - altar was in the holy place, not in the holy of holies; </p>
<p>(b) Philo and Josephus use qumiathrion for the altar of incense; 208 </p>
<p>(c) there is no mention in O. T. Of a censer set apart for the day of atonement; </p>
<p>(d) the high priest was to enter with incense, so that the ark might be veiled by the smoke (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+16:12">Leviticus 16:12</span>). Hence the censer could not have been kept in the holy of holies; </p>
<p>(e) the writer clearly speaks of an abiding - place of the qumiathrionin a particular division of the tabernacle. </p>
<p>There is evidently a discrepancy, probably owing to the fact that the writer drew his information from the O. T. by which he might have been led into error. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+26:35">Exodus 26:35</span>, there are mentioned in the holy place without the veil only the candlestick and the table, and not the incense - altar. Again, when the standing - place of the incense altar was mentioned, the expressions were open to misconstruction : see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:6">Exodus 30:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+40:5">Exodus 40:5</span>. On the day of atonement, the incense - altar, like the most holy place, was sprinkled with blood. This might have given rise to the impression that it was in the holy of holies. </p>
<p>With gold [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρυσιω] </span></span>. Properly, wrought gold. </p>
<p>Wherein [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν η] </span></span>. But according to <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:34">Exodus 16:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+17:10">Numbers 17:10</span>, neither the pot of manna nor Aaron 's rod was in the ark, but "before the testimony "; while in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:16">Exodus 25:16</span>, Moses was commanded to put only the tables of the law into the ark; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:9">1 Kings 8:9</span> it is said of the ark in the temple," there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone. " The writer follows the rabbinical tradition that the pot of manna and the rod were inside of the ark. </p>
<p>Golden pot (stamov crush). Stamov, N. T. o, a few times in LXX, rare in Class. Golden is an addition of the LXX Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:33">Exodus 16:33</span>.</p>
