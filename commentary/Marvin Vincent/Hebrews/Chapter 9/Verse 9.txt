The double relative directs attention to the emphasis which belongs to the first tabernacle. The way into the holiest was not yet manifest while the first tabernacle continued to be a recognized institution, seeing that the first tabernacle was a parable, etc. </p>
<p>A figure [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβολη] </span></span>. Outside of the Synoptic Gospels, only here and ch. 11 19. Here of a visible symbol or type.

See on these last days, ch. 1 2. jEiv for; with reference to; applying to.

The radical defect of the Levitical system was its inability to deal with the conscience, and thus bring about the "perfection" which is the ideal of true religion. That ideal contemplated the cleansing and renewal of the inner man; not merely the removal of ceremonial uncleanness, or the formal expiation of sins.
