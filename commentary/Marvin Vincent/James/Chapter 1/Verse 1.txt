Jesus Christ. Only here and in ch. 2 1; nowhere in the speeches of James (Acts 14:14, Acts 14:15; Acts 21:20 sq.). Had he used Jesus ' name it might have been supposed to arise from vanity, because he was the Lord 's brother. In all the addresses of epistles the full name, Jesus Christ, is given. Servant [δουλος] . Properly, hired servant. Compare Philippians 1:1; Jude 1:1. That are scattered abroad [εν τη διασπορα] . Lit., in the dispersion; on which see on 1 Pet Jude 1:1. Rev., which are of the dispersions. Greeting [χαιρειν] . Lit., rejoice. The ordinary Greek salutation, hail! welcome! Also used at parting : joy be with you. Compare the same expression in the letter from the church at Jerusalem, Acts 14:23; one of the very few peculiarities of style which connect this epistle with the James of the Acts. It does not occur in the address of any other of the Apostolic Epistles.
