<p>Jesus Christ. Only here and in ch. 2 1; nowhere in the speeches of James (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:14">Acts 14:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:15">Acts 14:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:20">Acts 21:20</span> sq.).

Servant [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος] </span></span>. Properly, hired servant. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:1">Jude 1:1</span>. </p>
<p>That are scattered abroad [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη διασπορα] </span></span>. Lit., in the dispersion; on which see on 1 Pet <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:1">Jude 1:1</span>. Rev., which are of the dispersions. </p>
<p>Greeting [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρειν] </span></span>. Lit., rejoice. The ordinary Greek salutation, hail! welcome! Also used at parting : joy be with you. Compare the same expression in the letter from the church at Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</span>; one of the very few peculiarities of style which connect this epistle with the James of the Acts. It does not occur in the address of any other of the Apostolic Epistles.</p>
