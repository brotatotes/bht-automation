For the sun is no sooner risen, etc. [ανετειλεν γαρ ο ηλιος] . By the use of the aorist tense James graphically throws his illustration into the narrative form : "For the sun arose - and withered," etc. With a burning heat [τω καυσωνι] . Rev., with the scorching wind. The article denotes something familiar; and the reference may be to the scorching east - wind (Job 1:19, Sept.; Ezekiel 17:10), which withers vegetation. Some of the best authorities, however, prefer the rendering of the A. V. Falleth [εξεπεσεν] . Aorist tense. Lit., fell off. The grace of the fashion [ευπρεπεια του προσωπου] . Lit., the beauty of its face or appearance. Eujprepeia only here in New Testament. Fade away [μαρανθησεται] . See on 1 Peter 1:4. Ways [πορειαις] . Rev., goings. Only here and Luke 13:22. His goings to and fro in acquiring riches.
