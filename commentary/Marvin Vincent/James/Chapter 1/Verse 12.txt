<p>Is tried [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμος γενομενος] </span></span>. Lit., having become approved. See on trial, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>. The meaning is not, as the A. V. suggests, when his trial is finished, but when he has been approved by trial. Rev., rightly, when he hath been approved. </p>
<p>The crown [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στεφανον</span></span>] . See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span>. </p>
<p>Of life [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της ζωης] </span></span>. Lit., the life : the article pointing to the well - known eternal life. The figure is not that of the athlete's crown, for an image from the Grecian games, which the Jews despised, would be foreign to James' thought and displeasing to his readers. Rather the kingly crown, the proper word for which is diadhma, diadem. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+20:3">Psalms 20:3</span> (Sept.), stefanov is used of the royal crown. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+6:11">Zechariah 6:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+6:14">Zechariah 6:14</span>, the reference seems to be to a priestly crown, forming part of the high priest 's mitre.</p>
