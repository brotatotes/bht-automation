<p>The first words of this verse form a hexameter line, thus Pasa dosiv ajgaqh kaipan dwrhma teleion Such verses, or parts of verses, occur occasionally in the New Testament. Sometimes they are quotations from the Greek poets; sometimes the writer's words unconsciously fall into metrical form. Poetical quotations are confined to Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:28">Acts 17:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:33">1 Corinthians 14:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:12">Titus 1:12</span>. Every good gift and every perfect gift (see Greek above). The statement that these gifts are from God is in pursuance of the idea that God does not tempt men to evil. The gifts of God are contrasted with the evil springing from man's lust. Two words are used for gift. Dosiv occurs only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:15">Philippians 4:15</span>; there in an active sense; but here passive, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+21:14">Proverbs 21:14</span> (Sept.). Dwrhma is found <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16">Romans 5:16</span>. It enlarges slightly upon the other word in emphasizing the gift as free, large, full; an idea which is further developed in ver. 18, of his own will. The Rev., rather awkwardly, endeavors to bring out the distinction by the word boon, for which the American Revisers insist on retaining gift. Boon originally means a petition; favor being a secondary and later sense, as of something given in response to a petition. The word is of Scandinavian origin, and the meaning favor seems to indicate a confusion with the Latin bonus, good; French, bon. Perfect. Enlarges upon good, bringing out more distinctly the moral quality of the gift. </p>
<p>And cometh down [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβαινον] </span></span>. A present participle, to be construed with anwqen ejstin, is from above. Lit., is coming down from above. As usual, this union of the participle with the finite verb denotes something habitual. Render, descendeth from above. Compare ch. 3 15. </p>
<p>Father of lights [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του πατρος των φωτων] </span></span>. Lit., the lights, by which are meant the heavenly bodies. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+135:7">Psalms 135:7</span> (Sept.); and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+4:23">Jeremiah 4:23</span> (Sept.). God is called "the Father of the lights," as being their creator and maintainer. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+38:28">Job 38:28</span>; Ps. viii. 3; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="am+5:8">Amos 5:8</span>. </p>
<p>Is no variableness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενι] </span></span>. Abbreviated from enesti is in. Stronger than the simple is, and denoting inherence or indwelling. Rev., can be. </p>
<p>Variableness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλλαγη] </span></span>. Better, Rev., variation. The word is not used, as some suppose, in a technical, astronomical sense, which James' readers would not have understood, but in the simple sense of change in the degree or intensity of light, such as is manifested by the heavenly bodies. Compare Plato, "Republic," 7, 530 : "Will he (the astronomer) not think that the heaven and the things in heaven are framed by the Creator in the most perfect manner? But when he reflects that the proportions of night and day, or of both, to the month, or of the month to the year, or of the other stars to these and to one another, are of the visible and material, he will never fall into the error of supposing that they are eternal and liable to no deviation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν παραλλαττειν</span></span>] - that would be monstrous." </p>
<p>Shadow of turning [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τροπης αποσκιασμα] </span></span>. This is popularly understood to mean that there is in God not the faintest hint or shade of change, like the phrase, a shadow of suspicion. But the Greek has no such idiom, and that is not James' meaning. Rev., rightly, renders, shadow that is cast by turning; referring still to the heavenly orbs, which cast shadows in their revolution, as when the moon turns her dark side to us, or the sun is eclipsed by the body of the moon.</p>
