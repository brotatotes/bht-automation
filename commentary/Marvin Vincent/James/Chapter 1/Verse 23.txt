<p>Beholding [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατανοουντι] </span></span>. With the notion of attentively considering (kata, down into, or through; compare eijv, into, ver. 25). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:24">Luke 12:24</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:27">Luke 12:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>. So that the contrast is not between a hasty look and a careful contemplation (ver. 25, looketh). It is not mere careless hearing of the word which James rebukes, but the neglect to carry into practice what is heard. One may be an attentive and critical hearer of the word, yet not a doer. </p>
<p>His natural face [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το προσωπον της γενεσεως] </span></span>. Lit., the countenance of his birth; the face he was born with. </p>
<p>In a glass [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εσοπτρω] </span></span>. Better, Rev., a mirror; a metallic mirror. The word occurs only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span>.</p>
