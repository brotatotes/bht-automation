The mirror is conceived as placed on a table or on the ground. Bengel quotes Wisdom of Sirach 14 23 : "He that prieth in at her (Wisdom 's) windows shall also hearken at her doors." Coleridge remarks : "A more happy or forcible word could not have been chosen to express the nature and ultimate object of reflection, and to enforce the necessity of it, in order to discover the living fountain and spring - head of the evidence of the Christian faith in the believer himself, and at the same time to point out the seat and region where alone it is to be found" (" Aphorisms "). Into [εις] . Denoting the penetration of the look into the very essence of the law. The perfect law of liberty [νομον τελειον τον της ελευθεριας] . Lit., the perfect law, the law of liberty. So Rev. The law of liberty is added as defining the perfect law. Continueth therein. Better, Rev., so continueth; i e. continues looking. Forgetful hearer [ακροατης επιλησμονης] . The latter word only here in New Testament. Lit., a hearer of forgetfulness; whom forgetfulness characterizes. Rev., very happily, a hearer that forgetteth; a rendering which gives the proper sense of forgetfulness as a characteristic better than A. V., a forgetful hearer. Doer of the work. Lit., of work, as the noun has no article. Rev., a doer that worketh. In his deed [εν τη ποιησει αυτου] . More correctly, as Rev., in his doing. Only here in New Testament. The preposition ejn (in) marks the inner connection between doing and blessedness. "The life of obedience is the element wherein the blessedness is found and consists" (Alford).
