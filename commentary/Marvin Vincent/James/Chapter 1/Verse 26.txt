Seem to be [δοκει] . Rev., correctly, thinketh himself to be. A man can scarcely seem to be religious, when, as Trench observes, "his religious pretensions are belied and refuted by the allowance of an unbridled tongue." Religious [θρησκος] . Only here in New Testament, and nowhere in classical Greek. The kindred noun qrhskeia, religion, occurs Acts 26:5; Colossians 2:18; James 1:26, James 1:27; and means the ceremonial service of religion. Herodotus (ii., 37) uses it of various observances practiced by the Egyptian priests such as wearing linen, circumcision, shaving, etc. The derivation is uncertain. Qreomai, to mutter forms of prayer, has been suggested, as the followers of Wycliffe were called Lollards, from the old Dutch lullen or lollen, to sing. Hence the adjective here refers to a zealous and diligent performance of religious services. Bridleth [χαλιναγωγων] . Used by James only. See ch. James 3:2. Lit., to guide with a bridle. So Plato, "Laws," 701 : "I think that the argument ought to be pulled up from time to time, and not to be allowed to run away, but held with bit and bridle."
