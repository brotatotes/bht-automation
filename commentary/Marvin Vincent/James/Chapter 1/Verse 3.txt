Trying [δοκιμιον] . Rev., proof; but the American Revisers insist on proving, and rightly. See on 1 Peter 1:7. Worketh [κατεργαζεται] . The compound verb with kata, down through, indicates accomplishment. The proving will work successfully and thoroughly. This harmonizes with a perfect work, ver. 4. Patience [υπομονην] . See on 2 Peter 1:6, and James 5:7.
