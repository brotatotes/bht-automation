Perfect work [εργον τελειον] . "This is followed by a perfect man. The man himself is characterized from his condition and work" (Bengel). Work [εργον] is the word with which katergazetai, worketh, is compounded. It is the accomplished result of patience in moral purification and ennobling. Compare work of faith, 1 Thessalonians 1:3. Perfect and entire [τελειοι και ολοκληροι] . The two words express different shades of thought. Teleioi, perfect, from telov, fulfillment or completion (perfect, from perfectus, per factus, made throughout), denotes that which has reached its maturity or fulfilled the end contemplated. 'Oloklhroi, from olov, entire, and klhrov, a lot or allotment; that which has all which properly belongs to it; its entire allotment, and is, therefore, intact in all its parts. Thus Peter (Acts 3:16) says of the restored cripple, " faith has given him this perfect soundness [ολοκληριαν] . Compare the familiar phrase, an accomplished man. Note, also, James' repetition of the key - words of his discourse, rejoice, joy, patience, perfect. Wanting nothing [εν μηδενι λειπομενοι] . Rev., more literally, lacking in nothing. Note James' characteristic corroboration of a positive statement by a negative clause : entire, lacking in nothing; God that giveth and upbraideth not; in faith, nothing doubting. The conditional negative mhdeni, nothing, is used, rather than the absolute negative ouJudeni, as implying nothing which may be supposed; no possible thing.
