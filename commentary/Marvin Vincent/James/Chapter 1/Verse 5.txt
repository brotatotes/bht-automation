<p>But. Omitted in A. V. In pursuing this perfection you will find yourselves lacking in wisdom. One may say, "I know not how to become perfect;" but, if any man, etc. </p>

<p>Of God that giveth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του διδοντος θεου] </span></span>. The Greek puts it so that giving is emphasized as an attribute of God. Lit., "Ask of the giving God," or of "God the giver." </p>
<p>Liberally [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απλως] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. Literally the word means simply, and this accords with the following negative clause, upbraiding not. It is pure, simple giving of good, without admixture of evil or bitterness. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span>, where a kindred noun is used : " He that giveth let him do it with simplicity [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν απλοτητι</span></span>] Compare, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+10:22">Proverbs 10:22</span>. Men often complicate and mar their giving with reproach, or by an assumption of superiority.</p>
