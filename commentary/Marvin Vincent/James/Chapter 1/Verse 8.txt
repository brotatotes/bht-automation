A double - minded man is unstable, etc. The A. V. puts this as an independent apophthegm, which is wrong. The sentence is a comment and enlargement upon that man. "Let not that man think," etc., "a doubleminded man, unstable in all his ways." So Rev. Double - minded [διψυχος] . Peculiar to James, here and ch. 4 8. Not deceitful, but dubious and undecided. Unstable [ακαταστατος] . Only here in New Testament. The kindred ajkatastasia, confusion, is found ch. 3 16, and elsewhere.
