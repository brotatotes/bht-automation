<p>Have [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχετε] </span></span>. Rev., hold, not in the sense of hold fast, cleave to, but of possessing, occupying, and practicing, as a matter of habit. Thus we say that a man holds his property by a certain tenure. A rented estate is a holding. So of an opinion, or set of opinions, with which one is publicly identified. We say that he holds thus and so. </p>
<p>With respect of persons [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν προσωπολημψιαις] </span></span>. From proswpon, the countenance, and lambanw, to receive. To receive the countenance is a Hebrew phrase. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+19:15">Leviticus 19:15</span> (Sept.) : Ouj lhyh proswpon ptwcou : Thou shalt not respect the person (receive the countenance) of the poor. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:21">Luke 20:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:11">Romans 2:11</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:16">Jude 1:16</span>. </p>
<p>The Lord of glory. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:8">1 Corinthians 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:2">Acts 7:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span>.</p>
