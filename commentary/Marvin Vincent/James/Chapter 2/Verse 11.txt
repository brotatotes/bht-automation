<p>A transgressor [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβατης] </span></span>. From para, beyond, and bainw, to go. A transgressor, therefore, is one who goes beyond the line. So, also, trespass, which is trespass, from the Latin trans, across, and passus, a step. A similar word occurs in Homer, uJperbasia, a transgression or trespass, from uJper, over, and bainw, to go.</p>
