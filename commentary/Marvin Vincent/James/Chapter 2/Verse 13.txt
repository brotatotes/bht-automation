<p>He shall have judgment without mercy that hath shewed no mercy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η γαρ κρισις ανιλεως τω μη ποιησαντι ελεος] </span></span>. Lit., as Rev., judgment is without mercy to him that hath shewed no mercy. Both A. V. and Rev. omit the article "the judgment," that, namely, which is coming. Hath shewed, or, lit., shewed (aorist tense). The writer puts himself at the stand - point of the judgment, and looks backward. </p>
<p>Rejoiceth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακαυχαται] </span></span>. The simple verb kaucaomai means to speak loud, to be loud - tongued; hence, to boast. Better, therefore, as Rev., glorieth. Judgment and mercy are personified. While judgment threatens condemnation, mercy interposes and prevails over judgment. "Mercy is clothed with the divine glory, and stands by the throne of God. When we are in danger of being condemned, she rises up and pleads for us, and covers us with her defense, and enfolds us with her wings" (Chrysostom, cited by Gloag).</p>
