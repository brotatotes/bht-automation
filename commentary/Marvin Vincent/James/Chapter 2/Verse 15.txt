<p>Be [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαρχωσιν] </span></span>. The distinction between this word and the simple einai, to be, is very subtle. The verb uJparcw originally means to make a beginning; hence, to begin or to come into being; and, though used substantially as a synonym of einai, of a thing actually existing and at hand, it has a backward look to an antecedent condition which has been protracted into the present. Thus we might paraphrase here, "If a brother or sister, having been in a destitute condition, be found by you in that condition." Einai, on the other hand, would simply state the present fact of destitution. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:8">2 Peter 1:8</span>. </p>
<p>Destitute [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λειπομενοι] </span></span>. Lit., left behind; and hence lacking, as Rev. Compare ch. 1 4, 5. This usage of the word occurs in James only. </p>
<p>Daily [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφημερου] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament.</p>
