Be [υπαρχωσιν] . The distinction between this word and the simple einai, to be, is very subtle. The verb uJparcw originally means to make a beginning; hence, to begin or to come into being; and, though used substantially as a synonym of einai, of a thing actually existing and at hand, it has a backward look to an antecedent condition which has been protracted into the present. Thus we might paraphrase here, "If a brother or sister, having been in a destitute condition, be found by you in that condition." Einai, on the other hand, would simply state the present fact of destitution. See on 2 Peter 1:8. Destitute [λειπομενοι] . Lit., left behind; and hence lacking, as Rev. Compare ch. 1 4, 5. This usage of the word occurs in James only. Daily [εφημερου] . Only here in New Testament.
