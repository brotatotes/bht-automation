<p>When he had offered [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανενεγκας] </span></span>. Incorrect. For the participle states the ground of his justification. By works gives the general ground; offered, etc., the specific work. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:16">Genesis 22:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:17">Genesis 22:17</span>. Rev., correctly, in that he offered. The word ajnenegkav is, lit., brought up to; and means, not actually to offer up in sacrifice (though Isaac was morally sacrificed in Abraham 's will), but to bring to the altar as an offering. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>.</p>
