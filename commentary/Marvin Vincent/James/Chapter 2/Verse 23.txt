Not was confirmed, which the word does not mean either in New - Testament or in classical usage, but was actually and fully realized.

<p>He was called the friend of God. The term, however, does not occur either in the Hebrew or Septuagint, though it is found in the A. V. and retained in Rev. Old Testament. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ch+20:7">2 Chronicles 20:7</span> (Sept.), thy friend tw hjgaphmenw, thy beloved. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+41:8">Isaiah 41:8</span> (Sept.), my friend is on hjgaphsa whom I loved. "The friend of God" is still the favorite title of Abraham among the Jews and Mohammedans.</p>
