Are ye not partial in yourselves? [ου διεκριθητε εν εαυτοις] . Wrong. The constant sense of the verb in the New Testament is doubt, except Acts 11:2; Jude 1:9, where it means dispute. Compare ch. 1 6. The meaning here is, therefore, that, in making a distinction between the rich and the poor, they expressed a doubt concerning the faith which they professed, and which abolished such distinctions. Hence, Rev., rightly, Are ye not divided in your own mind ? Judges of evil thoughts [κριτιαι διαλογισμων πονηρων] . Better, as Rev., "judges with evil thoughts." The form of expression is the same as in Luke 18:6, krithv thv ajdikiav, the judge of injustice, i e., the unjust judge. So James 1:25, a hearer of forgetfulness. The word thoughts is, rather, reasonings. See on deceiving yourselves (ch. 1 22). Compare Luke 5:21. Their evil processes of thought lead to these unjust discriminations.
