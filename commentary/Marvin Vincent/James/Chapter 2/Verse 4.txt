<p>Are ye not partial in yourselves? [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου διεκριθητε εν εαυτοις] </span></span>. Wrong. The constant sense of the verb in the New Testament is doubt, except <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:2">Acts 11:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:9">Jude 1:9</span>, where it means dispute. Compare ch. 1 6. The meaning here is, therefore, that, in making a distinction between the rich and the poor, they expressed a doubt concerning the faith which they professed, and which abolished such distinctions. Hence, Rev., rightly, Are ye not divided in your own mind ? </p>
<p>Judges of evil thoughts [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριτιαι διαλογισμων πονηρων] </span></span>. Better, as Rev., "judges with evil thoughts." The form of expression is the same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:6">Luke 18:6</span>, krithv thv ajdikiav, the judge of injustice, i e., the unjust judge. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:25">James 1:25</span>, a hearer of forgetfulness. The word thoughts is, rather, reasonings. See on deceiving yourselves (ch. 1 22). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:21">Luke 5:21</span>. Their evil processes of thought lead to these unjust discriminations.</p>
