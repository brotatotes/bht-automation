<p>Hearken, my beloved brethren. Alford cites this phrase as one of the very few links which connect this epistle with the speech of Jas. in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:13">Acts 14:13</span>. </p>
<p>The poor of this world [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους πτωχους του κοσμου] </span></span>. But the correct reading is tw kosmw, to the world; and the expression is to be explained in the same way as ajsteiov tw Qew, fair unto God, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:20">Acts 7:20</span>, and dunata tw Qew, mighty through (Rev., before) God, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:4">2 Corinthians 10:4</span>. So Rev., poor as to the world, in the world 's esteem. Poor, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span>. Rich in faith. The Rev., properly, inserts to be, since the words are not in apposition with poor, but express the object for which God has chosen them. Faith is not the quality in which they are to be rich, but the sphere or element; rich in their position as believers. "Not the measure of faith, in virtue of which one man is richer than another, is before the writer's mind, but the substance of the faith, by virtue of which every believer is rich" (Wiesinger, cited by Alford).</p>
