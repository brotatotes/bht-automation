<p>Despised [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητιμασατε] </span></span>. Not strong enough. They had manifested their contempt; had done despite to them. Rev., correctly, dishonored. From the use of the aorist tense, ye dishonored, which the A. V. and Rev. render as a perfect, ye have dishonored, the reference would appear to be to a specific act like that described in vv. 2, 3. </p>
<p>Oppress [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταδυναστευουσιν] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:38">Acts 10:38</span>. The preposition kata, against, implies a power exercised for harm. Compare being lords over, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:3">1 Peter 5:3</span>, and exercise dominion, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:25">Matthew 20:25</span>, both compounded with this preposition. </p>
<p>Draw [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελκουσιν] </span></span>. Not strong enough. The word implies violence. Hence, better, as Rev., drag. Compare Livy's phrase, "a lictoribus trahi, to be dragged by the lictors to judgment;" <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span>, of Saul haling or hauling men and women to prison; and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:58">Luke 12:58</span>. </p>
<p>Judgment - seats [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριτηρια] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:24">1 Corinthians 6:24</span>.</p>
