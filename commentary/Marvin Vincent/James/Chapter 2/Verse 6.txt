Despised [ητιμασατε] . Not strong enough. They had manifested their contempt; had done despite to them. Rev., correctly, dishonored. From the use of the aorist tense, ye dishonored, which the A. V. and Rev. render as a perfect, ye have dishonored, the reference would appear to be to a specific act like that described in vv. 2, 3. Oppress [καταδυναστευουσιν] . Only here and Acts 10:38. The preposition kata, against, implies a power exercised for harm. Compare being lords over, 1 Peter 5:3, and exercise dominion, Matthew 20:25, both compounded with this preposition. Draw [ελκουσιν] . Not strong enough. The word implies violence. Hence, better, as Rev., drag. Compare Livy's phrase, "a lictoribus trahi, to be dragged by the lictors to judgment;" Acts 8:3, of Saul haling or hauling men and women to prison; and Luke 12:58. Judgment - seats [κριτηρια] . Only here and 1 Corinthians 6:24.
