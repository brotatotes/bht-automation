Ye have respect to persons [προσωπολημπτειτε] . Only here in New Testament. See on ver. 1. Ye commit sin [αμαρτιαν εργαζεσθε] . Lit., "work sin." Compare Matthew 7:23; Acts 10:35; Hebrews 11:33. The phrase is rather stronger than the more common aJmartian poiein, to do sin, John 8:34; James 5:15; 1 Peter 2:29. The position of sin is emphatic : "it is sin that ye are working." And are convinced [ελεγχομενοι] . Rather, as Rev., convicted. The word, which is variously rendered in A. V. tell a fault, reprove, rebuke, convince, while it carries the idea of rebuke, implies also a rebuke which produces a conviction of the error or sin. See on John viii. 46. Compare John 3:20; John 8:9; 1 Corinthians 14:24, 1 Corinthians 14:25.
