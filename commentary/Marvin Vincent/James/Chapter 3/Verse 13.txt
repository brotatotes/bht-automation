<p>Wise and endued with knowledge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφος και επισπημων] </span></span>. A rendering needlessly verbose, yet substantially correct. Probably no very nice distinction was intended by the writer. It is somewhat difficult to fix the precise sense of sofov, since there is no uniformity in its usage in the New Testament. In classical Greek it primarily means skilled in a handicraft or art. Thence it runs into the sense of clever, in matters of common life, worldly wise. Then, in the hands of the philosophers, it acquires the sense of learned in the sciences, and, ironically, abstruse, subtle, obscure, like the English cunning, which originally meant knowing or skillful, and is often used in that sense in the English Bible (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:27">Genesis 25:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+16:16">1 Samuel 16:16</span>). </p>
<p>In the New Testament sofov is used - 1. In the original classical sense, skilled in handicraft (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:10">1 Corinthians 3:10</span>). 2. Accomplished in letters, learned (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:14">Romans 1:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:22">Romans 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:19">1 Corinthians 1:19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:26">1 Corinthians 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:18">1 Corinthians 3:18</span>). So of the Jewish theologians and doctors (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span>), and of Christian teachers (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:34">Matthew 23:34</span>). 3. In a practical sense, of the practice of the law of piety and honesty; so <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:15">Ephesians 5:15</span>, where it is joined with walking circumspectly, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:5">1 Corinthians 6:5</span>, where it is represented as the quality adapted to adjust differences in the church. 4. In the higher, philosophical sense, of devising the best counsels and employing the best means to carry them out. So of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:27">Romans 16:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:17">1 Timothy 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:25">Jude 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:25">1 Corinthians 1:25</span>. In this passage the word appears to be used in the sense of practical wisdom in pious living. </p>
<p>'Episthmwn occurs only here in the New Testament. In classical Greek it is often used like sofov, in the sense of skilled, versed; and by the philosophers in the higher sense of scientifically versed, in which sense it is opposed by Plato to doxasthv, a mere conjecturer. In this passage sofov would seem to be the broader, more general, and perhaps more dignified term of the two, as denoting the habit or quality, while ejpisthmwn indicates the special development and intelligent application of the quality to particular things. The Rev., wise and understanding, gives the distinction, on the whole, as nearly as is necessary. </p>
<p>Conversation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστροφης] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:15">1 Peter 1:15</span>. </p>
<p>Meekness of wisdom. On meekness, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:5">Matthew 5:5</span>. The meekness which is the proper attribute of wisdom. </p>
<p>"Knowledge is proud that she has learned so much, Wisdom is humble that she knows no more."</p>
