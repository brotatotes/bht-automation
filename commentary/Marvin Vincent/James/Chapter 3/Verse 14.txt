<p>Envying [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλον] </span></span>. The word is used in the New Testament both in a bad and a good sense. For the latter, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:17">John 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:2">Romans 10:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:2">2 Corinthians 9:2</span>. From it is our word zeal, which may be either good or bad, wise or foolish. The bad sense is predominant in the New Testament. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:17">Acts 5:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:20">Galatians 5:20</span>, and here, where the bad sense is defined and emphasized by the epithet bitter. It is often joined with eriv, strife, as here with ejriqeia, intriguing or faction. The rendering envying, as A. V., more properly belongs to fqonov, which is never used in a good sense. Emulation is the better general rendering, which does not necessarily include envy, but may be full of the spirit of self - devotion. Rev. renders jealousy. </p>
<p>Strife [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εριθειαν] </span></span>. A wrong rendering, founded on the mistaken derivation from eriv, strife. It is derived from eriqov, a hired servant, and means, primarily, labor for hire. Compare Tobit 2 11 : My wife did take women 's work to do [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηριθευετο] </span></span>. Thus it comes to be applied to those who serve in official positions for their own selfish interest, and who, to that end, promote party spirit and faction. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:8">Romans 2:8</span> : them that are contentious [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ εριθειας] </span></span>, lit., of faction. Rev., factious. Also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:20">2 Corinthians 12:20</span>. Rev., here, rightly, faction.</p>
