<p>Confusion [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακαταστασια] </span></span>. See on restless, ver. 8. </p>
<p>Evil [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαυλον] </span></span>. An inadequate rendering, because it fails to bring out the particular phase of evil which is dominant in the word : worthlessness, good - for - nothingness. In classical Greek it has the meanings slight, trivial, paltry, which run into bad. In the New Testament it appears in this latest stage, and is set over against good. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:20">John 3:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29">John 5:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:8">Titus 2:8</span>. Rev., vile, which, according to its etymology, Lat., vilis, follows the same process of development from cheap, or paltry, to bad.</p>
