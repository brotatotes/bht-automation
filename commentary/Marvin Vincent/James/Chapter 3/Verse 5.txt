<p>Boasteth great things [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγαλαυχει] </span></span>. The best texts separate the compound, and read megala aujcei, of course with the same meaning. Aujcei, boasteth, only here in New Testament. </p>
<p>How great a matter a little fire kindleth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλικον πυρ ηλικην υλην αναπτει] </span></span>. The word ulh (only here in New Testament) means wood or a forest, and hence the matter or raw material of which a thing is made. Later, it is used in the philosophical sense of matter - "the foundation of the manifold" - opposed to the intelligent or formative principle nouv, mind. The authorized version has taken the word in one of its secondary senses, hardly the philosophical sense it would seem; but any departure from the earlier sense was not only needless, but impaired the vividness of the figure, the familiar and natural image of a forest on fire. So Homer : </p>
<p>"As when a fire Seizes a thick - grown forest, and the wind Drives it along in eddies, while the trunks Fall with the boughs amid devouring flames." Iliad, 11, 156. </p>
<p>Hence, Rev., rightly, " Behold how much wood or how great a forest is kindled by how small a fire. </p>
<p>This, too, is the rendering of the Vulgate : quam magnum silvam.</p>
