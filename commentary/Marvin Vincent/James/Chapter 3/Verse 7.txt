Kind [φυσις] . Wrong. Jas. is not speaking of the relation between individual men and individual beasts, but of the relation between the nature of man and that of beasts, which may be different in different beasts. Hence, as Rev., in margin, nature. Beasts [θηριων] . Quadrupeds. Not beasts generally, nor wild beasts only. In Acts 28:4, Acts 28:5, the word is used of the viper which fastened on Paul 's hand. In Peter's vision (Acts 10:12; Acts 11:6) there is a different classification from the one here; quadrupeds being denoted by a specific term, tetrapoda, four - footed creatures. There qhria includes fishes, which in this passage are classed as ejnaliwn, things in the sea. By mankind [τη φυσει τη ανθρωπινη] . Rather, by the nature of man, fusiv, as before, denoting the generic character. Every nature of beasts is tamed by the nature of man. Compare the fine chorus in the "Antigone" of Sophocles, 343 - 352 : "The thoughtless tribe of birds, The beasts that roam the fields, The brood in sea - depths born, He takes them all in nets, Knotted in snaring mesh, Man, wonderful in skill. And by his subtle arts He holds in sway the beasts That roam the fields or tread the mountain 's height; And brings the binding yoke Upon the neck of horse with shaggy mane, Or bull on mountain crest, Untamable in strength."
