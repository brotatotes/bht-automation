<p>God, even the Father [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον θεον και πατερα] </span></span>. The proper reading, is ton Kurion, the Lord, and the kai, and, is simply connective. Read, therefore, as Rev., the Lord and Father. This combination of terms for God is uncommon. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:27">James 1:27</span>. </p>
<p>Which. Not who, which would designate personally certain men; whereas James designates them generically.</p>
