<p>Lusts [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδονων] </span></span>. Lit., pleasures, as Rev. Properly, sensual pleasures. The sinful pleasures are the outgrowths of the lusts, ver. 2. </p>
<p>That war [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατευομενων] </span></span>. The thought of wars and fightings is carried into the figurative description of the sensuality which arrays its forces and carries on its campaign in the members. The verb does not imply mere fighting, but all that is included in military service. A remarkable parallel occurs in Plato, "Phaedo," 66 "For whence come wars and fightings and factions ? Whence but from the body and the lusts of the body?"
