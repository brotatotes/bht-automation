Go to now [αγε νυν] . Go to is an obsolete phrase, though retained in Rev. It is a formula for calling attention : come now. Such a city [τηνδε την πολιν] . More accurately, as Rev., this city. Continue there a year [τοιησομεν εκει ενιαυτον] . Lit., we will make a year. See, for the same form of expression, Acts 14:33; Acts 18:23; 2 Corinthians 11:25. Better, as Rev., spend a year there. (Compare the A. V., Acts 18:23, rightly retained by Rev.) The word poihsomen implies more than mere continuance; rather, a doing something with the year. And. The frequent use of the copulative gives a lively tone to the passage, expressive of the lightness and thoughtlessness of a careless spirit. Buy and sell [εμπορευσομεθα] . Rev., more concisely, trade. Only here and 2 Peter 2:3.
