Whereas ye know not [οιτινες ουκ επιστασθε] . The pronoun marking a class, as being of those who know not. What shall be on the morrow [το της αυριον] . Lit., the thing of the morrow. The texts vary. Westcott and Hort read, Ye know not what your life shalt be on the morrow, for ye are a vapor : thus throwing out the question. What is your life ? [ποια] . Lit., of what kind or nature. It is even a vapor [ατμις γαρ εστιν] . But all the best texts read ejste, ye are. So Rev., which, however, retains the question, what is your life ? Appeareth - vanisheth. Both participles, appearing, vanishing. And then [επειτα και] . The kai placed after the adverb then is not copulative, but expresses that the vapor vanishes even as it appeared.
