<p>Ye rejoice [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυχασθε] </span></span>. Rev., glory. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:13">James 2:13</span>. </p>
<p>Boastings [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλαζονειαις] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:16">1 John 2:16</span>. The kindred word ajlazwn a boaster, is derived from alh, a wandering or roaming; hence, primarily, a vagabond, a quack, a mountebank. From the empty boasts of such concerning the cures and wonders they could perform, the word passed into the sense of boaster. One may boast truthfully; but ajlazoneia, is false and swaggering boasting. Rev. renders vauntings, and rightly, since vaunt is from the Latin vanus, empty, and therefore expresses idle or vain boasting. </p>
