Ye adulterers [μοιχοι] All the best texts omit. Adulteresses [μοιχαλιδες] . The feminine term is the general designation of all whom James here rebukes. The apostate members of the church are figuratively regarded as unfaithful spouses; according to the common Old Testament figure, in which God is the bridegroom or husband to whom his people are wedded. See Jeremiah 3:0; Hosea 2:3, Hosea 2:4; Isaiah 54:5; Isaiah 61:4, Isaiah 61:5. Also, Matthew 12:39; 2 Corinthians 11:2; Revelation 19:7; Revelation 21:9. Will be [βουληθη ειναι] . More correctly, as Rev., would be. Lit., may have been minded to be. Is the enemy [καθισταται] . Thereby constitutes himself. Rev., maketh himself. See on ch. James 3:6.
