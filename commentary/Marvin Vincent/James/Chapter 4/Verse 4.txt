<p>Ye adulterers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μοιχοι</span></span>] All the best texts omit. </p>
<p>Adulteresses [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μοιχαλιδες] </span></span>. The feminine term is the general designation of all whom James here rebukes. The apostate members of the church are figuratively regarded as unfaithful spouses; according to the common Old Testament figure, in which God is the bridegroom or husband to whom his people are wedded. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+3:0">Jeremiah 3:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:3">Hosea 2:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:4">Hosea 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:5">Isaiah 54:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:4">Isaiah 61:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:5">Isaiah 61:5</span>.

Will be [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουληθη ειναι] </span></span>. More correctly, as Rev., would be. Lit., may have been minded to be. </p>
<p>Is the enemy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθισταται] </span></span>. Thereby constitutes himself. Rev., maketh himself. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:6">James 3:6</span>.</p>
