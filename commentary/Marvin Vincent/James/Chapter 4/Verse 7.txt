<p>Submit yourselves [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποταγητε] </span></span>. Rev., be subject. The verb means to place or arrange under; as resist (ver. 6) is to array against. God sets himself in array against the proud; therefore, array yourselves under God, that ye may withstand the devil.</p>
