<p>Endure [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπομενοντας] </span></span>. Present participle. But the later texts read uJpomeinantav, the aorist participle, which endured; referring to the prophets in the past ages. So Rev. On endured and patience, see on ver. 7. The end of the Lord [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το τελος κυριου] </span></span>. A peculiar expression. The happy conclusion to which God brought Job's trials. </p>
<p>Very pitiful and of tender mercy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολυσπλαγχνος και οικτιρμων] </span></span>. The former adjective only here in New Testament; the latter here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:36">Luke 6:36</span>. Rev., full of pity and merciful. Polusplagcnov, is from poluv much, and splagcna the nobler entrails, used like our heart, as the seat of the emotions. Hence the term bowels in the A. V. (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:8">Philippians 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12">Colossians 3:12</span>, etc.). Compare eusplagcnoi, tender - hearted, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:32">Ephesians 4:32</span>. The distinction between this and oijktirmwn, merciful, seems to be that the former denotes the general quality of compassion, while the latter emphasizes the sympathy called out by special cases, being the feeling which is moved to pain at another's suffering.</p>
