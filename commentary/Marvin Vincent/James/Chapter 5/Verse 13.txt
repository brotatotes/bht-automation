<p>Let him sing psalms [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψαλλετω] </span></span>. The word means, primarily, to pluck or twitch. Hence of the sharp twang on a bowstring or harp - string, and so to play upon a stringed instrument. Our word psalm, derived from this, is, properly, a tune played upon a stringed instrument.
