<p>The sick [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον καμνοντα] </span></span>. Rev. gives, better, the participial force, him that is sick. The word originally means to work. Hence, "him that is laboring under disease." </p>
<p>And if he have committed sins [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καν αμαρτιας η πεποιηκως] </span></span>. The Greek gives a shade of meaning which can hardly be transferred neatly into English, representing not merely the fact that the man has sinned, but his condition as a sinner. Literally the words read, if he be having committed sins; i e., in a state of having committed, and under the moral or physical consequences of transgression. </p>
<p>They shall be forgiven [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεθησεται] </span></span>. Better, Rev., "it shall be forgiven," supplying the commission as a subject. The verb means to send forth or discharge, and is the standard New Testament word for forgiving. Forgiveness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεσις</span></span>] is a putting or sending away of sins, with a consequent discharge of the sinner; thus differing from paresiv (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>), which a passing by of sin, a pretermission as distinguished from a remission. See, farther, on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>.</p>
