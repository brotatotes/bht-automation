The sick [τον καμνοντα] . Rev. gives, better, the participial force, him that is sick. The word originally means to work. Hence, "him that is laboring under disease." And if he have committed sins [καν αμαρτιας η πεποιηκως] . The Greek gives a shade of meaning which can hardly be transferred neatly into English, representing not merely the fact that the man has sinned, but his condition as a sinner. Literally the words read, if he be having committed sins; i e., in a state of having committed, and under the moral or physical consequences of transgression. They shall be forgiven [αφεθησεται] . Better, Rev., "it shall be forgiven," supplying the commission as a subject. The verb means to send forth or discharge, and is the standard New Testament word for forgiving. Forgiveness [αφεσις] is a putting or sending away of sins, with a consequent discharge of the sinner; thus differing from paresiv (Romans 3:25), which a passing by of sin, a pretermission as distinguished from a remission. See, farther, on Romans 3:25.
