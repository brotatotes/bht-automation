Confess [εξομολογεισθε] . The preposition ejx, forth out, implies full, frank, open confession, and so in every case of its use in the New Testament. See on Matthew 3:6. Faults [παραπτωματα] . See on Matthew 6:14. The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much [πολυ ισχυει δεησις δικαιου ενεργουμενη] . Lit., much availeth (ijscuei, is strong), the prayer of a righteous man working or operating. The rendering of the A. V., besides being unwarranted by the text, is almost a truism. An effectual prayer is a prayer that avails. The Rev. is at once more correct and more natural : The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working.
