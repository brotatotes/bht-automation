<p>Confess [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξομολογεισθε] </span></span>. The preposition ejx, forth out, implies full, frank, open confession, and so in every case of its use in the New Testament. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:6">Matthew 3:6</span>. </p>
<p>Faults [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραπτωματα] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:14">Matthew 6:14</span>. </p>
<p>The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολυ ισχυει δεησις δικαιου ενεργουμενη] </span></span>. Lit., much availeth (ijscuei, is strong), the prayer of a righteous man working or operating. The rendering of the A. V., besides being unwarranted by the text, is almost a truism. An effectual prayer is a prayer that avails. The Rev. is at once more correct and more natural : The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working.</p>
