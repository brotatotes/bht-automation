A man [ανθρωπος] . The generic word; human like ourselves, this thought being emphasized by the succeeding epithet of like passions. See the same expression, Acts 14:15. Of like passions [ομοιοπαθης] . Only here and Acts 14:15. There is some danger of a misunderstanding of this rendering, from the limited and generally bad sense in which the word passions is popularly used. The meaning is rather of like nature and constitution. Rev. puts nature in margin, which would be better in the text. He prayed fervently [προσευχη προσηυξατο] . Lit., he prayed with prayer. See a similar mode of expression, Genesis 2:17 (Sept.), ye shall surely die [θανατω αποθανεισθε] ; lit., ye shall die with death. Compare Luke 22:15; John 3:29; Acts 4:17. The addition of the cognate noun gives intenseness to the verb. Hide - sins. A familiar Hebrew phrase. See Psalms 32:1; Psalms 85:2; Proverbs 10:12.
