<p>A man [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπος] </span></span>. The generic word; human like ourselves, this thought being emphasized by the succeeding epithet of like passions. See the same expression, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:15">Acts 14:15</span>. </p>
<p>Of like passions [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιοπαθης] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:15">Acts 14:15</span>. There is some danger of a misunderstanding of this rendering, from the limited and generally bad sense in which the word passions is popularly used. The meaning is rather of like nature and constitution. Rev. puts nature in margin, which would be better in the text. </p>
<p>He prayed fervently [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσευχη προσηυξατο] </span></span>. Lit., he prayed with prayer. See a similar mode of expression, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:17">Genesis 2:17</span> (Sept.), ye shall surely die [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θανατω αποθανεισθε] </span></span>; lit., ye shall die with death. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:15">Luke 22:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:29">John 3:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:17">Acts 4:17</span>. The addition of the cognate noun gives intenseness to the verb. </p>
<p>Hide - sins. A familiar Hebrew phrase. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+32:1">Psalms 32:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+85:2">Psalms 85:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+10:12">Proverbs 10:12</span>. </p>
