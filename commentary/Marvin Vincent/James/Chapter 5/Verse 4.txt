Reaped down [αμησαντων] . Only here in New Testament. The primary meaning is to reap corn; also in classical Greek of mowing down in battle. The secondary, which some mistake for the primary sense, is to gather, as for harvest. Rev., mowed. Fields [χωρας] . The more general word, place, for ajgrov, the ordinary word for a field; though the usage is warranted by classical Greek, and occurs Luke 12:16; John 4:35, the only two instances besides this in the New Testament. It implies a larger tract than ajgrov, as is evident in all the New Testament passages cited. In two cases it refers to a rich man's estates; and in John 4:35, the Lord directs the attention of the disciples to a broad area or series of fields. Crieth [κραζει] . An inarticulate cry. Compare Genesis 4:10. Lord of Sabaoth. Lord of hosts. The only instance in which the phrase is used by a New Testament writer. Romans 9:29, is quoted from Isaiah 1:9.
