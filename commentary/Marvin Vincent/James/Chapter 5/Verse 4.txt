<p>Reaped down [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμησαντων] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. The primary meaning is to reap corn; also in classical Greek of mowing down in battle. The secondary, which some mistake for the primary sense, is to gather, as for harvest. Rev., mowed. </p>
<p>Fields [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρας] </span></span>. The more general word, place, for ajgrov, the ordinary word for a field; though the usage is warranted by classical Greek, and occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:16">Luke 12:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:35">John 4:35</span>, the only two instances besides this in the New Testament. It implies a larger tract than ajgrov, as is evident in all the New Testament passages cited. In two cases it refers to a rich man's estates; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:35">John 4:35</span>, the Lord directs the attention of the disciples to a broad area or series of fields. </p>
<p>Crieth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραζει] </span></span>. An inarticulate cry. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:10">Genesis 4:10</span>. </p>
<p>Lord of Sabaoth. Lord of hosts. The only instance in which the phrase is used by a New Testament writer. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:29">Romans 9:29</span>, is quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:9">Isaiah 1:9</span>.</p>
