Ye have lived in pleasure [ετρυφησατε] . Only here in New Testament. See on 2 Peter 2:13, on the kindred noun trufh, riot or revel. Rev., ye have lived delicately. Been wanton [εσπαταλησατε] .

As in a day of slaughter [ως εν ημερα σφαγης] . All the best texts reject wJv, as. The meaning of the passage is disputed. Some find the key to it in the words last days (ver. 3). The phrase day of slaughter is used for a day of judgment, Jeremiah 12:3; Jeremiah 25:34 (Sept.). According to this, the meaning is, the day of judgment, at the supposed near coming of Christ. Others explain that these men are like beasts, which, on the very day of their slaughter, gorge themselves in unconscious security.
