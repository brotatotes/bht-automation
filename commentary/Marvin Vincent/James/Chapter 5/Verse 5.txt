<p>Ye have lived in pleasure [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετρυφησατε] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:13">2 Peter 2:13</span>, on the kindred noun trufh, riot or revel. Rev., ye have lived delicately. </p>
<p>Been wanton [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσπαταλησατε] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:6">1 Timothy 5:6</span>. </p>
<p>'Etrufhsate denotes dainty living : this word, luxurious or prodigal living. Rev., taken your pleasure, is colorless, and is no improvement on the A. V. </p>
<p>As in a day of slaughter [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως εν ημερα σφαγης] </span></span>. All the best texts reject wJv, as. The meaning of the passage is disputed. Some find the key to it in the words last days (ver. 3). The phrase day of slaughter is used for a day of judgment, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+12:3">Jeremiah 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+25:34">Jeremiah 25:34</span> (Sept.). According to this, the meaning is, the day of judgment, at the supposed near coming of Christ. Others explain that these men are like beasts, which, on the very day of their slaughter, gorge themselves in unconscious security.</p>
