<p>In Him was life [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτω ζωη ην] </span></span>. He was the fountain of life - physical, moral, and eternal - its principle and source. Two words for life are employed in the New Testament : biov and zwh. The primary distinction is that zwh means existence as contrasted with death, and biov, the period, means, or manner of existence. Hence biov is originally the higher word, being used of men, while zwh is used of animals [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωα] </span></span>. We speak therefore of the discussion of the life and habits of animals as zoology; and of accounts of men's lives as biography. Animals have the vital principle in common with men, but men lead lives controlled by intellect and will, and directed to moral and intellectual ends. In the New Testament, biov means either living, i e., means of subsistence (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:44">Mark 12:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:43">Luke 8:43</span>), or course of life, life regarded as an economy (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:14">Luke 8:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:2">1 Timothy 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:4">2 Timothy 2:4</span>). Zwh occurs in the lower sense of life, considered principally or wholly as existence (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:10">1 Peter 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:33">Acts 8:33</span>; xvi </p>
