Sheepfold [αυλην των προβατων] . Literally, fold of the sheep. So Rev., better, because the two ideas of the flock and the fold are treated distinctly. Compare ver. 16. Some other way [αλλαχοθεν] . Literally, from some other quarter. The thief does not, like the shepherd, come from some well - known direction, as from his dwelling or from the pasture, but from an unknown quarter and by a road of his own.

There is a climax in the order of the words; one who will gain his end by craft, and, if that will not suffice, by violence.
