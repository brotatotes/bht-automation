<p>Verily, verily [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμην, αμην] </span></span>. The formula never begins anything quite new, but connects what follows with what precedes. This discourse grows out of the assumption of the Pharisees to be the only authoritative guides of the people (ix. 24, 29). They have already been described as blind and sinful. </p>
<p>Sheepfold [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυλην των προβατων] </span></span>. Literally, fold of the sheep. So Rev., better, because the two ideas of the flock and the fold are treated distinctly. Compare ver. 16. </p>
<p>Some other way [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλαχοθεν] </span></span>. Literally, from some other quarter. The thief does not, like the shepherd, come from some well - known direction, as from his dwelling or from the pasture, but from an unknown quarter and by a road of his own. This from is significant, because, in the previous discourses, Jesus has laid great stress on the source from which He proceeded, and has made the difference in character between Himself and His opposers turn upon difference of origin. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:23">John 8:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:42">John 8:42</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>. In the latter part of this chapter He brings out the same thought (vv. 30, 32, 33, 36). Thief - robber [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλεπτης - ληστης] </span></span>. For the distinction see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:17">Mark 11:17</span>. There is a climax in the order of the words; one who will gain his end by craft, and, if that will not suffice, by violence.</p>
