<p>The good shepherd [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ποιμην ο καλος] </span></span>. Literally, the shepherd the good (shepherd). Kalov, though not of frequent occurrence in John, is more common than ajgaqov, good, which occurs but four times and three times out of the four in the neuter gender, a good thing, or that which is good. Kalov in John is applied to wine (ii. 10), three times to the shepherd in this chapter, and twice to works (x. 32, 33). In classical usage, originally as descriptive of outward form, beautiful; of usefulness, as a fair haven, a fair wind. Auspicious, as sacrifices. Morally beautiful, noble; hence virtue is called to kalon. The New Testament usage is similar. Outwardly fair, as the stones of the temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:5">Luke 21:5</span>) : well adapted to its purpose, as salt (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:50">Mark 9:50</span>) : competent for an office, as deacons (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:6">1 Timothy 4:6</span>); a steward (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:10">1 Peter 4:10</span>); a soldier (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:3">2 Timothy 2:3</span>) : expedient, wholesome (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:43">Mark 9:43</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:45">Mark 9:45</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:47">Mark 9:47</span>) : morally good, noble, as works (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:16">Matthew 5:16</span>); conscience (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:18">Hebrews 13:18</span>). The phrase it is good, i e., a good or proper thing (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:21">Romans 14:21</span>). In the Septuagint kalov is the most usual word for good as opposed to evil (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:17">Genesis 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+24:50">Genesis 24:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+5:20">Isaiah 5:20</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:15">Luke 8:15</span>, kalov and ajgaqov are found together as epithets of the heart; honest (or virtuous, noble) and good. The epithet kalov, applied here to the shepherd, points to the essential goodness as nobly realized, and appealing to admiring respect and affection. As Canon Westcott observes, "in the fulfillment of His work, the Good Shepherd claims the admiration of all that is generous in man." </p>
<p>Giveth his life [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ψυχην αυτου τιθησιν] </span></span>. The phrase is peculiar to John, occurring in the Gospel and First Epistle. It is explained in two ways : either (1) as laying down as a pledge, paying as a price, according to the classical usage of the word tiqhmi. So Demosthenes, to pay interest or the alien tax. Or (2) according to <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:4">John 13:4</span>, as laying aside his life like a garment. The latter seems preferable. Tiqhmi, in the sense of to pay down a price, does not occur in the New Testament, unless this phrase, to lay down the life, be so explained. 34 In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:4">John 13:4</span>, layeth aside His garments [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιδησι τα ιματια</span></span>] is followed, in ver. 12, by had taken His garments [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαβε τα ιματια] </span></span>. So, in this chapter, giveth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιδησιν</span></span>] His life (ver. 11), and I lay down [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιδημι</span></span>] my life (vv. 17, 18), are followed by labein "to take it again." The phrases thn yuchn He laid down His life, and tav yucav qeinai to lay down our lives, occur in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:16">1 John 3:16</span>. The verb is used in the sense of laying aside in the classics, as to lay aside war, shields, etc. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>, dounai thn yuchn, to give His life. </p>
