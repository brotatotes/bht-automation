My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all [ο πατηρ μου ος δεδωκε μοι, μειζων παντων εστιν] . There is considerable confusion here about the reading. Westcott and Hort and Tischendorf read oJ pathr mou (Tischendorf rejects mou) o dedwken moi pantwn meizon ejstin. That which the Father (or my Father) hath given me is greater than all. Rev. gives this in the margin. For gave, render hath given.
