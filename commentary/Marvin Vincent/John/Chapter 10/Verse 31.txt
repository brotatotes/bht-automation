<p>Took up - again [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβαστασαν - παλιν] </span></span>. Again refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:59">John 8:59</span>. It seems as though a different verb is purposely chosen here (compare hran took up, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:59">John 8:59</span>), since the interview took place in Solomon 's porch, where stones would not be at hand. The verb here may mean to take up. So Ajax says : </p>
<p>"Send some one as a messenger to bear The evil news to Teucros, that he first May lift [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασταση</span></span>] my corpse by this sharp sword transfixed." Sophocles, "Ajax," 827. </p>
<p>Its more usual meaning in the New Testament, however, is to bear or carry. So of the cross (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:17">John 19:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:27">Luke 14:27</span>). Here it might very properly be rendered brought, perhaps from the works which were then going on at the temple. See further on 12 6.</p>
