Took up - again [εβαστασαν - παλιν] . Again refers to John 8:59. It seems as though a different verb is purposely chosen here (compare hran took up, in John 8:59), since the interview took place in Solomon 's porch, where stones would not be at hand. The verb here may mean to take up. So Ajax says : "Send some one as a messenger to bear The evil news to Teucros, that he first May lift [βασταση] my corpse by this sharp sword transfixed." Sophocles, "Ajax," 827. Its more usual meaning in the New Testament, however, is to bear or carry. So of the cross (John 19:17; Luke 14:27). Here it might very properly be rendered brought, perhaps from the works which were then going on at the temple. See further on 12 6.
