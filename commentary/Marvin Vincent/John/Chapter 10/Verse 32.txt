Good works [καλα] . Beautiful, noble works, adapted to call forth admiration and respect. Compare Mark 14:6, and see on ver. 11. For which of these works [δια ποιον αυτων εργον] . Literally, for what kind of a work of these. This qualitative force of poion is not to be lost sight of, though it is impossible to render it accurately without paraphrasing. Jesus does not mean, as the A. V. and Rev. imply, "for which one of these works," but "what is the character of that particular work among all these for which you stone me?" The me, closing the sentence, is emphatic.
