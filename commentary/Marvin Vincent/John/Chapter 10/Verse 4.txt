Putteth forth [εκβαλη] . Rev., more strictly, hath put forth. Instead of leadeth out, in ver. 3. It implies a constraint; as if some of the sheep were unwilling to leave the fold. Meyer says that putteth forth pictures the manner of the leading out. He lays hold on the sheep and brings them out to the door. His own sheep [τα ιδια προβατα] . The best texts read panta, all, for probata, sheep : all his own. So Rev. Goeth before. As the Eastern shepherd always does. Having pushed them forth, he now leads them. Follow. "It is necessary that they should be taught to follow, and not stray away into the unfenced fields of wheat which lie so temptingly on either side. The shepherd calls from time to time to remind them of his presence. They know his voice and follow on; but if a stranger call, they stop, lift up their heads in alarm, and if the call is repeated, they turn and flee from him; for they know not the voice of strangers. This is not the fanciful costume of a parable; it is simple fact. I have made the experiment often" (Thomson).
