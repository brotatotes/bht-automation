<p>Parable [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παροιμιαν] </span></span>. The word occurs but once outside of John's writings (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:22">2 Peter 2:22</span>). The usual word for parable is parabolh, which is once rendered proverb in the A. V. (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:23">Luke 4:23</span>, changed to parable by Rev.), and which occurs nowhere in John. For the distinction see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:3">Matthew 13:3</span>.</p>
