<p>To Martha and Mary [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τας περι μαρθαν και μαριαν] </span></span>. </p>
<p>Literally, to those about Martha and Mary; a Greek idiom for Martha and Mary and their companions, or attendants. Compare oiJ peri Paulon, Paul and his companions (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:13">Acts 13:13</span>).

Westcott and Hort and Tregelles, however, read prov thn Marqan k. M., to Martha and Mary. So also the Revisers' text.</p>
