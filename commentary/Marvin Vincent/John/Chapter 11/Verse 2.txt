<p>Anointed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλειψασα] </span></span>. Three words for anointing are found in the New Testament : ajleifw, criw, and its compounds, and murizw. The last is used but once, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:8">Mark 14:8</span>, of anointing the Lord 's body for burying. Between the two others the distinction is strictly maintained. Criw, which occurs five times, is used in every case but one of the anointing of the Son by the Father With the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:18">Luke 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:27">Acts 4:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:38">Acts 10:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:9">Hebrews 1:9</span>). In the remaining instance (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:21">2 Corinthians 1:21</span>) of enduing Christians with the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Thus the word is confined to sacred anointing. 36 Aleifw is used of all actual anointings. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:17">Matthew 6:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:13">Mark 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:38">Luke 7:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:14">James 5:14</span>. The same distinction is generally maintained in the Septuagint, though with a few exceptions, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+3:3">Numbers 3:3</span>.</p>
