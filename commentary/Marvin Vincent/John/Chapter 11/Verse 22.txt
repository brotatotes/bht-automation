<p>Wilt ask of God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτηση τον θεον] </span></span>. The verb aijtew is used of the asking of an inferior from a superior. Erwtaw is to ask on equal terms, and hence is always used by Christ of His own asking from the Father, in the consciousness of His equal dignity. Hence Martha, as Trench observes, "plainly reveals her poor, unworthy conception of His person, that she recognizes in Him no more than a prophet, when she ascribes that asking [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτεισθαι</span></span>] to Him which He never ascribes to Himself" (" Synonyms "). Bengel says : "Martha did not speak in Greek, yet John expresses her inaccurate remark, which the Lord kindly tolerated."
