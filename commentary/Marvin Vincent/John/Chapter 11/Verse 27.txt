<p>I believe [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπιστευκα] </span></span>. Literally, I have believed. The perfect tense. So Rev. Martha goes back to her previous belief, which consists in the recognition of Christ as her Lord. Whatever faith she has in this new revelation of Christ rests upon the truth that He is the Anointed, the Son of God, even He that cometh into the world.</p>
