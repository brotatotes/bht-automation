<p>He groaned in the spirit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεβριμησατο τω πνευματι] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:43">Mark 1:43</span>. The word for groaned occurs three times elsewhere : <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:30">Matthew 9:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:43">Mark 1:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:5">Mark 14:5</span>. In every case it expresses a charge, or remonstrance, accompanied with a feeling of displeasure. On this passage there are two lines of interpretation, both of them assuming the meaning just stated. </p>
<p>(1) Tw pneu. mati, the spirit, is regarded as the object of Jesus ' inward charge or remonstrance. This is explained variously : as that Jesus sternly rebuked the natural shrinking of His human spirit, and summoned it to the decisive conflict with death; or that He checked its impulse to put forth His divine energy at once. </p>
<p>(2) Takes in the spirit, as representing the sphere of feeling, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:21">John 13:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:12">Mark 8:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span>. Some explain the feeling as indignation at the hypocritical mourning of the Jews, or at their unbelief and the sisters' misapprehension; others as indignation at the temporary triumph of Satan, who had the power of death. </p>
<p>The interpretation which explains tw pneumati as the sphere of feeling is to be preferred. Comp. ver. 38, in himself. The nature of the particular emotion of Jesus must remain largely a matter of conjecture. Rev. renders, in margin, was moved with indignation in the spirit. </p>
<p>Was troubled [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εταραξεν εαυτον] </span></span>. Literally, troubled Himself. Probably of the outward manifestation of His strong feeling.</p>
