<p>The chief priests. Of the Sadducean party. This should be constantly kept in mind in reading both John's narrative and that of the Synoptists. The Sadducees, represented by the chief priests, are the leaders in the more decisive measures against Christ. Throughout this Gospel the form of expression is either the chief priests alone, or the chief priests and the Pharisees. The only mention of the Pharisees in the history of the passion is <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:62">Matthew 27:62</span>, where also the expression is the chief priests and Pharisees. The chief priests are the deadly enemies of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:3">Matthew 26:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:14">Matthew 26:14</span>). Similarly, in the Acts, the opposition to the Christians is headed by the priests and Sadducees, who represent the same party. In the two instances where the Pharisees appear, they incline to favor the Christians (v. 34; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:6">Matthew 23:6</span>). </p>

Correctly, and not the council, which would require the article. The meaning is, they called a sitting of the Sanhedrim; probably as distinguished from a formal meeting of that body. </font></p>
<p>What do we? The present tense, indicating an emergency. This man is at work teaching and working miracles, and what are we doing?</p>
