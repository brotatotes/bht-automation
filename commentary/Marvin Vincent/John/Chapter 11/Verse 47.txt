The only mention of the Pharisees in the history of the passion is Matthew 27:62, where also the expression is the chief priests and Pharisees. The chief priests are the deadly enemies of Christ (Matthew 26:3, Matthew 26:14).

In the two instances where the Pharisees appear, they incline to favor the Christians (v. 34; Matthew 23:6). John 11:47A council [συνεδριον] .
