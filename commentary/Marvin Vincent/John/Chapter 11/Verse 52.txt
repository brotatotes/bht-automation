<p>Nation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνους] </span></span>. John does not used the word laov, people, which Caiaphas had just employed. The Jews were no longer a people, only one of the nations of the world. He wishes to set the Gentiles over against the Jews, and this distinction was national. Moreover, John points out in this word the fact that the work of Christ was not to be for any people as specially chosen of God, but for all nations.</p>
