Branches of palms [τα βαια των φοινικων] . The A. V. overlooks both the articles, the branches of the palms. baia occurs only here in the New Testament, and means palm branches, or, strictly, tops of the palms where the fruit is produced. Of the palms may have been added by John for readers unacquainted with the technical term, but the expression palm branches of the palms, is similar to housemaster of the house (oijkodespothv thv oijkiav, Luke 22:11). The articles are commonly explained as marking the trees which were by the wayside on the route of the procession. Some think that they point to the well - known palm branches connected with the Feast of Tabernacles. On the different terms employed by the Evangelists for "branches," see on Mark 11:8. To meet [εις υπαντησιν] . Very literally, to a going to meet. Cried [εκραζον] . Imperfect, kept crying as he advanced. Hosanna. Meaning O save ! Blessed [ευλογημενος] . A different word from the blessed of Matthew 5:3 [μακαριος] . This is the perfect participle of the verb eujlogew, to speak well of, praise, hence our eulogy. Matthew's word applies to character; this to repute. The ascription of praise here is from Psalms 118:25, Psalms 118:26. This Psalm, according to Perowne, was composed originally for the first celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles after the completion of the sacred temple. The words of the twenty - fifth verse were sung during that feast, when the altar of burnt - offering was solemnly compassed; that is, once on each of the first six days of the feast, and seven times on the seventh day. This seventh day was called "the Great Hosanna," and not only the prayers for the feast, but even the branches of trees, including the myrtles which were attached to the palm branch, were called "Hosannas."
