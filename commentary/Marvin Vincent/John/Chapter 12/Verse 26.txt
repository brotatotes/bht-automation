<p>My Father. Rev., rightly, the Father. "Very much of the exact force of St. John's record of the Lord 's words appears to depend upon the different conceptions of the two forms under which the fatherhood of God is described. God is spoken of as 'the Father ' and as 'my Father. ' Generally it may be said that the former title expresses the original relation of God to being, and specially to humanity, in virtue of man's creation in the divine image; and the latter more particularly the relation of the Father to the Son incarnate, and so indirectly to man in virtue of the incarnation. The former suggests those thoughts which spring from the consideration of the absolute moral connection of man with God; the latter, those which spring from what is made known to us through revelation of the connection of the incarnate Son with God and with man. 'The Father ' corresponds, under this aspect, with the group of ideas gathered up in the Lord 's titles, 'the Son" 'the Son of man; ' and 'my Father ' with those which are gathered up in the title 'the Son of God, ' 'the Christ ' " (Westcott).</p>
