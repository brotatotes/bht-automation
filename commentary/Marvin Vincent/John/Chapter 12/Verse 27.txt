My soul. See reff. on ver. 25. The soul, yuch, is the seat of the human affections; the spirit [πνευμα] of the religious affections. Is troubled [τεταρακται] . The perfect tense; has been disturbed and remains troubled. The same verb as in John 11:33. Notice that there it is said He groaned in the spirit [τω πνευματι] . His inward agitation did not arise from personal sorrow or sympathy, but from some shock to His moral and spiritual sense. What shall I say? A natural expression out of the depths of our Lord 's humanity. How shall I express my emotion? Some commentators connect this with the following clause, shall I say, Father, save me, etc. But this does not agree with the context, and represents a hesitation in the mind of Jesus which found no place there. 41 Save me. The shrinking from suffering belongs to the human personality of our Lord (compare Matthew 39); but the prayer, save me from this hour, is not for deliverance from suffering, but for victory in the approaching trial. See Hebrews 5:7. The expression is very vivid. "Save me out of this hour." For this cause. Explained by glorify thy name. For this use, namely, that the Father 's name might be glorified.
