<p>My soul. See reff. on ver. 25. The soul, yuch, is the seat of the human affections; the spirit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span>] of the religious affections. </p>
<p>Is troubled [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεταρακται] </span></span>. The perfect tense; has been disturbed and remains troubled. The same verb as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:33">John 11:33</span>. Notice that there it is said He groaned in the spirit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω πνευματι] </span></span>. His inward agitation did not arise from personal sorrow or sympathy, but from some shock to His moral and spiritual sense. </p>
<p>What shall I say? A natural expression out of the depths of our Lord 's humanity. How shall I express my emotion? Some commentators connect this with the following clause, shall I say, Father, save me, etc. But this does not agree with the context, and represents a hesitation in the mind of Jesus which found no place there. 41 Save me. The shrinking from suffering belongs to the human personality of our Lord (compare Matthew 39); but the prayer, save me from this hour, is not for deliverance from suffering, but for victory in the approaching trial. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span>. The expression is very vivid. "Save me out of this hour." </p>
<p>For this cause. Explained by glorify thy name. For this use, namely, that the Father 's name might be glorified.</p>
