<p>Among the chief rulers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και εκ των αρχοντων] </span></span>. Rev., more neatly and accurately, even of the rulers. </p>
<p>Believed on Him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευσαν εις αυτον] </span></span>. See on 1 12. It is to be noted that John here uses of this imperfect faith which refused to complete itself in confession, the formula for complete faith. Compare believed in His name (ii. 23), and see note there. </p>
<p>Confess Him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωμολογουν] </span></span>. The Him, or, Rev., it, is not in the text. The verb is used absolutely. They did not make confession. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23">Matthew 7:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:32">Matthew 10:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:7">Matthew 14:7</span>. </p>
<p>Lest they should be put out of the synagogue [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη αποσυναγωγοι γενωνται] </span></span>. Better, that they should not be, etc. Compare Rev., ver. 35. On the phrase, be put out of the synagogue, see on 9 22.</p>
