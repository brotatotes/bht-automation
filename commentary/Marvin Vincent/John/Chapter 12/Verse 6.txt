<p>And had the bag, and bare what was put therein [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και το γλωσσοκομον ειχε, και τα βαλλομενα εβασταζεν] </span></span>. The best texts read ecwn, having, and omit the second kai and. The rendering would then be, and having the bag bare, etc. </p>
<p>The bag [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γλωσσοκομον] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:29">John 13:29</span>. Originally a box for keeping the mouth - pieces of wind instruments. From glwssa, tongue, and komew, to tend. The word was also used for a coffin. Josephus applies it to the coffer in which the golden mice and emerods were preserved (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+6:11">1 Samuel 6:11</span>). In the Septuagint, of the chest which Joash had provided for receiving contributions for the repairing of the Lord 's house (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:8">2 Chronicles 24:8</span>). Rev. gives box, in margin. </p>
<p>Bare [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβασταζεν] </span></span>. Carried away or purloined. This meaning is rather imparted by the context than residing in the verb itself, i e., according to New Testament usage (see on 10 21). Unquestionably it has this meaning in later Greek, frequently in Josephus. 39 Render, therefore, as Rev., took away. The rendering of the A. V. is tautological.</p>
