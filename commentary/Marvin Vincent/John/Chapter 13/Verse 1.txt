<p>Before the Feast of the Passover. This clause is to be construed with hjgaphsen, loved, at the close of this verse. Notice that John, in mentioning the Passover, here drops the explanatory phrase of the Jews (xi. 55). It is not the Passover of the Jews which Jesus is about to celebrate, which had degenerated into an empty form, but the national ordinance, according to its true spirit, and with a development of its higher meaning. </p>
<p>Knowing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδως] </span></span>. Or, since he knew. </p>
<p>His hour. See on 12 23, and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:4">John 2:4</span>. </p>
<p>That [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα] </span></span>. In order that; marking the departure as a divine decree. Depart [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταβη] </span></span>. The compounded preposition meta, signifies passing over from one sphere into another. </p>
<p>His own [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους ιδιους] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:7">Acts 1:7</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:6">John 17:6</span> sqq.; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:23">Acts 4:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:23">Acts 24:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:8">1 Timothy 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span>. </p>
<p>He loved [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγαπησεν] </span></span>. Notice that John uses the word indicating the discriminating affection : the love of choice and selection. See on 5 20. Unto the end [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τελος] </span></span>. Interpretations differ. The rendering of the A. V. and Rev. is of doubtful authority. The passages cited in support of this, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:22">Matthew 10:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:13">Matthew 24:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:13">Mark 13:13</span>, may all be rendered to the uttermost. Morever, other formulas are used where the meaning to the end is unquestionable. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+2:26">Revelation 2:26</span>, the only other instance in John's writings where telov is used in an adverbial phrase the expression is acri telouv, unto the end. Similarly <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:11">Hebrews 6:11</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6">Hebrews 3:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:14">Hebrews 3:14</span>, mecri telouv, unto the end. The phrase may mean at last, and so is rendered by many here, as Meyer, Lange, Thayer (Lex.). "At last He loved them;" that is, showed them the last proof of His love. This is the most probable rendering in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:5">Luke 18:5</span>, on which see note. It may also mean to the uttermost, completely. So Westcott and Godet. But I am inclined, with Meyer, to shrink from the "inappropriate gradation" which is thus implied, as though Jesus ' love now reached a higher degree than before [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπησας] </span></span>. Hence I prefer the rendering at last, or finally He loved them, taking hjgaphsen, loved, in the sense of the manifestation of His love. This sense frequently attaches to the verb. See, for instance, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:10">1 John 4:10</span> (" love viewed in its historic manifestation " Westcott), and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:4">Ephesians 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:2">Ephesians 5:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:25">Ephesians 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:16">2 Thessalonians 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9">Revelation 3:9</span>.</p>
