He that is washed - wash his feet [ο λελουμενος - νιψασθαι] . The A. V. obliterates the distinction between louw, to bathe, to apply water to the whole body, and niptw, to wash a part of the body. Thus, when Dorcas died (Acts 9:37) they bathed her body [λουσαντες] . The proverb in 2 Peter 2:22, is about the sow that has been bathed all over [λουσαμενη] . On the other hand, he who fasts must wash [νιψαι] his face (Matthew 6:17). Both verbs are always used of living beings in the New Testament. The word for washing things, as nets, garments, etc., is plunw. See Luke 5:2. All three verbs occur in Leviticus 14:11 (Sept.).
