<p>He that is washed - wash his feet [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λελουμενος - νιψασθαι] </span></span>. The A. V. obliterates the distinction between louw, to bathe, to apply water to the whole body, and niptw, to wash a part of the body. Thus, when Dorcas died (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:37">Acts 9:37</span>) they bathed her body [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λουσαντες] </span></span>. The proverb in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:22">2 Peter 2:22</span>, is about the sow that has been bathed all over [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λουσαμενη] </span></span>. On the other hand, he who fasts must wash [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νιψαι</span></span>] his face (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:17">Matthew 6:17</span>). Both verbs are always used of living beings in the New Testament. The word for washing things, as nets, garments, etc., is plunw. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:2">Luke 5:2</span>. All three verbs occur in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+14:11">Leviticus 14:11</span> (Sept.).</p>
