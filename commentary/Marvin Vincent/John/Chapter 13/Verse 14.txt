<p>Ought [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφειλετε] </span></span>. The verb means to owe. It occurs several times in John's Epistles (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:6">1 John 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:16">1 John 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:11">1 John 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:8">3 John 1:8</span>). In the Gospel only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:7">John 19:7</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:10">Luke 17:10</span>. In Matthew's version of the Lord 's prayer occur the two kindred words ojfeilnma, debt, and ojfeilethv, debtor. Jesus here puts the obligation to ministry as a debt under which His disciples are laid by His ministry to them. The word ought is the past tense of owe. Dei, ought or must (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:7">John 3:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:14">John 3:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:30">John 3:30</span>, etc.) expresses an obligation in the nature of things; ojfeilein, a special, personal obligation.</p>
