<p>Supper being ended [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειπνου γενομενου] </span></span>. The most approved reading is ginomenou, the present participle, denoting while a supper was in progress. Hence Rev., rightly, during supper. The A. V. is wrong, even if the reading of the Received Text be retained; for in ver. 12 Jesus reclined again, and in ver. 26, the supper is still in progress. It should be, supper having begun, or having been served. 42 It is important to note the absence of the definite article : a supper, as distinguished from the feast, which also is designated by a different word. </p>
<p>Having now put [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη βεβληκοτος] </span></span>. Rev., better, already. Put, is literally, thrown or cast. </p>
<p>Into the heart of Judas. Meyer, strangely, refers the heart, not to Judas, but to the Devil himself; rendering, the Devil having already formed the design that Judas should deliver Him up. Godet does not speak too strongly when he says that "this meaning is insufferable." 43</p>
