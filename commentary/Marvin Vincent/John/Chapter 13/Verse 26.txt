<p>Sop [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψωμιον] </span></span>. Only in this chapter. Diminutive from ywmov, a morsel, which, in turn, is from yaw, to rub, or to crumble. Homer, of the Cyclops : </p>
<p>"Then from his mouth came bits [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψωμοι</span></span>] of human flesh Mingled with wine." " Odyssey, " 9, 374. </p>
<p>And Xenophon : "And on one occasion having seen one of his companions at table tasting many dishes with one bit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψωμω</span></span>] of bread" (" Memorabilia, "3 14, 15). The kindred verb ywmizw, rendered feed, occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:20">Romans 12:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:3">1 Corinthians 13:3</span>. See also Septuagint, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+79:5">Psalms 79:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+80:16">Psalms 80:16</span>. According to its etymology, the verb means to feed with morsels; and it was used by the Greeks of a nurse chewing the food and administering it to an infant. So Aristophanes :" And one laid the child to rest, and another bathed it, and another fed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εψωμισεν</span></span>] it "(" Lysistrate," 19, 20). This sense may possibly color the word as used in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:20">Romans 12:20</span> : "If thine enemy hunger, feed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψωμιζε</span></span>] him;" with tender care. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:3">1 Corinthians 13:3</span>, the original sense appears to be emphasized : "Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψωμισω] </span></span>." This idea is that of doling away in morsels. Dean Stanley says : "Who that has witnessed the almsgiving in a Catholic monastery, or the court of a Spanish or Sicilian bishop 's or archbishop's palace, where immense revenues are syringed away in farthings to herds of beggars, but must feel the force of the Apostle 's half satirical ywmisw?" Dipped the sop. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:23">Matthew 26:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:20">Mark 14:20</span>. The regular sop of the Paschal supper consisted of the following things wrapped together : flesh of the Paschal lamb, a piece of unleavened bread, and bitter herbs. The sauce into which it was dipped does not belong to the original institution, but had been introduced before the days of Christ. According to one authority it consisted of only vinegar and water (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ru+2:14">Ruth 2:14</span>); others describe it as a mixture of vinegar, figs, dates, almonds, and spice. The flour which was used to thicken the sauce on ordinary occasions was forbidden at the Passover by the Rabbins, lest it might occasion a slight fermentation. According to some, the sauce was beaten up to the consistence of mortar, in order to commemorate the toils of the Israelites in laying bricks in Egypt. </p>
