Had given [δεδωκεν] . The best texts read edwken, gave, the aorist marking Jesus ' commission as given once for all. Was come [εξηλθε] . This rendering would require the perfect tense. The aorist points to His coming as a historic fact, not as related to its result. See on 12 47. Rev., rightly, came forth. Went [υπαγει] . Present tense : goeth; withdrawing from the scenes of earth. Note the original order : that it was from God He came forth, and unto God He is going.
