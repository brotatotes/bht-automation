<p>Little children [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνια] </span></span>. Diminutive, occurring only here in the Gospel, but repeatedly in the First Epistle. Nowhere else in the New Testament. </p>
<p>Now [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτι] </span></span>. In ver. 31, now is nun, which marks the point of time absolutely. Arti marks the point of time as related to the past or to the future. Thus, "from the days of John the Baptist until now" (arti, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:12">Matthew 11:12</span>). "Thinkest thou that I cannot now [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτι</span></span>] pray to my Father ?" though succor has been delayed all along till now (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:53">Matthew 26:53</span>). Here the word implies that the sorrowful announcement of Jesus ' departure from His disciples had been withheld until the present. The time was now come.</p>
