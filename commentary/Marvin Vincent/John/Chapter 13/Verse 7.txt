Knowest - shalt know [οιδας - γνωση] . The A. V. ignores the distinction between the two words. "Thou knowest not" [ουκ οιδας] , of absolute and complete knowledge. Thou shalt learn or perceive [γνωση] , of knowledge gained by experience. See on 2 24. Hereafter [μετα ταυτα] . Literally, after these things.
