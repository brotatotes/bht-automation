<p>Knowest - shalt know [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδας - γνωση] </span></span>. The A. V. ignores the distinction between the two words. "Thou knowest not" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ οιδας] </span></span>, of absolute and complete knowledge. Thou shalt learn or perceive [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωση] </span></span>, of knowledge gained by experience. See on 2 24. </p>
<p>Hereafter [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα ταυτα] </span></span>. Literally, after these things.</p>
