<p>Heart [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρδια] </span></span>. Never used in the New Testament, as in the Septuagint, of the mere physical organ, though sometimes of the vigor and sense of physical life (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:17">Acts 14:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:5">James 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:34">Luke 21:34</span>). Generally, the center of our complex being - physical, moral, spiritual, and intellectual. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:30">Mark 12:30</span>. The immediate organ by which man lives his personal life, and where that entire personal life concentrates itself. It is thus used sometimes as parallel to yuch, the individual life, and to pneuma the principle of life, which manifests itself in the yuch. Strictly, kardia is the immediate organ of yuch, occupying a mediating position between it and pneuma. In the heart [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρδια</span></span>] the spirit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα] </span></span>, which is the distinctive principle of the life or soul [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη] </span></span>, has the seat of its activity. Emotions of joy or sorrow are thus ascribed both to the heart and to the soul. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:27">John 14:27</span>, "Let not your heart [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρδια</span></span>] be troubled;" and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:27">John 12:27</span>, "Now is my soul [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span>] troubled." The heart is the focus of the religious life (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:37">Matthew 22:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:45">Luke 6:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:22">2 Timothy 2:22</span>). It is the sphere of the operation of grace (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:19">Matthew 13:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:15">Luke 8:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:32">Luke 24:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:37">Acts 2:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:9">Romans 10:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:10">Romans 10:10</span>). Also of the opposite principle (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:2">John 13:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:3">Acts 5:3</span>). Used also as the seat of the understanding; the faculty of intelligence as applied to divine things (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:15">Matthew 13:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21">Romans 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:17">Mark 8:17</span>). Ye believe - believe also [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευετε και πιστευετε] </span></span>. The verbs may be taken either as indicatives or as imperatives. Thus we may render : ye believe in God, ye believe also in me; or, believe in God and ye believe in me; or, believe in God and believe in me; or again, as A. V. The third of these renderings corresponds best with the hortatory character of the discourse.</p>
