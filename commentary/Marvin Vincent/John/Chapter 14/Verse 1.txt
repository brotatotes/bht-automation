Heart [καρδια] . Never used in the New Testament, as in the Septuagint, of the mere physical organ, though sometimes of the vigor and sense of physical life (Acts 14:17; James 5:5; Luke 21:34). Generally, the center of our complex being - physical, moral, spiritual, and intellectual. See on Mark 12:30. The immediate organ by which man lives his personal life, and where that entire personal life concentrates itself. It is thus used sometimes as parallel to yuch, the individual life, and to pneuma the principle of life, which manifests itself in the yuch. Strictly, kardia is the immediate organ of yuch, occupying a mediating position between it and pneuma. In the heart [καρδια] the spirit [πνευμα] , which is the distinctive principle of the life or soul [ψυχη] , has the seat of its activity. Emotions of joy or sorrow are thus ascribed both to the heart and to the soul. Compare John 14:27, "Let not your heart [καρδια] be troubled;" and John 12:27, "Now is my soul [ψυχη] troubled." The heart is the focus of the religious life (Matthew 22:37; Luke 6:45; 2 Timothy 2:22). It is the sphere of the operation of grace (Matthew 13:19; Luke 8:15; Luke 24:32; Acts 2:37; Romans 10:9, Romans 10:10). Also of the opposite principle (John 13:2; Acts 5:3). Used also as the seat of the understanding; the faculty of intelligence as applied to divine things (Matthew 13:15; Romans 1:21; Mark 8:17). Ye believe - believe also [πιστευετε και πιστευετε] . The verbs may be taken either as indicatives or as imperatives. Thus we may render : ye believe in God, ye believe also in me; or, believe in God and ye believe in me; or, believe in God and believe in me; or again, as A. V. The third of these renderings corresponds best with the hortatory character of the discourse.
