<p>Will manifest [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμφανισω] </span></span>. Properly, of manifestation to the sight, as distinguished from dhlow, to make evident to the mind (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:13">1 Corinthians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:8">Colossians 1:8</span>, etc.).
