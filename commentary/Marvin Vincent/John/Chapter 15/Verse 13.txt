Greater love hath no man than this, that [ινα] . Some of the more subtle phases of John's thought cannot be apprehended without a careful study of this often - recurring conjunction. It is still claimed by some grammarians that it is used to mark, not only design and end, but also result. 50 But it may fairly be claimed that its predominant sense is intent, purpose, purport, or object. Hence that, as representing ina, is to be taken in the sense of to the end or intent that; in order that. Here the use of the word is very subtle and suggestive, as well as beautiful. No man hath greater love than this (love), which, in its original conception, was intended and designed to reach to the extent of sacrificing life for a friend. Christ, therefore, here gives us more than a mere abstract comparison and more than a merely human gauge of love. He measures love according to its divine, original, far - reaching intent.
