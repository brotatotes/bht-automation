<p>I command [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντελλομαι] </span></span>. Of several words for command in the New Testament, this one is always used of giving a specific injunction or precept. The kindred noun, ejntolh, means an order, a charge, a precept and hence is used of a separate precept of the law as distinguished from the law as a whole [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νομος] </span></span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:36">Matthew 22:36</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:38">Matthew 22:38</span>. It is, however, sometimes used of the whole body of the moral precepts of Christianity. See on 13 34. The sense of specific commands here falls in with the reading of the Rec. Text, osa, whatsoever, literally, as many things as.</p>
