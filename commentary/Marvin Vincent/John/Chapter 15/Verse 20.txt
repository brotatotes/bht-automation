Persecuted [εδιωξαν] . The verb means originally to put to flight; thence to run swiftly in order to overtake or attain, as the goal or the competitor in the race.

Thus Wyc, Matthew 5:44, for men pursuing you. Sir Thomas More (" Utopia ")," Whiles their enemies rejoicing in the victory have persecuted (i. e., pursued) them. "
