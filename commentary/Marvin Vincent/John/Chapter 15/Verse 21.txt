<p>For my name's sake [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια το ονομα μου] </span></span>. Literally, on account of my name. The name of Christ represented the faith, the attitude, the claims, and the aim of the disciples. His name was their confession. Luther says : "The name of Christ from your mouth will be to them nothing but poison and death."</p>
