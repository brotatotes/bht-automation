<p>Had sin [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτιαν ειχον] </span></span>. See on 9 41; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8">1 John 1:8</span>. </p>
<p>Cloke [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφασιν] </span></span>. From pro, before, in front of, and fhmi, to say or affirm. Hence something which is placed in front of the true cause of a thing, a pretext. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:5">1 Thessalonians 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:30">Acts 27:30</span>. Pretext carries the same idea, Latin, proetextum, something woven in front, with a view to concealment or deception. Rev., excuse. Wyc, excusation. The A. V. follows Tyndale : nothing to cloke their sin withal. Latimer (" Sermons ") : "By such cloaked charity, when thou dost offend before Christ but once, thou hast offended twice herein." The word appears in the low Latin cloca, a bell (compare the French cloche, and English clock), and the name was given to a horseman's cloak because of its resemblance to a bell. The word palliate is from the Latin pallium, a cloak.</p>
