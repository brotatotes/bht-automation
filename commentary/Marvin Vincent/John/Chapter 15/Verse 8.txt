<p>Herein [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τουτω] </span></span>. Commonly referred to what follows. My Father is glorified in this, namely, that ye bear much fruit. It is better to refer it back to ver. 7. In the perfect unity of will between the Son and the disciple, which results in the disciple 's obtaining whatever he asks, the Father is glorified. To this effect is <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:13">John 14:13</span>, "Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son." The design of this glorification is that [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>] you may bear much fruit. This retrospective reference of ejn toutw, in this, or herein, occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:37">John 4:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:30">John 16:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:17">1 John 4:17</span>. </p>
<p>Is glorified [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοξασθη] </span></span>. The aorist tense; was glorified. As in ver. 6, marking the point when the Father 's glory was realized in the perfect union of the believer 's will with Christ 's. </p>
<p>So shall ye be [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και γενησεσθε] </span></span>. Literally, and ye shall become. Some editors, however, read genhsqe, and connect, in the same construction with the preceding clause, rendering, "Herein is (was) my Father glorified, that ye might bear much fruit and become my disciples." Note that the word is become, not be. Christian discipleship implies progress and growth.</p>
