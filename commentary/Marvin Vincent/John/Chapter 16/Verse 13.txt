Spirit of truth. Literally, of the truth. See on 14 7. Will guide [οδηγησει] . From oJdov, way, and hJgeomai, to lead. The kindred noun, oJdhgov, guide, leader, occurs Matthew 14:14; Acts 1:16, etc. Into all truth [εις πασαν την αληθειαν] . Rev., more correctly, into all the truth. Some editors read, ejn th ajlhqeia pash, in all the truth. Others, eijv thn ajlhqeian pasan, joining pasan in an adverbial sense with will guide you : i e., will guide you wholly into the truth. The Spirit does not reveal all truth to men, but He leads them to the truth as it is in Christ. Of himself. Rev., rightly, from himself. See on 7 17. He shall hear [αν ακουση] . Some read, ajkouei, heareth, and omit an, the conditional particle. %Osa an ajkoush, the reading of the Rec. Text, is, strictly, whatsoever things he may have heard. Will shew [αναγγελει] . Better, as Rev., declare. Compare Mark 5:14, Mark 5:19; Acts 20:27; 2 Corinthians 7:7. Also to rehearse; Acts 14:27. Used of the formal proclamation of the Christian religion (Acts 20:20; 1 Peter 1:12; 1 John 1:5). See on Acts 19:18. Things to come [τα ερχομενα] . The article, omitted by A. V., is important. The meaning is not, He will show you some things to come, but the things that are to come, or the things that are coming. These things are whatsoever He shall hear. The phrase occurs only here in the New Testament.
