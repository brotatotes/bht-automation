<p>Weep - lament - be sorrowful [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαυσετε - θρηνησετε - λυπηθησεσθε] </span></span>. Of these three words, the last is the most general in meaning, expressing every species of pain, of body or of soul, and not necessarily the outward manifestation of sorrow. Both the other words denote audible expressions of grief. Qrhnew marks the more formal expression. It means to utter a dirge over the dead. Thus Homer, of the mourning over Hector in Troy : </p>
<p>"On a fair couch they laid the corse, and placed Singers beside it leaders of the dirge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θρηνων] </span></span>, Who sang [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθρηνεον</span></span>] a sorrowful, lamenting strain, And all the women answered it with sobs." </p>
<p>"Iliad," 24 720 - 722. </p>
