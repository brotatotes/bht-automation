<p>Ye shall ask [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερωτησετε] </span></span>. Or, as Rev., in margin, ask - question. To question is the primary meaning of the verb, from which it runs into the more general sense of request, beseech. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:26">Mark 7:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:38">Luke 4:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span>, etc. Here the meaning is, ye shall ask me no question (compare ver. 19, where the same verb is used). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:13">Matthew 16:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:24">Matthew 21:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>. Ask, absolutely, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:68">Luke 22:68</span>. Note, moreover, the selection of the word here as marking the asking on familiar terms. See on 11 22. Another verb for ask occurs in the following sentence : "If ye shall ask [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτηστητε</span></span>] anything," etc. Here the sense is, if ye shall make any request. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:42">Matthew 5:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7">Matthew 7:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:9">Matthew 7:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:10">Matthew 7:10</span>, etc. Note, also, that this word for asking the Father marks the asking of an inferior from a superior, and is the word which Christ never uses of His own requests to the Father. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:22">1 John 3:22</span>. </p>
<p>Verily, verily. See on 1 51; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1">John 10:1</span>. </p>
<p>Whatsoever ye shall ask - in my name - give. The best texts change osa an, whatsoever, to ant, if (ye shall ask) anything; and place in my name after give it you. So Rev. If ye shall ask anything of the Father, He will give it you in my name. Not only is the prayer offered, but the answer is given in Christ 's name.</p>
