These words [ταυτα] . Literally, these things. So Rev. Said. John nowhere says that Jesus prayed, as the other Evangelists do. Thy Son - thy Son [σου τον υιον - ο υιος] . Properly, thy Son - the Son. The second phrase marks a change from the thought of personal relationship to that of the relation in which Jesus manifests the Father 's glory.
