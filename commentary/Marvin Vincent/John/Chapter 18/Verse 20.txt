<p>In the synagogue [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη συναγωγη] </span></span>. The best texts omit the article. Render, in synagogue : when the people were assembled. Like our phrase, in church. </p>
<p>Always resort [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντοτε συνερχονται] </span></span>. For pantote always, read pantev all. Sunercontai is rather come together, assemble. Rev., where all the Jews come together.</p>
