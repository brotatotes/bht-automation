<p>Struck - with the palm of his hand [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκε ραπισμα] </span></span>. Literally, gave a blow. Interpreters differ as to whether it was a blow with a rod, or with the hand. The kindred verb rJapizw, from rJapiv, a rod, is etymologically related to rJabdizw, from rJabdov, a rod, and occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:39">Matthew 5:39</span>, of smiting on the cheek, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:67">Matthew 26:67</span>, where it is distinguished from kolafizw, to strike with the fist. This latter passage, however, leaves the question open, since, if the meaning to smite with a rod can be defended, there is nothing to prevent its being understood there in that sense. The earlier meaning of the word was, undoubtedly, according to its etymology, to smite with a rod. So Herodotus of Xerxes. "It is certain that he commanded those who scourged [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραπι. ζοντας</span></span>] the waters (of the Hellespont) to utter, as they lashed them, these barbarian and wicked words" (vii. 35). And again : "The Corinthian captain, Adeimantus, observed, 'Themistocles, at the games they who start too soon are scourged [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραπιζονται] </span></span>'" (viii. 59). It passes, in classical Greek, from this meaning to that of a light blow with the hand. The grammarian Phrynichus (A. D. 180) condemns the use of the word in the sense of striking with the hand, or slapping, as not according to good Attic usage, and says that the proper expression for a blow on the cheek with the open hand is ejpi korrhv pataxai. This shows that the un - Attic phrase had crept into use. In the Septuagint the word is clearly used in the sense of a blow with the hand. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:6">Isaiah 50:6</span> : "I gave my cheeks to blows [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ραπι. σματα] </span></span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ho+11:4">Hosea 11:4</span>," As a man that smiteth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραπιζων</span></span>] upon his cheeks "(A. V. and Rev., that take off the yoke on their jaws). In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:24">1 Kings 22:24</span>, we read," Zedekiah - smote Micaiah on the cheek [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαταξε επι την σιαγονα] </span></span>. "The word in ver. 23, dereiv, literally, flayest, hence, do beat or thrash (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:47">Luke 12:47</span>), seems better to suit the meaning strike with a rod; yet in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:20">2 Corinthians 11:20</span>, that verb is used of smiting in the face [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις προσωπον δερει] </span></span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27">1 Corinthians 9:27</span>, where Paul is using the figure of a boxer, he says," So fight I (pukteuw, of boxing, or fighting with the fists), not as one that beateth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δερων</span></span>] the air. " These examples practically destroy the force of the argument from dereiv. It is impossible to settle the point conclusively; but, on the whole, it seems as well to retain the rendering of the A. V. and Rev. 52</p>
