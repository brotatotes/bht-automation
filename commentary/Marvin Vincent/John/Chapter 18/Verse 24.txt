<p>Annas had sent [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστειλεν ο αννας] </span></span>. The best texts insert oun, therefore. The rendering of the aorist by the pluperfect here is inadmissible, and is a device to bring this examination of Jesus into harmony with that described in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:56-68">Matthew 26:56-68</span>, and to escape the apparent inconsistency between the mention of the high - priest [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιαπηασ</span></span>] as conducting this examination and the statement of ver. 13, which implies that this was merely a preliminary examination before Annas. Render, Annas therefore sent him. </p>
<p>Bound. Probably He had been unbound during His examination.</p>
