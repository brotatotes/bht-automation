Truth. Not with the article as in the previous verse, the truth. Jesus meant the absolute truth : Pilate, truth in any particular case. "Pilate 's exclamation is neither the expression of an ardent thirst for truth, nor that of the despair of a soul which has long sought it in vain; it is the profession of a frivolous skepticism, such as is frequently met with in the man of the world, and especially in the statesman" (Godet). Fault [αιτιαν] . Properly, cause of accusation. Rev., crime. See on Matthew 27:37, and compare on Matthew 19:10. 39, 40. Compare Matthew 27:15-26; Mark 6:15.
