Scourged [εμαστιγωσεν] . Matthew and Mark use the Greek form of the Latin word flagellare, fragellow, which occurs only in those two instances in the New Testament. John uses the more common Greek word, though he has fragellion (flagellum), scourge, at John 2:15. Matthew and Mark, however, both use mastigow elsewhere (Matthew 10:17; Matthew 20:29; Mark 10:34). Its kindred noun, mastix, occurs several times in the metaphorical sense of a plague. See on Mark 3:10, and compare Mark 5:29, Mark 5:34; Luke 7:21. The verb is used metaphorically only once, Hebrews 12:6. Scourging was the legal preliminary to crucifixion, but, in this case, was inflicted illegally before the sentence of crucifixion was pronounced, with a view of averting the extreme punishment, and of satisfying the Jews. (Luke 23:22). The punishment was horrible, the victim being bound to a low pillar or stake, and beaten, either with rods, or, in the case of slaves and provincials, with scourges, called scorpions, leather thongs tipped with leaden balls or sharp spikes. The severity of the infliction in Jesus ' case is evident from His inability to bear His cross.
