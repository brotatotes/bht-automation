<p>That saying [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτον τον λογον] </span></span>. The best texts read twn logwn toutwn, these words. He was afraid of an accusation at Rome before Tiberius, an accusation which could be justified by his misrule. </p>
<p>Judgment - seat [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βηματος] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:5">Acts 7:5</span>. The best texts omit the article, which may indicate that the tribunal was an improvised one. The Pavement [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθοστρωτον] </span></span>. From liqov, stone, and strwtov, strewn or spread. </p>
<p>Gabbatha. From the Hebrew gab, "back," and meaning, therefore, a raised place. Thus the Aramaic term is not a translation of the Greek term, which indicates that the place, wherever it was, was distinguished by a mosaic or tessellated pavement. Suetonius relates that Julius Caesar used to carry about with him on his expeditions a portable tessellated pavement for his tribunal. It is not likely, however, that there is any allusion to such a practice here. Westcott explains Gabbatha as the ridge of the house.</p>
