<p>Four parts. All the Synoptists relate the parting of the garments. The four pieces to be divided would be, the head - gear, the sandals, the girdle, and the tallith or square outer garment with fringes.

Over the tunic which covered the body to the hands and feet, a blue tallith with the blue and white fringes on the four ends, so thrown over and gathered together that the gray, red - striped undergarment was scarcely noticeable, except when the sandal - shod feet came into view" (" A Day in Capernaum "). </p>
