Four parts. All the Synoptists relate the parting of the garments. The four pieces to be divided would be, the head - gear, the sandals, the girdle, and the tallith or square outer garment with fringes. Delitzsch thus describes the dress of our Lord : "On His head He wore a white sudar, fastened under the chin and hanging down from the shoulders behind. Over the tunic which covered the body to the hands and feet, a blue tallith with the blue and white fringes on the four ends, so thrown over and gathered together that the gray, red - striped undergarment was scarcely noticeable, except when the sandal - shod feet came into view" (" A Day in Capernaum "). Coat [χιτωνα] . Or tunic. See on Matthew 5:40. Without seam [αρραφος, ορ αραφος] . Only here in the New Testament. From aj, not, and rJaptw, to sew together. Like the tunic of the High - Priest. Only John records this detail. Woven [υφαντος] . Only here in the New Testament.
