<p>Vinegar. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:48">Matthew 27:48</span>. </p>
<p>Hyssop. Matthew and Mark have kalamw, a reed. Luke says merely that they offered Him vinegar. The vinegar mingled with gall (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:34">Matthew 27:34</span>), or the wine mingled with myrrh (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:23">Mark 14:23</span>) was offered to Jesus before his crucifixion as a stupefying draught. The hyssop gives a hint of the height of the cross, as the greatest length of the hyssop reed was not more than three or four feet. The vinegar in this case was offered in order to revive Christ. John does not mention the stupefying draught.</p>
