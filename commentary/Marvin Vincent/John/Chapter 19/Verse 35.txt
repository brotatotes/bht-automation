<p>He that saw it bare record [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εωρακως μεμαρτυρηκεν] </span></span>. Rev., rendering the perfect tense in both verbs, he that hath seen hath born witness. This can refer only to the writer of this Gospel. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>. </p>
<p>True [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθινη] </span></span>. Genuine, according to the true ideal of what testimony should be. See on 1 9. </p>
<p>And he [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακεινος] </span></span>. This pronoun is urged by some as a reason for regarding the witness as some other than John, because it is the pronoun of remote reference. But <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:37">John 9:37</span> shows clearly that a speaker can use this pronoun of himself; and it is, further, employed in this Gospel to indicate a person "as possessing the quality which is the point in question in an eminent or even exclusive degree" (Godet). See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:39">John 5:39</span>. </p>
<p>True [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθη] </span></span>. Literally, true things. As distinguished from false. Thus, by the use of the two words for true, there are brought out, as Westcott remarks, "the two conditions which testimony ought to satisfy; the first, that he who gives it should be competent to speak with authority; and the second, that the account of his experience should be exact."</p>
