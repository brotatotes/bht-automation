A disciple of Jesus. Matt. calls him a rich man; Mark, an honorable counselor, i e., a member of the Sanhedrim; and Luke, a counselor, good and just. Besought [ηρωτησε] . Better, as Rev., asked. See on 11 22; John 16:23. Mark adds that he went in boldly, which is suggestive in view of John's statement of his secret discipleship, a fact which is passed over by the Synoptists. Gave him leave. According to Roman law. Ulpian, a Roman jurist of the third century, says : "The bodies of those who are capitally punished cannot be denied to their relatives. At this day, however, the bodies of those who are executed are buried only in case permission is asked and granted; and sometimes permission is not given, especially in the cases of those who are punished for high treason. The bodies of the executed are to be given for burial to any one who asks for them." Avaricious governors sometimes sold this privilege. Cicero, in one of his orations against Verres, has a terribly graphic passage describing such extortions. After dwelling upon the tortures inflicted upon the condemned, he says : "Yet death is the end. It shall not be. Can cruelty go further? A way shall be found. For the bodies of the beheaded shall be thrown to the beasts. If this is grievous to parents, they may buy the liberty of burial" (v. 45). Compare Matthew 14:12; Acts 8:2.
