<p>Have well drunk [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεθυσθωσι] </span></span>. Wyc., be filled. Tynd., be drunk. The A. V. and Tynd. are better than the Rev. when men have drunk freely. The ruler of the feast means that when the palates of the guests have become less sensitive through indulgence, an inferior quality of wine is offered. In every instance of its use in the New Testament the word means intoxication. The attempt of the advocates of the unfermented - wine theory to deny or weaken this sense by citing the well - watered garden (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+58:11">Isaiah 58:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:12">Jeremiah 31:12</span>) scarcely requires comment. One might answer by quoting Plato, who uses baptizesqai, to be baptized, for being drunk (" Symposium, " 176). In the Septuagint the verb repeatedly occurs for watering (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+65:9">Psalms 65:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+65:10">Psalms 65:10</span>), but always with the sense of drenching or soaking; of being drunken or surfeited with water.

The metaphorical use of the word has passed into common slang, as when a drunken man is said to be wetted or soaked (so Plato, above). The figurative use of the word in the Septuagint has a parallel in the use of potizw, to give to drink, to express the watering of ground. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:6">Genesis 2:6</span>, a mist watered the face of the earth, or gave it drink.

A curious use of the word occurs in Homer, where he is describing the stretching of a bull's hide, which, in order to make it more elastic, is soaked [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεθυουσαν</span></span>] with fat (" Iliad, " 17 390). </p>
<p>Worse [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελασσω] </span></span>. Literally, smaller. Implying both worse and weaker. Small appears in the same sense in English, as small - beer. </p>
