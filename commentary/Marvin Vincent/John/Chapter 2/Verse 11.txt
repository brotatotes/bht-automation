<p>This beginning. Or, more strictly, this as a beginning. </p>
<p>Of miracles [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειων] </span></span>. Rev., correctly, signs. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:20">Matthew 11:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>. This act was not merely a prodigy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τερας] </span></span>, nor a wonderful thing (qaumasion), nor a power [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις] </span></span>, but distinctively a sign, a mark of the doer's power and grace, and divine character. Hence it falls in perfectly with the words manifested His glory. </p>
<p>Believed on Him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευσαν εις αυτον] </span></span>. See on 1 12. Literally, believed into. Canon Westcott most aptly says that it conveys the idea of "the absolute transference of trust from one's self to another."</p>
