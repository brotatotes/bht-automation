The Jews ' passover. On John's use of the term Jews, see on 1 19. So it is used here with an under - reference to the national religion as consisting in mere ceremonies. The same hint underlies the words in ver. 6, "after the Jews ' manner of purifying." Only John mentions this earliest passover of Christ 's ministry. The Synoptists relate no incident of his ministry in Judaea, and but for the narrative of John, it could not be positively asserted that Jesus went up to Jerusalem during His public life until the time of His arrest and crucifixion.
