The temple [ιερω] . The temple inclosure : not the sanctuary [ναοξ] . See on Matthew 9:5; Mark 11:16. Those that sold [τους πωλουντας] . The article defines them as a well - known class. Changers of money [κερματιστας] . Only here in the New Testament. The kindred noun kerma, money, which occurs only in ver. 15, is from keirw, to cut into bits, and means therefore small coin; "small change," of which the money - changers would require a large supply. Hence changers of money means, strictly, dealers in small change. Matthew and Mark use lubisthv (see ver. 15), of which the meaning is substantially the same so far as regards the dealing in small coin; but with the difference that kollubov, the noun from which it is derived, and meaning a small coin, is also used to denote the rate of exchange. This latter word therefore gives a hint of the premium on exchange, which John's word here does not convey. The money - changers opened their stalls in the country towns a month before the feast. By the time of the first arrivals of passover - pilgrims at Jerusalem, the country stalls were closed, and the money - changers sat in the temple (see on Matthew 17:24; Matthew 21:12; Mark 11:15). John's picture of this incident is more graphic and detailed than those of the Synoptists, who merely state summarily the driving out of the traders and the overthrow of the tables. Compare Matthew 21:12, Matthew 21:13; Mark 11:15-17; Luke 19:45, Luke 19:46. Luke 19:21
