<p>A scourge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φραγελλιον] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. Only John records this detail. </p>
<p>Of small cords [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ σχοινιων] </span></span>. The Rev. omits small, but the word is a diminutive of scoinov, a rush, and thence a rope of twisted rushes. The A. V. is therefore strictly literal. Herodotus says that when Croesus besieged Ephesus, the Ephesians made an offering of their city to Diana, by stretching a small rope [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχοινιον</span></span>] from the town wall to the temple of the goddess, a distance of seven furlongs (i. 26). The schoene was an Egyptian measure of length, marked by a rush - rope. See Herodotus, 2 6. Some find in this the etymology of skein. </p>
<p>Drove out [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεβαλεν] </span></span>. Literally, as Rev., cast out. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:34">Matthew 10:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:35">Matthew 12:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:12">Mark 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:25">James 2:25</span>. </p>
<p>All. Referring to the animals. The A. V. makes the reference to the traders; but Rev., correctly, "cast all out - both the sheep and the oxen." </p>
<p>Money. See on ver. 14. </p>
<p>Tables. Wyc., turned upside down the boards. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:23">Luke 19:23</span>.</p>
