A scourge [φραγελλιον] . Only here in the New Testament. Only John records this detail. Of small cords [εκ σχοινιων] . The Rev. omits small, but the word is a diminutive of scoinov, a rush, and thence a rope of twisted rushes. The A. V. is therefore strictly literal. Herodotus says that when Croesus besieged Ephesus, the Ephesians made an offering of their city to Diana, by stretching a small rope [σχοινιον] from the town wall to the temple of the goddess, a distance of seven furlongs (i. 26). The schoene was an Egyptian measure of length, marked by a rush - rope. See Herodotus, 2 6. Some find in this the etymology of skein. Drove out [εξεβαλεν] . Literally, as Rev., cast out. See on Matthew 10:34; Matthew 12:35; Mark 1:12; James 2:25. All. Referring to the animals. The A. V. makes the reference to the traders; but Rev., correctly, "cast all out - both the sheep and the oxen." Money. See on ver. 14. Tables. Wyc., turned upside down the boards. See on Luke 19:23.
