<p>It was written [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγραμμενον εστιν] </span></span>. Literally, it stands written. This form of the phrase, the participle with the substantive verb, is peculiar to John in place of the more common gegraptai. For a similar construction see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:21">John 3:21</span>. </p>
<p>The zeal of thine house. Jealousy for the honor of God 's house. Zeal, zhlov, from zew, to boil. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:14">James 3:14</span>. </p>
<p>Hath eaten me up [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεφαγε με] </span></span>. So the Sept., <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:0">Psalms 68:0</span> (A. V., 69 9). But the best texts read katafagetai, shall eat up. So Rev., Wyc., "The fervor of love of thine house hath eaten me."</p>
