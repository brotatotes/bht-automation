It was written [γεγραμμενον εστιν] . Literally, it stands written. This form of the phrase, the participle with the substantive verb, is peculiar to John in place of the more common gegraptai. For a similar construction see John 3:21. The zeal of thine house. Jealousy for the honor of God 's house. Zeal, zhlov, from zew, to boil. See on James 3:14. Hath eaten me up [κατεφαγε με] . So the Sept., Psalms 68:0 (A. V., 69 9). But the best texts read katafagetai, shall eat up. So Rev., Wyc., "The fervor of love of thine house hath eaten me."
