<p>Answered. Often used in reply to an objection or criticism, or to something present in another's mind, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:7">John 19:7</span>, or <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:3">John 3:3</span>, where Jesus answers with reference to the error in Nicodemus ' mind, rather than in direct reply to his address. </p>
<p>Destroy this temple [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυσατε τον ναον τουτον] </span></span>. Destroy, Literally, loosen. Wyc., undo. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:2">Mark 13:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:12">Luke 9:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:38">Acts 5:38</span>. Notice that the word for temple is naon, sanctuary (see on ver. 14). This temple points to the literal temple, which is truly a temple only as it is the abode of God, hence sanctuary, but with a typical reference to Jesus ' own person as the holy dwelling - place of God who "was in Christ." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:17">1 Corinthians 3:17</span>. Christ 's death was therefore the pulling down of the temple, and His resurrection its rebuilding. The imperative in destroy is of the nature of a challenge.
