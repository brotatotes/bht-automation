Answered. Often used in reply to an objection or criticism, or to something present in another's mind, as John 19:7, or John 3:3, where Jesus answers with reference to the error in Nicodemus ' mind, rather than in direct reply to his address. Destroy this temple [λυσατε τον ναον τουτον] . Destroy, Literally, loosen. Wyc., undo. See on Mark 13:2; Luke 9:12; Acts 5:38. Notice that the word for temple is naon, sanctuary (see on ver. 14). This temple points to the literal temple, which is truly a temple only as it is the abode of God, hence sanctuary, but with a typical reference to Jesus ' own person as the holy dwelling - place of God who "was in Christ." Compare 1 Corinthians 3:16, 1 Corinthians 3:17. Christ 's death was therefore the pulling down of the temple, and His resurrection its rebuilding. The imperative in destroy is of the nature of a challenge. Compare fill ye up, Matthew 23:32.
