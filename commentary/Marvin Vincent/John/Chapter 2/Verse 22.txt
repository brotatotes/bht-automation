<p>Was risen [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγερθη] </span></span>. Rev., more correctly, was raised. The same verb as in vv. 19, 20. </p>
<p>Had said [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγεν] </span></span>. Rev., more correctly, He spake. The best texts omit unto them. </p>
<p>Believed the Scripture [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευσαν τη γραφη] </span></span>. Notice that ejpioteusan, believed, is used here with the simple dative, and not with the preposition eijv, into (see on 1 12). The meaning is, therefore, they believed that the Scripture was true. On grafh, a passage or section of Scripture, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:10">Mark 12:10</span>. </p>
<p>In John, as elsewhere, the word almost always refers to a particular passage cited in the context. The only two exceptions are <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:12">John 17:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:9">John 20:9</span>. For the Old Testament, as a whole, John always uses the plural aiJ grafai The passage referred to here is probably <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:10">Psalms 16:10</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:27">Acts 2:27</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:31">Acts 2:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:35">Acts 13:35</span>. </p>
<p>The word. The saying just uttered concerning the destruction of the temple.</p>
