But Jesus [αυτος δε ο ιησους] . The aujtov, which does not appear in translation, has the force of on His part, marking the contrast with those just mentioned. Did not commit [ουκ επιστευτεν] . Rev., trust. There is a kind of word - play between this and ejpisteusan, believed, in the preceding verse. Wyc. reproduces it : "Jesus himself believed not himself to them." He did not trust His person to them. Tynd., put not himself in their hands. "He had no faith in their faith" (Godet). Because He knew [δια το αυτον γινωσκειν] . Literally, on account of the fact of His knowing. John describes the Lord 's knowledge by two words which it is important to distinguish. Ginwskein, as here, implies acquired knowledge; knowledge which is the result of discernment and which may be enlarged. This knowledge may be drawn from external facts (v. 6; John 6:15) or from spiritual sympathy (x. 14, 27; John 17:25). EiJudenai (i. 26) implies absolute knowledge : the knowledge of intuition and of satisfied conviction. Hence it is used of Christ 's knowledge of divine things (iii. 11; John 5:32; John 7:29), Of the facts Of His own being (vi. 6; John 8:14; John 13:1), and of external facts (vi. 61, 64; John 13:11). In John 21:17 the two words appear together. Peter says to Jesus, appealing to His absolute knowledge, "Thou knowest [οιδας] all things :" appealing to his discernment, "Thou knowest or perceivest [γινωσκεις] that I love Thee."
