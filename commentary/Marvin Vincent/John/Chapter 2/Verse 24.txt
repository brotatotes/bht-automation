<p>But Jesus [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος δε ο ιησους] </span></span>. The aujtov, which does not appear in translation, has the force of on His part, marking the contrast with those just mentioned. </p>
<p>Did not commit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ επιστευτεν] </span></span>. Rev., trust. There is a kind of word - play between this and ejpisteusan, believed, in the preceding verse. Wyc. reproduces it : "Jesus himself believed not himself to them." He did not trust His person to them. Tynd., put not himself in their hands. "He had no faith in their faith" (Godet). </p>
<p>Because He knew [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια το αυτον γινωσκειν] </span></span>. Literally, on account of the fact of His knowing. John describes the Lord 's knowledge by two words which it is important to distinguish. Ginwskein, as here, implies acquired knowledge; knowledge which is the result of discernment and which may be enlarged. This knowledge may be drawn from external facts (v. 6; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:15">John 6:15</span>) or from spiritual sympathy (x. 14, 27; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:25">John 17:25</span>). EiJudenai (i. 26) implies absolute knowledge : the knowledge of intuition and of satisfied conviction. Hence it is used of Christ 's knowledge of divine things (iii. 11; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:32">John 5:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:29">John 7:29</span>), Of the facts Of His own being (vi. 6; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:14">John 8:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span>), and of external facts (vi. 61, 64; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:11">John 13:11</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:17">John 21:17</span> the two words appear together. Peter says to Jesus, appealing to His absolute knowledge, "Thou knowest [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδας</span></span>] all things :" appealing to his discernment, "Thou knowest or perceivest [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκεις</span></span>] that I love Thee."</p>
