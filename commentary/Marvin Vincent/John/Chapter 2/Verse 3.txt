<p>They wanted wine [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υστερησαντος οινου] </span></span>. Literally, when the wine failed. So Rev., Wyc., and wine failing. Some early authorities read : "they had no wine, for the wine of the marriage was consumed." Marriage festivals sometimes lasted a whole week (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+29:27">Genesis 29:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:14">Jude 1:14</span>:15; Tobit 9 12; 10 1). </p>
<p>They have no wine. Implying a request for help, not necessarily the expectation of a miracle.</p>
