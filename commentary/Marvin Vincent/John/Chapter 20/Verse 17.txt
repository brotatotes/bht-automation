<p>Touch me not [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη μου απτου] </span></span>. The verb, primarily, means to fasten to. Hence it implies here, not a mere momentary touch, but a clinging to. Mary thought that the old relations between her Lord and herself were to be renewed; that the old intercourse, by means of sight, sound, and touch, would go on as before. Christ says, "the time for this kind of intercourse is over. Henceforth your communion with me will be by faith through the Spirit. This communion will become possible through my ascending to the Father." </p>
<p>My Father. The best texts omit the pronoun and read the Father. See on 12 26. This expression, emphasizing the relation of God to humanity rather than to Christ himself, is explained by what follows - "my Father and your Father." </p>
<p>My brethren. The word brethren, applied to the disciples, occurs before (vii. 3, 5, 10), but not the phrase my brethren, which follows from my Father and your Father. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:10">Matthew 28:10</span>. </p>
<p>I ascend [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινω] </span></span>. The present tense is used, not in the sense of the near future, but implying that He had already entered upon that new stage of being which the actual ascension formally inaugurated. The resurrection was really the beginning of the ascension.</p>
