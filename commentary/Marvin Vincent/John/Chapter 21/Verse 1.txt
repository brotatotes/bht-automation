<p>Shewed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφανερωσεν] </span></span>. This rendering might easily convey merely the sense of appearing; but its meaning is much deeper. Occurring frequently in the New Testament, it is used most frequently of God and Christ, or of men in their relation to these. Thus, of Christ in person while upon earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:12">Mark 16:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:14">Mark 16:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:31">John 1:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2">1 John 1:2</span>). Of the works of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:3">John 9:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:5">1 John 3:5</span>). Of Christ in redemption (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:5">1 John 3:5</span>). Of Christ in His second coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:28">1 John 2:28</span>). Of Christ in glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:4">Colossians 3:4</span>). It is used of God. Of His revelation to men of the knowledge of Himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:19">Romans 1:19</span>). Of His manifestation in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>). Of His righteousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:21">Romans 3:21</span>). Of His love (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:9">1 John 4:9</span>). It is used of men. As epistles manifesting the character and spirit of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:3">2 Corinthians 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:11">2 Corinthians 5:11</span>). In the judgment (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span>). In all these cases the appearing is not merely an appeal to sense, but is addressed to spiritual perception, and contemplates a moral and spiritual effect. It is the setting forth of the law or will or character of God; of the person or work of Christ; of the character or deeds of men, with a view to the disclosure of their quality and to the producing of a moral impression. Rev., manifested. </p>
