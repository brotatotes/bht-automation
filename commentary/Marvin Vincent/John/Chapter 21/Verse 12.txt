<p>Dine [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αριστησατε] </span></span>. Rather, breakfast. In Attic Greek ariston signified the mid - day meal; the evening meal being known as deipnon. The regular hour for the ariston cannot be fixed with precision. The drift of authority among Greek writers seems to be in favor of noon. The meal described here, however, evidently took place at an earlier hour, and would seem to have answered more nearly to the ajkratisma, or breakfast of the Greeks, which was taken directly upon rising. Plutarch, however, expressly states that both names were applied to the morning meal, and says of Alexander, "He was accustomed to breakfast [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηριστα</span></span>] at early dawn, sitting, and to sup [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδειπνει</span></span>] late in the evening." In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:4">Matthew 22:4</span>, it is an ariston to which the king's wedding - guests are invited. Ask [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξετα. σαι] </span></span>. Rev., inquire. Implying careful and precise inquiry. It occurs only three times in the New Testament; of Herod 's command to search diligently for the infant Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:8">Matthew 2:8</span>), and of the apostles ' inquiring out the worthy members of a household (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:11">Matthew 10:11</span>).</p>
