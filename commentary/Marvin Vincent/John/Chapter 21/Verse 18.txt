<p>Young [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεωτερος] </span></span>. Literally, younger. Peter was apparently of middle age. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:14">Matthew 8:14</span>. </p>
<p>Thou girdedst thyself [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζωννυες σεαυτον] </span></span>. The word may have been suggested by Peter's girding his fisher's coat round him. The imperfect tense signifies something habitual. Thou wast wont to clothe thyself and to come and go at will. </p>
<p>Walkedst [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεπατεις] </span></span>. Literally, walkedst about. Peculiarly appropriate to describe the free activity of vigorous manhood. </p>
<p>Stretch forth thy hands. The allusion to the extending of the hands on the cross, which some interpreters have found here, is fanciful. It is merely an expression for the helplessness of age. </p>
<p>Whither thou wouldest not. According to tradition Peter suffered martyrdom at Rome, and was crucified with his head downward.</p>
