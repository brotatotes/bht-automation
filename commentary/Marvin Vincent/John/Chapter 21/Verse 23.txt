<p>Should not die [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ αποθνησκει] </span></span>. Literally, dieth not. </p>
<p>24, 25. Many interpreters think that these two verses were written by some other hand than John's. Some ascribe vv. 24 and 25 to two different writers. The entire chapter, though bearing unmistakable marks of John's authorship in its style and language, was probably composed subsequently to the completion of the Gospel. </p>
