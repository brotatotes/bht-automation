<p>Was come [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενης] </span></span>. The best texts read the present participle, ginomenhv, is coming. Rev., when day was now breaking. The A. V. does not agree so well with the fact that Jesus was not at once recognized by the disciples, owing in part, perhaps, to the imperfect light. </p>
<p>On the shore [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τον αιγιαλον] </span></span>. Rev., beach. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:2">Matthew 13:2</span>. The preposition eijv, to, makes the phrase equivalent to "Jesus came to the beach and stood there."</p>
