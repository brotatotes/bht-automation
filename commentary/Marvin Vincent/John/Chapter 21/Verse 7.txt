Fisher's coat [επενδυτην] . An upper garment or blouse. Only here in the New Testament. In the Septuagint, 1 Samuel 18:4, the robe which Jonathan gave to David. 2 Samuel 13:18, the royal virgin garment of Tamar. The kindred verb, ejpenduomai, occurs twice (2 Corinthians 5:2, 2 Corinthians 5:4), meaning "to be clothed upon," with the house which is from heaven, i e., clothed as with an upper garment. See on that passage. Naked. Not absolutely, but clothed merely in his undergarment or shirt.
