<p>Art thou a master of Israel [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ ει ο διδασκαλος του ισραηλ] </span></span>. The su, thou, is emphatic. A master is more correctly rendered by Rev., the teacher. Not ironical, but the article marks Nicodemus ' official relation to the people, and gives additional force to the contrast in the following words. Similarly Plato : "Will you (su, emphatic), O professor of true virtue, pretend that you are justified in this?" (" Crito, "51). On" Israel, " see on 1 47. The word occurs four times in John's Gospel; here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:31">John 1:31</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:49">John 1:49</span>. </p>
<p>Knowest not [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γινωσκεις] </span></span>. See on 2 24. Nicodemus is not reproved for the want of previous knowledge, but for the want of perception or understanding when these truths are expounded to him. Rev., better, understandest not.</p>
