<p>We speak - we know - we have seen. After the use of the singular number in vv. 3, 5, 7, 12, the plural here is noteworthy. It is not merely rhetorical - "a plural of majesty" - but is explained by ver. 8, "every one that is born of the Spirit." The new birth imparts a new vision. The man who is born of the Spirit hath eternal life (ver. 36); and life eternal is to know God and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent (xvii. 3). "Ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and ye know [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδατε</span></span>] all things" 22 (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:20">1 John 2:20</span>). He who is born of water and of the Spirit sees the kingdom of God. This we therefore includes, with Jesus, all who are truly born anew of the Spirit. Jesus meets the we know of Nicodemus (ver. 2), referring to the class to which he belonged, with another we know, referring to another class, of which He was the head and representative. We know [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδαμεν] </span></span>, absolutely. See on 2 24. </p>
