<p>Have eternal life. A characteristic phrase of John for live forever. See vv. 16, 36; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:40">John 6:40</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:47">John 6:47</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:54">John 6:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:15">1 John 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:12">1 John 5:12</span>. </p>
<p>The interview with Nicodemus closes with ver. 15; and the succeeding words are John's. This appears from the following facts : </p>
<p>1. The past tenses loved and gave, in ver. 16, better suit the later point of view from which John writes, after the atoning death of Christ was an accomplished historic fact, than the drift of the present discourse of Jesus before the full revelation of that work. </p>
<p>2. It is in John's manner to throw in explanatory comments of his own (i. 16 - 18; 1Jo 12:37 - 41), and to do so abruptly. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span>, and on and, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span>. </p>
<p>3. Ver. 19 is in the same line of thought with <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9-11">John 1:9-11</span> in the Prologue; and the tone of that verse is historic, carrying the sense of past rejection, as loved darkness; were evil. </p>
<p>4. The phrase believe on the name is not used elsewhere by our Lord, but by John (i. 12; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:13">1 John 5:13</span>). </p>
<p>5. The phrase only - begotten son is not elsewhere used by Jesus of himself, but in every case by the Evangelist (i. 14, 18; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:9">1 John 4:9</span>). </p>
<p>6. The phrase to do truth (ver. 21) occurs elsewhere only in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:6">1 John 1:6</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2">1 John 1:2</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3">1 John 1:3</span></p>
