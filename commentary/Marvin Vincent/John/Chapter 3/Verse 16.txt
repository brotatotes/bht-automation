<p>This attitude of God toward the world is in suggestive contrast with that in which the gods of paganism are represented. </p>
<p>Thus Juno says to Vulcan : </p>
<p>"Dear son, refrain : it is not well that thus A God should suffer for the sake of men." " Iliad, " 21, 379, 380. </p>
<p>And Apollo to Neptune : </p>
<p>"Thou would'st not deem me wise, should I contend With thee, O Neptune, for the sake of men, Who flourish like the forest - leaves awhile, And feed upon the fruits of earth, and then Decay and perish. Let us quit the field, And leave the combat to the warring hosts." " Iliad, " 21, 461, 467. </p>
<p>Man has no assurance of forgiveness even when he offers the sacrifices in which the gods especially delight. "Man's sin and the divine punishment therefore are certain; forgiveness is uncertain, dependent upon the arbitrary caprice of the gods. Human life is a life without the certainty of grace" (Nagelsbach, " Homerische Theologie "). Mr. Gladstone observes : </p>
<p>"No Homeric deity ever will be found to make a personal sacrifice on behalf of a human client" (" Homer and the Homeric Age, " 2 372).</p>
