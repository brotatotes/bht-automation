<p>Doeth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρασσων] </span></span>. The present participle, indicating habit and general tendency. </p>
<p>Evil [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαυλα] </span></span>. Rev., ill. A different word from that in the previous verse. Originally, light, paltry, trivial, and so worthless. Evil, therefore, considered on the side of worthlessness. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:16">James 3:16</span>. </p>
<p>Lest his works should be reproved [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη ελεγχθη τα εργα αυτου] </span></span>. Rather, in order that his works may not be reproved. Elegcw, rendered reprove, has several phases of meaning. In earlier classical Greek it signifies to disgrace or put to shame. Thus Ulysses, having succeeded in the trial of the bow, says to Telemachus, "the stranger who sits in thy halls disgraces [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγχει</span></span>] thee not" (" Odyssey, 21 424). Then, to cross - examine or question, for the purpose of convincing, convicting, or refuting; to censure, accuse. So Herodotus : "In his reply Alexander became confused, and diverged from the truth, whereon the slaves interposed, confuted his statements (hlegcon, cross - questioned and caught him in falsehood), and told the whole history of the crime" (i. 115). The messenger in the "Antigone" of Sophocles, describing the consternation of the watchmen at finding Polynices' body buried, says : "Evil words were bandied among them, guard accusing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγχων</span></span>] guard" (260). Of arguments, to bring to the proof; prove; prove by a chain of reasoning. It occurs in Pindar in the general sense of to conquer or surpass. "Having descended into the naked race they surpassed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλεγξαν</span></span>] the Grecian band in speed (" Pythia," 11 75). </p>
<p>In the New Testament it is found in the sense of reprove (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:19">Luke 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:20">1 Timothy 5:20</span>, etc.). Convince of crime or fault (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:24">1 Corinthians 14:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:9">James 2:9</span>). To bring to light or expose by conviction (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:20">James 3:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:11">Ephesians 5:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:13">Ephesians 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:46">John 8:46</span>; see on that passage). So of the exposure of false teachers, and their refutation (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:9">Titus 1:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:13">Titus 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:15">Titus 2:15</span>). To test and expose with a view to correction, and so, nearly equivalent to chasten (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:5">Hebrews 12:5</span>). The different meanings unite in the word convict. Conviction is the result of examination, testing, argument. The test exposes and demonstrates the error, and refutes it, thus convincing, convicting, and rebuking the subject of it. This conviction issues in chastening, by which the error is corrected and the erring one purified. If the conviction is rejected, it carries with it condemnation and punishment. The man is thus convicted of sin, of right, and of judgment (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:8">John 16:8</span>). In this passage the evil - doer is represented as avoiding the light which tests, that light which is the offspring of love (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+3:19">Revelation 3:19</span>) and the consequent exposure of his error. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:13">Ephesians 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9-11">John 1:9-11</span>. This idea of loving darkness rather than light is graphically treated in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+24:0">Job 24:0</span> and runs through vv. 13 - 17.</p>
