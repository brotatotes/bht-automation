<p>Doeth the truth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιων την αληθειαν] </span></span>. The phrase occurs only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:6">1 John 1:6</span>. Note the contrasted phrase, doeth evil (ver. 20). There the plural is used : doeth evil things; evil being represented by a number of bad works. Here the singular, the truth, or truth; truth being regarded as one, and "including in a supreme unity all right deeds." There is also to be noted the different words for doing in these two verses : doeth evil [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρασσων] </span></span>; doeth truth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιων] </span></span>. The latter verb contemplates the object and end of action; the former the means, with the idea of continuity and repetition. Prasswn is the practice, while poiwn may be the doing once for all. Thus poiein is to conclude a peace : prassein, to negotiate a peace. So Demosthenes : "He will do [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πραξει</span></span>] these things, and will accomplish them [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησει] </span></span>." In the New Testament a tendency is observable to use poiein in a good sense, and prasswin in an evil sense. Compare the kindred word praxiv, deed or work, which occurs six times, and in four out of the six of evil doing (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:27">Matthew 16:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:51">Luke 23:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:18">Acts 19:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:13">Romans 8:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:14">Romans 12:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:9">Colossians 3:9</span>). With this passage compare especially <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29">John 5:29</span>, where the two verbs are used with the two nouns as here. Also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:15">Romans 7:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:19">Romans 7:19</span>. Bengel says : "Evil is restless : it is busier than truth." In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:32">Romans 1:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:3">Romans 2:3</span>, both verbs are used of doing evil, but still with a distinction in that prassw is the more comprehensive term, designating the pursuit of evil as the aim of the activity. </p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:2">John 3:2</span>1Cometh to. In contrast with hateth (ver. 20). His love of the light is shown by his seeking it. </p>
<p>In God. The element of holy action. Notice the perfect tense, have been wrought (as Rev.) and abide.</p>
