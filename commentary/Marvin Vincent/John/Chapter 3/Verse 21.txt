Doeth the truth [ποιων την αληθειαν] . The phrase occurs only here and in 1 John 1:6. Note the contrasted phrase, doeth evil (ver. 20). There the plural is used : doeth evil things; evil being represented by a number of bad works. Here the singular, the truth, or truth; truth being regarded as one, and "including in a supreme unity all right deeds." There is also to be noted the different words for doing in these two verses : doeth evil [πρασσων] ; doeth truth [ποιων] . The latter verb contemplates the object and end of action; the former the means, with the idea of continuity and repetition. Prasswn is the practice, while poiwn may be the doing once for all. Thus poiein is to conclude a peace : prassein, to negotiate a peace. So Demosthenes : "He will do [πραξει] these things, and will accomplish them [ποιησει] ." In the New Testament a tendency is observable to use poiein in a good sense, and prasswin in an evil sense. Compare the kindred word praxiv, deed or work, which occurs six times, and in four out of the six of evil doing (Matthew 16:27; Luke 23:51; Acts 19:18; Romans 8:13; Romans 12:14; Colossians 3:9). With this passage compare especially John 5:29, where the two verbs are used with the two nouns as here. Also, Romans 7:15, Romans 7:19. Bengel says : "Evil is restless : it is busier than truth." In Romans 1:32; Romans 2:3, both verbs are used of doing evil, but still with a distinction in that prassw is the more comprehensive term, designating the pursuit of evil as the aim of the activity. John 3:21Cometh to. In contrast with hateth (ver. 20). His love of the light is shown by his seeking it. In God. The element of holy action. Notice the perfect tense, have been wrought (as Rev.) and abide.
