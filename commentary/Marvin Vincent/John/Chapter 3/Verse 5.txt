<p>Born of water and the Spirit. The exposition of this much controverted passage does not fall within the scope of this work. We may observe, </p>
<p>1. That Jesus here lays down the preliminary conditions of entrance into His kingdom, expanding and explaining His statement in ver. 3. </p>
<p>2. That this condition is here stated as complex, including two distinct factors, water and the Spirit. </p>
<p>3. That the former of these two factors is not to be merged in the latter; that the spiritual element is not to exclude or obliterate the external and ritual element. We are not to understand with Calvin, the Holy Spirit as the purifying water in the spiritual sense : "water which is the Spirit." </p>
<p>4. That water points definitely to the rite of baptism, and that with a twofold reference - to the past and to the future. Water naturally suggested to Nicodemus the baptism of John, which was then awakening such profound and general interest; and, with this, the symbolical purifications of the Jews, and the Old Testament use of washing as the figure of purifying from sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:2">Psalms 2:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:25">Ezekiel 36:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:1">Zechariah 13:1</span>). Jesus ' words opened to Nicodemus a new and more spiritual significance in both the ceremonial purifications and the baptism of John which the Pharisees had rejected (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:30">Luke 7:30</span>). John's rite had a real and legitimate relation to the kingdom of God which Nicodemus must accept. </p>
<p>5. That while Jesus asserted the obligation of the outward rite, He asserted likewise, as its necessary complement, the presence and creating and informing energy of the Spirit with which John had promised that the coming one should baptize. That as John's baptism had been unto repentance, for the remission of sins, so the new life must include the real no less than the symbolic cleansing of the old, sinful life, and the infusion by the Spirit of a new and divine principle of life. Thus Jesus ' words included a prophetic reference to the complete ideal of Christian baptism - "the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5">Titus 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:26">Ephesians 5:26</span>); according to which the two factors are inseparably blended (not the one swallowed up by the other), and the new life is inaugurated both symbolically in the baptism with water, and actually in the renewing by the Holy Spirit, yet so as that the rite, through its association with the Spirit's energy, is more than a mere symbol : is a veritable vehicle of grace to the recipient, and acquires a substantial part in the inauguration of the new life. Baptism, considered merely as a rite, and apart from the operation of the Spirit, does not and cannot impart the new life. Without the Spirit it is a lie. It is a truthful sign only as the sign of an inward and spiritual grace. </p>
<p>6. That the ideal of the new life presented in our Lord 's words, includes the relation of the regenerated man to an organization. The object of the new birth is declared to be that a man may see and enter into the kingdom of God. But the kingdom of God is an economy. It includes and implies the organized Christian community. This is one of the facts which, with its accompanying obligation, is revealed to the new vision of the new man. He sees not only God, but the kingdom of God; God as King of an organized citizenship; God as the Father of the family of mankind; obligation to God implying obligation to the neighbor; obligation to Christ implying obligation to the church, of which He is the head, "which is His body, the fullness of Him that filleth all things with all things" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span>). Through water alone, the mere external rite of baptism, a man may pass into the outward fellowship of the visible church without seeing or entering the kingdom of God. Through water and the Spirit, he passes indeed into the outward fellowship, but through that into the vision and fellowship of the kingdom of God. </p>
<p>Enter into. This more than see (ver. 3). It is to become partaker of; to go in and possess, as the Israelites did Canaan.</p>
