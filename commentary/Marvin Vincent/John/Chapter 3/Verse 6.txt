<p>That which is born [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το γεγεννηενον] </span></span>. Strictly, that which hath been born, and consequently is now before us as born. The aorist tense (3, 4, 5, 7), marks the fact of birth; the perfect (as here), the state of that which has been born (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:18">1 John 5:18</span>, where both tenses occur); the neuter, that which, states the principle in the abstract. Compare ver. 8, where the statement is personal : everyone that is born. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4">1 John 5:4</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:1">1 John 5:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:18">1 John 5:18</span>. </p>
<p>Of the flesh [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ της σαρκος] </span></span>. See on ver. 14. John uses the word sarx generally, to express humanity under the conditions of this life (i. 14; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:2">1 John 4:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:3">1 John 4:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:7">1 John 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:7">2 John 1:7</span>), with sometimes a more definite hint at the sinful and fallible nature of humanity (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:16">1 John 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:15">John 8:15</span>). Twice, as opposed to pneuma, Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:6">John 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:63">John 6:63</span>). </p>
<p>Of the Spirit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του πνευματος] </span></span>. The Holy Spirit of God, or the principle of life which He imparts. The difference is slight, for the two ideas imply each other; but the latter perhaps is better here, because a little more abstract, and so contrasted with the flesh. Spirit and flesh are the distinguishing principles, the one of the heavenly, the other of the earthly economy.</p>
