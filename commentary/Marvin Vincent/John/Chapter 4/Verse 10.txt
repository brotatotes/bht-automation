<p>If thou knewest, etc. Answering rather something latent in the question than the question itself, as in Jesus ' first answer to Nicodemus. The gift [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωρεαν] </span></span>. Only here in the Gospels, though Luke uses it in Acts four times, and the kindred adverb, dwrhma, freely, is found once in Matthew. The word carries the sense of a bountiful, free, honorable gift. Compare dwrhma, gift, and see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:17">James 1:17</span>. </p>
<p>Asked [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητησας] </span></span>. Jesus uses the same word for ask which the woman had employed of his asking her, the word expressing the asking of the inferior from the superior. Here it is the appropriate word. </p>
<p>Living water [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υδωρ ζων] </span></span>. Fresh, perennial. A familiar figure to the Jews. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:13">Jeremiah 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:13">Jeremiah 17:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:8">Zechariah 14:8</span>. Not necessarily the same as water of life (udwr zwhv, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:6">Revelation 21:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1">Revelation 22:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+22:17">Revelation 22:17</span>).</p>
