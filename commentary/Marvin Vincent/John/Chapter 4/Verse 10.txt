If thou knewest, etc. Answering rather something latent in the question than the question itself, as in Jesus ' first answer to Nicodemus. The gift [δωρεαν] . Only here in the Gospels, though Luke uses it in Acts four times, and the kindred adverb, dwrhma, freely, is found once in Matthew. The word carries the sense of a bountiful, free, honorable gift. Compare dwrhma, gift, and see on James 1:17. Asked [ητησας] . Jesus uses the same word for ask which the woman had employed of his asking her, the word expressing the asking of the inferior from the superior. Here it is the appropriate word. Living water [υδωρ ζων] . Fresh, perennial. A familiar figure to the Jews. See Jeremiah 2:13; Jeremiah 17:13; Zechariah 14:8. Not necessarily the same as water of life (udwr zwhv, Revelation 21:6; Revelation 22:1, Revelation 22:17).
