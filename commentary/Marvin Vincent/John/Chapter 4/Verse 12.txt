<p>Art thou greater [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη συ μειζων] </span></span>. The interrogative particle indicates that a negative answer is expected : Surely thou art not. The su, thou, first in the sentence, is emphatic, and possibly with a shade of contempt. </p>

<p>Children [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιοι] </span></span>. Rev., correctly, sons. </p>
<p>Cattle [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θρεμματα] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. From [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρεφω</span></span>] to nourish. A general term for whatever is fed or nursed. When used of animals - mostly of tame ones - cattle, sheep, etc. It is applied to children, fowls, insects, and fish, also to domestic slaves, which, according to some, is the meaning here; but, as Meyer justly remarks, "there was no need specially to name the servants; the mention of the herds completes the picture of their nomadic progenitor."</p>
