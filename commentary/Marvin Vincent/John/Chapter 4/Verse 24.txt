<p>God is a Spirit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα ο θεος] </span></span>. Or, as Rev., in margins, God is spirit. Spirit is the emphatic word; Spirit is God. The phrase describes the nature, not the personality of God. Compare the expressions, God is light; God is love (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:8">1 John 4:8</span>).</p>
