<p>Meat [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βρωμα] </span></span>. A different word from that in ver. 32, signifying what is eaten. </p>
<p>To do [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ποιω] </span></span>. Literally, in order that I do. Emphasizing the end and not the process. Frequently so used in John. See on 3 19. </p>
<p>Finish [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πελειωσω] </span></span>. Better, as Rev., accomplish. Not merely bring to an end, but perfect. From teleiov, perfect. The verb is characteristic of John, and of the Epistle to the Hebrews.
