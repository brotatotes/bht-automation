Say not ye. In what follows, Jesus is contrasting the natural harvest - time with the spiritual, which was immediately to take place in the ingathering of the Samaritans. Ye is emphatic, marking what the disciples expect according to the order of nature. As you look on these green fields between Ebal and Gerizim, ye say, it is yet four months to harvest. There are four months [τετραμηνον εστιν] . Properly, it is a space of four months. Only here in the New Testament. Harvest [θερισμος] . See on Luke 10:2. White [λευκαι] . See on Luke 9:29. Already unto harvest. Spiritual harvest. The crowd of Samaritans now pouring out toward the well was to Jesus as a ripe harvest - field, prefiguring the larger harvest of mankind which would be reaped by His disciples. By the best texts the already is joined with the next verse, and the kai, and, at the beginning of that verse is omitted : Already he that reapeth receiveth, etc. Wages [μισθον] . See on 2 Peter 2:13. Unto life eternal. This is explained either, which shall not perish but endure unto eternal life, or into life eternal, as into a granary. Compare ver. 14. Together [ομου] . The construction is peculiar : that both the sower may rejoice together and the reaper. Together signifies not in common, but simultaneously. So quickly does the harvest follow the gospel - seed sown among the Samaritans, that the sower and the reaper rejoice together.
