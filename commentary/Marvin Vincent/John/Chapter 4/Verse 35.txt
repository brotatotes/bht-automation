<p>Say not ye. In what follows, Jesus is contrasting the natural harvest - time with the spiritual, which was immediately to take place in the ingathering of the Samaritans. Ye is emphatic, marking what the disciples expect according to the order of nature. As you look on these green fields between Ebal and Gerizim, ye say, it is yet four months to harvest. There are four months [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετραμηνον εστιν] </span></span>. Properly, it is a space of four months. Only here in the New Testament. </p>
<p>Harvest [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θερισμος] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:2">Luke 10:2</span>. </p>
<p>White [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λευκαι] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:29">Luke 9:29</span>. </p>
<p>Already unto harvest. Spiritual harvest. The crowd of Samaritans now pouring out toward the well was to Jesus as a ripe harvest - field, prefiguring the larger harvest of mankind which would be reaped by His disciples. By the best texts the already is joined with the next verse, and the kai, and, at the beginning of that verse is omitted : Already he that reapeth receiveth, etc. </p>
<p>Wages [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθον] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:13">2 Peter 2:13</span>. </p>
<p>Unto life eternal. This is explained either, which shall not perish but endure unto eternal life, or into life eternal, as into a granary. Compare ver. 14. </p>
<p>Together [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομου] </span></span>. The construction is peculiar : that both the sower may rejoice together and the reaper. Together signifies not in common, but simultaneously. So quickly does the harvest follow the gospel - seed sown among the Samaritans, that the sower and the reaper rejoice together.</p>
