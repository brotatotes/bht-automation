A woman. Held in low esteem by the popular teachers; a Samaritan, and therefore despised by the Jews; poor, for drawing water was not, as in earlier times, performed by women of station (Genesis 24:15; Genesis 29:9). Of Samaria. Literally, out of Samaria [εκ] . Not of the city of Samaria, which was some six miles distant, but the country. A Samaritan by race and religion. To draw. See on 2 8.
