Ye believe. Again the emphatic ye, the reason for the emphasis being given in the succeeding clause. Which receive [λαμβανοντες] . Literally, receiving (as ye do) : seeing that ye receive. Seek not the honor that cometh from God only [και την δοξαν την μονου θεου ου ζητειτε] . The Rev. gives it capitally, following the Greek order : and the glory that cometh from the only God ye seek not. Not God only, which entirely overlooks the force of the definite article; but the only God. Compare 1 Timothy 6:15, 1 Timothy 6:16; John 17:3; Romans 16:27.
