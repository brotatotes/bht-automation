<p>I will accuse [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηγορησω] </span></span>. From kata, against, and ajgoreuw, to speak in the assembly [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγορα] </span></span>. Hence, properly, to bring an accusation in court. John uses no other verb for accuse, and this only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:6">John 8:6</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+12:10">Revelation 12:10</span>. Once in the New Testament diaballw occurs (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:1">Luke 16:1</span>, on which see note), signifying malicious accusation, and secret, as distinguished from public, accusation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηγορια] </span></span>. Aijtiaomai occurs once in the compound prohtiasameqa, we before laid to the charge (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:9">Romans 3:9</span>). This has reference especially to the ground of accusation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτια] </span></span>. Egkalew occurs only in Acts, with the exception of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:33">Romans 8:33</span>. It means to accuse publicly, but not necessarily before a tribunal. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:28">Acts 23:28</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:29">Acts 23:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:2">Acts 26:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:7">Acts 26:7</span>. </p>
<p>In whom ye trust [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ον υμεις ηλπικατε] </span></span>. A strong expression. Literally, into whom ye have hoped. Rev., admirably, on whom ye have set your hope.</p>
