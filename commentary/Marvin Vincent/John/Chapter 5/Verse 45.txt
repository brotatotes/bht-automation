I will accuse [κατηγορησω] . From kata, against, and ajgoreuw, to speak in the assembly [αγορα] . Hence, properly, to bring an accusation in court. John uses no other verb for accuse, and this only here, John 8:6, and Revelation 12:10. Once in the New Testament diaballw occurs (Luke 16:1, on which see note), signifying malicious accusation, and secret, as distinguished from public, accusation [κατηγορια] . Aijtiaomai occurs once in the compound prohtiasameqa, we before laid to the charge (Romans 3:9). This has reference especially to the ground of accusation [αιτια] . Egkalew occurs only in Acts, with the exception of Romans 8:33. It means to accuse publicly, but not necessarily before a tribunal. See Acts 23:28, Acts 23:29; Acts 26:2, Acts 26:7. In whom ye trust [εις ον υμεις ηλπικατε] . A strong expression. Literally, into whom ye have hoped. Rev., admirably, on whom ye have set your hope.
