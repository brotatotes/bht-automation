<p>Writings [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραμμασιν] </span></span>. It is important to understand the precise sense of this word, because it goes to determine whether Jesus intended an antithesis between Moses ' writings and His own words, or simply between Moses [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινου</span></span>] and Himself [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμοις] </span></span>. </p>
<p>Gramma primarily means what is written. Hence it may describe either a single character or a document. From this general notion several forms develop themselves in the New Testament. The word occurs in its narrower sense of characters, at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:38">Luke 23:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7">2 Corinthians 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:11">Galatians 6:11</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:21">Acts 28:21</span>, it means official communications. Paul, with a single exception (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7">2 Corinthians 3:7</span>), uses it of the letter of scripture as contrasted with its spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:27">Romans 2:27</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:6">Romans 7:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:6">Luke 16:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:7">Luke 16:7</span>, it denotes a debtor 's bond (A. V., bill). In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:15">John 7:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:24">Acts 26:24</span>) it is used in the plural as a general term for scriptural and Rabbinical learning. Compare Sept., <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:11">Isaiah 29:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:12">Isaiah 29:12</span>) where a learned man is described as ejpitamenov grammata, acquainted with letters. Once it is used collectively of the sacred writings - the scriptures (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:15">2 Timothy 3:15</span>), though some give it a wider reference to Rabbinical exegesis, as well as to scripture itself. Among the Alexandrian Greeks the term is not confined to elementary instruction, but includes exposition, based, however, on critical study of the text. The tendency of such exegesis was often toward mystical and allegorical interpretation, degenerating into a petty ingenuity in fixing new and recondite meanings upon the old and familiar forms. This was illustrated by the Neo - Platonists' expositions of Homer, and by the Rabbinical exegesis. Men unacquainted with such studies, especially if they appeared as public teachers, would be regarded as ignorant by the Jews of the times of Christ and the Apostles. Hence the question respecting our Lord Himself : How knoweth this man letters (grammata <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:15">John 7:15</span>)? Also the comment upon Peter and John (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:13">Acts 4:13</span>) that they were unlearned [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγραμματοι] </span></span>. Thus, too, those who discovered in the Old Testament scriptures references to Christ, would be stigmatized by Pagans, as following the ingenious and fanciful method of the Jewish interpreters, which they held in contempt. Some such feeling may have provoked the words of Festus to Paul : Much learning [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλα γραμματα</span></span>] doth make thee mad (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:24">Acts 26:24</span>). It is well known with what minute care the literal transcription of the sacred writings was guarded. The Scribes [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραμματεις</span></span>] were charged with producing copies according to the letter [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα το γραμμα] </span></span>. </p>
<p>The one passage in second Timothy cannot be urged in favor of the general use of the term for the scriptures, especially since the best texts reject the article before iJera gramma, so that the meaning is apparently more general : "thou hast known sacred writings." The familiar formula for the scriptures was aiJ grafai aJgiai.. A single book of the collection of writings was known as biblion (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:17">Luke 4:17</span>), or biblov (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:42">Luke 20:42</span>); never grafh, which was the term for a particular passage. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:10">Mark 12:10</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:27">Mark 12:27</span> It seems to me, therefore, that the antithesis between the writings of Moses, superstitiously reverenced in the letter, and minutely and critically searched and expounded by the Jews, and the living words (rJhmasin, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:37">Luke 1:37</span>), is to be recognized. This, however, need not exclude the other antithesis between Moses and Jesus personally. ===<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:0">John 6:0</span> </p>
