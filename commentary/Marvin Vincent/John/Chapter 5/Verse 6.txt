See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:19">Matthew 1:19</span>. Jesus appeals to the energy of his will. Not improbably he had fallen into apathy through his long sickness. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:4">Acts 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:17">John 7:17</span>. </p>
<p>Whole [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υγιης] </span></span>. Sound.</p>
