Sit down [αναπεσειν] . Literally, recline. Grass [χορτος] . Originally an enclosure. Thus Homer speaks of Peleus offering a sacrifice, aujlhv ejn cortw, in the enclosure of the court (" Iliad, " 11, 774). Hence a feeding - place, and so grass, provender. The sense is merely that of our abstract pasture. Matthew and Mark mention the grass, Mark with the epithet green. Wyc., hay.
