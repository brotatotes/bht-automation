<p>Grass [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χορτος] </span></span>. Originally an enclosure. Thus Homer speaks of Peleus offering a sacrifice, aujlhv ejn cortw, in the enclosure of the court (" Iliad, " 11, 774). Hence a feeding - place, and so grass, provender. The sense is merely that of our abstract pasture. Matthew and Mark mention the grass, Mark with the epithet green. Wyc., hay.</p>
