Baskets [κοφινους] . See on Matthew 14:20. Wyc., coffins. With the fragments, etc. John goes into fuller detail than the Synoptists. Mark alone notes the gathering of the remains of the fishes. John also uses ejgemisan, filled, for they took up, or were taken up, of the Synoptists. Five barley loaves. A detail peculiar to John, emphasizing the identity of the fragments with the original loaves. Unto them that had eaten (bebrwkosin). Only here in the New Testament.
