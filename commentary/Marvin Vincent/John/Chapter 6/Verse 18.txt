<p>Arose [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διηγειρετο] </span></span>. It is lamentable how the A. V. misses the graphic force of these imperfects. Rev., rightly, was rising. Literally, was being awakened. The imperfects convey the sense of gathering danger, and throw into stronger relief the fact of Jesus ' appearance. They were going; the darkness had already fallen, the sea was rising, and Jesus had not yet come. </p>
<p>That blew [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνεοντος] </span></span>. Literally, blowing. That was blowing would be better. John's narrative at this point is more detailed and graphic than the others.</p>
