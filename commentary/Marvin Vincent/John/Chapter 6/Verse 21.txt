<p>They willingly received [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηθελον λαβειν] </span></span>. Wrong. Rev., correctly, they were willing to receive; after being reassured by His voice. The imperfect denotes a continuous state of feeling, not a mere impulsive and temporary wish. </p>
<p>Immediately [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευθεως] </span></span>. Whether Jesus actually entered the boat or not, John does not say. The more natural inference is that he did. Both Matthew and Mark say so. Their immediate and miraculous arrival at the shore was simultaneous either with their entertaining the wish to receive Him, or with His actually coming on board. Only John mentions this incident. Matthew and Mark say that the wind ceased. </p>
<p>They went [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπηγον] </span></span>. Imperfect : were going. Literally, were going away. The verb has the sense of retiring from something. Compare ver. 67; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:33">John 7:33</span>, on which see note; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:11">John 12:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:8">John 18:8</span>.</p>
