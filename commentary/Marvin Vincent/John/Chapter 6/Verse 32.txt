<p>Moses gave you not [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μωσης δεδωκεν υμιν] </span></span>. The antithesis is between Moses and my Father. So Rev., rightly, "it was not Moses that gave you," etc. - "but my Father giveth," etc. Some editors change the perfect tense, dedwken, hath given, to the aorist, edwken, gave. </p>
<p>The true bread from heaven [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αρτον εκ τουουρανου τον αληθινον] </span></span>. The translation would gain by following the Greek order, "the bread out of heaven, the real bread."</p>
