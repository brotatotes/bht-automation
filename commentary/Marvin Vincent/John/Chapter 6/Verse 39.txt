<p>The Father 's will. Omit the Father 's. Render, the will of Him, etc. That of all which He hath given me [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα παν ο δεδωκε μοι] </span></span>. The construction is a peculiar and broken one. All which He hath given, stands alone as an absolute nominative; a very emphatic and impressive mode of statement. Literally it reads, that all which He hath given me I should lose nothing out of it. </p>
<p>At the last day [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη εσχατη ημερα] </span></span>. The phrase occurs only in John.</p>
