<p>Murmured [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγγογυζον] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:16">Jude 1:16</span>, and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:10">1 Corinthians 10:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:14">Philippians 2:14</span>. The word is constantly used in the Septuagint of the murmuring of Israel in the wilderness. Wyc., grudged of Him. So Chaucer, "Judas grucched agens the Maudeleyn whan sche anoynted the hed of oure Lord" (" Parson's Tale "); and Shakespeare, </p>
<p>"Served Without or grudge or grumbling." " Tempest " 1, 2, 249. </p>
<p>At Him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περι αυτου] </span></span>. Implying that they addressed their remonstrances to Him. But peri means about or concerning. So Rev., properly, concerning.</p>
