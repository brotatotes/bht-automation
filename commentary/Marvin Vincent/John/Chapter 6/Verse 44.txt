<p>Draw [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελκυση] </span></span>. Two words for drawing are found in the New Testament, surw and eJlkuw. The distinction is not habitually observed, and the meanings often overlap. Surw is originally to drag or trail along, as a garment or torn slippers. Both words are used of haling to justice. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:6">Acts 17:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:19">Acts 16:19</span>.) In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:19">Acts 14:19</span>, su. rw, of dragging Paul 's senseless body out of the city at Lystra. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:6">John 21:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:8">John 21:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:11">John 21:11</span>, both words of drawing the net. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:10">John 18:10</span>, eJlkuw, of drawing Peter's sword. One distinction, however, is observed : surw is never used of Christ 's attraction of men. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44">John 6:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:32">John 12:32</span>. Elkuw occurs only once outside of John's writings (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:19">Acts 16:19</span>). Luther says on this passage : "The drawing is not like that of the executioner, who draws the thief up the ladder to the gallows; but it is a gracious allurement, such as that of the man whom everybody loves, and to whom everybody willingly goes."</p>
