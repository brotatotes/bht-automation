Draw [ελκυση] . Two words for drawing are found in the New Testament, surw and eJlkuw. The distinction is not habitually observed, and the meanings often overlap. Surw is originally to drag or trail along, as a garment or torn slippers. Both words are used of haling to justice. (See Acts 8:3; Acts 17:6; Acts 16:19.) In Acts 14:19, su. rw, of dragging Paul 's senseless body out of the city at Lystra. In John 21:6, John 21:8, John 21:11, both words of drawing the net. In John 18:10, eJlkuw, of drawing Peter's sword. One distinction, however, is observed : surw is never used of Christ 's attraction of men. See John 6:44; John 12:32. Elkuw occurs only once outside of John's writings (Acts 16:19). Luther says on this passage : "The drawing is not like that of the executioner, who draws the thief up the ladder to the gallows; but it is a gracious allurement, such as that of the man whom everybody loves, and to whom everybody willingly goes."
