Eat the flesh. Appropriate the life. Compare Galatians 2:20; Ephesians 3:17. Drink His blood. Appropriate the saving merit of His death. The passover was approaching, and the reference may well have been to the flesh and blood of the paschal lamb. Have no life in you [ουκ εχετε ζωην εν εαυτοις] . Not according to the Greek. Rightly, as Rev., ye have not life in yourselves. All true life must be in Christ. Compare Colossians 3:3.
