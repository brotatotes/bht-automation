<p>Have no life in you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εχετε ζωην εν εαυτοις] </span></span>. Not according to the Greek. Rightly, as Rev., ye have not life in yourselves. All true life must be in Christ. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:3">Colossians 3:3</span>.</p>
