<p>Eateth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρωγων] </span></span>. Another verb for eating is used. With the exception of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:38">Matthew 24:38</span>, it is found only in John, and always in connection with Christ. No special significance can be fairly attached to its use here. It seems to be taken as a current word, and efagon is resumed in ver. 58.</p>
