<p>The living Father [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ζων πατηρ] </span></span>. A phrase found nowhere else in the New Testament. On living and live, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>. </p>
<p>By the Father [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τον πατερα] </span></span>. Wrong. Render, because of, as Rev. Because the Father is the living One. So, because of me, instead of by me.</p>
