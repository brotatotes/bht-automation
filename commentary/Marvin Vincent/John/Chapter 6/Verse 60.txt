Hard [σκληρος] . See on Matthew 25:24; Jude 1:14. According to the Greek order, hard is this saying. Hear it [αυτου ακουειν] . Aujtou may be rendered Him, but this is not probable. Hear means a docile hearing, with a view to receiving what is heard. Compare John 10:3, John 10:16, John 10:27; John 12:47; John 18:37.
