<p>What and if ye shall see [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν ουν θεωρητε] </span></span>. The question is marked by an aposiopesis, i e., a breaking off of the sentence and leaving the hearer to complete it for himself. Literally, if then ye should behold, etc. - the completion would be, would not this still more cause you to stumble ? </p>
<p>Ascend [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινοντα] </span></span>. Rev., properly, renders the participle, ascending. I speak [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλω] </span></span>. But the correct reading is lelalhka, the perfect tense, I have spoken, or I have just spoken, referring to the preceding discourse.</p>
