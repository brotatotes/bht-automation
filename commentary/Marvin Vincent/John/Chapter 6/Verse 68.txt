<p>Simon Peter. Assailants of the authenticity of John's Gospel have asserted that it reveals an effort on the part of the writer to claim for the disciple whom Jesus loved a pre - eminence above Peter. The assertion is effectually contradicted by the narrative itself. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:42">John 1:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:68">John 6:68</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:6">John 13:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:10">John 18:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:16">John 18:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:2">John 20:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:7">John 20:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:3">John 21:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:7">John 21:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:11">John 21:11</span>, and notes on those passages. Peter's replying for the twelve, in this passage, is a case in point. </p>
