<p>A devil [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαβολος] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:1">Matthew 4:1</span>. The word is an adjective, meaning slanderous, but is almost invariably used in the New Testament as a noun, and with the definite article. The article is wanting only in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:8">1 Peter 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:10">Acts 13:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span>; and perhaps <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:2">Revelation 20:2</span>. It is of the very essence of the devilish nature to oppose Christ. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:23">Matthew 16:23</span>.</p>
