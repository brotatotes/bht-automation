Will do his will [θελη το θελημα αυτου ποιειν] . This is a notable illustration of the frequent blunder of the A. V. in rendering qelein, to will or determine, as a mere auxiliary verb. By overlooking the distinct meaning of the verb to will, and resolving willeth to do into will do, it sacrifices the real force of the passage. Jesus says, if it be one's will to do; if his moral purpose is in sympathy with the divine will. He shall know. Sympathy with the will of God is a condition of understanding it. Of God [εκ του θεου] . Better, from; proceeding out of. Of myself [απ εμαυτου] . Of myself is misleading, being commonly understood to mean concerning myself. Rev., correctly, from myself; without union with the Father. Compare John 5:30.
