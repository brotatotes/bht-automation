A devil [δαιμονιον] . Or more correctly, a demon. See on Mark 1:34. The name was applied to Jesus by the multitude [οχλος] and not by those whom He was addressing in ver. 19, because of the gloomy suspicions which they thought He entertained, and in entire ignorance of the design of the Jews which Jesus had penetrated. The same term was applied to John the Baptist, the ascetic, as one who withdrew from social intercourse (Matthew 11:18).
