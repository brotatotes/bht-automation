<p>Will He go [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος μελλει πορευεσθαι] </span></span>. Literally, whither does this man intend to go, or whither is He thinking of going? The A. V. misses the contemptuous insinuation in this man (Rev.). </p>
<p>We shall not find him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις] </span></span>. The pronoun is emphatic; we, the religious leaders, the wise men, who scrutinize the claims of all professed teachers and keep a watchful eye on all impostors. </p>
<p>The dispersed among the Gentiles [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την διασποραν των ελληνων] </span></span>. Literally, the dispersion of the Greeks. The Jews who remained in foreign lands after the return from the Captivity were called by two names : </p>
<p>1. The Captivity, which was expressed in Greek by three words, viz., ajpoikia, a settlement far from home, which does not occur in the New Testament; metoikesia, change of abode, which is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:11">Matthew 1:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:12">Matthew 1:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:17">Matthew 1:17</span>, and always of the carrying into Babylon; aijcmalwsia, a taking at the point of the spear; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:8">Ephesians 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+13:10">Revelation 13:10</span>. </p>
<p>2. The Dispersion [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασπορα] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>. The first name marks their relation to their own land; the second to the strange lands. </p>
<p>The Gentiles (%Ellhnav). Literally, the Greeks. So Rev. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>.</p>
