Shall Christ, etc. [μη γαρ ο χριστος] . The Rev. gives better the force of the interrogative particle with gar, for : What, doth the Christ come, etc. The idea in full is, "you cannot [μη] say that, for [γαρ] doth the Christ, etc." Shall - come [ερχεται] . The present tense. Rev., rightly, doth - come.
