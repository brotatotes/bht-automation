<p>Any man [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον ανθρωπον] </span></span>. Literally, the man, whoever he may be, that comes before them. </p>
<p>Before it hear him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη ακουση παρ αυτου] </span></span>. Rev., more correctly, except it first hear. Hear him, is an inadequate rendering of par' aujtou, which is, as Rev., from himself; para, implying from beside, i e., from his side of the case.</p>
