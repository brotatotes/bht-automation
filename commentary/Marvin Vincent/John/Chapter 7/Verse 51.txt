Any man [τον ανθρωπον] . Literally, the man, whoever he may be, that comes before them. Before it hear him [εαν μη ακουση παρ αυτου] . Rev., more correctly, except it first hear. Hear him, is an inadequate rendering of par' aujtou, which is, as Rev., from himself; para, implying from beside, i e., from his side of the case.
