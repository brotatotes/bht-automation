<p>The light of the world [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το φως του κοσμου] </span></span>. Not lucnov, a lamp, as John the Baptist (v. 35). Light is another of John's characteristic terms and ideas, playing a most important part in his writings, as related to the manifestation of Jesus and His work upon men. He comes from God, who is light (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>). "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men" (i. 4). The Word was among men as light before the incarnation (i. 9; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:5">John 9:5</span>), and light came with the incarnation (iii. 19 - 21; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:46">John 12:46</span>). Christ is light through the illuminating energy of the Spirit (xiv. 21, 26; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:13">John 16:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:20">1 John 2:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:27">1 John 2:27</span>), which is received through love (xiv. 22, 23). The object of Christ 's work is to make men sons of light (xii. 36, 46), and to endow them with the light of life (viii. 12). </p>
<p>In ver. 20, we are told that Jesus spake these words in the Treasury. This was in the Court of the Women, the most public part of the temple. Four golden candelabra stood there, each with four golden bowls, each one filled from a pitcher of oil by a youth of priestly descent. These were lighted on the first night of the Feast of Tabernacles. It is not unlikely that they may have suggested our Lord 's figure, but the figure itself was familiar both from prophecy and from tradition. According to tradition, Light was one of the names of the Messiah. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:1">Isaiah 9:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:6">Isaiah 42:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:6">Isaiah 49:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:1-3">Isaiah 60:1-3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:2">Malachi 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:32">Luke 2:32</span>. </p>
<p>Walk in darkness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιπετησει εν τη σκοτια] </span></span>. This phrase is peculiar to the Gospel and First Epistle. </p>
<p>Shall have [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξει] </span></span>. Not only shall see it, but shall possess it. Hence Christ 's disciples are the light of the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:14">Matthew 5:14</span>). Compare lights, or, properly, luminaries [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωστηρες</span></span>] a name, applied to believers in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:15">Philippians 2:15</span>.</p>
