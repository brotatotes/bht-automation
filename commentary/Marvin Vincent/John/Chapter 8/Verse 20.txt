The Treasury [γαζοφυλακιω] . From gaza, treasure, a Persian word, occurring only once in the New Testament (Acts 8:27), and fulakh, guard. Used by John only here. The Treasury was in the Court of the Women, so called, not because it was appropriated to the worship of women exclusively, but because they were not allowed to proceed further, except for sacrificial purposes. The court covered a space upwards of two hundred feet square, and was surrounded by a colonnade, within which, and against the wall, were the thirteen trumpet - shaped chests, called "trumpets" from their shape, for charitable contributions. This court was the most public part of the temple. And no man laid hands on Him [και ουδεις επιασεν αυτον] . Notice the connection with the previous sentence by the simple and, where another writer would have said and yet : the sense being that though Jesus was teaching where He might easily have been apprehended, yet no one attempted to arrest Him. See on 1 10. Laid hands on is better rendered, as elsewhere, took (compare John 7:30). The inconsistency of the A. V. in the renderings of the same word, of which this is only one of many instances, is noteworthy here from the fact that in the only two passages in which John uses the phrase laid hands on (vii. 30; John 7:44), he employs the common formula, ejpiballein tav ceirav, or thn ceira, and in both these passages the word piasai is rendered take. The use of this latter word is confined almost exclusively to John, as it is found only three times elsewhere (Acts 3:7; Acts 12:4; 2 Corinthians 11:32).
