<p>Then [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν] </span></span>. Properly, therefore, connecting the fact of Jesus ' continuing to speak with His freedom from arrest. </p>

<p>Go away [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαγω] </span></span>. Withdraw myself from you; this sense being emphasized by the succeeding words, ye shall seek me. In expressing one's departure from men or from surrounding objects, we may emphasize merely the fact of removal, in which case ajpercomai, to go away, would be appropriate; or we may emphasize the removal as affecting some relation of the person to that from which he removes, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:67">John 6:67</span>, where Jesus says to the disciples, "will ye also go away, or withdraw from me," in which case uJpagw is the proper word. 31 In your sin [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη αμαρτια υμων] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>. Note the singular, sin, not sins. It is used collectively to express the whole condition of estrangement from God.</p>
