<p>Will He kill Himself [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητι αποκτενει εαυτον] </span></span>? The mockery in these words is alike subtle and bitter. The interrogative particle, mhti, signifies surely He will not by any chance kill Himself; and the sense of the whole clause is, He will not surely go where we cannot reach Him, unless perchance He should kill Himself; and as that would insure His going to Gehenna, of course we could not go to Him there. The remark displays alike the scorn and the self - righteousness of the speakers.</p>
