Ye are from beneath [εκ των κατω εστε] . A phrase peculiar to John and to his Gospel. Jesus states the radical antagonism between His opposers and Himself, as based upon difference of origin and nature. They spring from the lower, sensual, earthly economy; He from the heavenly. Compare James 3:15 sqq. From above [εκ των ανω] . Also peculiar to John's Gospel. Compare Colossians 3:1. On the phrase to be of [ειναι εκ] see on 1 46. Ye are of this world [εκ του κοσμου τουτου εστε] . Peculiar to John, and occurring in the First Epistle. On kosmou, world, see on 1 9. Ye are of this earthly order or economy.
