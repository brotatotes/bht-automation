<p>I am he [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω ειμι] </span></span>. He is inserted in the versions and is not in the text. By retaining it, we read, I am the Messiah. But the words are rather the solemn expression of His absolute divine being, as in ver 58 "If ye believe not that I am." See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+32:39">Deuteronomy 32:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+43:10">Isaiah 43:10</span>; and compare vv. 28, 58 of this chapter, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:19">John 13:19</span>.</p>
