<p>Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αρχην ο τι και λαλω υμιν] </span></span>. A very difficult passage, on which the commentators are almost hopelessly divided. There are two main classes of interpretations, according to one of which it is to be read interrogatively, and according to the other, affirmatively. The two principal representatives of the former class are Meyer, who renders "Do you ask that which all along [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αρχην</span></span>] I am even saying to you?" and Westcott, "How is it that I even speak to you at all [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αρχην] </span></span>" ? So also Milligan and Moulton. This latter rendering requires the change of o ti, the relative, that which, into the conjunction oti, that. </p>
<p>The second class of interpreters, who construe the passage affirmatively, vary in their explanations of thn archn, which they render severally, altogether, essentially, first of all, in the beginning. There is also a third class, who take thn archn as a noun, and explain according to <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:6">Revelation 21:6</span>, "I am the beginning, that which I am even saying unto you." This view is represented mostly by the older commentators, Augustine, Bede, Lampe, and later by Wordsworth. </p>
<p>I adopt the view of Alford, who renders essentially, explaining by generally, or traced up to its principle [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχη] </span></span>. Shading off from this are Godet, absolutely; Winer, throughout; Thayer, wholly or precisely. I render, I am essentially that which I even speak to you. If we accept the explanation of I am, in ver. 24, as a declaration of Jesus ' absolute divine being, that thought prepares the way for this interpretation of His answer to the question, Who art thou? His words are the revelation of Himself. "He appeals to His own testimony as the adequate expression of His nature. They have only to fathom the series of statements He has made concerning Himself, and they will find therein a complete analysis of His mission and essence" (Godet). 32</p>
