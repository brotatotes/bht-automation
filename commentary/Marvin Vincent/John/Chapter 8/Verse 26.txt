I have many things, etc. The connection of thought seems to be as follows : "I being such as my words show me to be, I must declare the whole message of Him by virtue of my essential union with whom I speak. Many things I have to declare and judge, and you may turn a deaf ear to them; nevertheless, I must speak the whole truth, the things which I have heard from Him who sent me and who is true." I speak to the world [λεγω εις τον κοσμον] . The best texts read lalw, which emphasizes not what Christ says (which would be legw), but the fact that He speaks. See on Matthew 28:18. The use of the preposition eijv here is peculiar. Literally, "I speak into the world;" so that my words may reach and spread through the world. See for a similar construction 1 Thessalonians 2:9; 1 Thessalonians 4:8; Hebrews 2:3. So Sophocles, where Electra says, khrusse mj eijv apantav proclaim me to all : so that the report of me may reach all ears (" Electra, " 606).
