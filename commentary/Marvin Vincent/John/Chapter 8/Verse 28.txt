<p>Ye shall know [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωσεσθε] </span></span>. Render, perceive, here as in ver. 27. </p>

<p>Of myself [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ εμαυτου] </span></span>. Properly, from myself, as Rev., at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+7:17">Revelation 7:17</span>, but not here. See on 7 17. </p>
<p>Hath taught [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιδαξεν] </span></span>. Rev., more correctly, taught. The aorist tense, regarding the teaching as a single act. Compare hkousa, I heard, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:32">John 3:32</span>. I speak these things [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παυτα λαλω] </span></span>. Not equivalent to so I speak (i. e., as the Father taught me), but an absolute declaration with reference to these present revelations.</p>
