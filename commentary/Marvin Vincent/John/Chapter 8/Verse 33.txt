Were never in bondage [δεδουλευκαμεν πωποτε] . Rev., better, have never yet been in bondage; thus giving the force of the perfect tense, never up to this time, and of the pw, yet. In the light of the promises given to Abraham, Genesis 17:16; Genesis 22:17, Genesis 22:18, the Jews claimed not only freedom, but dominion over the nations. In their reply to Jesus they ignore alike the Egyptian, Babylonian, and Syrian bondage, through which the nation had successively passed, as well as their present subjection to Rome, treating these merely as bondage which, though a fact, was not bondage by right, or bondage to which they had ever willingly submitted, and, therefore, not bondage in any real sense. Beside the fact that their words were the utterance of strong passion, it is to be remembered that the Romans, from motives of policy, had left them the semblance of political independence. As in so many other cases, they overlook the higher significance of Jesus ' words, and base their reply on a technicality. These are the very Jews who believed Him (ver. 31). Stier remarks : "These poor believers soon come to the end of their faith." The hint of the possible inconstancy of their faith, conveyed in the Lord 's words if ye abide in my word, is thus justified.
