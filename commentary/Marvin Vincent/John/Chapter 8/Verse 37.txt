Hath no place [ου χωρει] . Rev., hath not free course, or maketh no way. This rendering is in harmony with vv. 30, 31, concerning those who believed, but did not believe on Him, and who showed by their angry answer, in ver. 33, that the word of Jesus had made no advance in them. The rendering of the A. V. is not supported by usage, though Field (" Otium Norvicense ") cites an undoubted instance of that sense from the Epistles of Alciphron, a post - Christian writer, who relates the story of a parasite returning gorged from a banquet and applying to a physician, who administered an emetic. The parasite, describing the effect of the medicine, says that the doctor wondered where such a mess had place [εχωρησε] . For the rendering of the Rev., compare Aristophanes : pwv oun ouj cwrei tourgon; "How is it that the work makes no progress?" (" Peace, "472). Plutarch, ejcwrei dia thv polewv oJ logov," the word : (or report) spread (or advanced) through the city (" Caesar, " 712).
