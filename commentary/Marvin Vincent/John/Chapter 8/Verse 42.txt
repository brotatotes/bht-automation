I proceeded forth - from God [εκ του θεου εξηλθον] . Rev., came forth. The phrase occurs only here and in John 16:28. Exelqein is found in John 13:3; John 16:30, and emphasizes the idea of separation; a going from God to whom He was to return (and goeth unto God). Exelqein para (John 16:27; John 17:8), is going from beside, implying personal fellowship with God. Exelqein ejk, here, emphasizes the idea of essential, community of being : "I came forth out of." And am come [ηκω] . As much as to say, and here I am. Of myself [απ εμαυτου] . Of my own self - determination, independently, but my being is divinely derived. See on 7 17.
