<p>Say we not well. Indicating a current reproach. Well [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλως</span></span>] is literally, finely, beautifully. Sometimes ironical, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:6">Mark 7:6</span>. </p>
<p>Thou art a Samaritan [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαμαρειτης ει συ] </span></span>. Literally, a Samaritan art thou : the su, thou, terminating the sentence with a bitter emphasis : thou who professest such reverence for God and His law, art only a Samaritan, hostile to the true law and kingdom of God.</p>
