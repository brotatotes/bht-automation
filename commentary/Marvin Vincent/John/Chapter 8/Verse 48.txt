Say we not well. Indicating a current reproach. Well [καλως] is literally, finely, beautifully. Sometimes ironical, as Mark 7:6. Thou art a Samaritan [σαμαρειτης ει συ] . Literally, a Samaritan art thou : the su, thou, terminating the sentence with a bitter emphasis : thou who professest such reverence for God and His law, art only a Samaritan, hostile to the true law and kingdom of God.
