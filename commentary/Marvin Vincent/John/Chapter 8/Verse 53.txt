Art thou [μη συ] . Thou, emphatic, and the negative interrogative particle implying a negative answer, thou art not surely greater. Which is dead [οστις] . The compound pronoun ostiv, which, is used explicatively, according to a familiar New Testament usage, instead of the simple relative. The sense is, seeing that he is dead. The compound relative properly indicates the class or kind to which an object belongs. Art thou greater than Abraham, who is himself one of the dead? So Colossians 3:5. "Mortify covetousness, seeing it is [ητις εστιν] idolatry." See on Matthew 13:52; Matthew 21:41; Mark 12:18; Luke 12:1; Acts 7:53; Acts 10:41; 1 Peter 2:11.
