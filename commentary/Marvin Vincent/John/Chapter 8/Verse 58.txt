Was, I am [γενεσθαι, εγω ειμι] . It is important to observe the distinction between the two verbs. Abraham 's life was under the conditions of time, and therefore had a temporal beginning. Hence, Abraham came into being, or was born [γενεσθαι] . Jesus ' life was from and to eternity. Hence the formula for absolute, timeless existence, I am [εγω ειμι] . See on 1 3; John 7:34.
