<p>Was, I am [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεσθαι, εγω ειμι] </span></span>. It is important to observe the distinction between the two verbs. Abraham 's life was under the conditions of time, and therefore had a temporal beginning. Hence, Abraham came into being, or was born [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεσθαι] </span></span>. Jesus ' life was from and to eternity. Hence the formula for absolute, timeless existence, I am [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω ειμι] </span></span>.
