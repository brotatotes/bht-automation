Reviled [ελοιδορησαν] . The verb means to reproach or scold in a loud and abusive manner. Calvin, on 1 Corinthians 4:12, "being reviled we bless," remarks : "Loidoria is a harsher railing, which not only rebukes a man, but also sharply bites him, and stamps him with open contumely. Hence loidorein is to wound a man as with an accursed sting." His disciple [μαθητης εκεινου] . Literally, that man's disciple. The pronoun has a contemptuous force which is not given by his.
