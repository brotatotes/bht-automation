<p>Reviled [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελοιδορησαν] </span></span>. The verb means to reproach or scold in a loud and abusive manner. Calvin, on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:12">1 Corinthians 4:12</span>, "being reviled we bless," remarks : "Loidoria is a harsher railing, which not only rebukes a man, but also sharply bites him, and stamps him with open contumely. Hence loidorein is to wound a man as with an accursed sting." </p>
<p>His disciple [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαθητης εκεινου] </span></span>. Literally, that man's disciple. The pronoun has a contemptuous force which is not given by his.</p>
