<p>We know. Here the pronoun is not expressed, and the we is not emphatic, like the pronouns in vv. 24, 29, but expresses the common information of all concerning a familiar fact. </p>
<p>A worshipper of God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεοσεβης] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. The kindred word, qeosebeia, godliness, occurs only at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:10">1 Timothy 2:10</span>. Compounded with Qeov, God, and sebomai, to worship, the same verb which appears in eujsebhv, devout (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:2">Acts 10:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:7">Acts 10:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:12">Acts 22:12</span>), and eujsebeia, godliness (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:12">Acts 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:2">1 Timothy 2:2</span>, etc.). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:3">2 Peter 1:3</span>. These two latter words, while they may mean reverence toward God, may also mean the due fulfillment of human relations; while qeosebhv, worshipper of God, is limited to piety towards God.</p>
