<p>I must work [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμε δει εργαζεσθαι] </span></span>. The best texts read hJmav, us, instead of ejme, me. Literally, it is necessary for us to work. The disciples are thus associated by Jesus with Himself. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:11">John 3:11</span>. </p>
<p>Sent me, not us. The Son sends the disciples, as the Father sends the Son.</p>
