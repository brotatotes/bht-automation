<p>Woe [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουαι] </span></span>. Often used by our Lord, but never elsewhere except here and in Revelation. The expression in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:16">1 Corinthians 9:16</span> is different. There the word is not used as an imprecation, but almost as a noun : "Woe is unto me" So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ho+9:12">Hosea 9:12</span> (Sept.). </p>

Gainsay is a literal translation, being compounded of the Anglo - Saxon gegn, which reappears in the German gegen, against, and say. </p>
<p>Korah. Who spake against Moses (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:3">Numbers 16:3</span>). The water which Moses brought from the rock at Kadesh was called the water of Meribah (Strife), or, in Septuagint, Greek, the water of contradiction.</p>
