<p>Spots [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπιλαδες] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. So rendered in A. V., because understood as kindred to spiloi (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:13">2 Peter 2:13</span>); but rightly, as Rev., hidden rocks. So Homer, (" Odyssey, "3, 298)," the waves dashed the ship against the rocks [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπιλαδεσσιν] </span></span>. " See on deceivings, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:13">2 Peter 2:13</span>. These men were no longer mere blots, but elements of danger and wreck. </p>
<p>When they feast with you. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:13">2 Peter 2:13</span>. </p>
<p>Feeding [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμαινοντες] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:2">1 Peter 5:2</span>. Lit., shepherding themselves; and so Rev., shepherds that feed themselves; further their own schemes and lusts instead of tending the flock of God. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+56:11">Isaiah 56:11</span>. </p>
<p>Without fear [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφοβως] </span></span>. Of such judgments as visited Ananias and Sapphira. Possibly, as Lumby suggests, implying a rebuke to the Christian congregations for having suffered such practices. </p>
<p>Clouds without water. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:17">2 Peter 2:17</span>, springs without water. As clouds which seem to be charged with refreshing showers, but are born past [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραφερομεναι</span></span>] and yield no rain. </p>
<p>Whose fruit withereth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθινοπωρινα] </span></span>. From fqinw or fqiw, to waste away, pine, and ojpwra, autumn. Hence, literally, pertaining to the late autumn, and rightly rendered by Rev., autumn (trees). The A. V. is entirely wrong. Wyc., harvest trees. Tynd., trees without fruit at gathering - time. Twice dead. Not only the apparent death of winter, but a real death; so that it only remains to pluck them up by the roots.</p>
