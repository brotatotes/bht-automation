<p>Separate themselves [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδιοριζοντες] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. Themselves is unnecessary. Better, as Rev., make separations; i e., cause divisions in the church. The verb is compounded with ajpo, away; dia, though; orov, a boundary line. Of those who draw a line through the church and set off one part from another. </p>
<p>Sensual [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχικοι] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:30">Mark 12:30</span>. As yuch denotes life in the distinctness of individual existence, "the center of the personal being, the I of each individual," so this adjective derived from it denotes what pertains to man as man, the natural personality as distinguished from the renewed man. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14">1 Corinthians 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:44">1 Corinthians 14:44</span>. The rendering sensual, here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:15">James 3:15</span>, is inferential : sensual because natural and unrenewed. In contrast with this is The spirit. The higher spiritual life. So the adjective pneumatikov, spiritual, is everywhere in the New Testament opposed to yucikov, natural. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:44">1 Corinthians 14:44</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:46">1 Corinthians 14:46</span>.</p>
