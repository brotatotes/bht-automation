<p>First estate [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχην] </span></span>. The word originally signifies beginning, and so frequently in New Testament, mostly in the Gospels, Acts, Hebrews, Catholic Epistles, and Revelation. From this comes a secondary meaning of sovereignty, dominion, magistracy, as being the beginning or first place of power. So mostly by Paul, as principalities (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:38">Romans 8:38</span>); rule (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:24">1 Corinthians 14:24</span>). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:11">Luke 12:11</span>, magistrates; Rev., rulers; and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:20">Luke 20:20</span>, power. Rev., rule. A peculiar use of the word occurs at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1">Acts 10:1</span>, "the sheet knit at the four corners [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχαις] </span></span>;" the corners being the beginnings of the sheet. In this passage the A. V. has adopted the first meaning, beginning, in its rendering first estate. Rev. adopts the second, rendering principality. The Jews regarded the angels as having dominion over earthly creatures; and the angels are often spoken of in the New Testament as ajrcai, principalities; as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:38">Romans 8:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21">Ephesians 1:21</span>; so that this term would be appropriate to designate their dignity, which they forsook. </p>
<p>Habitation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικητηριον] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:2">2 Corinthians 5:2</span>. </p>
<p>Everlasting [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιδιοις] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>. For a longer form ajeidiov, from ajei, always. </p>
<p>Under darkness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο ζοφον] </span></span>. under carries the sense of the darkness brooking over the fallen spirits. On darkness, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:4">2 Peter 2:4</span>. Compare Heriod : </p>
