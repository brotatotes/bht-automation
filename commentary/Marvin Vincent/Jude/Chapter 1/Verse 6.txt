First estate [αρχην] . The word originally signifies beginning, and so frequently in New Testament, mostly in the Gospels, Acts, Hebrews, Catholic Epistles, and Revelation. From this comes a secondary meaning of sovereignty, dominion, magistracy, as being the beginning or first place of power. So mostly by Paul, as principalities (Romans 8:38); rule (1 Corinthians 14:24). Compare Luke 12:11, magistrates; Rev., rulers; and Luke 20:20, power. Rev., rule. A peculiar use of the word occurs at Acts 10:1, "the sheet knit at the four corners [αρχαις] ;" the corners being the beginnings of the sheet. In this passage the A. V. has adopted the first meaning, beginning, in its rendering first estate. Rev. adopts the second, rendering principality. The Jews regarded the angels as having dominion over earthly creatures; and the angels are often spoken of in the New Testament as ajrcai, principalities; as Romans 8:38; Ephesians 1:21; so that this term would be appropriate to designate their dignity, which they forsook. Habitation [οικητηριον] . Only here and 2 Corinthians 5:2. Everlasting [αιδιοις] . Only here and Romans 1:20. For a longer form ajeidiov, from ajei, always. Under darkness [υπο ζοφον] . under carries the sense of the darkness brooking over the fallen spirits. On darkness, see on 2 Peter 2:4. Compare Heriod : "There the Titanian gods, to murky gloom Condemned by will of cloud - collecting Jove, Lie hid in region foul." Theogony, 5, 729.
