<p>Yet [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεντοι] </span></span>. Not rendered by A. V., but expressing that though they have these fearful examples before them, yet they persist in their sin. Dominion - dignities [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριοτητα - δοξας] </span></span>. It is not easy to determine the exact meaning of these two terms. Kuriothv, dominion, occurs in three other passages, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21">Ephesians 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:10">2 Peter 2:10</span>. In the first two, and probably in the third, the reference is to angelic dignities. Some explain this passage and the one in Peter, of evil angels. In Colossians the term is used with thrones, principalities, and powers, with reference to the orders of the celestial hierarchy as conceived by Gnostic teachers, and with a view to exalt Christ above all these. Glories or dignities is used in this concrete sense only here and at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:10">2 Peter 2:10</span>.</p>
