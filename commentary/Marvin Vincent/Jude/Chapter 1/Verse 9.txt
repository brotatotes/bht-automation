<p>Michael the archangel. Here we strike a peculiarity of this epistle which caused its authority to be impugned in very early times, viz., the apparent citations of apocryphal writings. The passages are vv. 9, 14, 15. This reference to Michael was said by Origen to be founded on a Jewish work called "The Assumption of Moses," the first part of which was lately found in an old Latin translation at Milan; and this is the view of Davidson, so far at least as the words "the Lord rebuke thee" are concerned. Others refer it to <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:1">Zechariah 3:1</span>; but there is nothing there about Moses ' body, or Michael, or a dispute about the body. Others, again, to a rabbinical comment on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+34:6">Deuteronomy 34:6</span>, where Michael is said to have been made guardian of Moses ' grave. Doubtless Jude was referring to some accepted story or tradition, probably based on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+34:6">Deuteronomy 34:6</span>. For a similar reference to tradition compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:8">2 Timothy 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:22">Acts 7:22</span>. Michael. Angels are described in scripture as forming a society with different orders and dignities. This conception is developed in the books written during and after the exile, especially Daniel and Zechariah. Michael (Who is like God ?) is one of the seven archangels, and was regarded as the special protector of the Hebrew nation. He is mentioned three times in the Old Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+10:13">Daniel 10:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+10:21">Daniel 10:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1">Daniel 12:1</span>), and twice in the New Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:9">Jude 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+12:7">Revelation 12:7</span>). He is adored as a saint in the Romish Church. For legends, see Mrs. Jameson, "Sacred and Legendary Art," 1, 94 sq. </p>
<p>A railing accusation (krisin blasfhmiav). Lit., a judgment of railing; a sentence savoring of impugning his dignity. Michael remembered the high estate from which he fell, and left his sentence to God.</p>
