<p>Forasmuch as [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επειδηπερ] </span></span>. Only ere in New Testament. A compound conjuction : ejpei, since, dh, as is well known, and per, giving the sense of certainty. </p>
<p>Have taken in hand [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεχειρησαν] </span></span>. Used by Luke only. A literal translation. The word carries the sense of a difficult undertaking (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:13">Acts 19:13</span>), and implies that previous attempts have not been successful. It occurs frequently in medical language. Hippocrates begins one of his medical treatises very much as Luke begins his gospel. "As many as have taken in hand [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεχειρησαν</span></span>] to speak or to write concerning the healing art." </p>
<p>To set forth in order [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναταξασθαι] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. The A. V. is true to the core of the word, which is tassw, to put in order, or arrange. Rev. happily gives the force of the preposition ajna, up, by the rendering draw up. </p>
<p>A declaration [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διηγησιν] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. From dia, through, and hJgeomai, to lead the way. Hence something which leads the reader through the mass of facts : a narrative, as A. V., with the accompanying idea of thoroughness. Note the singular number. Many took in hand to draw up, not narratives, but a narrative, embracing the whole of the evangelic matter. The word was particularly applied to a medical treatise. Galen applies it at least seventy three times to the writings of Hippocrates. </p>
<p>Which are most surely believed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των πεπληροφορημενων] </span></span>. From plhrhv, full, and forew, the frequentative form of ferw, to bring, meaning to bring frequently or habitually. Hence, to bring full measure; to fulfil. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:5">2 Timothy 4:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:17">2 Timothy 4:17</span>. Also of full assurance. Applied to persons. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:21">Romans 4:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:22">Hebrews 5:22</span>. As applied to things, therefore, the sense of the A. V. is inadmissible. Render as Rev., have been fulfilled. The word is chosen to indicate that these events happened in accordance with a preconceived design. Wyc., been filled in us. </p>
<p>Among us. Explained by the words in the next sentence, who were eye witnesses and ministers.</p>
