<p>Is heard [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισηκουσθη] </span></span>. If we render the aorist literally, was heard, we avoid the question as to what prayer is referred to. The reference is to the prayer for offspring, which, owing to his extreme years, Zacharias had probably ceased to offer, and which he certainly would not be preferring in that public and solemn service. Hence the aorist is appropriate, referring back to the past acts of prayer. "The prayer, which thou no longer offerest, was heard." </p>
<p>John. Meaning God is favorable, or Jehovah showeth grace.</p>
