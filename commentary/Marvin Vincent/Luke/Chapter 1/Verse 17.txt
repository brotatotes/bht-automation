Wisdom [φρονησει] . Wyc., prudence. This is a lower word than sofia, wisdom (see on James 3:13). It is an attribute or result of wisdom, and not necessarily in a good sense, though mostly so in the New Testament.. Compare, however, the use of the kindred word fronimov in Romans 11:25; Romans 12:16 : wise in your own conceits; and the adverb fronimwv, wisely, of the unjust steward, Luke 16:8. It is practical intelligence, which may or may not be applied to good ends. Appropriate here as a practical term corresponding to disobedient. Prepared [κατασκευασμενον] . Adjusted, disposed, placed in the right moral state.
