<p>Wisdom [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρονησει] </span></span>. Wyc., prudence. This is a lower word than sofia, wisdom (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:13">James 3:13</span>). It is an attribute or result of wisdom, and not necessarily in a good sense, though mostly so in the New Testament.. Compare, however, the use of the kindred word fronimov in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:25">Romans 11:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:16">Romans 12:16</span> : wise in your own conceits; and the adverb fronimwv, wisely, of the unjust steward, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:8">Luke 16:8</span>. It is practical intelligence, which may or may not be applied to good ends. Appropriate here as a practical term corresponding to disobedient. Prepared [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατασκευασμενον] </span></span>. Adjusted, disposed, placed in the right moral state.</p>
