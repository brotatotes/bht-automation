Conceived [συνελαβεν] . Mr. Hobart (" Medical Language of Luke ") says that the number of words referring to pregnancy, barrenness, etc., used by Luke, is almost as large as that used by Hippocrates. Compare Luke 1:31; Luke 1:24; Luke 2:5; Luke 1:7; Luke 20:28. All of these, except Luke 1:24, are peculiar to himself, and all, of course, in common use among medical writers. Hid [περιεκρυβεν] . Only here in New Testament. Peri signifies completely; entire seclusion.
