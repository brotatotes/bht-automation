<p>Gabriel. The annunciation and the angel Gabriel are favorite themes with Dante, and he pictures them with exquisite beauty. Thus both appear on the sculptured wall which flanks the inner side of the purgatorial ascent. </p>
<p>"The angel who came down to earth with tidings Of peace that had been wept for many a year, And opened heaven from its long interdict, In front of us appeared so truthfully There sculptured in a gracious attitude, He did not seem an image that is silent. One would have sworn that he was saying Ave! For she was there in effigy portrayed Who turned the key to ope the exalted love, And in her mien this language had impressed, Ecce ancilla Dei! as distinctly As any figure stamps itself in wax." Purgatory, 10, 34 - 45. </p>
<p>In Paradise Gabriel appears as a light circling round the Virgin and singing : </p>
<p>"I am angelic love, that circle round The joy sublime which breathes out from the womb That was the hostelry of our desire; And I shall circle, Lady of heaven, while Thou followest thy Son, and mak'st diviner The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there." </p>
<p>Paradise, 23, 103 - 108. </p>
<p>And again : </p>
<p>"And the same love that first descended then, Ave Maria gratia plena singing, In front of her his wings expanded wide." </p>
<p>Paradise, 32, 94 - 96.</p>
