Thou that art highly favored [κεχαριτωμενη] . Lit., as Rev. in margin, endued with grace. Only here and Ephesians 1:6. The rendering full of grace, Vulgate, Wyc., and Tynd., is therefore wrong. All the best texts omit blessed art thou among women. Cast in her mind [διελογιζετο] . See on James 2:4. The imperfect tense, "began to reason."
