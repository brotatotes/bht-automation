Grace [χαριν] . From the same root as cairw, to rejoice. 1. Primarily that which gives joy or pleasure; and hence outward beauty, loveliness, something which delights the beholder. Thus Homer, of Ulysses going to the assembly : "Athene shed down manly grace or beauty upon him" (Odyssey, "2 12); and Septuagint, Psalms 45:3," grace is poured into thy lips. " See also Proverbs 1:9; Proverbs 3:22. Substantially the same idea, agreeableness, is conveyed in Luke 4:22, respecting the gracious words, lit., words of grace, uttered by Christ. So Ephesians 4:29. 2. As a beautiful or agreeable sentiment felt and expressed toward another; kindness, favor, good will. 2 Corinthians 8:6, 2 Corinthians 8:7, 2 Corinthians 8:9; 2 Corinthians 9:8; Luke 1:30; Luke 2:40; Acts 2:47. So of the responsive sentiment of thankfulness. See Luke 6:32, Luke 6:33, Luke 6:34; Luke 17:9; but mostly in the formula thanks to God; Romans 6:17; 1 Corinthians 14:57; 2 Corinthians 2:14; 2 Timothy 1:3. 3. The substantial expression of good will; a boon, a favor, a gift; but not in New Testament. See Romans 5:15, where the distinction is made between cariv, grace, and dwrea ejn cariti, a gift in grace. So a gratification or delight, in classical Greek only; as the delight in battle, in sleep, etc. 4. The higher Christian signification, based on the emphasis of freeness in the gift or favor, and, as commonly in New Testament, denoting the free, spontaneous, absolute loving kindness of God toward men, and so contrasted with debt, law, works, sin. The word does not occur either in Matthew or Mark.
