<p>Grace [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριν] </span></span>. From the same root as cairw, to rejoice. </p>
<p>1. Primarily that which gives joy or pleasure; and hence outward beauty, loveliness, something which delights the beholder. Thus Homer, of Ulysses going to the assembly : "Athene shed down manly grace or beauty upon him" (Odyssey, "2 12); and Septuagint, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:3">Psalms 45:3</span>," grace is poured into thy lips. " See also <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+1:9">Proverbs 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:22">Proverbs 3:22</span>. Substantially the same idea, agreeableness, is conveyed in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:22">Luke 4:22</span>, respecting the gracious words, lit., words of grace, uttered by Christ. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:29">Ephesians 4:29</span>. </p>
<p>2. As a beautiful or agreeable sentiment felt and expressed toward another; kindness, favor, good will. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6">2 Corinthians 8:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:7">2 Corinthians 8:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:9">2 Corinthians 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:8">2 Corinthians 9:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:30">Luke 1:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:40">Luke 2:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:47">Acts 2:47</span>. So of the responsive sentiment of thankfulness. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:32">Luke 6:32</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:33">Luke 6:33</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:34">Luke 6:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:9">Luke 17:9</span>; but mostly in the formula thanks to God; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:17">Romans 6:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:57">1 Corinthians 14:57</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:14">2 Corinthians 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:3">2 Timothy 1:3</span>. </p>
<p>3. The substantial expression of good will; a boon, a favor, a gift; but not in New Testament. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span>, where the distinction is made between cariv, grace, and dwrea ejn cariti, a gift in grace. So a gratification or delight, in classical Greek only; as the delight in battle, in sleep, etc. </p>
<p>4. The higher Christian signification, based on the emphasis of freeness in the gift or favor, and, as commonly in New Testament, denoting the free, spontaneous, absolute loving kindness of God toward men, and so contrasted with debt, law, works, sin. The word does not occur either in Matthew or Mark.</p>
