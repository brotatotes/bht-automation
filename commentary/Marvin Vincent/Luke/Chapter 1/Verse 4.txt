<p>Mightest know [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγνως] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:16">Matthew 7:16</span>. With the idea of full knowledge; or, as regards Theophilus, of more accurate knowledge than is possible from the many who have undertaken the narration. </p>
<p>Certainty [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασφαλειαν] </span></span>. From aj, not, and sfallomai, to fall. Hence steadfastness, stability, security against error. </p>
<p>Wast instructed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηχηθης] </span></span>. From kathcew, to resound; to teach by word of mouth; and so, in Christian writers, to instruct orally in the elements of religion. It would imply that Theophilus had, thus far, been orally instructed. See on delivered, verse 2. The word catechumen is derived from it. </p>
<p>Things [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογων] </span></span>. Properly words (so Wyc.), which Rev. gives in margin. If the word can mean thing at all, it is only in the sense of the thing spoken of; the subject or matter of discourse, in which sense it occurs often in classical Greek. Some render it accounts, histories; others, doctrines of the faith. Godet translates instruction, and claims that not only the facts of the gospel, but the exposition of the facts with a view to show their evangelical meaning and to their appropriation by faith, are included in the word. There is force in this idea; and if we hold to the meaning histories, or even words, this sense will be implied in the context. Luke has drawn up his account in order that Theophilus may have fuller knowledge concerning the accounts which he has heard by word of mouth. That his knowledge may go on from the facts. to embrace their doctrinal and evangelical import; that he may see the facts of Jesus ' life and ministry as the true basis of the Gospel of salvation. </p>
