She spake out with a loud voice [ανεφωνησε φωνη μεγαλη] . For fwnh, voice, read kraugh, cry : inarticulate, though fwnh may also be used of inarticulate utterance. Rev., rightly, She lifted up her voice with a loud cry; thus rendering in the verb the force of ajna, up, besides picturing the fact more naturally. Elizabeth's sudden and violent emotion at the appearance of Mary, and the movement of the child, prompted an exclamation which was followed by words (eipen, said). The verb ajnafwnew occurs only here in the New Testament. It was a medical term for a certain exercise of the voice.
