<p>Said [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπεν] </span></span>. Simply. Compare verse 42. "Elizabeth's salutation was full of excitement, but Mary 's hymn breathes a sentiment of deep inward repose" (Godet). Compare the song of Hannah (1 Samual 2). Hannah 's song differs from Mary 's in its sense of indignation and personal triumph compared with Mary 's humility and calmness. </p>
<p>My soul - spirit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχηπνευμα] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:30">Mark 12:30</span>. The soul is the principle of individuality, the seat of personal impressions, having a side in contact with the material element of humanity, as well as with the spiritual element. It is thus the mediating organ between the spirit and the body, receiving impressions from without and from within, and transmitting them by word or sign. Spirit is the highest, deepest, noblest part of our humanity, the point of contact between God and man.</p>
