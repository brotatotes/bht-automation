<p>Course [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφημεριας] </span></span>. Lit., daily service. The college of priests was divided into twenty four courses. Each of these did duty for eight days, from one Sabbath to another, once every six months. The service of the week was subdivided among the various families which constituted a course. On Sabbaths the whole couse was on duty. On feast days any priest might come up and join in the ministrations of the sanctuary; and at the Feast of Tabernacles all the twenty four courses were bound to be present and officiate. The course of Abijah was the eith of the twenty four. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ch+24:10">1 Chronicles 24:10</span>.</p>
