Mercy [ελεος] . The word emphasizes the misery with which grace (see on verse 30) deals; hence, peculiarly the sense of human wretchedness coupled with the impulse to relieve it, which issues in gracious ministry. Bengel remarks, "Grace takes away the fault, mercy the misery." From generation to generation [εις γενεας και γενεας] . Lit., as Rev., unto generations and generations. Fear [φοβουμενος] . The word is used in both a good and a bad sense in the New Testament. For the latter, see Matthew 21:46; Mark 6:20; Mark 11:32; Luke 12:4. For the former, as here, in the sense of godly reverence, Acts 10:2, Acts 10:22, Acts 10:35; Colossians 3:22; Revelation 14:7; Revelation 14:4.
