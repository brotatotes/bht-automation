<p>In the imagination [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διανοια] </span></span>. The faculty of thought, understanding, especially moral understanding. Wyc. refers the word here to God : with mind of his heart. Some prefer to render "by the imagination," thus making the proud the instrument of their own destruction.
