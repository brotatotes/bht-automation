Shewed strength [εποιησεν κρατος] . Lit., made strength. So Wyc., made might. A Hebrew form of expression. Compare Psalms 118:15, Sept. : "The right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly" (ejpoihse dunamin, made strength). In the imagination [διανοια] . The faculty of thought, understanding, especially moral understanding. Wyc. refers the word here to God : with mind of his heart. Some prefer to render "by the imagination," thus making the proud the instrument of their own destruction. Compare 2 Corinthians 10:5.
