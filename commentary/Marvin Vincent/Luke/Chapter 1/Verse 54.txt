<p>Hath holpen [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντελαβετο] </span></span>. The verb means to lay hold on : thence to grasp helpfully or to help. To lay hold in the sense of partaking (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:2">1 Timothy 6:2</span>), carries us back to the primitive meaning of the word according to its composition : to receive instead of, or in return [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντι] </span></span>, and suggests the old phrase to take up for, espouse the cause of. Wyc., has took up, but probably not in this sense. </p>
<p>Servant [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδος] </span></span>. Often child, son or daughter, but here servant, in allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+41:8">Isaiah 41:8</span>. Meyer truthfully says that the theocratic notion of sonship is never expressed by paiv. See Rev., <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:13">Acts 3:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:26">Acts 3:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:27">Acts 4:27</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:30">Acts 4:30</span>.</p>
