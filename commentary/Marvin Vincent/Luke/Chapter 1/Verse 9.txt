<p>His lot was [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαχε] </span></span>. Four lots were drawn to determine the order of the ministry of the day : the first, before daybreak, to designate the priests who were to cleanse the altar and prepare its fires; the second for the priest who was to offer the sacrifice and cleanse the candlestick and the altar of incense; the third for the priest who should burn incense; and the fourth appointing those who were to lay the sacrifice and meat offering on the altar, and pour out the drink offering. There are said to have been twenty thousand priests in Christ 's time, so that no priest would ever offer incense more than once. </p>
<p>Temple [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναον] </span></span>. The sanctuary. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:5">Matthew 4:5</span>. </p>
<p>Burn incense [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυμιασαι] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. The incensing priest and his assistans went first to the altar of burnt offering, and filled a golden censer with incense, and placed burning coals from the altar in a golden bowl. As they passed into the court from the Holy Place they struck a large instrument called the Magrephah, which summoned all the ministers to their places. Ascending the steps to the holy place, the priests spread the coals on the golden altar, and arranged the incense, and the chief officiating priest was then left alone within the Holy Place to await the signal of the president to burn the incense. It was probably at this time that the angel appeared to Zacharias. When the signal was given, the whole multitude withdrew from the inner court, and fell down before the Lord. Silence pervaded the temple, while within, the clouds of incense rose up before Jehovah. (For a more detailed account see Edersheim, "The Temple, its Ministry," etc.).</p>
