Appointed [ανεδειξεν] . Used by Luke only. Lit., to lift up and shew, as Acts 1:24 : "Shew which one thou hast chosen." Hence to proclaim any one elected to an office. See on the kindred noun, shewing, ch. 1 80. Other seventy. Wrong; for he had not appointed seventy previously. Rev., rightly, seventy others, with reference to the twelve.
