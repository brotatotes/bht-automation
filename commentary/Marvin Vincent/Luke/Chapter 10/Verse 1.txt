<p>Appointed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεδειξεν] </span></span>. Used by Luke only. Lit., to lift up and shew, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:24">Acts 1:24</span> : "Shew which one thou hast chosen." Hence to proclaim any one elected to an office. See on the kindred noun, shewing, ch. 1 80. Other seventy. Wrong; for he had not appointed seventy previously. </p>
<p>Rev., rightly, seventy others, with reference to the twelve.</p>
