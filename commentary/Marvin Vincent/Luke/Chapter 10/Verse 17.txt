The seventy. "The fuller development of the new dispensation begins with the mission of the seventy, and not with the mission of the apostles. Its ground - work, from Luke's point of sight, is the symbolic evangelization of every nation upon earth, and not the restoration of the twelve tribes of Israel. According to Jewish tradition, there were seventy or seventy - two different nations and tongues in the world. In ch. 10 1, some read seventy - two instead of seventy" (Westcott, " Int. to the Study of the Gospels ").
