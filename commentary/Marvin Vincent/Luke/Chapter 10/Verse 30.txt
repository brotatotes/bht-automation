Answering [υπολαβων] . Used by Luke only, and in this sense only here. See on ch. Luke 7:43. It means, strictly, to take up; and hence, of conversation, to take up another's discourse and reply. Fell among. See on James 1:2. Thieves [λησταις] . See on Matthew 26:55; and Luke 23:39-43. These were not petty stealers, but men of violence, as was shown by their treatment of the traveler. The road from Jerusalem to Jericho passed through a wilderness (Joshua 16:1), which was so notorious for robberies and murders that a portion of it was called "the red or bloody way," and was protected by a fort and a Roman garrison. Stripped. Not of his clothing only, but of all that he had. Wounded [πληγας επιθεντες] . Lit., having laid on blows. Blows or stripes is the usual sense of the word in the New Testament. See ch. Luke 12:48; Acts 16:23. It has the metaphorical sense of plagues in Revelation 14:1, Revelation 14:6, Revelation 14:8, etc. Half dead [ημιθανη τυγχανοντα] . The full force of the expression cannot be rendered into English. The word tugcanonta throws an element of chance into the case. Lit., happening to be half dead; or "leaving him half dead, as it chanced;" his condition being a matter of unconcern to these robbers. The word hJmiqanh, half dead, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The best texts, however, omit tugcanonta.
