<p>Answering [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπολαβων] </span></span>. Used by Luke only, and in this sense only here. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:43">Luke 7:43</span>. It means, strictly, to take up; and hence, of conversation, to take up another's discourse and reply. </p>
<p>Fell among. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2">James 1:2</span>. </p>
<p>Thieves [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λησταις] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:55">Matthew 26:55</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:39-43">Luke 23:39-43</span>. These were not petty stealers, but men of violence, as was shown by their treatment of the traveler. The road from Jerusalem to Jericho passed through a wilderness (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jos+16:1">Joshua 16:1</span>), which was so notorious for robberies and murders that a portion of it was called "the red or bloody way," and was protected by a fort and a Roman garrison. </p>
<p>Stripped. Not of his clothing only, but of all that he had. </p>
<p>Wounded [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληγας επιθεντες] </span></span>. Lit., having laid on blows. Blows or stripes is the usual sense of the word in the New Testament. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:48">Luke 12:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:23">Acts 16:23</span>. It has the metaphorical sense of plagues in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6">Revelation 14:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>, etc. </p>
<p>Half dead [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημιθανη τυγχανοντα] </span></span>. The full force of the expression cannot be rendered into English. The word tugcanonta throws an element of chance into the case. Lit., happening to be half dead; or "leaving him half dead, as it chanced;" his condition being a matter of unconcern to these robbers. The word hJmiqanh, half dead, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The best texts, however, omit tugcanonta.</p>
