<p>Bound up [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεδησεν] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. </p>
<p>Wounds [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τραυματα] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. </p>
<p>Pouring in [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιχεων] </span></span>. Rather upon [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι] </span></span>, as Rev. Wine to cleanse, and oil to soothe. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:6">Isaiah 1:6</span>. </p>
<p>Oil and wine. Usual remedies for sores, wounds, etc. Hippocrates prescribes for ulcers, "Bind with soft wool, and sprinkle with wine and oil." </p>
<p>Beast [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτηνος] </span></span>. Perhaps akin to kthma, a possession; since animals anciently constituted wealth, so that a piece of property and a beast were synonymous terms. </p>
<p>Inn [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πανδοχειον] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. From pan, all, and decomai, to receive : a place of common reception. See on inn, ch. 2 7. Remains of two khans, or inn, on the road between Jericho and Jerusalem are mentioned by modern travelers. Porter (" Handbook of Syria and Palestine ") speaks of one about a mile from Bethany, and another farther on, at the most dangerous part of the road, an extensive, ruined caravanserai, called Khan el Almah, situated on the top of a bleak ridge. Concerning the former, Hepworth Dixon (" Holy Land ") says : "About midway in the descent from Bethany to Jericho, in a position commanding a view of the road above and below,.... on the very spot where search would be made for them, if no such ruins were suspected of existing, stands a pile of stones, archways, lengths of wall, which the wandering Arabs call Khan Houdjar, and still make use of as their own resting - place for the night. These ruins are those of a noble inn; the lewan, the fountain, and the court, being plainly traceable in the ruins."</p>
