<p>Salute no man. Oriental salutations are tedious and complicated. The command is suited to a rapid and temporary mission. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ki+4:29">2 Kings 4:29</span>. "These instructions were also intended to reprove another propensity which an Oriental can hardly resist, no matter how urgent his business. If he meets an acquaintance, he must stop and make an endless number of inquiries, and answer as many. If they come upon men making a bargain, or discussing any other matter, they must pause and intrude their own ideas, and enter keenly into the business, though it in nowise concerns them; and, more especially, an Oriental can never resist the temptation to assist when accounts are being settled or money counted out. The clink of coin has a positive fascination to them" (Thomson, " Land and Book ").</p>
