Purse [βαλλαντιον] . Used by Luke only. For money. Scrip (phran). For victuals. Rev., wallet. Shoes. Not that they were to go unshod, but that they were not to carry a change of sandals. See Deuteronomy 29:5; Deuteronomy 33:25. Salute no man. Oriental salutations are tedious and complicated. The command is suited to a rapid and temporary mission. Compare 2 Kings 4:29. "These instructions were also intended to reprove another propensity which an Oriental can hardly resist, no matter how urgent his business. If he meets an acquaintance, he must stop and make an endless number of inquiries, and answer as many. If they come upon men making a bargain, or discussing any other matter, they must pause and intrude their own ideas, and enter keenly into the business, though it in nowise concerns them; and, more especially, an Oriental can never resist the temptation to assist when accounts are being settled or money counted out. The clink of coin has a positive fascination to them" (Thomson, " Land and Book ").
