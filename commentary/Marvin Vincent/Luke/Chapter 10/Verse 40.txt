Was cumbered [περιεσπατο] . Only here in New Testament. The Rev. might better have inserted in the text the marginal rendering, was distracted. The verb means, literally, to draw from around [περι] . Martha 's attention, instead of centering round Jesus, was drawn hither and thither. The peri, around, in composition with the verb, is followed immediately by another peri, "about much serving." Came to him [επιστασα] . Came up to him, as Rev., suddenly stopping in her hurry. Hath left [κατελιπεν] . The aorist, as Rev., did leave, indicating that she had been assisting before she was drawn off by Jesus ' presence. Some read kateleipen, the imperfect, was leaving. Help [συναντιλαβηται] . The verb consists of three elements : lambanw, to take hold; sun, together with; ajnti, reciprocally - doing her part as Martha does hers. It might be paraphrased, therefore, take hold and do her part along with me. It occurs only here and Romans 8:26, of the Spirit helping our infirmities, where all the elements of the verb are strikingly exemplified.
