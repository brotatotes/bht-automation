<p>Was cumbered [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεσπατο] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. The Rev. might better have inserted in the text the marginal rendering, was distracted. The verb means, literally, to draw from around [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περι] </span></span>. </p>
<p>Martha 's attention, instead of centering round Jesus, was drawn hither and thither. The peri, around, in composition with the verb, is followed immediately by another peri, "about much serving." </p>
<p>Came to him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστασα] </span></span>. Came up to him, as Rev., suddenly stopping in her hurry. </p>
<p>Hath left [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατελιπεν] </span></span>. The aorist, as Rev., did leave, indicating that she had been assisting before she was drawn off by Jesus ' presence. Some read kateleipen, the imperfect, was leaving. </p>
<p>Help [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναντιλαβηται] </span></span>. The verb consists of three elements : lambanw, to take hold; sun, together with; ajnti, reciprocally - doing her part as Martha does hers. It might be paraphrased, therefore, take hold and do her part along with me. It occurs only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</span>, of the Spirit helping our infirmities, where all the elements of the verb are strikingly exemplified.</p>
