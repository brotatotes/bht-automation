<p>A house divided against itself falleth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικος επι οικον πιπτει] </span></span>. Some make this an enlargement on the previous sentence - a more detailed description of the general is brought to desolation, and render house falleth upon house. So Rev., margin. It might be taken metaphorically : the divided kingdom is brought to desolation, and its families and households in their party strifes are brought to ruin. Wyc., and an house shall fall on an house. Tynd., one house shall fall upon another.</p>
