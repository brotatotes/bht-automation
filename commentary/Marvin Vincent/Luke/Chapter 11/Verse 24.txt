Dry places [ανυδρων τοπων] . Rev., more literally, waterless. The haunts of evil spirits (Isaiah 13:21, Isaiah 13:22; Isaiah 34:14). By satyrs in these two passages are meant goblins shaped like goats, which were sacrificed to by some of the Israelites (Leviticus 17:7, 2 Chronicles 11:15); a remnant of the Egyptian worship of Mendes or Pan, who, under the figure of a goat, was worshipped by the Egyptians as the fertilizing principle in nature. In Isaiah 34:14, it is said "the screech - owl shall rest there." This is rendered in margin of A. V. and in the Rev., Old Testament, the night - monster (Hebrew, Lilith); and by Cheyne (Isaiah) night - fairy. The reference is to a popular superstition that Lilith, Adam 's first wife, forsook him and became a demon which murdered young children and haunted desert places. Rest. See on Matthew 11:28.
