<p>Dry places [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανυδρων τοπων] </span></span>. Rev., more literally, waterless. The haunts of evil spirits (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:21">Isaiah 13:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:22">Isaiah 13:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+34:14">Isaiah 34:14</span>). By satyrs in these two passages are meant goblins shaped like goats, which were sacrificed to by some of the Israelites (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+17:7">Leviticus 17:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ch+11:15">2 Chronicles 11:15</span>); a remnant of the Egyptian worship of Mendes or Pan, who, under the figure of a goat, was worshipped by the Egyptians as the fertilizing principle in nature. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+34:14">Isaiah 34:14</span>, it is said "the screech - owl shall rest there." This is rendered in margin of A. V. and in the Rev., Old Testament, the night - monster (Hebrew, Lilith); and by Cheyne (Isaiah) night - fairy. The reference is to a popular superstition that Lilith, Adam 's first wife, forsook him and became a demon which murdered young children and haunted desert places. </p>
<p>Rest. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:28">Matthew 11:28</span>.</p>
