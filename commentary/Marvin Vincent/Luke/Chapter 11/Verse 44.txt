<p>Tombs which appear not [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα μνημεια τα αδηλα] </span></span>. Lit., the tombs, the unseen ones. The word adhlov, unapparent, occurs only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:8">1 Corinthians 14:8</span>, of the trumpet giving an uncertain sound. </p>
<p>That walk over [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιπατουντες] </span></span>. The participle, and without the article; and therefore better, as they walk; walk about [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περι</span></span>] on their daily business. In Matthew the sepulchres are whitened, that men may see them and avoid ceremonial defilement. Here they are not seen, and men walking on them are unconsciously defiled. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:27">Matthew 23:27</span>.</p>
