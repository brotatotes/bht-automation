Tombs which appear not [τα μνημεια τα αδηλα] . Lit., the tombs, the unseen ones. The word adhlov, unapparent, occurs only here and 1 Corinthians 14:8, of the trumpet giving an uncertain sound. That walk over [περιπατουντες] . The participle, and without the article; and therefore better, as they walk; walk about [περι] on their daily business. In Matthew the sepulchres are whitened, that men may see them and avoid ceremonial defilement. Here they are not seen, and men walking on them are unconsciously defiled. See on Matthew 23:27.
