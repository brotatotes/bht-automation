<p>Stature [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλικιαν] </span></span>. The original meaning of the word is time of life, age. So, commonly, in classical Greek. See, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:21">John 9:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:23">John 9:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:11">Hebrews 11:11</span>. The other meaning, stature, also occurs. Herodotus speaks of one who was of the same height [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλικιην</span></span>] with another (iii. 16). But both the usage and the connection are in favor of the meaning age. A measure of time is sometimes represented by a measure of length, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+39:5">Psalms 39:5</span>; but, most of all, the addition of a cubit (a foot and a half) to one's stature would not be a small one, as the text implies (that which is least), but a very large one. Moreover, Christ is speaking of food and clothing, the object of which is to foster and prolong life. Rev., age, in margin.</p>
