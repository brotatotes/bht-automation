Be ye of doubtful mind [μετεωριζεσθε] . Only here in New Testament. The verb primarily means to raise to a height; buoy up, as with false hopes; and so to unsettle, or excite, or keep in fluctuation. Thus Thucydides says of the war between Athens and Sparta : "All Hellas was excited [μετεωρος] by the coming conflict between the two chief cities" (ii. 8).
