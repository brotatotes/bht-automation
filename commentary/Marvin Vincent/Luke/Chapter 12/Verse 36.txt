<p>Shall return [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναλυση] </span></span>. The verb means, originally, to unloose : so of vessels, to unloose their moorings and go to sea. Of departing generally. This is its sense in the only other passage where it occurs, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span>, "having a desire to depart, or break up; the metaphor being drawn from breaking up an encampment." Compare departure [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναλυσεως] </span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:6">2 Timothy 4:6</span>. The rendering return is a kind of inference from this : when he shall leave the wedding and return. </p>
<p>Wedding [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των γαμων] </span></span>. Properly, the marriage - feast. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:2">Matthew 22:2</span>.</p>
