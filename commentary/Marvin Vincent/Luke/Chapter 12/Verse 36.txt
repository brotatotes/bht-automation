Shall return [αναλυση] . The verb means, originally, to unloose : so of vessels, to unloose their moorings and go to sea. Of departing generally. This is its sense in the only other passage where it occurs, Philippians 1:23, "having a desire to depart, or break up; the metaphor being drawn from breaking up an encampment." Compare departure [αναλυσεως] , 2 Timothy 4:6. The rendering return is a kind of inference from this : when he shall leave the wedding and return. Wedding [των γαμων] . Properly, the marriage - feast. See on Matthew 22:2.
