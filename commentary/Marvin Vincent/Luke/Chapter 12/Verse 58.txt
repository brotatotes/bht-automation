<p>When thou goest [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως γαρ υπαγεις] </span></span>. The A. V. does not translate gar, for. Rev., correctly, for as thou art going. Their own judgment should show them the necessity of repentance toward God; and this duty is urged under the figure of a debtor who meets his creditor in the way, and whose best policy it is to make terms on the spot. </p>
<p>As thou art in the way. Emphatic, standing first in the Greek order : "On the way give diligence." </p>
<p>Hale [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατασυρη] </span></span>. Drag. Compare haul. Only here in New Testament. </p>
<p>Officer [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρακτορι] </span></span>. From prassw, to effect or accomplish; to bring things to an issue, and hence to exact. The name praktor was given at Athens to an officer charged with the collection of taxes; hence an exactor, as Rev., in margin. Only here in New Testament. </p>
<p>Mite [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεπτον] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:42">Mark 12:42</span>. </p>
