<p>It cannot be [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ενδεχεται] </span></span>. The verb means to accept or admit; so that the sense is, "it is not admissable that."

"It would be contrary to use and wont, and, in a manner, to theocratic decorum, if such a prophet as I should perish elsewhere than in Jerusalem" (Godet).</p>
