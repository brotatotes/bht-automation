<p>These three years I come. The best texts insert ajf ou=, from which, or since. "It is three years from the time at which I came." </p>
<p>Cut it down [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκοψον] </span></span>. Rather, "cut it out" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>] from among the other trees and the vines. </p>

"Not only is it unfruitful, but it draws away the juices which the vines would extract from the earth, intercepts the sun, and occupies room" (Bengel). The verb cumbereth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταργει</span></span>] means to make of no effect. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:3">Romans 3:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:31">Romans 3:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:17">Galatians 3:17</span>. Cumbereth expresses the meaning in a very general and comprehensive way. The specific elements included in it are expressed by Bengel above. De Wette, makes the land unfruitful. See on barren and unfruitful, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:8">2 Peter 1:8</span>.</p>
