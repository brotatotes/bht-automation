And if it bear fruit, well; and if not, then after that. Join after that with bear fruit. "If it bear fruit for the future (eijv to mellon, Rev., thenceforth), well; but if not, thou shalt cut it down." Trench (" Parables ") cites an Arabian writer's receipt for curing a palm - tree of barrenness. "Thou must take a hatchet, and go to the tree with a friend, unto whom thou sayest, 'I will cut down this tree, for it is unfruitful. ' He answers, 'Do not so, this year it will certainly bear fruit. ' But the other says, 'It must needs be - it must be hewn down; ' and gives the stem of the tree three blows with the back of the hatchet. But the other restrains him, crying, 'Nay, do it not, thou wilt certainly have fruit from it this year, only have patience with it, and be not overhasty in cutting it down; if it still refuses to bear fruit, then cut it down. ' Then will the tree that year be certainly fruitful and bear abundantly." Trench adds that this story appears to be widely spread in the East. Thou shalt cut it down. The vine - dresser does not say, "I will cut," but refers that to the master.
