<p>Dinner - supper. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:4">Matthew 22:4</span>. Supper [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειπνον</span></span>] is the principal meal at evening, and corresponding to the modern late dinner. Call not thy friends, etc. A striking parallel occurs in Plato's "Phaedrus," 233. "And, in general, when you make a feast, invite not your friend, but the beggar and the empty soul, for they will love you, and attend you, and come about your doors, and will be the best pleased, and the most grateful, and will invoke blessings on your head."</p>
