Made [εποιει] . Imperfect, was making. His preparations were in progress. A definite act among these preparations is described by the aorist, he bade [εκαλεσεν] , the technical word for inviting to a festival. See Matthew 22:3; John 2:2. Sent his servant. "If a sheikh, bey, or emeer invites, he always sends a servant to call you at the proper time. This servant often repeats the very formula mentioned in Luke 14:17 : Come, for the supper is ready.

"The chief, or some unbreeched youngster of his family, comes up to us with the customary tefaddaloo, or do us the favor" (" Central and Eastern Arabia ").
