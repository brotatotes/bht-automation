<p>Made [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποιει] </span></span>. Imperfect, was making. His preparations were in progress. A definite act among these preparations is described by the aorist, he bade [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαλεσεν] </span></span>, the technical word for inviting to a festival. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:3">Matthew 22:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:2">John 2:2</span>. </p>

This servant often repeats the very formula mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:17">Luke 14:17</span> : Come, for the supper is ready.

It is true now, as then, that to refuse is a high insult to the maker of the feast (Thomson," Land and Book "). Palgrave mentions a similar formula of invitation among the Bedouins of Arabia. "The chief, or some unbreeched youngster of his family, comes up to us with the customary tefaddaloo, or do us the favor" (" Central and Eastern Arabia ").</p>
