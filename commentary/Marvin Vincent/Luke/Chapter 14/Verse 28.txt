Counteth [ψηφιζει] . Only here and Revelation 13:18. From yhfov, a pebble (see Revelation 2:17), used as a counter. Thus Herodotus says that the Egyptians, when they calculate (logizontai yhfoiv, reckon with pebbles), move their hand from right to left (ii. 36). So Aristophanes, "Reckon roughly, not with pebbles [ψηφοις] , but on the hand" (" Wasps, "656). Similarly calculate, from Latin calculus, a pebble. Used also of voting. Thus Herodotus :" The Greeks met at the altar of Neptune, and took the ballots [τας ψηφους] wherewith they were to give their votes. "Plato :" And you, would you vote (an yhfon qeio, cast your pebble) with me or against me? "(" Protagoras," 330). See Acts 26:10. Cost [την δαπανην] . Allied to daptw, to devour. Hence expense, as something which eats up resources. Sufficient [εις απαρτισμον] . Lit., unto completion.
