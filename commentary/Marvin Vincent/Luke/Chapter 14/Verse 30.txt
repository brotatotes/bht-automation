This man [ουτος ο ανθρωπος] . With sarcastic emphasis. Was not able [ουκ ισχυσεν] . From ijscuv, strength. See on power, 2 Peter 2:11. To be strong in body or in resources, and so to be worth, as Lat., valere. "This man was not worth enough, or was not good for the completion." In this latter sense, Matthew 5:13, "good for nothing."
