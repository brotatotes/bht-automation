<p>Filled his belly [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεμισαι την κοιλιαν] </span></span>. The texts vary. The Rev. follows the reading cortasqhnai, "He would fain have been filled," using the same word which is employed by filling those who hunger and thirst after righteousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:6">Matthew 5:6</span>, see note), and of the five thousand (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:20">Matthew 14:20</span>).

<p>Husks [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερατιων] </span></span>. Carob - pods. The word is a diminutive of kerav, a horn, and means, literally, a little horn, from the shape of the pod. The tree is sometimes called in German Bockshornbaum, Goat 's - horn - tree. "The fleshy pods are from six to ten inches long, and one broad, lined inside with a gelatinous substance, not wholly unpleasant to the taste when thoroughly ripe" (Thomson, "Land and Book "). The shell or pod alone is eaten. It grows in Southern Italy and Spain, and it is said that during the Peninsular War the horses of the British cavalry were often fed upon the pods. It is also called Saint John's bread, from a tradition that the Baptist fed upon its fruit in the wilderness. Edersheim quotes a Jewish saying," When Israel is reduced to the carob - tree, they become repentant. "</p>
