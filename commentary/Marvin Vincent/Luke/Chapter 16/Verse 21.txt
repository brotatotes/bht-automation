Desiring [επιθυμων] . Eagerly, and not receiving what he desired. The same thing is implied in the story of the prodigal, where the same word is used, "he would fain have been filled" (ch. 14 16), but the pods did not satisfy his hunger. The crumbs that fell [των πιπτοντων] . Lit., the things falling. The best texts omit yiciwn, crumbs. Moreover [αλλα και] . Lit., but even. "But (instead of finding compassion), even the dogs," etc. Licked [επελειχον] . Only here in New Testament. Cyril, cited by Hobart, says : "The only attention, and, so to speak, medical dressing, which his sores received, was from the dogs who came and licked them."
