Cool [καταψυχειν] . Only here in New Testament. Common in medical language. See on ch. Luke 21:26. Compare the exquisite passage in Dante, where Messer Adamo, the false coiner, horribly mutilated, and in the lowest circle of Malebolge, says : " I had, while living, much of what I wished; And now, alas! a drop of water crave. The rivulets that from the verdant hills Of Cassentin descend down into Arno, Making their channels to be soft and cold, Ever before me stand, and not in vain : For far more doth their image dry me up Than the disease which strips my face of flesh. " Inferno, 30, 65 sq. Tormented [οδυνωμαι] . Used by Luke only. Tormented is too strong. The word is used of the sorrow of Joseph and Mary when the child Jesus was missing (ch. 2 48); and of the grief of the Ephesian elders on parting with Paul (Acts 20:38). Rev., I am in anguish.
