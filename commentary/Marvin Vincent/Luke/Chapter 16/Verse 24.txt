<p>Cool [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταψυχειν] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. Common in medical language. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:26">Luke 21:26</span>. Compare the exquisite passage in Dante, where Messer Adamo, the false coiner, horribly mutilated, and in the lowest circle of Malebolge, says : </p>
<p>" I had, while living, much of what I wished; And now, alas! a drop of water crave. </p>
<p>The rivulets that from the verdant hills Of Cassentin descend down into Arno, Making their channels to be soft and cold, Ever before me stand, and not in vain : For far more doth their image dry me up Than the disease which strips my face of flesh. " Inferno, 30, 65 sq. </p>
<p>Tormented [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδυνωμαι] </span></span>. Used by Luke only. Tormented is too strong. </p>
<p>The word is used of the sorrow of Joseph and Mary when the child Jesus was missing (ch. 2 48); and of the grief of the Ephesian elders on parting with Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:38">Acts 20:38</span>). Rev., I am in anguish.</p>
