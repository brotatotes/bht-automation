<p>Be persuaded. Dives had said, "they will repent." Abraham replies, "they will not be even persuaded." </p>
<p>Though one rose. Dives had said, "if one went." </p>
<p>From the dead [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ νεκρων] </span></span>. Dives had said from the dead, but using a different preposition [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο] </span></span>. It is wellnigh impossible to give the English reader this nice play of prepositions. The general distinction is ajpo, from the outside; ejk, from within. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:4">Luke 2:4</span>, Joseph went up from [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>] Galilee, the province, out of [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>] the city of Nazareth. Abraham 's preposition (ejk, out of) implies a more complete identification with the dead than Dives' ajpo, from. A rising from among the dead was more than a messenger going from the dead. "We can hardly pass over the identity of the name Lazarus with that of him who actually was recalled from the dead; but whose return, far from persuading the Pharisees, was the immediate exciting cause of their crowning act of unbelief" (Alford). </p>
