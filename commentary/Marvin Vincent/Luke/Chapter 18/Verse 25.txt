<p>To go through the eye of a needle [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τρηματος βελονης εισελθειν] </span></span>. Rev., more literally, to enter in through a needle 's eye. Both Matthew and Mark use another word for needle [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραφις] </span></span>; see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:25">Mark 10:25</span>. Luke alone has belonh, which, besides being an older term, is the peculiar word for the surgical needle. The other word is condemned by the Greek grammatrians as barbarous.</p>
