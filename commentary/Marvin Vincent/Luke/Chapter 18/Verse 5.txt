<p>Lest by her continual coming she weary me [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη εις τελος ερχομενη υπωπιαζη με] </span></span>. Eijv telov, lit., unto the end, may mean continually; but weary or wear out for uJpwpiazh is more than doubtful. That word is from uJpwpion, the part of the face under the eyes, and means to strike under the eye; to give one a black eye. It is used only once again, by Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27">1 Corinthians 9:27</span>, and in its literal sense : "I buffet my body;" treat it as the boxer does his adversary. The more literal sense of this word, and of eijv telov, in the end, or finally, give a sound and much livelier meaning here. "Lest at last she come and assault me." So Goebel and Meyer, and so Wyc., "Lest at the last she, coming, strangle me;" and Tynd., "Lest at the last she come and rail on me." The judge fears lest importunity may culminate in personal violence. Perhaps, also, as Goebel suggests, he intentionally exaggerates his fear.</p>
