The descent. Two distinct sights of Jerusalem are caught on this route, an inequality of ground hiding it for a time after one has first seen it. Verse 37 marks the first sight, verse 41 the second and nearer view (see Introduction, on Luke's topographical accuracy). "At this point (the former) the first view is caught of the southeastern corner of the city. The temple and the more northern portions are hid by the slope of Olivet on the right : what is seen is only Mount Zion, now, for the most part, a rough field, crowned with the mosque of David, and the angle of the western walls, but then covered with houses to its base, and surmounted by the castle of Herod, on the supposed site of the palace of David.... It was at this point that the shout of triumph burst forth from the multitude" (Stanley, " Sinai and Palestine ").
