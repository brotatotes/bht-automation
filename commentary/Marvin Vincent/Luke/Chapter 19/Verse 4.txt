<p>Sycamore [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συκομορεαν] </span></span>. From sukh, fig - tree, and moron, the mulberry. The fig - mulberry, resembling the fig in its fruit, and the mulberry in its leaves. Some old writers derived it from mwrov, foolish, because it produced worthless figs. Dr. Thomson says that it bears several crops yearly, which grow on short stems along the trunk and the large branches. They are very insipid, and none but the poorer classes eat them. Hence Amos expresses the fact that he belongs to the humblest class of the community, by calling himself a gatherer of sycamore fruit (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="am+7:14">Amos 7:14</span>). It grows with its large branches low down and wide open, so that Zacchaeus could easily have climbed into it. It is a favorite and pleasant conceit with old commentators that Zacchaeus' sycamore that day bore precious fruit.</p>
