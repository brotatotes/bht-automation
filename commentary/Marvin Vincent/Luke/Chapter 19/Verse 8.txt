The more formal word for standing, applied to the Pharisee in the temple, is here used of the publican. I give. Not, It is my practice to give. Zacchaeus' statement is not a vindication, but a vow. "I now give by way of restoration." If I have taken anything by false accusation [ει τι εσυκοφαντησα] . If - anything does not state a merely possible case, as if Zacchaeus were unconscious of any such extortion; but is a milder way of saying "Whatever I have taken." See on ch. Luke 3:14.

It was common for the publicans to put a fictitious value on property or income, or to advance the tax to those unable to pay, and then to charge usurious interest on the private debt. On the harsh exaction of such debts, see Matthew 18:28; Luke 12:58. Fourfold. The restoration required of a thief (Exodus 22:1).
