Peace, good will toward men [ειρηνη εν ανθρωποις ευδοκια] . Both Tischendorf and Westcott and Hort read eujdokiav, which the Rev. follows. According to this the rendering is, unto men of good pleasure, or as Rev., among men in whom he is well pleased. Wyc., to men of good will. For a similar construction, see Acts 9:15; Colossians 1:13.
