<p>The law of the Lord. The word law occurs in this chapter five times; oftener than in all the rest of this Gospel put together. Luke emphasizes the fact that Jesus "was made under the law" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span>), and accordingly elaborates the details of the fulfilment of the law by the parents of both John and Jesus.</p>
