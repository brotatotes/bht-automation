A pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons. The offering of the poor. While the lamb would probably cost about one dollar and seventy five cents, the doves would cost about sixteen cents. She would not bring the creatures themselves, but would drop the price into one of the thirteen trumpet shaped chests in the Court of the Women. Young pigeons : lit., young ones of pigeons [νοσσους περιστερων] . Wyc. has culver birds; culver being an old English term for dove. So Spenser : "More light than culver in the falcon's fist."
