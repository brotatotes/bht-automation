Devout [ευλαβης] . Used by Luke only. The kindred word, eujlabeia, godly fear, occurs twice : Hebrews 5:7; Hebrews 12:28. From eu, well, and lambanw, to take hold of. Hence of a circumspect or cautious person who takes hold of things carefully. As applied to morals and religion, it emphasizes the element of circumspection, a cautious, careful observance of divine law; and is thus peculiarly expressive of Old Testament piety, with its minute attention to precept and ceremony. Compare Acts 2:5. Consolation of Israel. Compare hope of Israel, Acts 28:20, and Isaiah 41:1. The Messianic blessing of the nation. Of the Messiah himself, Rest. See Isaiah 11:10. A common form of adjuration among the Jews was, So may I see the consolation.
