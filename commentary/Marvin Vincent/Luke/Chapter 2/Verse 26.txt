It was revealed [ην κεχρηματισμενον] . Lit., it was having been revealed; i e., it stood revealed, while he waited for the fulfilment of the revelation. The verb means primarily to have dealings with; thence to consult or debate about business matter; and so of an oracle, to give a response to one consulting it. The word here implies that the revelation to Simeon had been given in answer to prayer. See on Matthew 2:12.
