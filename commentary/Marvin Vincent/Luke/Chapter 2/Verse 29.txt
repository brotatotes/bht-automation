Lettest thou thy servant depart [απολυεις τον δουλον] . Lit., thou dost release. The word is often used of manumitting or setting free on payment of ransom; and as Simeon uses the word for bond servant, it is evident that his death is conceived by him under the figure of enfranchisement from service. Godet's "release of a sentinel from duty" is fanciful. O Lord [δεσποτα] . See on 2 Peter 2:1. In peace. Rev. properly puts this in its emphatic position at the end of the sentence.
