<p>Lettest thou thy servant depart [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολυεις τον δουλον] </span></span>. Lit., thou dost release. The word is often used of manumitting or setting free on payment of ransom; and as Simeon uses the word for bond servant, it is evident that his death is conceived by him under the figure of enfranchisement from service. Godet's "release of a sentinel from duty" is fanciful. </p>
<p>O Lord [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεσποτα] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>. </p>
<p>In peace. Rev. properly puts this in its emphatic position at the end of the sentence.</p>
