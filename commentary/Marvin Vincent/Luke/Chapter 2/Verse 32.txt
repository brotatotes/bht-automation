<p>A light [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φως] </span></span>. The light itself as distinguished from lucnov, a lamp, which the A. V. often unfortunately renders light. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:54">Mark 14:54</span>. To lighten [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις αποκαλυψιν] </span></span>. Wrong. Rev., correctly, for revelation. Wyc., to the shewing. It may be rendered the unveiling of the Gentiles. Gentiles [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνων] </span></span>. Assigned to the same root as eqw, to be accustomed, and hence of a people bound together by like habits or customs. According to biblical usage the term is understood of people who are not of Israel, and who therefore occupy a different position with reference to the plan of salvation. Hence the extension of the gospel salvation to them is treated as a remarkable fact. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:18">Matthew 12:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:21">Matthew 12:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:14">Matthew 24:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:45">Acts 10:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:18">Acts 11:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:6">Acts 18:6</span>. Paul is called distinctively an apostle and teacher of the Gentiles, and a chosen vessel to bear Christ 's name among them. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:9">Acts 14:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:11">Ephesians 2:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:18">Ephesians 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:6">Ephesians 3:6</span>, we see this difference annihilated, and the expression at last is merely historical designation of the non - Israelitish nations which, as such, were formerly without God and salvation. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:4">Romans 16:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span>. Sometimes the word is used in a purely moral sense, to denote the heathen in opposition to Christians. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1">1 Corinthians 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:20">1 Corinthians 10:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:12">1 Peter 2:12</span>. Light is promised here to the Gentiles and glory to Israel. The Gentiles are regarded as in darkness and ignorance. Some render the words eijv ajpokaluyin, above, for the unveiling of the Gentiles, instead of for revelation. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+25:7">Isaiah 25:7</span>. Israel, however, has already received light by the revelation of God through the law and the prophets, and that light will expand into glory through Christ. Through the Messiah, Israel will attain its true and highest glory.</p>
