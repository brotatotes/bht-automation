<p>Them. The parents; the child being separately and specially designated. </p>
<p>Is set [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κειται] </span></span>. The verb means primarily to be laid, and so to lie : hence to be set forth or promulgated, as the law is said to be laid down, and so, appointed or destined, as here. </p>
<p>The fall and rising again (ptwsin kai ajnastasin). For the fall, because he will be a stumbling block to many (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:14">Isaiah 8:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:44">Matthew 21:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:11">Acts 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:23">1 Corinthians 1:23</span>). For the rising, because many will be raised up through him to life and glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:9">Romans 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:6">Ephesians 2:6</span>). The A. V. predicates the falling and the rising of the same persons : the fall and rising again of many. The Rev., the falling and rising up of many, is ambiguous. The American Revisers give it correctly : the falling and the rising. </p>
<p>Which shall be spoken against [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιλεγομενον] </span></span>. The participle is the present; and the expression does not voice a prophecy, but describes an inherent characteristic of the sign : a sign of which it is the character to experience contradiction from the world. In the beginning, as a babe, Jesus experienced this at the hands of Herod; so all through his earthly ministry and on the cross; and so it will be to the end, until he shall have put all enemies under his feet. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:3">Hebrews 12:3</span>. Wyc., a token to whom it shall be gainsaid.</p>
