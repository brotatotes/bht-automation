The verb originally means to make a mutual agreement; and the idea of reciprocity is retained in the expression "to return thanks" for something received. Compare Sept., <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+79:13">Psalms 79:13</span>. Spake. Not a public utterance, for which the words, those that waited, etc., would be inappropriate. It was to the pious ones who were with her in the temple, waiting for the Messiah. </p>
<p>In Jerusalem [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ιερουσαλημ] </span></span>. All the best texts omit ejn, in. Render, as Rev., the redemption of Jerusalem. Nearly equivalent to the consolation of Israel, verse 25. Compare chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:68">Luke 1:68</span>, and see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:2">Isaiah 40:2</span>.</p>
