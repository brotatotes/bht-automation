Understanding [συνεσει] . From sunihmi, to bring together. Hence that quality of mind which combines : understanding not only of facts, but of facts in their mutual relations. See on Mark 12:33; where there is meant "the love of a well pondered and duly considered resolution which determines the whole person; the love which clearly understands itself" [χρεμερ] .
