Amaze is to throw into a maze or labyrinth; and so is closely akin to the Greek word here, and is a faithful rendering. Son [τεκνον] . Lit., child. See on Matthew 1:1. Thy father. "Up to this time Joseph had been so called by the holy child himself; but from this time never" (Alford). Have sought [εζητουμεν] .
