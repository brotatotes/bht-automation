<p>They were amazed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεπλαγησαν] </span></span>. A very strong word; the verb meaning, literally, to strike out or drive away from; and so to drive out of one's senses. Hence in the general sense of great amazement. Amaze is to throw into a maze or labyrinth; and so is closely akin to the Greek word here, and is a faithful rendering. </p>
