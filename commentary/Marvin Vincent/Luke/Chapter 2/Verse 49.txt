<p>And he said. The first saying of Jesus which is preserved to us. Must [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δει] </span></span>. Lit., it is necessary, or it behoves. A word often used by Jesus concerning his own appointed work, and expressing both the inevitable fulfilment of the divine counsels and the absolute constraint of the principle of duty upon himself. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:54">Matthew 26:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:31">Mark 8:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:43">Luke 4:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:22">Luke 9:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:33">Luke 13:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:7">Luke 24:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:26">Luke 24:26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:46">Luke 24:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:14">John 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:4">John 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:34">John 12:34</span>. About my Father 's business [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις του πατρος] </span></span>. Lit., in the things of my Father. The words will bear this rendering; but the Rev. is better, in my Father 's house. Mary 's question was not as to what her son had been doing, but as to where he had been. Jesus, in effect, answers, "Where is a child to be found but in his Father 's house ?"</p>
