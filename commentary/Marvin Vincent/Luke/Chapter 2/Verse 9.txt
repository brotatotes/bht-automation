Behold. Omitted by the best texts. The angel. More correctly an angel, as Rev. The Greek has no article. Came upon [επεστη] . The word is used in this sense in classical Greek, as well as in that of to stand by, which Rev. prefers here, as in Acts 12:7. In verse 38 of this chapter, Rev. renders coming up. The rendering to come upon has a hostile flavor, as properly in Acts 17:5, where the verb is rendered assaulted; so that the Rev. rendering here is preferable. They were sore afraid. Lit., feared with great fear.
