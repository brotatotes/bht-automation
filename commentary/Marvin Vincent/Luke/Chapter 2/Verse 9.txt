<p>Behold. Omitted by the best texts. </p>
<p>The angel. More correctly an angel, as Rev. The Greek has no article. Came upon [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεστη] </span></span>. The word is used in this sense in classical Greek, as well as in that of to stand by, which Rev. prefers here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:7">Acts 12:7</span>. In verse 38 of this chapter, Rev. renders coming up. The rendering to come upon has a hostile flavor, as properly in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</span>, where the verb is rendered assaulted; so that the Rev. rendering here is preferable. They were sore afraid. Lit., feared with great fear.</p>
