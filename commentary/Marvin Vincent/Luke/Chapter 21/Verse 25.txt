Signs [σημεια] . See on Matthew 24:24. Distress [συνοχη] . Only here and 2 Corinthians 2:4. Kindred with sunecomenh, taken (ch. 4 38), on which see note. The original idea of the word is being held in a tight grasp. With perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring. The A. V. follows the reading hjcoushv, the participle, roaring. The proper reading is hjcouv, the noun, the roaring. Render perplexity for the roaring of the sea, etc. 'Hcw, roaring, is properly a returned sound, an echo. Generally a ringing sound, as of the blows on an anvil. Waves [σαλου] . Only here in New Testament. The radical notion of the word is unsteady motion, especially the rolling swell of the sea. Rev., better, billows.
