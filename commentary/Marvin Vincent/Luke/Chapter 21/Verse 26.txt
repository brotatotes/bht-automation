<p>Failing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποψυχοντων] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. The word originally means to leave off breathing; to swoon. Thus Homer, when Laertes recognizes Ulysses : </p>
<p>"He threw Round his dear son his arms. The hardy chief, Ulysses, drew him fainting [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποψυχοντα</span></span>] to his heart." Odyssey, 24, 346. </p>
<p>So also Sophocles, of Hector dragged behind Achilles' chariot : </p>
<p>" He breathed out his life [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεψυξεν βιον] </span></span>. </p>
<p>Ajax, 1031. </p>
<p>Matthew alone uses the simple verb, yucw, to breathe, or blow. See on wax cold, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:12">Matthew 24:12</span>. Luke uses four compounds of this simple verb, all of which are peculiar to him. Compare cool, ch. 16 24; refreshing, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:19">Acts 3:19</span>; gave up the ghost, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:5">Acts 5:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:10">Acts 5:10</span>. </p>
<p>Expectation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσδοκιας] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:11">Acts 12:11</span>. </p>
<p>The world. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:1">Luke 2:1</span>. </p>
<p>Shall be shaken [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαλευθησονται] </span></span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:7">Matthew 11:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:38">Luke 6:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:31">Acts 4:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:26">Hebrews 12:26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:27">Hebrews 12:27</span>. The root of the verb is the same as that of billows, ver 25.</p>
