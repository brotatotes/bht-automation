<p>Overcharged (barhqwsin). Weighed down. Compare ch. 9 32; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:4">2 Corinthians 5:4</span>. </p>
<p>Surfeiting [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραιπαλη] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. Derivation uncertain : akin to the Latin crapula, intoxication. Trench finds an equivalent in fulsomeness, in its original sense of fulness. In the medical writings it is used of drunken nausea or headache. </p>
<p>Drunkenness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεθη] </span></span>. Compare are well drunk, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:10">John 2:10</span>. This and kindred words in the New Testament always refer to intoxication, or that which intoxicates. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:10">John 2:10</span>. </p>
<p>Cares [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεριμναις] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:25">Matthew 6:25</span>. </p>
<p>Of this life [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιωτικαις] </span></span>. The rendering is too general; though it might be difficult to give a better. Biov, life, means life considered either as to its duration (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:3">1 Peter 4:3</span>); the means of support (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:44">Mark 12:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:43">Luke 8:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:4">Luke 21:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:17">1 John 3:17</span>); or the manner of leading it (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:2">1 Timothy 2:2</span>). The meaning here is pertaining to the support or luxury of life; and so in the only other passages where it occurs, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:3">1 Corinthians 6:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:4">1 Corinthians 6:4</span>. The parallel is <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:31">Matthew 6:31</span>. Wyc., business of this life. </p>
<p>Suddenly [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιφνιδιος] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:3">1 Thessalonians 5:3</span>.</p>
