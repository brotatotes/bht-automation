<p>Prayed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδεηθην] </span></span>. See on prayers, ch. 5 33. </p>
<p>Art converted [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστρεψας] </span></span>. Converted is simply the Latinized rendering of the word to turn round [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χονςερτερε] </span></span>. Rev. renders the aorist participle, denoting a definite act, by once : "when once thou hast turned again." </p>
<p>Strengthen [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηρισον] </span></span>. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:25">Luke 16:25</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:10">1 Peter 5:10</span>. Rev., stablish, which is much better. Strengthen may denote only a temporary effect. The word implies fixedness.</p>
