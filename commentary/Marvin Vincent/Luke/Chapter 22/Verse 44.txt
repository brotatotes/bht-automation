Being in an agony [γενομενος εν αγωνια] . There is in the aorist participle a suggestion of a growing intensity in the struggle, which is not conveyed by the simple being. Literally, though very awkwardly, it is, having become in an agony : having progressed from the first prayer (began to pray, ver. 41) into an intense struggle of prayer and sorrow. Wycliffe's rendering hints at this : and he, made in agony, prayed. Agony occurs only here. It is used by medical writers, and the fact of a sweat accompanying an agony is also mentioned by them. More earnestly [εκτενεστερον] . See on fervently, 1 Peter 1:22. Was [εγενετο] . More correctly, as Rev., became. See on genomenov, being, above. Great drops [θρομβοι] . Only here in New Testament : gouts or clots. Very common in medical language. Aristotle mentions a bloody sweat arising from the blood being in poor condition; and Theophrastus mentions a physician who compared a species of sweat to blood.
