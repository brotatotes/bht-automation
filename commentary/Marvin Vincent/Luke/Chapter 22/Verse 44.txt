<p>Being in an agony [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενος εν αγωνια] </span></span>. There is in the aorist participle a suggestion of a growing intensity in the struggle, which is not conveyed by the simple being. Literally, though very awkwardly, it is, having become in an agony : having progressed from the first prayer (began to pray, ver. 41) into an intense struggle of prayer and sorrow. Wycliffe's rendering hints at this : and he, made in agony, prayed. Agony occurs only here. It is used by medical writers, and the fact of a sweat accompanying an agony is also mentioned by them. </p>
<p>More earnestly [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτενεστερον] </span></span>. See on fervently, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22">1 Peter 1:22</span>. Was [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο] </span></span>. More correctly, as Rev., became. See on genomenov, being, above. </p>
<p>Great drops [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θρομβοι] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament : gouts or clots. Very common in medical language. Aristotle mentions a bloody sweat arising from the blood being in poor condition; and Theophrastus mentions a physician who compared a species of sweat to blood.</p>
