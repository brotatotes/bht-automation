I think the text requires that the words should be addressed to the disciples, and taken as the answer to the question, shall we smite, etc. The meaning then is, permit them to go so far as to seize me. The expression thus corresponds with Matthew 26:52. Ear [ωτιου] . This time Luke uses the diminutive. Wyc., little ear. Healed. Only Luke records the healing.
