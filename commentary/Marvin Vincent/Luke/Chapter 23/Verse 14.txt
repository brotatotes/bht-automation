Perverteth [αποστρεφοντα] . Another compound of strefw, to turn; diastrefonta is rendered by the same word in ver. 2. Probably the words are used without any intentional distinction of meaning. Diastrefonta implies more of the idea of distraction (compare Wyc., turning upside down); turning different ways; while ajpostrefonta emphasizes the turning away [απο] of the people from their civil and religious allegiance. So Wyc., turning away. Examined [ανακρινας] . Originally implying a thorough examination; ajna, up, from bottom to top. Technically, of a legal examination.
