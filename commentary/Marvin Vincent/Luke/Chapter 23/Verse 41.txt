<p>Receive. Are receiving would be better. </p>
<p>Amiss [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατοπον] </span></span>. Lit., out of place, and so strange, eccentric, perverse; as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:2">2 Thessalonians 3:2</span>, where it is rendered unreasonable. The expression here answers nearly to our familiar phrase, "has done nothing out of the way." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:6">Acts 28:6</span>; no harm.</p>
