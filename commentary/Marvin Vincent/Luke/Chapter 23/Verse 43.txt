In Paradise [παραδεισω] . Originally an enclosed park, or pleasure - ground. Xenophon uses it of the parks of the Persian kings and nobles. "There (at Celaenae) Cyrus had a palace and a great park [παραδεισος] , full of wild animals, which he hunted on horseback.... Through the midst of the park flows the river Maeander (" Anabasis," 1, 2, 7). And again : "The Greeks encamped near a great and beautiful park, thickly grown with all kinds of trees" (ii. 4, 14.) In the Septuagint, Genesis 2:8, of the garden of Eden. In the Jewish theology, the department of Hades where the blessed souls await the resurrection; and therefore equivalent to Abraham 's bosom (ch. 16 22, 23). It occurs three times in the New Testament : here; 2 Corinthians 12:4; Revelation 2:7; and always of the abode of the blessed. " Where'er thou roam'st, one happy soul, we know, See at thy side in woe, Waits on thy triumph - even as all the blest With him and Thee shall rest. Each on his cross, by Thee we hang awhile, Watching thy patient smile, Till we have learn 'd to say, "Tis justly done, Only in glory, Lord, thy sinful servant own. '" KEBLE, Christian Year. 44 - 46. Compare Matthew 27:45-50; Mark 14:33-37.
