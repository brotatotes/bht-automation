Were the more fierce [επισχυον] . Only here in New Testament. The verb means, literally, to grow strong. See on ch. Luke 14:30; Luke 16:3. Here the sense is, they were more energetic and emphatic. Rev., urgent. Wyc., waxed stronger. Stirreth up [ανασειει] . See on Mark 14:11. The increased urgency is shown by the use of a stronger word than perverteth (ver. 2).
