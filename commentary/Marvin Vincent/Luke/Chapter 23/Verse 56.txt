Returned [υποστρεψασαι] . This word occurs thirty - two times in Luke, and only three times in the rest of the New Testament. It is a significant fact that, reckoning the aggregate space occupied by the four Gospels, nearly one - sixth of the whole amount is occupied with the account of the twenty - four hours beginning with the last supper and ending with the burial of Jesus. There is no day in all Bible history narrated with the fulness of that day. If we possessed the whole life of Christ, written with the same detail, the record would occupy one hundred and eighty volumes as large as the whole Bible. ===Luke 24:0 CHAPTER XXIV 1 - 3. Compare Matthew 28:1; Mark 16:2-4.
