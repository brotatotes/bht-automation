<p>Very early in the morning [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορθρου βαθεως] </span></span>. Lit., at deep dawn, or the dawn being deep. It is not uncommon in Greek to find baquv, deep, used of time; as deep or late evening. Plutarch says of Alexander, that he supped "at deep evening;" i e., late at night. Philo says that the Hebrews crossed the Red Sea "about deep dawn (as here), while others were yet in bed." So Socrates, in prison, asks Crito the time of day. He replies, orqrov baquv, the dawn is deep, i e. breaking (Plato, "Crito," 43). </p>
