Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem [συ μονος παροικεις ιερουσαλημ] . Paroikein, to dwell as a stranger, is used in later Greek of strangers who have no rights of citizenship, and no settled home. Compare Hebrews 11:9. See on strangers, 1 Peter 1:1; and compare sojourning, 1 Peter 1:17. The only of the A. V. is commonly understood adverbially : "Are you nothing but a stranger ?" But the emphasis of the question falls there, and the word is an adjective. Render "Dost thou alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem ?" Are you the only one who sojourns as a stranger in Jerusalem, and who does not know, etc. So, nearly, Wyc., Thou alone art a pilgrim in Jerusalem. Luke 24:18What things [ποια] . Lit., "what kind of things."
