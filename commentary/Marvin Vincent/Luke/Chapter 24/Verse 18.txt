<p>Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ μονος παροικεις ιερουσαλημ] </span></span>. Paroikein, to dwell as a stranger, is used in later Greek of strangers who have no rights of citizenship, and no settled home. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:9">Hebrews 11:9</span>. See on strangers, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span>; and compare sojourning, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:17">1 Peter 1:17</span>. The only of the A. V. is commonly understood adverbially : "Are you nothing but a stranger ?" But the emphasis of the question falls there, and the word is an adjective. Render "Dost thou alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem ?" Are you the only one who sojourns as a stranger in Jerusalem, and who does not know, etc. So, nearly, Wyc., Thou alone art a pilgrim in Jerusalem. </p>
