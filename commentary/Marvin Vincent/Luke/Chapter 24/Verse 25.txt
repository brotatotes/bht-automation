<p>Fools and slow of heart [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοητοι και βραδεις τη καρδια] </span></span>. This is an unfortunate translation, in the light of the ordinary, popular use of the word fool. Jesus would never have called those sorrowful disciples fools in that sense. The word is compounded of aj, not, and noew, which implies, besides seeing, perception of the mind as consequent upon sight. It is therefore equivalent to dull of perception. They had read what the prophets had spoken, but had failed to perceive its application to Christ. While this rebuke relates to the understanding, the following one, slow of heart, goes deeper, and contemplates the region of feeling and moral susceptibility. Your heart is dull and slow to respond to these testimonies of your own prophets. Compare hardness of heart, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:14">Mark 16:14</span>. </p>
<p>All (ejpi pasin). Rev., rightly, in all; relying upon [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι</span></span>] all the utterances of the prophets.</p>
