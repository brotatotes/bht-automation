They went [επορευοντο] . Imperfect, were going. So Rev. Made as though [προσεποιησατο] . The verb means originally to add or attach to; hence to take to one's self what does not belong to him; and so, to pretend; though pretending as implying anything false, does not attach to this act of Jesus. He was going on, and would have gone on but for their invitation. Only here in New Testament.
