Did not our heart burn - while he talked - opened. [ουχι η καρδια ημων καιομενη ην - ως ελαλει - διηνοιγεν] . The A. V., as usual, pays no attention to the graphic imperfects here. They are speaking of something which was in progress : "was not our heart burning (finite verb and participle) while he was speaking, and was opening the scriptures?"
