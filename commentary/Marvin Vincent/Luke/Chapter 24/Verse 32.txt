<p>Did not our heart burn - while he talked - opened. [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχι η καρδια ημων καιομενη ην - ως ελαλει - διηνοιγεν] </span></span>. The A. V., as usual, pays no attention to the graphic imperfects here. They are speaking of something which was in progress : "was not our heart burning (finite verb and participle) while he was speaking, and was opening the scriptures?"</p>
