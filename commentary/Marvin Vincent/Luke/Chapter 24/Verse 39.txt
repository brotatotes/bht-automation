Handle [ψηλαφησατε] . Compare 1 John 1:1. The word occurs also Acts 17:27; Hebrews 12:18. "It never expresses the so handling an object as to exercise a moulding, modifying influence upon it, but at most a feeling of its surface; this, it may be, with the intention of learning its composition (Genesis 27:12, Genesis 27:21, Genesis 27:22); while, not seldom, it signifies no more than a feeling for or after an object, without any actual coming in contact with it at all" (Trench, " Synonyms "). Compare Acts 17:27. Used of groping in the dark, Job 5:14; of the blind, Isaiah 49:10; Deuteronomy 28:29; Jude 1:16:26. See on Hebrews 12:18.
