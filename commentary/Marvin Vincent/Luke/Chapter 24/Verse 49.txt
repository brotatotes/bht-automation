I send [εγω εξαποστελλω] . Rev., better, send forth, giving the force of ejx. I emphatic. Endued with power. The Rev. has properly substituted the simpler clothed, which, to the English reader, conveys the exact figure in the word. This metaphorical sense of clothed is found in classical Greek. Aristophanes has clothes with audacity; Homer, clothed with strength; Plutarch, clothes with nobility and wealth.
