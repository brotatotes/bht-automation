The use of the tenses is graphic. He said, the imperfect, and came forth, the present participle; both denoting action in progress, or customary action; so that the sense is, he kept saying, or he used to say to those who were coming out, to the crowds of people which kept pouring out successively. Compare ejxeporeueto, went out, also imperfect, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:5">Matthew 3:5</span>. Luke gives the substance of the Baptist's preaching summarily. </p>

<p>Warned [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεδειξεν] </span></span>. From upo, under, and deiknumi, to shew. Hence, literally, to shew secretly. The word implies a private or confidential hint or reminder.
