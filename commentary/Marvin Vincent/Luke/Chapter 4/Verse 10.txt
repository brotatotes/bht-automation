<p>To keep [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαφυλαξαι] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. Better as Rev., guard. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:4">1 Peter 1:4</span>. The preposition implies close, careful guarding. The phrase, to guard thee, is wanting in Matthew.</p>
