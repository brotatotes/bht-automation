<p>Had ended all the temptation. Peculiar to Luke. The verb suntelesav, from sun, together, and telew, to accomplish, means to bring to one end together; hence to bring to an end utterly. Better therefore as Rev., completed. The temptations formed a complete cycle, so that it could afterward be said of Jesus that "he was in all points tried like as we are" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>). </p>
<p>All the temptation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα πειρασμον] </span></span>. Incorrect, Rev., rightly, every temptation. So Wyc., Every temptation ended. </p>
<p>For a season [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρι καιρου] </span></span>. Peculiar to Luke. More strictly, until a convenient time; since Satan meant to assail him again, as he did in the person of Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:33">Mark 8:33</span>); by the Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:40">John 8:40</span> sq.); and at Gethsemane. See chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:53">Luke 22:53</span>.</p>
