<p>The book [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιβλιον] </span></span>. A diminutive of biblov, the inner bark of the papyrus, used for writing. Hence, a roll. The word is also used to denote a division of a work, and is therefore appropriate here to mark the writings of a single prophet as related to the whole body of the prophetic writings. Opened [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναπτυξας] </span></span>. Lit., unrolled. Both this and the simple verb ptussw, to close, (verse 30), occure only once in the New Testament. The former word was used in medical language of the opening out of various parts of the body, and the latter of the rolling up of bandages. The use of these terms by Luke the physician is the more significant from the fact that elsewhere in the New Testament ajnoigw, is used for the opening of a book (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+5:2-5">Revelation 5:2-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+10:2">Revelation 10:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+10:8">Revelation 10:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:12">Revelation 20:12</span>) and eijlissw, for rolling it up (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+6:14">Revelation 6:14</span>). </p>
<p>Found. As if by chance : reading at the place where the roll opened of itself, and trusting to divine guidance. </p>
<p>Was written [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην γεγραμμενον] </span></span>. Lit., was having been written; i e., stood written.</p>
