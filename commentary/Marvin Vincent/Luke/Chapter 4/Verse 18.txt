<p>Anointed. See on Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>. </p>
<p>To preach good tidings. See on Gospel, Superscription of Matthew. </p>
<p>To the poor [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πτωχοις] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span>. </p>
<p>To heal the broken hearted. The best texts omit. So Rev. </p>
<p>To preach [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυξαι] </span></span>. Better as Rev., proclaim, as a herald. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span>. </p>
<p>To the captives [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιχμαλωτοις] </span></span>. From aijcmh, a spear point, and aJliskomai, to be taken or conquered. Hence, properly, of prisoners of war. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:7">Isaiah 42:7</span> : "To bring out captives from the prison, and those who sit in darkness from the house of restraint." The allusion is to Israel, both as captive exiles and as prisoners of Satan in spiritual bondage. Wyc. has caytifs, which formerly signified captives. </p>
<p>To set at liberty [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστειλαι] </span></span>. Lit., to send away in discharge. Inserted from the Sept. of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+58:6">Isaiah 58:6</span>. See on chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:3">Luke 3:3</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:15">James 5:15</span>. Them that are bruised [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεθραυσμενους] </span></span>. Lit., broken in pieces. Only here in New Testament. Wyc., to deliver broken men into remission. The same Hebrew word is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:3">Isaiah 42:3</span>. "a crushed seed shall he not break," which the Septuagint translates by teqlasmenon, a word which does not occur in the New Testament. In the citation of this latter passage (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:20">Matthew 12:20</span>, on which see) the word for bruised is suntribw, which the Septuagint uses for break.</p>
