Surely [παντως] . Lit., by all means. Rev., doubtless. Proverb [παραβολην] . Rev., parable. See on Matthew 13:3. Wyc., likeness. Physician, heal thyself. A saying which Luke alone records, and which would forcibly appeal to him as a physician. Galen speaks of a physician who should have cured himself before he attempted to attend patients. The same appeal was addressed to Christ on the cross (Matthew 27:40, Matthew 27:42).
