<p>Proverb [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβολην] </span></span>. Rev., parable. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:3">Matthew 13:3</span>. Wyc., likeness. </p>
<p>Physician, heal thyself. A saying which Luke alone records, and which would forcibly appeal to him as a physician. Galen speaks of a physician who should have cured himself before he attempted to attend patients. The same appeal was addressed to Christ on the cross (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:40">Matthew 27:40</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:42">Matthew 27:42</span>).</p>
