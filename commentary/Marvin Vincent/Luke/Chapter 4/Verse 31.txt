Taught [ην διδασκων] . Correctly, as Rev., was teaching. The finite verb and participle denoting continuance. On the Sabbath - days [τοις σαββασιν] . Rev., day. The word is often used in the plural form for the single day, as in verse 16; probably after the analogy of plural names of festivals, as ta azuma, the feast of unleavened bread; ta genesia, the birthday; or perhaps following the Aramaic plural.
