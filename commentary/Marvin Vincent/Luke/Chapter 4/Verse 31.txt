<p>Taught [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην διδασκων] </span></span>. Correctly, as Rev., was teaching. The finite verb and participle denoting continuance. </p>
<p>On the Sabbath - days [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις σαββασιν] </span></span>. Rev., day. The word is often used in the plural form for the single day, as in verse 16; probably after the analogy of plural names of festivals, as ta azuma, the feast of unleavened bread; ta genesia, the birthday; or perhaps following the Aramaic plural.</p>
