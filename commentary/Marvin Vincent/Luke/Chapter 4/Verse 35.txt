<p>Had thrown [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ριψαν] </span></span>. Used in connection with disease by Luke only, and only here. In medical language, of convulsions, fits, etc. </p>
<p>Hurt him not [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν βλαψαν αυτον] </span></span>. Lit., in no possible way. Mark omits this detail, which a physician would be careful to note. Blaptein, to injure, occurs but twice in New Testament - here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:18">Mark 16:18</span>. It is common in medical language, opposed to wjfelein, to benefit, as of medicines or diet hurting or benefiting.</p>
