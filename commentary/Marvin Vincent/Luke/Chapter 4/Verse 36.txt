They were all amazed [εγενετο θαμβος επι παντας] . Lit., as Rev., amazement came upon all. Qambov, amazement, is used by Luke only. The kindred verb, qambeomai, to be amazed, occurs only once in Luke (Acts 9:6), and three times in Mark; while Mark alone has the strong compound ejkqambew, to be greatly amazed (Mark 9:15).
