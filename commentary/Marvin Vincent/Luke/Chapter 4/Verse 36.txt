<p>They were all amazed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο θαμβος επι παντας] </span></span>. Lit., as Rev., amazement came upon all. Qambov, amazement, is used by Luke only. The kindred verb, qambeomai, to be amazed, occurs only once in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:6">Acts 9:6</span>), and three times in Mark; while Mark alone has the strong compound ejkqambew, to be greatly amazed (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:15">Mark 9:15</span>).</p>
