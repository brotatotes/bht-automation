The fame [ηχος] . Lit., noise. Rev., rumor. Only here, chapter Luke 21:25, where the correct reading is hcouv, the roaring, and Acts 2:2.Hebrews 12:19 is a quotation from the Septuagint. It is the word used in Acts 2:2 of the mighty rushing wind at Pentecost. Mark uses ajkoh, in its earlier sense of a report. The same word occurs in Luke, but always in the sense in which medical writers employed it - hearing or the ears. See chapter Luke 7:1; Acts 17:20; Acts 28:26. Hcov was the medical tem for sound in the ears or head. Hippocrates uses both words together : " the ears [ακοαι] are full of sound [ηχου] ; ' and Aretaeus of the noise of the sea, as Luke 21:25. 38 - 41. Compare Matthew 8:14-17; Mark 1:29-34.
