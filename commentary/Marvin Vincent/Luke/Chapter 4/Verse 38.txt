<p>Taken [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεχομενη] </span></span>. Rev., holden. So Wyc. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>. The word is used nine times by Luke, and only three times elsewhere. Paul uses it of the constraining of Christ 's love (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:14">2 Corinthians 5:14</span>), and of being in a strait (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:8">Acts 28:8</span>, it is joined with fever, as here, and is a common medical term in the same sense. </p>
<p>A great fever [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυρετω μεγαλω] </span></span>. Another mark of the physician. The epithet great is peculiar to Luke. The ancient physicians distinguished fevers into great and small.</p>
