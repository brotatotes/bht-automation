Taken [συνεχομενη] . Rev., holden. So Wyc. See on Matthew 4:24. The word is used nine times by Luke, and only three times elsewhere. Paul uses it of the constraining of Christ 's love (2 Corinthians 5:14), and of being in a strait (Philippians 1:23). In Acts 28:8, it is joined with fever, as here, and is a common medical term in the same sense. A great fever [πυρετω μεγαλω] . Another mark of the physician. The epithet great is peculiar to Luke. The ancient physicians distinguished fevers into great and small.
