Crying out [κραυγαζοντα] . The inarticulate demoniac scream. Saying. The articulate utterance. Hobart (" Medical Language of St. Luke ") remarks that the medical bias of Luke may be seen from the words he abstains from using as well as from those he does use in respect of disease. Thus he never uses malakia for sickness, as Matthew does (iv. 23; 9 35; Matthew 10:1), since this word is never so used in medical language, but is confined to the meaning of delicacy, effeminacy. So, too, he never uses basanizein, to torment, of sickness, as Matthew does (viii. 6), as it is never so used in medical language, the word there meaning to examine some part of the body or some medical question. 42 - 44. Compare Mark 1:35-39.
