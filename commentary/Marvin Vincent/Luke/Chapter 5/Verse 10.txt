<p>Partners [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνοι] </span></span>. In verse 7 the word rendered partners is metocoi; from meta, with, and ecw, to have. The word here denotes a closer association, a common interest. The kindred noun, koinwnia, fellowship, is used of the fellowship of believers with Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:9">1 Corinthians 1:9</span>); the communion of the body and blood of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:16">1 Corinthians 10:16</span>); the communion of the Holy Ghost (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span>). The persons referred to in verse 7 might have been only hired workmen (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:20">Mark 1:20</span>), temporarily associated with the principals. </p>
<p>Thou shalt catch [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εση ζωγρων] </span></span>. Lit., thou shalt be catching, the participle and finite verb denoting that this is to be his habitual calling. Both Matthew and Mark make the promise to be addressed to Peter and his companions; Luke to Peter alone. The verb zwgrew, to catch, is compounded of zwov, living, and ajgreuw, to catch or take. Hence, lit., to take alive : in war, to take captive, instead of killing. Thus Homer, when Menelaus threatens the prostate Adrastus : </p>
<p>"Adrastus clasped the warrior's knees and said, O son of Atreus, take me prisoner" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωγρει] </span></span>. </p>
<p>Iliad, 6, 45, 6; compare Iliad, 5, 378. </p>
<p>So Herodotus : "The Persians took Sardis, and captured Croesus himself alive" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζωγρησαν] </span></span>. - 1 86. There is certainly a reason for the use of this term, as indicating that Christ 's ministers are called to win men to life. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:26">2 Timothy 2:26</span>, where, according to the best supported rendering, the servant of God is represented as taking men alive out of the power of Satan, to be preserved unto the will of God; i e., as instruments of his will (compare A. V. and Rev.). The word thus contains in itself an answer to the sneering remark of the Apostate Julian, that Christ aptly termed his apostles fishers; "for, as the fisherman draws out the fish from waters where they were free and happy, to an element in which they cannot breathe, but must presently perish, so did these." </p>
