He charged [παρηγγειλεν] . A strong word, often, of military orders. Aristotle uses it of a physician : to prescribe. Mark has ejmbrimhsamenov, strictly or sternly charged. See on Mark 1:43. No one [μηδενι] . The conditional negative : no one that he might chance to meet. Go, shew thyself. A lively change from the narrative to direct address.
