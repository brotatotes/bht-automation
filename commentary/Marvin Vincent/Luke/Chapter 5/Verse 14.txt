<p>He charged [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρηγγειλεν] </span></span>. A strong word, often, of military orders. Aristotle uses it of a physician : to prescribe. Mark has ejmbrimhsamenov, strictly or sternly charged. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:43">Mark 1:43</span>. </p>
<p>No one [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδενι] </span></span>. The conditional negative : no one that he might chance to meet. </p>
<p>Go, shew thyself. A lively change from the narrative to direct address.</p>
