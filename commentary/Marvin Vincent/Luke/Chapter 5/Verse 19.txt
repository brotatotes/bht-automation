Luke uses four words for the beds of the sick : klinh, as verse 18, the general word for a bed or couch; krabbatov (Acts 5:15; Acts 9:33), a rude pallet (see on Mark 2:4); klinidion, a small couch or litter, as here, a couch so light that a woman could lift and carry it away. Thus, in the "Lysistrata" of Aristophanes, 916, Myrrine says : "Come now, let me carry our couch" [κλινιδιον] . The fourth term, klinarion (Acts 5:15), cannot be accurately distinguished from the last. The last two are peculiar to Luke. Into the midst before Jesus. See on Mark 2:4.
