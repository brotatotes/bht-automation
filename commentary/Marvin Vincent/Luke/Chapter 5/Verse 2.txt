Luke uses four different words for washing or cleansing : plunw, here, see also Revelation 7:14; ajpomassw, of wiping the dust from the feet, only at chapter Luke 10:11; ejkmassw, of the woman wiping Christ 's feet with her hair, chapter Luke 7:38, Luke 7:44; ajpolouw, of washing away sins, Acts 22:16; louw, of washing the prisoners ' stripes and the body of Dorcas, Acts 16:33; Acts 9:37. The reading ajpoplunw is rejected by the best texts, so that ajpomassw is the only one peculiar to Luke. All the words were common in medical language.
