Often [πυκνα] . Only here, Acts 24:26; 1 Timothy 5:23. The word literally means close - packed, as a thicket, or the plumage of a bird. Prayers [δεησεις] . Used by no other evangelist. From deomai, to want, and hence distinctively of petitionary prayer. In classical Greek the word is not restricted to sacred uses, but is employed of requests preferred to men. Rev., more correctly, supplications.
