A parable. "From a garment and from wine, especially appropriate at a banquet" (Bengel). Putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old [επι βλημα ιματιου καινου επιβαλλει επι ιματιον παλαιον] . The best texts, however, insert scisav, having rent, which directly governs ejpiblhma, piece; so that the rendering is, No man having rent a piece from a new garment, putteth it, etc. So Rev., No man rendeth a piece and putteth. Both Matthew and Mark have cloth instead of garment, by the use of which latter term "the incongruity of the proceeding comes more strongly into prominence" (Meyer). jEpiblhma, a piece, is literally, a patch, from ejpi, upon, and ballw, to throw : something clapped on. Compare the kindred verb here, ejpiballei, putteth upon. The new maketh a rent [το καινον σχιζει] . The best texts read scisei, will rend, governing the new instead of being used intransitively. Render, as Rev., He will rend the new. Agreeth not [ου συμφωνει] . The best texts read sumfwnhsei, the future; will not agree. So Rev. In Matthew and Mark there is only a single damage, that, namely, to the old garment, the rent in which is enlarged. In Luke the damage is twofold; first, in injuring thenew garment by cutting out a piece; and second, in making the old garment appear patched, instead of widening the rent, as in Matthew and Mark. Bottles [ασκους] . Rev., wine skins. See on Matthew 9:17.
