<p>Let down [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλασατε] </span></span>. The plural, addressed to the whole of the boat 's crew. Originally, to slacken or loosen, as a bow - string or the reins of horses; hence to let sink as a net. Also of unbarring a door. Metaphorically, to be indulgent, to pardon. The word occurs in the New Testament seven times, and five of these in Luke. He uses it of letting down Paul in a basket at Damascus (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:25">Acts 9:25</span>); of striking a ship 's sails, and of letting down a boat into the sea (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:17">Acts 27:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:30">Acts 27:30</span>). Matthew, Mark, and John use ballw or ajmfiballw, for casting a net (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:18">Matthew 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:47">Matthew 13:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:16">Mark 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:6">John 21:6</span>), which appears also in the compound noun for a casting net (amfiblhstron, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:18">Matthew 4:18</span>). The word used by Luke was in common use in medical writings, to denote relaxation of the limbs; loosening of bandages; abatement of sickness; letting herbs down into a vessel to be steeped.</p>
