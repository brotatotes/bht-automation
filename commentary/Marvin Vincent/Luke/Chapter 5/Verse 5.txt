From korov, suffering, weariness; and therefore indicating exhausting toil. At thy word [επι] . Relying on : on the ground of. The net [δικτυον] . A general term for a net, whether for fish or fowl. See on Matthew 4:18. Some, as Rev., read ta diktua, the nets. Brake [διερρηγνυτο] . Some texts read dierhsseto, from the later form of the verb. The difference is unimportant. The A. V. fails to give the force of the imperfect, were breaking, as Rev.; or even better, possible, began to break. Trench suggests were at the point to break. The word occurs also at chapter Luke 8:29; Acts 14:14, and only twice beside in the New Testament. Luke alone uses the two compounds perirjrJhgnumi, of rending off clothes (Acts 16:22), and prosrhgnumi, to beat violently (chapter Luke 6:48, Luke 6:49). See on those passages. All the words occure in medical writings.
