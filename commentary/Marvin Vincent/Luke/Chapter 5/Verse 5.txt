<p>Master [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστατα] </span></span>. Used by Luke only, and always with reference to Jesus. He never uses Rabbi, as John especially. Wyc., commander. </p>
<p>Toiled [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπιασαντες] </span></span>. From korov, suffering, weariness; and therefore indicating exhausting toil. </p>
<p>At thy word [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι] </span></span>. Relying on : on the ground of. </p>
<p>The net [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικτυον] </span></span>. A general term for a net, whether for fish or fowl. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:18">Matthew 4:18</span>. Some, as Rev., read ta diktua, the nets. </p>
<p>Brake [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διερρηγνυτο] </span></span>. Some texts read dierhsseto, from the later form of the verb. The difference is unimportant. The A.

The word occurs also at chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:29">Luke 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:14">Acts 14:14</span>, and only twice beside in the New Testament. Luke alone uses the two compounds perirjrJhgnumi, of rending off clothes (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:22">Acts 16:22</span>), and prosrhgnumi, to beat violently (chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:48">Luke 6:48</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:49">Luke 6:49</span>). See on those passages. All the words occure in medical writings.</p>
