Sought - went out [εζητουνεξηρχετο] . Both imperfects. The A. V. and Rev. lose in vividness by not rendering them accordingly. The multitudes were all the while seeking to touch him, for virtue was going out of him. Healed [ιατο] . Compare Matthew 14:36; Mark 6:56, where dieswqhsan, were thoroughly saved, and ejswzonto, were saved, are used. Luke is more technical, using the strictly medical term, which occurs twenty eight times in the New Testament, seventeen of these in Luke. Luke also uses the two words employed by Matthew and Mark, but always with some addition showing the nature of the saving. Thus Luke 7:3, where diaswsh, (A. V., heal) is explained by verse 7, ijaqhsetai, the technical word, shall be healed, and by verse 10, "found the servant whole (uJgiainonta, another professional word - see on chapter Luke 5:31) that had been sick." Compare, also, Luke 8:35, Luke 8:36, Luke 8:44, Luke 8:47, Luke 8:48. Medical writers do not use swzein or diaswzein, to save, as equivalent to ijasqai, to heal, but in the sense of escaping from a severe illness or from some calamity. Luke employs it in the sense - Acts 27:44; Acts 28:1. THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT. 20 - 49. Compare Matthew 5:1 to Matthew 8:1.
