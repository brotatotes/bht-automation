<p>Healed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιατο] </span></span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:36">Matthew 14:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:56">Mark 6:56</span>, where dieswqhsan, were thoroughly saved, and ejswzonto, were saved, are used. Luke is more technical, using the strictly medical term, which occurs twenty eight times in the New Testament, seventeen of these in Luke. Luke also uses the two words employed by Matthew and Mark, but always with some addition showing the nature of the saving. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:3">Luke 7:3</span>, where diaswsh, (A. V., heal) is explained by verse 7, ijaqhsetai, the technical word, shall be healed, and by verse 10, "found the servant whole (uJgiainonta, another professional word - see on chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:31">Luke 5:31</span>) that had been sick." Compare, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:35">Luke 8:35</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:36">Luke 8:36</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:44">Luke 8:44</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:47">Luke 8:47</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:48">Luke 8:48</span>. Medical writers do not use swzein or diaswzein, to save, as equivalent to ijasqai, to heal, but in the sense of escaping from a severe illness or from some calamity. Luke employs it in the sense - <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:44">Acts 27:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:1">Acts 28:1</span>. </p>
<p>THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT. </p>
