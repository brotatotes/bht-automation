<p>Lifted up his eyes. Peculiar to Luke. Compare he opened his mouth (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span>). Both indicate a solemn and impressive opening of a discourse. </p>
<p>Blessed. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span>. </p>
<p>Ye poor. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span>. Luke adopts the style of direct address; Matthew of abstract statement. </p>
<p>Kingdom of God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η βασιλεια του θεου] </span></span>. Matthew has kingdom of heaven, or of the heavens [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των ουρανων] </span></span>, a phrase used by him only, and most frequently employed by Christ himself to describe the kingdom; though Matthew also uses, less frequently, kingdom of God. The two are substantially equivalent terms, though the pre - eminent title was kingdom of God, since it was expected to be fully realized in the Messianic era, when God should take upon himself the kingdom by a visible representative. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:9">Isaiah 40:9</span>, "Behold your God." The phrase kingdom of Heaven was common in the Rabbinical writings, and had a double signification : the historical kingdom and the spiritual and moral kingdom. They very often understood by it divine worship; adoration of God; the sum of religious duties; but also the Messianic kingdom. </p>
<p>The kingdom of God is, essentially, the absolute dominion of God in the universe, both in a physical and a spiritual sense. It is "an organic commonwealth which has the principle of its existence in the will of God" (Tholuck). It was foreshadowed in the Jewish theocracy. The idea of the kingdom advanced toward clearer defination from Jacob 's prophecy of the Prince out of Judah (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span>), though David 's prophecy of the everlasting kingdom and the king of righteousness and peace (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:0">Psalms 22:0</span>, </p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:7">Luke 6:7</span>2through Isaiah, until, in Daniel, its eternity and superiority over the kingdoms of the world are brought strongly out. For this kingdom Israel looked with longing, expecting its realization in the Messiah; and while the common idea of the people was narrow, sectarian, Jewish, and political, yet "there was among the people a certain consciousness that the principle itself was of universal application" (Tholuck). In Daniel this conception is distinctly expressed (vii. 14 - 27; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:25">Luke 4:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:44">Luke 2:44</span>). In this sense it was apprehended by John the Baptist. </p>
<p>The ideal kingdom is to be realized in the absolute rule of the eternal Son, Jesus Christ, by whom all things are made and consist (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16-20">Colossians 1:16-20</span>), whose life of perfect obedience to God and whose sacrificial offering of love upon the cross reveal to men their true relation to God, and whose spirit works to bring them into this relation. The ultimate idea of the kingdom is that of "a redeemed humanity, with its divinely revealed destiny manifesting itself in a religious communion, or the Church; a social communion, or the state; and an aesthetic communion, expressing itself in forms of knowledge and art." </p>
<p>This kingdom is both present (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:12">Matthew 11:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:28">Matthew 12:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:20">Luke 11:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:16">Luke 16:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:21">Luke 17:21</span>; see, also, the parables of the Sower, the Tares, the Leaven, and the Drag - net; and compare the expression "theirs, or yours, is the kingdom," <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:20">Luke 6:20</span>) and future (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+7:27">Daniel 7:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:43">Matthew 13:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:34">Matthew 25:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:29">Matthew 26:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:47">Mark 9:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:11">2 Peter 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:9">1 Corinthians 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:0">Revelation 20:0</span> sq.). As a present kingdom it is incomplete and in process of development. It is expanding in society like the grain of mustard seed (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:31">Matthew 13:31</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:32">Matthew 13:32</span>); working toward the pervaion of society like the leaven in the lump (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:33">Matthew 13:33</span>). God is in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, and the Gospel of Christ is the great instrument in that process (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19">2 Corinthians 5:19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:20">2 Corinthians 5:20</span>). The kingdom develops from within outward under the power of its essential divine energy and law of growth, which insures its progress and final triumph against all obstacles. </p>
<p>Similarly, its work in reconciling and subjection the world to God begins at the fountain head of man's life, by implanting in his heart its own divine potency, and thus giving a divine impulse and direction to the whole man, rather than by moulding him from without by a moral code. The law is written in his heart. In like manner the State and the Church are shaped, not by external pressure, like the Roman empire and the Romish hierarchy, but by the evolution of holy character in men. The kingdom of God in its present development is not identical with the Church. The Church is identified with the kingdom to the dgree in which it is under the power of the spirit of Christ. "As the Old Testament kingdom of God was perfected and competed when it ceased to be external, and became internal by being enthroned in the heart, so, on the other hand, the perfection of the New Testament kingdom will consist in its complete incarnation and externalization; that is, when it shall attain an outward manifestation, adequately expressing, exactly corresponding to its internal principle" (Tholuck). The consummation is described in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:22">Revelation 21:22</span>.</p>
