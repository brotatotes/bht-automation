<p>Son of Man. The phrase is employed in the Old Testament as a circumlocution for man, with special reference to his frailty as contrasted with God (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+23:19">Numbers 23:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:4">Psalms 8:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+25:6">Job 25:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+35:8">Job 35:8</span>; and eighty nine times in Ezekiel). It had also a Messianic meaning (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span> sq.), to which our Lord referred in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:64">Matthew 26:64</span>. It was the title which Christ most frequently applied to himself; and there are but two instances in which it is applied to him by another, viz., by Stephen (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:56">Acts 7:56</span>) and by John (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+1:13">Revelation 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14">Revelation 14:14</span>); and when acquiescing in the title "Son of God," addressed to himself, he sometimes immediately after substitutes "Son of Man" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:50">John 1:50</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:52">John 1:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:63">Matthew 26:63</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:64">Matthew 26:64</span>). </p>
<p>The title asserts Christ 's humanity - his absolute identification with our race : "his having a genuine humanity which could deem nothing human strange, and could be touched with a feeling of the infirmities of the race which he was to judge" (Liddon, "Our Lord 's Divinity "). It also exalts him as the representative ideal man." All human history tends to him and radiates from him; he is the point in which humanity finds its unity; as St. Irenaeus says, 'He recapitulates it.. ' He closes the earlier history of our race; he inaugurates its future. Nothing local, transient, individualizing, national, sectarian dwarfs the proportions of his world embracing character. He rises above the parentage, the blood, the narrow horizon which bounded, as it seemed, his human life. He is the archetypal man, in whose presence distinction of race, intervals of ages, types of civilization, degrees of mental culture are as nothing " (Liddon). </p>
<p>But the title means more. As Son of Man he asserts the authority of judgment over all flesh. By virtue of what he is as Son of Man, he must be more. "The absolute relation to the world which he attributes to himself demands an absolute relation to God.... He is the Son of Man, the Lord of the world, the Judge, only because he is the Son of God" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυτηαρδτ] </span></span>. </p>
<p>Christ 's humanity can be explained only by his divinity. A humanity so unique demands a solution. Divested of all that is popularly called miraculous, viewed simply as a man, under the historical conditions of his life, he is a greater miracle than all his miracles combined. The solution is expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:0">Hebrews 1:0</span>.</p>
