<p>Hoping for nothing again [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν απελπιζοντες] </span></span>. A later Greek word, only here in New Testament, and meaning originally to give up in despair, a sense which is adopted by some high authorities, and by Rev., never despairing. Luke was familiar with this sense in the Septuagint. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:19">Isaiah 29:19</span>, "The poor among men [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οι απηλπισμενοι των ανθρωπων] </span></span>. shall rejoice." So in Apocrypha, 2 <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:18">Mark 9:18</span>, "despairing of his health;" Judith 9 11, "A savior of them that are without hope [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηλπισμενων] </span></span>." According to this, the sense here is, "do good as those who consider nothing as lost." The verb and its kindred adjective are used by medical writers to describe desperate cases of disease. </p>
<p>Children of the Highest [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιοι υψιστου] </span></span>. Rev., rightly, sons. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:45">Matthew 5:45</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:48">Matthew 5:48</span>. </p>
<p>Kind [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρηστος</span></span>] See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:30">Matthew 11:30</span>.</p>
