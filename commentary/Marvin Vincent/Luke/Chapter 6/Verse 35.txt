Hoping for nothing again [μηδεν απελπιζοντες] . A later Greek word, only here in New Testament, and meaning originally to give up in despair, a sense which is adopted by some high authorities, and by Rev., never despairing. Luke was familiar with this sense in the Septuagint. Thus Isaiah 29:19, "The poor among men [οι απηλπισμενοι των ανθρωπων] . shall rejoice." So in Apocrypha, 2 Mark 9:18, "despairing of his health;" Judith 9 11, "A savior of them that are without hope [απηλπισμενων] ." According to this, the sense here is, "do good as those who consider nothing as lost." The verb and its kindred adjective are used by medical writers to describe desperate cases of disease. Children of the Highest [υιοι υψιστου] . Rev., rightly, sons. Compare Matthew 5:45, Matthew 5:48. Kind [χρηστος] See on Matthew 11:30.
