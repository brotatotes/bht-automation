<p>Pressed down [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπιεσμενον] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. A common medical term for pressing strongly on a part of the body, and opposed to yauein, to touch gently. </p>
<p>Shaken together, running over. Bengel says, "Pressed down, as dry articles; shaken together, as soft goods; running over, as liquids." But this is fanciful and incorrect.

In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ru+3:15">Ruth 3:15</span>, Boaz says to Ruth, "Bring the vail (the mantle, so Rev., Old Testament), that thou hast upon thee, and hold it (hold it open) : and he measured six measures of barley into it." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:7">Isaiah 65:7</span>, " I will measure their former work into their bosom; also <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+32:18">Jeremiah 32:18</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:39">Acts 27:39</span>, the word is used of a bay in a beach, forming a bend in the land like the hollow of a robe. Similarly, the Latin sinus means both the hanging, baggy bosom of a robe and a bay.</p>
