Pressed down [πεπιεσμενον] . Only here in New Testament. A common medical term for pressing strongly on a part of the body, and opposed to yauein, to touch gently. Shaken together, running over. Bengel says, "Pressed down, as dry articles; shaken together, as soft goods; running over, as liquids." But this is fanciful and incorrect. The allusion in every case is to a dry measure; and the climax in the three participles would be destroyed by Bengel's interpretation. Bosom [τον κολπον] . The gathered fold of the wide upper garment, bound together with the girdle, and thus forming a pouch. In the Eastern markets at this day vendors may be seen pouring the contents of a measure into the bosom of a purchaser. In Ruth 3:15, Boaz says to Ruth, "Bring the vail (the mantle, so Rev., Old Testament), that thou hast upon thee, and hold it (hold it open) : and he measured six measures of barley into it." Compare Isaiah 65:7, " I will measure their former work into their bosom; also Jeremiah 32:18. In Acts 27:39, the word is used of a bay in a beach, forming a bend in the land like the hollow of a robe. Similarly, the Latin sinus means both the hanging, baggy bosom of a robe and a bay.
