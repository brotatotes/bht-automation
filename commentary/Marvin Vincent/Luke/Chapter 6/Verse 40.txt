Perfect [κατηρτισμενος] . Rev., rendering the participle more literally, perfected. See on Matthew 4:21. The word signifies to readjust, restore, set to rights, whether in a physical or a moral sense. See 1 Corinthians 1:10, where Paul exhorts to be perfectly joined together [κατηρτισμενοι] in opposition to being divided. In Galatians 6:1, it is used of restoring a brother taken in a fault. Hence the meaning to perfect, as Ephesians 4:12. Used in medical language of setting a bone or joint.
