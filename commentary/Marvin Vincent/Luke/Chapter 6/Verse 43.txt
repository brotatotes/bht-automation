<p>a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου εστιν δενδρον καλον, ποιουν καρπον σαπρον] </span></span>. Rev., more correctly, there is no good tree that bringeth, etc. Sapron, corrupt, is etymologically akin to shpw, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:2">James 5:2</span> : "Your riches are corrupted." The word means rotten, stale. Neither. Rev., nor again. The A. V. omits again (palin, on the other hand).</p>
