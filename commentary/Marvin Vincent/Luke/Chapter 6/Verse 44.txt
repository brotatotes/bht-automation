Bramble - bush [βατου] Matthew has tribolwn, thistles. The word occurs only once outside of Luke's writings, in Mark 12:26, where it is used as the familiar title of a section of the Pentateuch. Luke also uses it in the same way (xx. 37). He was doubtless acquainted with it medicinally, as it was extensively used by ancient physicians. Galen has a chapter on its medicinal uses, and the medical writings abound in prescriptions of which it is an ingredient. Galen also has a saying similar to our Lord 's : "A farmer could never make a bramble bear grapes." It is the word employed by the Septuagint for the bush out of which God spoke to Moses. Grapes [σταφυλην] . Lit., a cluster of grapes.
