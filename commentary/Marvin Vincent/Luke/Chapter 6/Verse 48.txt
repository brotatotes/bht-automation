<p>Digged deep [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσκαψεν και εβαθυνεν] </span></span>. The A. V. regards the two words as a strong expression of a single idea; but the idea is twofold : he dug (through the sand), and deepened down into the solid rock. So Rev., rightly, he digged and went deep. </p>
<p>The flood [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλημμυρας] </span></span>. There is no article : a flood. The word occurs in Luke only, and only in this passage. As a medical term it is used of excess of fluids in the body : flooding. </p>
<p>Beat vehemently [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσερρηξεν] </span></span>. Rev., more literally, brake. Used by physicians of a rupture of the veins. It occurs only here and verse 49. Matthew has prosekoyan, beat.</p>
