Digged deep [εσκαψεν και εβαθυνεν] . The A. V. regards the two words as a strong expression of a single idea; but the idea is twofold : he dug (through the sand), and deepened down into the solid rock. So Rev., rightly, he digged and went deep. The flood [πλημμυρας] . There is no article : a flood. The word occurs in Luke only, and only in this passage. As a medical term it is used of excess of fluids in the body : flooding. Beat vehemently [προσερρηξεν] . Rev., more literally, brake. Used by physicians of a rupture of the veins. It occurs only here and verse 49. Matthew has prosekoyan, beat.
