<p>His right hand [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η χειρ αυτου η δεξια] </span></span>. A very precise mode of statement. Lit., his hand the right one. Luke only specifies which hand was withered. This accuracy is professional. Ancient medical writers always state whether the right or the left member is affected. </p>
<p>Withered. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:1">Mark 3:1</span>.</p>
