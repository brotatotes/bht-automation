<p>I will ask [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επερωτησω] </span></span>. Peculiar to Luke's narrative. The best texts read ejperwtw, the present tense, I ask. So Rev. </p>
<p>Life [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχην] </span></span>. Better as Rev., a life. Though the question is a general one, it carries a hint of an individual life thrown into it by the special case at hand. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:30">Mark 12:30</span>. Wyc., to make a soul safe.</p>
