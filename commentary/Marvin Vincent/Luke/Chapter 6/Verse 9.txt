I will ask [επερωτησω] . Peculiar to Luke's narrative. The best texts read ejperwtw, the present tense, I ask. So Rev. Life [ψυχην] . Better as Rev., a life. Though the question is a general one, it carries a hint of an individual life thrown into it by the special case at hand. See on Mark 12:30. Wyc., to make a soul safe.
