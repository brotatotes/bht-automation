No convent, no tradition marks the spot. But, under these circumstances, the name alone is sufficient to guarantee its authenticity. One entrance alone it could have had - that which opens on the rough hillside in its downward slope to the plain.

These are cut in the rock, and are situated on the hillside to the east of the village "(Thomson," Land and Book ").
