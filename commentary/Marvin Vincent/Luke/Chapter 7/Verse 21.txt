On ponhrov, evil, see ch. Luke 3:19. It is applied to evil spirits by Luke only, with the single exception of Matthew 12:45. In accordance with its signification of evil on its active side, it is applied in medicine to that which spreads destruction or corruption; as the poison of serpents. Note, moreover, that Luke distinguishes here between disease and demoniac possession, as often. See ch. Luke 6:17, Luke 6:18; Luke 8:2; Luke 13:32. He gave [εχαρισατο] .
