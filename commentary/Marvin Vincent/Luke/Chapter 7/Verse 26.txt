<p>A prophet [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητην] </span></span>. The popular conception of a prophet is limited to his foretelling future events. This is indeed included in the term, but does not cover its meaning entirely. The word is from fhmi, to speak, and pro, before, in front of. This meaning of the preposition may have reference to time, viz., before, beforehand; or to place, viz., in front of, and so, publicly; and this latter meaning, in turn, easily runs into that of in behalf of; for. The prophet is, therefore, primarily, one who speaks standing before another, and thus forming a medium between him and the hearer. This sense runs naturally into that of instead of. Hence it is the technical term for the interpreter of a divine message. So Plato : "For this reason it is customary to appoint diviners or interpreters to be judges of the true inspiration. Some persons call them diviners, seers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαντεις] </span></span>; they do not know that they are only repeaters of dark sayings and visions, and are not to be called diviners at all, but interpreters, [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφηται</span></span>] of things divine" (" Timaeus, "72). Similarly of an advocate to speak for, or instead of one. The central idea of the word is, one to whom God reveals himself and through whom he speaks. The revelation may or may not relate to the future. The prophet is a forth - teller, not necessarily a foreteller. The essence of the prophetic character is immediate intercourse with God. One of the Hebrew names for" prophet, " and, as some maintain, the earlier name, signified a shewer or seer.
