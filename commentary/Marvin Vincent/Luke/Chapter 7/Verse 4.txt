<p>They besought him instantly [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεκαλουν σπουδαιως] </span></span>. On besought, see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:24">Luke 6:24</span>. Instantly, which commonly means at once, is used in its older meaning, pressingly, from the Latin instare, to urge or press upon. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:12">Romans 12:12</span>, "instant in prayer." Wyc., prayed busily. That he was worthy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτι αξιος εστιν] </span></span>. The A. V. renders oti as a conjunction, that. The Rev., more correctly, takes it as a mark of quotation, besides properly rendering ejstin is, instead of was. Render as Rev., He is worthy that thou shouldst do this; for the best texts read parexh, the second person, thou shouldst do, instead of the third person, parexei, he shall do.</p>
