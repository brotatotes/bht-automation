They besought him instantly [παρεκαλουν σπουδαιως] . On besought, see on ch. Luke 6:24. Instantly, which commonly means at once, is used in its older meaning, pressingly, from the Latin instare, to urge or press upon. So Romans 12:12, "instant in prayer." Wyc., prayed busily. That he was worthy [οτι αξιος εστιν] . The A. V. renders oti as a conjunction, that. The Rev., more correctly, takes it as a mark of quotation, besides properly rendering ejstin is, instead of was. Render as Rev., He is worthy that thou shouldst do this; for the best texts read parexh, the second person, thou shouldst do, instead of the third person, parexei, he shall do.
