Say in a word. Lit., "say with a word." My servant shall be healed [ιαθητω ο παις μου] . It is strange that the Rev. should have omitted to note the imperative mood here, at least in the margin. The literal rendering is the more graphic : Let my servant be healed. Note the professional word for heal. See on ch. Luke 6:19.
