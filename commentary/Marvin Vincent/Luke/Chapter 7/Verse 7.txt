<p>Say in a word. Lit., "say with a word." </p>
<p>My servant shall be healed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιαθητω ο παις μου] </span></span>. It is strange that the Rev. should have omitted to note the imperative mood here, at least in the margin. The literal rendering is the more graphic : Let my servant be healed. Note the professional word for heal. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:19">Luke 6:19</span>.</p>
