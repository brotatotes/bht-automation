Go forth [πορευομενοι] . The present participle. Much better Rev., "they that have heard, and as they go on their way are choked," etc. Choked with [υπο, υνδερ] . Implying the impulse under which they pursue their course. Bring (no fruit) to perfection (telesforousin). Only here in New Testament. Matthew and Mark have, it becometh unfruitful. The verb literally means to bring to an end or accomplishment.
