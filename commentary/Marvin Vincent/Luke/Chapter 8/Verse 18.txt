How ye hear [πως] . The manner of hearing. Mark has ti, what ye hear; the matter. Seemeth [δοκει] . Peculiar to Luke. Rev. renders "thinketh he hath," as James 1:26, on which see note. Wyc., guesseth; Tynd., supposeth. 19 - 21. Compare Matthew 12:46-50; Mark 3:31-35. Come at him [συντυχειν] . Only here in New Testament. The word properly carries the idea of an accidental meeting, and slightly so here. Jesus was lost in the crowd, and his friends could not fall in with him. 22 - 25; Luke 9:57-62. Compare Matthew 8:18-27; Mark 4:35-41.
