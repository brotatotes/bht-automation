Who touched [τις ο αψαμενος] . Lit., who is he that touched? Rev., who is it that. Throng and press [συνεχουσιναποθλιβουσιν] . On the former word, see ver. 37, and ch. 4 38. Rev. renders the latter, which occurs here only, more literally, crush. It means to squeeze out, as wine from grapes. See on tribulation, Matthew 13:21.
