<p>Hath touched [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηψατο</span></span>] - I perceive [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγνων] </span></span>. Rev. renders the two aorists strictly : did touch, and I perceived, with reference to Jesus ' knowledge of the touch at the moment it was applied. </p>
<p>Virtue [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμιν] </span></span>. Rev., power. The evangelists use the word frequently of miracles - mighty works. It is used here in the sense of virtue, according to its use by naturalists and physicians. Still, too much stress must not be laid upon it as a mark of Luke's professional accuracy, as Dean Plumptre in "The Expositor," 4 139; since Mark uses it in his narrative of the same incident, and in the same sense (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:30">Mark 5:30</span>).</p>
