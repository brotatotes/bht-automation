Hath touched [ηψατο] - I perceive [εγνων] . Rev. renders the two aorists strictly : did touch, and I perceived, with reference to Jesus ' knowledge of the touch at the moment it was applied. Virtue [δυναμιν] . Rev., power. The evangelists use the word frequently of miracles - mighty works. It is used here in the sense of virtue, according to its use by naturalists and physicians. Still, too much stress must not be laid upon it as a mark of Luke's professional accuracy, as Dean Plumptre in "The Expositor," 4 139; since Mark uses it in his narrative of the same incident, and in the same sense (Mark 5:30).
