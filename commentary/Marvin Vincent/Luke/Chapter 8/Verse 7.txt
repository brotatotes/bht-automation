<p>Among [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν μεσω] </span></span>. In the midst. Stronger than the simple ejn, in, as giving more prominence to the danger. </p>
<p>Sprung up with it [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφυεισαι] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. See on ver. 6, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:7">Matthew 13:7</span>. The technical word among physicians for closing of wounds or ulcers, and uniting of nerves or bones. Dioscorides uses it, as here, of plants growing in the same place : "The hellebore grows together with the vines." </p>
<p>Choked [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεπνιξαν] </span></span>. Lit., choked off. Matthew has the simple epnixan, choked; and Mark sunepnixan; the sun, together, emphasizing the idea of compression. Luke is very fond of compounds and sonorous words. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:51">Luke 23:51</span>.</p>
