Among [εν μεσω] . In the midst. Stronger than the simple ejn, in, as giving more prominence to the danger. Sprung up with it [συμφυεισαι] . Only here in New Testament. See on ver. 6, and Matthew 13:7. The technical word among physicians for closing of wounds or ulcers, and uniting of nerves or bones. Dioscorides uses it, as here, of plants growing in the same place : "The hellebore grows together with the vines." Choked [απεπνιξαν] . Lit., choked off. Matthew has the simple epnixan, choked; and Mark sunepnixan; the sun, together, emphasizing the idea of compression. Luke is very fond of compounds and sonorous words. See on ch. Luke 23:51.
