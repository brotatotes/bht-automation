<p>Lodge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλυσωσιν] </span></span>. Peculiar to Luke. Primarily the verb means to break up or dissolve. Hence often in New Testament to destroy (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17">Matthew 5:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:2">Mark 13:2</span>). Intransitively, to take up one's quarters; lodge; either because the harness of the traveler's horses is loosed, or because the fastenings of their garments are untied. The kindred word kataluma, a guest - chamber, occurs, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:14">Mark 14:14</span>; or inn, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:7">Luke 2:7</span>. </p>
<p>Victuals [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισιτισμον] </span></span>. Only here in New Testament. Properly a stock of provisions. Thus Xenophon.
