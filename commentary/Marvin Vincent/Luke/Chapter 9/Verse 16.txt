Brake and gave [κατεκλασενεδιδου] . Note the two tenses, as in Mark 6:41, and see note there. To set before [παραθειναι] . Lit., to set beside, since the table was at the side of the guest. A common word for serving up a meal. Compare Luke 10:8; Acts 16:34. From the sense of placing beside, comes that of putting in charge, committing (Luke 12:48; Luke 23:46; 1 Timothy 1:18). Hence the kindred noun paraqhkh (2 Timothy 1:12), a deposit : that which I have committed.
