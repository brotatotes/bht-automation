Were filled. See on Matthew 5:6. There were taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets [και ηρθη το περισσευσαν αυτπις κλασματων κοφινοι δωδεκα] . The Rev. is more accurate, putting the comma after aujtoiv, to them, instead of after klasmatwn, fragments; and making the latter word depend on kofinoi, baskets. Render, therefore, And there was taken up that which remained over to them, of broken pieces, twelve baskets. Baskets. See on Matthew 14:20. 18 - 21. Compare Matthew 16:13-20. Mark 8:27-30.
