<p>Shall be ashamed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαισχυνθη] </span></span>. The feeling expressed by this word has reference to incurring dishonor or shame in the eyes of men. It is "the grief a man conceives from his own imperfections considered with relation to the world taking notice of them; grief upon the sense of disesteem" (" South, "cit. by Trench). Hence it does not spring out of a reverence for right in itself, but from fear of the knowledge and opinion of men. Thus in the use of the kindred noun aijscunh, shame, in the New Testament. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:9">Luke 14:9</span>, the man who impudently puts himself in the highest place at the feast, and is bidden by his host to go lower down, begins with shame to take the lowest place; not from a right sense of his folly and conceit, but from being humiliated in the eyes of the guests.

Onesiphorus was not ashamed to be known as the friend of the prisoner (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:16">2 Timothy 1:16</span>). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:11">Hebrews 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:16">Hebrews 11:16</span>. It is used of the Son of Man here by a strong metaphor. Literally, of course, the glorified Christ cannot experience the sense of shame, but the idea at the root is the same. It will be as if he should feel himself disgraced before the Father and the holy angels in owning any fellowship with those who have been ashamed of him. </p>
<p>His glory, etc. Threefold glory. His own, as the exalted Messiah; the glory of God, who owns him as his dearly beloved son, and commits to him the judgment; and the glory of the angels who attend him.</p>
