<p>This verse is peculiar to Luke. Spake [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγον] </span></span>. Imperfect, were speaking. </p>
<p>Decease [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξοδον] </span></span>. The Rev. retains the word of the A. V., though it has, to modern ears, a somewhat formal sound. No word, however, could more accurately represent the original, which is compounded of ejx, out of, and oJdov, a journeying; and thus corresponds to the Latin decessus, a going away, whence the word decease. The Greek word is familiar to us as exodus, applied principally to the migration of the Hebrews from Egypt, and thus used at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:22">Hebrews 11:22</span>, departing. In the mouth of Christ it covers the ideas both of death and ascension. Peter uses it of his own death (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:15">2 Peter 1:15</span>, where see note). </p>
<p>He should accomplish [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμελλεν πληρουν] </span></span>. Better, as Rev., he was about to accomplish. "Accomplish," or "fulfil," is very significant with reference to Christ 's death. Moses and Joshua had begun an exodus from Egypt, but had not accomplished the going out of God 's people from this present world. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:18">Hebrews 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:8">Hebrews 4:8</span>.</p>
