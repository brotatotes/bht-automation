<p>Taketh [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανει] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:18">Mark 9:18</span>. </p>
<p>Suddenly [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαιφνης] </span></span>. Used only once outside of the writings of Luke : <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:36">Mark 13:36</span>. Naturally, frequent in medical writers, of sudden attacks of disease. Luke has more medical details in his account than the other evangelists. He mentions the sudden coming on of the fits, and their lasting a long time. Mr. Hobart remarks that Aretaeus, a physician of Luke's time, in treating of epilepsy, admits the possibility of its being produced by demoniacal agency. Epilepsy was called by physicians "the sacred disease." </p>
<p>Bruising [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συντριβον] </span></span>. See on bruised, ch. 4 18. The word literally means crushing together. Rev. expresses the sun, together, by sorely. Compare the details in Mark, gnashing the teeth and pining away (ix. 18). The details in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:21">Mark 9:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:22">Mark 9:22</span>, we might rather expect to find in Luke; especially Christ 's question, how long he had been subject to these attacks. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:20">Mark 9:20</span>.</p>
