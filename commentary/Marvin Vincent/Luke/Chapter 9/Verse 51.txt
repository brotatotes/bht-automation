When the time was come [εν τω συμπληρουσθαι τας ημερας] . Lit., in the fulfilling of the days. This means when the days were being fulfilled; not when they were fulfilled : when the time was drawing near. Rev., were well - nigh come. Luke is speaking of a period beginning with the first announcement of his sufferings, and extending to the time of his being received up. That he should be received up [της αναλημψεως αυτου] . Lit., the days of his being taken up : his ascension into heaven. jAnalhmyiv occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; but the kindred verb, ajnalambanw, is the usual word for being received into heaven. See Acts 1:2, Acts 1:11, Acts 1:22; 1 Timothy 3:16. 57 - 62. Compare Matthew 8:19-27; Mark 4:35-41.
