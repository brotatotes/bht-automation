<p>To bid farewell [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποταξασθαι] </span></span>. In this sense the word is used only in later Greek. In classical Greek it signifies to set apart or assign, as a soldier to his post or an official to his office, and later to detach soldiers. Hence to dismiss one with orders. This latter sense may, as Kypke suggests, be included in the meaning of the word in this passage; the man desiring to return home, not merely to take formal leave, but also to give his final instructions to his friends and servants. Similarly, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:18">Acts 18:18</span>, of Paul taking leave of the brethren at Corinth, and, presumably, giving them instructions at parting. In the New Testament the word is used invariably in the sense of bidding farewell. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:46">Mark 6:46</span> is rendered by Rev. after he had taken leave of them. See note there, and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:33">Luke 14:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:13">2 Corinthians 2:13</span>.</p>
