<p>The tetrarch. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:1">Matthew 14:1</span>. </p>
<p>That was done [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα γινομενα] </span></span>. The present participle. Lit., all that is being done. </p>
<p>Was perplexed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διηπορει] </span></span>. Used by Luke only. From dia, through, and ajporew, to be without a way out. The radical idea of the compound verb seems to be of one who goes through the whole list of possible ways, and finds no way out. Hence, to be in perplexity.</p>
