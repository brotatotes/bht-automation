<p><b>Devils (</b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR"><b>δαιμόνια</b></span></span><b>)</b></p>
<p style=" ">We have seen that, in Homer, the bad sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμόνοις</span></span><i> </i>is the prevailing one. In the tragedians, also, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαίμων</span></span>, though used both of good and bad fortune, occurs more frequently in the latter sense, and toward this sense the word gravitates more and more. The undertone of Greek thought, which tended to regard no man happy until he had escaped from life (see on <a class="dict" href="#c40.5.3">Mat 5:3</a>, <i>blessed</i>)<i>, </i>naturally imparted a gloomy and forbidding character to those who were supposed to allot the destinies of life.</p>
<p style=" ">In classical Greek it is noticeable that the abstract <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὸ δαιμόνιον</span></span><i> </i>fell into the background behind <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαίμων</span></span><i>, </i>with the development in the latter of the notion of a <i>fate </i>or <i>genius </i>connected with each individual, as the demon of Socrates; while in biblical Greek the process is the reverse, this doctrine being rejected for that of an overruling personal providence, and the strange gods, “obscure to human knowledge and alien to human life,” taking the abstract term uniformly in an evil sense.</p>
<p style=" ">Empedocles, a Greek philosopher, of Sicily, developed Hesiod's distinction; making the demons of a mixed nature between gods and men, not only the link between the two, but having an agency and disposition of their own; not immortal, but long-lived, and subject to the passions and propensities of men. While in Hesiod the demons are all good, according to Empedocles they are both bad and good. This conception relieved the gods of the responsibility for proceedings unbecoming the divine nature. The enormities which the older myths ascribed directly to the gods - thefts, rapes, abductions - were the doings of bad demons. It also saved the credit of the old legends, obviating the necessity of pronouncing either that the gods were unworthy or the legends untrue. “Yet, though devised for the purpose of satisfying a more scrupulous religious sensibility, it was found inconvenient afterward when assailants arose against paganism generally. For while it abandoned as indefensible a large portion of what had once been genuine faith, it still retained the same word <i>demons </i>with an entirely altered signification. The Christian writers in their controversies found ample warrant among the <i>earlier </i>pagan authors for treating all the gods as demons; and not less ample warrant among the <i>later</i> pagans for denouncing the demons generally as evil beings” (Grote, “History of Greece”).</p>
<p style=" ">This evil sense the words always bear in the New Testament as well as in the Septuagint. Demons are synonymous with <i>unclean spirits</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:12">Mark 5:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:15">Mark 5:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:22">Mark 3:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:30">Mark 3:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:33">Luke 4:33</span>). They appear in connection with Satan (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:17">Luke 10:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:18">Luke 10:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:18">Luke 11:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:19">Luke 11:19</span>); they are put in opposition to the Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:20">1 Corinthians 10:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:21">1 Corinthians 10:21</span>); to the faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span>). They are connected with idolatry (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+9:20">Revelation 9:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+16:13">Revelation 16:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+16:14">Revelation 16:14</span>). They are special powers of evil, influencing and disturbing the physical, mental, and moral being (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:11">Luke 13:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:16">Luke 13:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:2-5">Mark 5:2-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:25">Mark 7:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:45">Matthew 12:45</span>).</p>
