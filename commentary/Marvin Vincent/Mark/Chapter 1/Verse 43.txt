<p><b>Strictly charged (å̓ìâñéìçóá́ìåíïò)</b></p>
<p style=" ">Rev., <i>sternly</i>, in margin. The word is originally to <i>snort, </i>as of mettlesome horses. Hence, to <i>fret, or chafe, </i>or be otherwise strongly moved; and then, as a result of this feeling, to <i>admonish or rebuke urgently. </i>The Lord evidently spoke to him <i>peremptorily. </i>Compare <i>sent him out </i>(å̓îǻâáëåí); lit., <i>drove </i>or <i>cast </i>him out. The reason for this charge and dismissal lay in the desire of Jesus not to thwart his ministry by awaking the premature violence of his enemies; who, if they should see the leper and hear his story before he had been officially pronounced clean by the priest, might deny either that he had been a leper or had been truly cleansed.</p>
