Money - changers [κολλυβιστων] . Another unclassical word, but used also by Matthew. "Such words as these might naturally find their place in the mongrel Greek of the slaves and freedmen who formed the first congregations of the church in Rome" (Ezra Abbott, Art. "Gospels," in Encyclopedia Britannica). See on Matthew 21:12.
