<p>Of all nations. Which rendering implies, shall be called by all nations. But render with Rev., a house of prayer for all the nations (pasin toiv eqnesin). </p>
<p>Thieves [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ληστων] </span></span>. Rev., correctly, robbers. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:13">Matthew 21:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:55">Matthew 26:55</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1">John 10:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:8">John 10:8</span>. From lhiv or leia, booty. In classical usage mostly of cattle. The robber, conducting his operations on a large and systematic scale, and with the aid of bands, is thus to be distinguished from the klepthv, or thief who purloins or pilfers whatever comes to hand. A den would be appropriate to a band of robbers, not to thieves. Thus the traveler to Jericho, in Christ 's parable (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:30">Luke 10:30</span>), fell among robbers, not thieves</p>
