Wine fat [υποληνιον] . Rev., wine - press. Only here in New Testament. The wine - press was constructed in the side of a sloping rock, in which a trough was excavated, which was the wine press proper. Underneath this was dug another trough, with openings communicating with the trough above, into which the juice ran from the press. This was called by the Rom. lacus, or the lake. The word here used for the whole structure strictly means this trough underneath [υπο] the press [ληνος] . This is the explanation of Wyc. 's translation, dalf [δελςεδ] , a lake. Went into a far country [απεδημησεν] . But this is too strong. The word means simply went abroad. So Wyc., went forth in pilgrimage; and Tynd., into a strange country. Rev., another country. See on Matthew 25:14. Of the fruits. Or, literally, from [απο] the fruits, showing that the rent was to be paid in kind.
