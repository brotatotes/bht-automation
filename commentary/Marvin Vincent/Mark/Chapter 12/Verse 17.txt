<p>They marvelled [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεθαυμαζον] </span></span>. The preposition ejx, out of, indicates great astonishment. They marvelled out of measure. Hence Rev., marvelled greatly. The A. V. follows another reading, with the simple verb ejqaumazon. The imperfect denotes continuance : they stood wondering.</p>
