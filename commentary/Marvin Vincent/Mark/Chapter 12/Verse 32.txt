Well, Master, thou hast said the truth; for there is one God. All the best texts omit God. Well [καλως] . Exclamatory, as one says good! on hearing something which he approves. The truth [επ αληθειας] . Incorrect. The phrase is adverbial; of a truth, in truth, truthfully, and qualifies the succeeding verb, thou hast said. For [οτι] . The A. V. begins a new and explanatory sentence with this word; but it is better with Rev. to translate that, and make the whole sentence continuous : Thou hast truthfully said that he is one.
