<p>Well, Master, thou hast said the truth; for there is one God. All the best texts omit God. </p>
<p>Well [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλως] </span></span>. Exclamatory, as one says good! on hearing something which he approves. </p>
<p>The truth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ αληθειας] </span></span>. Incorrect. The phrase is adverbial; of a truth, in truth, truthfully, and qualifies the succeeding verb, thou hast said. For [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτι] </span></span>. The A. V. begins a new and explanatory sentence with this word; but it is better with Rev. to translate that, and make the whole sentence continuous : Thou hast truthfully said that he is one.</p>
