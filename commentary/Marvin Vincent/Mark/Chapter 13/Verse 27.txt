<p>From the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ ακρου γης εως ακρου ουρανου] </span></span>. From the outermost border of the earth, conceived as a flat surface, to where the outermost border of the heaven sets a limit to the earth. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>. Mark's expression is more poetical.</p>
