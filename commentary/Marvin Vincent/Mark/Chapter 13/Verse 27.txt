From the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven [απ ακρου γης εως ακρου ουρανου] . From the outermost border of the earth, conceived as a flat surface, to where the outermost border of the heaven sets a limit to the earth. Compare Matthew 24:31. Mark's expression is more poetical.
