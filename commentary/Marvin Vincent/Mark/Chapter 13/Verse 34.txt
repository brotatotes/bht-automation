<p>A man taking a far journey [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπος αποδημος] </span></span>. The A. V. is incorrect, since the idea is not that of a man about to go, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:14">Matthew 25:14</span>; but of one already gone. So Wyc., gone far in pilgrimage; and Tynd., which is gone into a strange country. The two words form one notion - a man abroad. Rev., sojourning in another country.</p>
