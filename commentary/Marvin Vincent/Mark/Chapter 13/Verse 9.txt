<p>Sorrows [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωδινων] </span></span>. Rev., rightly, travail; for the word is used especially of birth - throes. </p>
<p>Shall ye be beaten [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαρησεσθε] </span></span>. The verb literally means to skin or flay, and by a slang usage, like our phrase to tan or hide, comes to mean to cudgel or beat.</p>
