<p>She [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινη] </span></span>. An absolute use of the pronoun unexampled in Mark. See also verses 11, 13. It would imply an emphasis which is not intended. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:11">Mark 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:4">Mark 12:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:5">Mark 12:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:7">Mark 12:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:21">Mark 14:21</span>. </p>
<p>Went [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορευθεισα] </span></span>. So in verses 12, 15. Went, go. This verb for to go occurs nowhere else in this Gospel except in compounds. </p>
<p>Them that had been with him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις μετ αυτου γενομενοις] </span></span>. A circumlocution foreign to the Gospels.</p>
