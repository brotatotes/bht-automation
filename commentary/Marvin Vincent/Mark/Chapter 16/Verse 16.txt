Shall be damned [κατακριθησεται] . A most unfortunate rendering. The word is a judicial term, and, as Dr. Morison truthfully says, "determines, by itself, nothing at all concerning the nature, degree, or extent of the penalty to be endured." See on the kindred noun, krima, judgment, rendered by A. V. damnation, 1 Corinthians 11:29. Rev., rightly, condemned.
