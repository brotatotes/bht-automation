Following [επακολουθουντων] . Following closely : force of ejpi. Both this and the word for follow, in verse 17, are foreign to Mark's diction, though he frequently uses the simple verb. A manuscript of the eighth or ninth century, known as L, has, at the close of verse 8, these words : "In some instances there is added as follows." Then we read : "But all the things enjoined they announced without delay to those who were around Peter (i. e., to Peter and those who were with him). And afterward Jesus himself, from the east unto the west, sent forth through them the sacred and incorruptible message of eternal salvation." The subject of the last twelve verses of this Gospel may be found critically discussed in the second volume of Westcott and Hort's Greek Testament; by Dean John W. Burgon in his monograph, "The Last Twelve Verses of the Gospel according to St. Mark Vindicated against Recent Objectors and Established;" Frederick Henry Scrivener, LL. D., "Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament;" James Morison, D. D., "Practical Commentary on the Gospel according to St. Mark;" Samuel Davidson, D. D., "Introduction to the Study of the New Testament;" Philip Schaff, D. D., "History of the Christian Church;" Canon F. 100 Cook in "Speaker's Commentary on Mark;" Samuel P. Tregelles, LL. D., "On the Printed Text of the Greek Testament;" also in the commentaries of Alford and Meyer. ===Luke 1:0 CHAPTER I Some two hundred expressions or phrases may be found which are common to Luke and Paul, and more or less foreign to other New Testament writers.
