<p>The first day of the week [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτη σαββατου] </span></span>. A phrase which Mark does not use. In verse 2 of this chapter it is miav sabbatwn. </p>
<p>Out of whom he had cast seven devils. With Mark's well - known habit of particularizing, it is somewhat singular that this circumstance was not mentioned in either of the three previous allusions to Mary (xv. 40, 47; 16 1). </p>
<p>Out of whom [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφ ης] </span></span>. An unusual expression. Mark habitually uses the preposition ejk in this connection (i. 25, 26; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:8">Mark 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:26">Mark 7:26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:29">Mark 7:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:25">Mark 9:25</span>). Moreover, ajpo, from, is used with ejkballein, cast out, nowhere else in the New Testament. The peculiarity is equally marked if we read with some, par h=v.</p>
