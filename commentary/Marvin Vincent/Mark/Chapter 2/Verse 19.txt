<p>Children of the bride - chamber [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιοι του νυμφωνος] </span></span>. More correctly as Rev., sons. It is noteworthy that Christ twice uses a figure drawn from marriage in his allusions to John the Baptist, the ascetic. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:29">John 3:29</span>. The sons of the bride - chamber are different from the groomsmen. They are the guests invited to the bridal. The scene is laid in Galilee, where groomsmen were not customary, as in Judaea. Hence there is no mention of them in the account of the marriage at Cana. In Judaea there were at every marriage two groomsmen or friends of the bridegroom. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:29">John 3:29</span>.</p>
