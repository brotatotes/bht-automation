<p>He went [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον παραπορευεσθαι] </span></span>. Lit., went along beside, along the stretches of standing grain. Matthew and Luke use dia, through, as Mark does, but not para. </p>
<p>Began, as they went, to pluck [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρξαντο οδον ποιειν τιλλοντες] </span></span>. Lit., began to make a way plucking the ears. This does not mean that the disciples broke a way for themselves through the standing corn by plucking the ears, for in that event they would have been compelled to break down the stalks. They could not have made a way by plucking the heads of the grain. Mark, who uses Latin forms, probably adopted here the phrase iter facere, to make a way, which is simply to go. The same idiom occurs in the Septuagint, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:17">Jude 1:17</span>:8; poihsai oJdon, as he journeyed. The offense given the Pharisees was the preparation of food on the Sabbath. Matthew says to eat, stating the motive, and Luke, rubbing with their hands, describing the act. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:2">Matthew 12:2</span>. The Rev. rightly retains the rendering of the A. V.</p>
