Pressed upon [επιπιπτειν] . Lit., fell upon. Plagues [μαστιγας] . Lit., scourges. Compare Acts 22:24; Hebrews 11:36. Our word plague is from plhgh, Latin plaga, meaning a blow. Pestilence or disease is thus regarded as a stroke from a divine hand. Plhgh is used in classical Greek in this metaphorical sense. Thus Sophocles, "Ajax," 279 : "I fear that a calamity [πληγη] is really come from heaven (qeou, God)." So of war. Aeschylus, "Persae," 251 : " O Persian land, how hath the abundant prosperity been destroyed by a single blow [εν μια πληγη] . The word here, scourges, carries the same idea.
