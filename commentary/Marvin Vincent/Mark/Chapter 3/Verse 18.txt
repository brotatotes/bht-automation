<p>Andrew [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανδρεαν] </span></span>. A name of Greek origin though ill use among the Jews, from ajnhr, man, and signifying manly. He was one of the two who came earliest to Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:18">Matthew 4:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:20">Matthew 4:20</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:40">John 1:40</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:41">John 1:41</span>); and hence is always styled by the Greek fathers prwtoklhtov, first called. </p>
<p>Philip [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλιππον] </span></span>. Another Greek name, meaning fond of horses. In ecclesiastical legend he is said to have been a chariot - driver. </p>
<p>Bartholomew. A Hebrew name - Bar Tolmai, son of Tolmai. Almost certainly identical with Nathanael. Philip and Nathanael are associated by John, as are Philip and Bartholomew in the parallel passages of the synoptics. Bartholomew is not mentioned in John's list of the twelve (xi. 2), but Nathanael is; while the synoptists do not mention Nathanael in their lists, but do mention Bartholomew. Probably he had two names. </p>
<p>Matthew. See on the superscription of Matthew's Gospel. Thomas. A Hebrew name, meaning twin, and translated by the Greek Didymus (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:16">John 11:16</span>). </p>
<p>Thaddaeus or Lebbaeus, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:3">Matthew 10:3</span>. He is the Judas of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:22">John 14:22</span>. Luther calls him der formme Judas (the good Judas). The two surnames, Lebbaeus and Thaddaeus, mean the same thing - beloved child. </p>
<p>Simon the Canaanite. Properly, Cananaean. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:4">Matthew 10:4</span> : "No name is more striking in the list than that of Simon the Zealot, for to none of the twelve could the contrast be so vivid between their former and their new position. What revolution of thought and heart could be greater than that which had thus changed into a follower of Jesus one of the fierce war - party of the day, which looked on the presence of Rome in the Holy Land as treason against the majesty of Jehovah, a party who were fanatical in their Jewish strictures and exclusiveness?" (Geikie, " Life and Words of Christ ").</p>
