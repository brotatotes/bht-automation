Guilty [ενοχος] . From ejn, in, ecw, to hold or have. Lit., is in the grasp of, or holden of. Compare 1 Corinthians 11:27; James 2:10. Eternal damnation [αιωνιου αμαρτηματος] . An utterly false rendering. Rightly as Rev., of an eternal sin. So Wyc., everlasting trespass. The A. V. has gone wrong in following Tyndale, who, in turn, followed the erroneous text of Erasmus, krisewv, judgment, wrongly rendered damnation. See Matthew 23:33, and compare Rev. there.
