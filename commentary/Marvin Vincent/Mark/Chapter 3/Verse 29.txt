<p>Guilty [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενοχος] </span></span>. From ejn, in, ecw, to hold or have. Lit., is in the grasp of, or holden of. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:27">1 Corinthians 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:10">James 2:10</span>. </p>
<p>Eternal damnation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιωνιου αμαρτηματος] </span></span>. An utterly false rendering. Rightly as Rev., of an eternal sin. So Wyc., everlasting trespass. The A. V. has gone wrong in following Tyndale, who, in turn, followed the erroneous text of Erasmus, krisewv, judgment, wrongly rendered damnation. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:33">Matthew 23:33</span>, and compare Rev. there.</p>
