<p>Being grieved [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συλλυπουμενος] </span></span>. Why the compound verb, with the preposition sun, together with? Herodotus (vi., 39) uses the word of condoling with another's misfortune. Plato (" Republic, "462) says," When any one of the citizens experiences good or evil, the whole state will either rejoice or sorrow with him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυλλυπησεται] </span></span>. The sun therefore implies Christ 's condolence with the moral misfortune of these hardhearted ones. Compare the force of con, in condolence. Latin, con, with, dolere, to grieve. </p>
<p>Hardness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πωρωσει] </span></span>. From pwrov, a kind of marble, and thence used of a callus on fractured bones. Pwrwsiv is originally the process by which the extremities of fractured bones are united by a callus. Hence of callousness, or hardness in general. The word occurs in two other passages in the New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:25">Romans 11:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:18">Ephesians 4:18</span>, where the A. V. wrongly renders blindness, following the Vulgate caecitas. It is somewhat strange that it does not adopt that rendering here (Vulgate, caecitate) which is given by both Wyc. and Tynd. The Rev. in all the passages rightly gives hardening, which is better than hardness, because it hints at the process going on. Mark only records Christ 's feeling on this occasion.</p>
