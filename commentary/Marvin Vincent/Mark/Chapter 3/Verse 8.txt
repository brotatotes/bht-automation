<p>He did [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποιει] </span></span>. Imperfect tense. Others read poiei, he is doing. In either case the tense has a continuous force : what things he was doing or is doing. Note in verses 7, 8, Mark's accurate detail of places. See Introduction. The reasons for our Lord 's withdrawing into a boat, given with such minuteness of detail in verses 9 - 11, are also peculiar to Mark.</p>
