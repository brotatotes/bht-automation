<p>Unto them that are without [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινοις τοις εξω] </span></span>. The two latter words are peculiar to Mark. The phrase means those outside of our circle. Its sense is always determined by the contrast to it. Thus, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:12">1 Corinthians 5:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:13">1 Corinthians 5:13</span>, it is non - Christians in contrast with me. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+4:5">Colossians 4:5</span>, Christians, contrasted with people of the world. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:12">1 Thessalonians 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:7">1 Timothy 3:7</span>. Matthew (xiii. 11), with less precision, uses simply ejkeinoiv (to them), the pronoun of remote reference. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:10">Luke 8:10</span>, toiv loipoiv (to the rest).</p>
