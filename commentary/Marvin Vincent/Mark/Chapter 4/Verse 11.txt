Unto them that are without [εκεινοις τοις εξω] . The two latter words are peculiar to Mark. The phrase means those outside of our circle. Its sense is always determined by the contrast to it. Thus, 1 Corinthians 5:12, 1 Corinthians 5:13, it is non - Christians in contrast with me. Colossians 4:5, Christians, contrasted with people of the world. Compare 1 Thessalonians 4:12; 1 Timothy 3:7. Matthew (xiii. 11), with less precision, uses simply ejkeinoiv (to them), the pronoun of remote reference. Luke 8:10, toiv loipoiv (to the rest).
