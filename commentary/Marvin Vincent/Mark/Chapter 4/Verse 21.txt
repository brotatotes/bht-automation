A candle [ο λυχνος] . Properly, the lamp, as Rev. Brought [ερχεται] . Lit., cometh. Doth the lamp come? This impersonation or investing the lamp with motion is according to Mark's lively mode of narrative, as is the throwing of the passage into the interrogative form. Compare Luke 8:16. The lamp : the article indicating a familiar household implement. So also "the bed" and "the stand." Bushel [μοδιον] . The Latin modius. One of Mark's Latin words. See on Matthew 5:15. The modius was nearer a peck than a bushel. Bed [κλινην] . A couch for reclining at table. Candlestick [λυχνιαν] . Rev., correctly, stand; i e., lamp stand. See on Matthew 5:15.
