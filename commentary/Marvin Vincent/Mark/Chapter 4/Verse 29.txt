<p>Is brought forth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδοι] </span></span>. This rendering cannot be correct, for the verb is active, not passive, meaning to deliver up. Hence it is usually explained, shall have delivered itself up to harvest; which is stilted and artificial. Rev. is ripe, is a free rendering from the margin of A. V. It is, perhaps, better to explain, as Meyer does, whose rendering is adopted by Rev. in margin : When the fruit shall have allowed, i e., shall have admitted of being harvested. Xenophon and Herodotus use the word in the sense of permit or allow; and an exact parallel to this occurs in the historian Polybius (xxii., 24, 9) : "When the season permitted" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδουσης] </span></span>. </p>
<p>Putteth in [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστελλει] </span></span>. Lit., sendeth forth. So Rev. in margin. The rendering, putteth in, misses the figure. The verb is the same as that used of sending forth the apostles to reap the harvest of souls. See especially <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:38">John 4:38</span> : "I sent [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστειλα</span></span>] you to reap."</p>
