<p>Storm [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαιλαψ] </span></span>. So Luke. Distinctively furious storm or hurricane. Compare Septuagint, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+38:1">Job 38:1</span>, of the whirlwind out of which God answered Job. See, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+21:18">Job 21:18</span>. Matthew uses seismov, a shaking. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:24">Matthew 8:24</span>. Mr. Macgregor (" Rob Roy on the Jordan ") says that "on the sea of Galilee the wind has a singular force and suddenness; and this is no doubt because that sea is so deep in the world that the sun rarefies the air in it enormously, and the wind, speeding swiftly above a long and level plateau, gathers much force as it sweeps through flat deserts, until suddenly it meets this huge gap in the way, and it tumbles down here irresistible."</p>
