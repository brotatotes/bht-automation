<p>My little daughter [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το θυγατριον] </span></span>. This little endearing touch in the use of the diminutive is peculiar to Mark. </p>
<p>Lieth at the point of death [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσχατως εχει] </span></span>. One of the uncouth phrases peculiar to Mark's style, and which are cited by some as evidence of the early composition of his gospel. </p>
<p>I pray thee come [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ελθων] </span></span>. The words I pray thee are not in the Greek. Literally the ruler 's words run thus : My little daughter lieth at the point of death - that thou come, etc. In his anguish he speaks brokenly and incoherently. </p>
<p>He went [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηλθεν] </span></span>. Lit., went away. The aorist tense, denoting action once for all, is in contrast with the imperfects, hjkolouqei, kept following, and suneqlibon, kept thronging. The multitude kept following and thronging as he went along. The preposition sun, together, in the latter verb, indicates the united pressure of a crowd. Compare Tynd., verse 31. Thrusting thee on every side.</p>
