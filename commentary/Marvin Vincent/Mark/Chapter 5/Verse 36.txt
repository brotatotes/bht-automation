Heard. This is from the reading ajkousav (Luke 8:50). The correct reading is parakousav, which may be rendered either not heeding, as Rev. (compare Matthew 28:17), or over - hearing, as Rev. in margin, which, on the whole, seems the more natural. Disregarding would be more appropriate if the message had been addressed to Jesus himself; but it was addressed to the ruler. Jesus overheard it. The present participle, laloumenon, being spoken, seems to fall in with this.
