<p>Heard. This is from the reading ajkousav (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:50">Luke 8:50</span>). The correct reading is parakousav, which may be rendered either not heeding, as Rev. (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:17">Matthew 28:17</span>), or over - hearing, as Rev. in margin, which, on the whole, seems the more natural. Disregarding would be more appropriate if the message had been addressed to Jesus himself; but it was addressed to the ruler. Jesus overheard it. The present participle, laloumenon, being spoken, seems to fall in with this.</p>
