With fetters and chains [πεδαις και αλυσεσιν] . pedh, fetter, is akin to peza, the instep; just as the Latin pedica, a shackle, is related to pes, a foot. The Anglo - Saxon plural of fot (foot) is fet; so that fetter is feeter. So Chaucer : "The pure fetters on his shinnes grete Were of his bitter salte teres wete." Alusiv (derivation uncertain) is a chain, a generic word, denoting a bond which might be on any part of the body. Broken in pieces [συντετριφθαι] . The verb suntribw means originally to rub together, to grind or crush. It has been suggested that the fetters might have been of cords which could be rubbed to pieces. Wyc. renders, Had broken the stocks to small gobbets.
