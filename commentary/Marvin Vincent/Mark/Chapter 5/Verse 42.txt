<p>Astonishment [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκστασει] </span></span>. Better Rev., amazement, which carries the sense of bewilderment. Ekstasiv, of which the English ecstasy is a transcript, is from ejk, out of, and isthmi, to place or put. Its primitive sense, therefore, is that of removal; hence of a man removed out of his senses. In Biblical Greek it is used in a modified sense, as here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:8">Mark 16:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:26">Luke 5:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:10">Acts 3:10</span>, of amazement, often coupled with fear. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:10">Acts 10:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:5">Acts 11:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:17">Acts 12:17</span>, it is used in the sense of our word ecstasy, and is rendered. </p>
