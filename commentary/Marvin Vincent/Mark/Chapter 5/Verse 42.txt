Astonishment [εκστασει] . Better Rev., amazement, which carries the sense of bewilderment. Ekstasiv, of which the English ecstasy is a transcript, is from ejk, out of, and isthmi, to place or put. Its primitive sense, therefore, is that of removal; hence of a man removed out of his senses. In Biblical Greek it is used in a modified sense, as here, Mark 16:8; Luke 5:26; Acts 3:10, of amazement, often coupled with fear. In Acts 10:10; Acts 11:5; Acts 12:17, it is used in the sense of our word ecstasy, and is rendered.
