Crying - he saith. The inarticulate cry (verse 5), and then the articulate speech. What have I to do with thee? [τι εμοι και σοι; ] . Lit., what is there to me and thee? What have we in common? I adjure thee by God. Stronger than Luke's I pray thee. The verb oJrkizw, I adjure, is condemned by the grammarians as inelegant.
