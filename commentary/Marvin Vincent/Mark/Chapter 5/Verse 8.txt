<p>For he said [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγεν] </span></span>. Imperfect tense, he was saying; the force of which is lost both in the A. V. and Rev. The imperfect gives the reason for this strange entreaty of the demon. Jesus was commanding, was saying "come out;" and, as in the case of the epileptic child at the Transfiguration Mount, the baffled spirit wreaked his malice on the man. The literal rendering of the imperfect brings out the simultaneousness of Christ 's exorcism, the outbreak of demoniac malice, and the cry Torment me not.</p>
