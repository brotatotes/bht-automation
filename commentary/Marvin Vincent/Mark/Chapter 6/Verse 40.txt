<p>In ranks [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρασιαι πρασιαι] </span></span>. Lit., like beds in a garden. The former adverb, by companies, describes the arrangement; this the color. The red, blue, and yellow clothing of the poorest Orientals makes an Eastern crowd full of color; a fact which would appeal to Peter's eye, suggesting the appearance of flower beds in a garden.</p>
