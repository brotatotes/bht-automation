Defiled [κοιναις] . Lit., common; and so Rev. in margin, Wyc., and Tynd. That is. Added by way of explanation to Gentile readers. Oft [πυγμη] . Rev., diligently. A word which has given critics much difficulty, and on which it is impossible to speak decisively. The Rev. gives in the margin the simplest meaning, the literal one, with the fist; that is, rubbing the uncleansed hand with the other doubled. This would be satisfactory if there were any evidence that such was the custom in washing; but there is none. Edersheim (" Life and Times of Jesus, "2, 11, note) says" the custom is not in accordance with Jewish law. "But he elsewhere says (" The Temple," 206, note), "For when water was poured upon the hands they had to be lifted, yet so that the water should neither run up above the wrist, nor back again upon the hand; best, therefore, by doubling the fingers into a fist. Hence (as Lightfoot rightly remarks) Mark 7:3, should be translated except they wash their hands with the fist." Tischendorf, in his eighth edition, retains an ancient reading, pukna, frequently or diligently, which may go to explain this translation in so man; y of the versions (Gothic, Vulgate, Syriac). Meyer, with his usual literalism gives with the fist, which I am inclined to adopt. Holding [κρατουντες] . Strictly, holding, firmly or fast. So Hebrews 4:14; Revelation 2:25; denoting obstinate adherence to the tradition.
