Evil Thoughts [διαλογισμοι οι κακοι] . Thoughts, those which are evil. So Rev., in margin. Thoughts that are evil. The word dialogismoi, thoughts, does not in itself convey a bad sense; and hence the addition of adjectives denoting evil, as here and James 2:4. Radically, it carries the idea of discussion or debate, with an under - thought of suspicion or doubt, either with one's own mind, as Luke 5:22; Luke 6:8; or with another, Luke 9:46; Philippians 2:14; Romans 14:1.
