<p>Wickedness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονηριαι] </span></span>. Plural. Rev., wickednesses. From ponein, to toil. The adjective ponhrov means, first, oppressed by toils; then in bad case or plight, from which it runs into the sense of morally bad. This conception seems to have been associated by the high - born with the life of the lower, laboring, slavish class; just as our word knave (like the German knabe from which it is derived) originally meant simply a boy or a servant - lad. As ponov means hard, vigorous labor, battle for instance, so the adjective ponhrov, in a moral sense, indicates active wickedness. So Jeremy Taylor : "Aptness to do shrewd turns, to delight in mischiefs and tragedies; a loving to trouble one's neighbor and do him ill offices." Ponhrov, therefore, is dangerous, destructive. Satan is called oJ ponhrov, the wicked one. Kakov, evil (see evil thoughts, verse 21), characterizes evil rather as defect : "That which is not such as, according to its nature, destination, and idea it might be or ought to be" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρεμερ] </span></span>. Hence of incapacity in war; of cowardice [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακια] </span></span>. Kakov doulov, the evil servant, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:48">Matthew 24:48</span>, is a servant wanting in proper fidelity and diligence. Thus the thoughts are styled evil, as being that which, in their nature and purpose, they ought not to be. Matthew, however (xv. 19), calls these thoughts ponhroi, the thoughts in action, taking shape in purpose. Both adjectives occur in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+16:2">Revelation 16:2</span>. </p>
<p>Lasciviousness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασελγεια] </span></span>. Derivation unknown. It includes lasciviousness, and may well mean that here; but is often used without this notion. In classical Greek it is defined as violence, with spiteful treatment and audacity. As in this passage its exact meaning is not implied by its being classed with other kindred terms, it would seem better to take it in as wide a sense as possible - that of lawless insolence and wanton caprice, and to render, with Trench, wantonness, since that word, as he remarks, "stands in remarkable ethical connection with ajselgeia, and has the same duplicity of meaning" (" Synonyms of the New Testament "). At <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</span>, where lasciviousness seems to be the probable meaning, from its association with chambering [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοιταις] </span></span>, it is rendered wantonness in A. V. and Rev., as also at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:18">2 Peter 2:18</span>. </p>
<p>Evil eye [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφθαλμος πονηρος] </span></span>. A malicious, mischief - working eye, with the meaning of positive, injurious activity. See on wickednesses. </p>
<p>Blasphemy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλασφημια] </span></span>. The word does not necessarily imply blasphemy against God. It is used of reviling, calumny, evil - speaking in general. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:39">Matthew 27:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:8">Romans 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:16">Romans 14:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:4">1 Peter 4:4</span>, etc. Hence Rev. renders railing. </p>
<p>Pride [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερηφανια] </span></span>. From uJper, above, and fainesqai, to show one's self. The picture in the word is that of a man with his head held high above others. It is the sin of an uplifted heart against God and man. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+16:5">Proverbs 16:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:16">Romans 12:16</span> (mind not high things); <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:6">1 Timothy 3:6</span>.</p>
