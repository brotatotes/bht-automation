<p>I have compassion [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπλαγχνιζομαι] </span></span>. A peculiar verb, from splagcna, the inward parts, especially the nobler entrails - the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. These came gradually to denote the seat of the affections, like our word heart. This explains the frequent use of the word bowels in the A. V. in the sense of tender mercy, affection, compassion. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:78">Luke 1:78</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:15">2 Corinthians 7:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:8">Philippians 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:7">Philippians 1:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:12">Philippians 1:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:20">Philippians 1:20</span>. The Rev. has properly rejected it in every such case, using it only in its literal sense in the single passage, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:18">Acts 1:18</span>. </p>
<p>They have been with me [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσμενουσιν] </span></span>. Lit., they continue, as Rev.</p>
