The Rev. reads, following the amended text, I see men, for [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτι</span></span>] I behold [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορω</span></span>] them as trees, walking. He saw them dimly. They looked like trees, large and misshapen; but he knew they were men, for they were walking about.</p>
