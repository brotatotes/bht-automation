I see men as trees walking (following the reading, Blepw touv ajnqrwpouv wJv dendra peripatountav). The Rev. reads, following the amended text, I see men, for [οτι] I behold [ορω] them as trees, walking. He saw them dimly. They looked like trees, large and misshapen; but he knew they were men, for they were walking about.
