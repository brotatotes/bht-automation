Faithless [απιστος] . Faithless has acquired the sense of treacherous, not keeping faith. But Christ means without faith, and such is Tyndale's translation. Wyc., out of belief. Unbelieving would be better here. The Rev. retains this rendering of the A. V. at 1 Corinthians 7:14, 1 Corinthians 7:15; Titus 1:15; Revelation 21:8, and elsewhere.
