<p>If thou canst believe [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ει δυνη] </span></span>. Lit., the if thou canst. The word believe is wanting in the best texts.

"It takes up substantially the word spoken by the father, and puts it with lively emphasis, without connecting it with the further construction, in order to link its fulfilment to the petitioner's own faith" (Meyer). We might paraphrase thus.

"If thou canst - all things can be."</p>
