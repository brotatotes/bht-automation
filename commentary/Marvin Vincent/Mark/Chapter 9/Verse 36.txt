Servant [διακονος] . Rev., minister. Probably from diwkw, to pursue; to be the follower of a person; to attach one's self to him. As distinguished from other words in the New Testament meaning servant, this represents the servant in his activity; while doulov, slave, represents him in his condition or relation as a bondman. A diakonov may be either a slave or a freeman. The word deacon is an almost literal transcription of the original. See Philippians 1:1; 1 Timothy 3:8, 1 Timothy 3:12. The word is often used in the New Testament to denote ministers of the gospel. See 1 Corinthians 3:5; Ephesians 3:7; 1 Thessalonians 3:2, and elsewhere. Mark uses doulov in Mark 10:44. Let [εστησεν] . Wyc. renders ordained. When he had taken him in his arms [εναγκαλισαμενος] . The verb is found only in Mark, and only he records this detail.
