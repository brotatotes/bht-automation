<p>Servant [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονος] </span></span>. Rev., minister. Probably from diwkw, to pursue; to be the follower of a person; to attach one's self to him. As distinguished from other words in the New Testament meaning servant, this represents the servant in his activity; while doulov, slave, represents him in his condition or relation as a bondman. A diakonov may be either a slave or a freeman. The word deacon is an almost literal transcription of the original.
