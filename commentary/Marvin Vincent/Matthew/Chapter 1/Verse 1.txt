<p>Christ [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χριστος</span></span>]. Properly an adjective, not a noun, and meaning anointed (criw, to anoint). It is a translation of the Hebrew Messiah, the king and spiritual ruler from David 's race, promised under that name in the Old Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:2">Psalms 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+9:25">Daniel 9:25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+9:26">Daniel 9:26</span>). Hence Andrew says to Simon, "We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:41">John 1:41</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:27">Acts 4:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:38">Acts 10:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:28">Acts 19:28</span>). To us "Christ" has become a proper name, and is therefore written without the definite article; but, in the body of the gospel narratives, since the identity of Jesus with the promised Messiah is still in question with the people, the article is habitually used, and the name should therefore be translated" the Christ. "After the resurrection, when the recognition of Jesus as Messiah has become general, we find the word beginning to be used as a proper name, with or without the article. In this passage it omits the article, because it occurs in the heading of the chapter, and expresses the evangelist 's own faith in Jesus as the Messiah. </p>
<p>Anointing was applied to kings (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+9:16">1 Samuel 9:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+10:1">1 Samuel 10:1</span>), to prophets (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:16">1 Kings 19:16</span>), and to priests (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:29">Exodus 29:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+40:15">Exodus 40:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+16:32">Leviticus 16:32</span>) at their inauguration. "The Lord 's anointed" was a common title of the king (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+12:3">1 Samuel 12:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+12:5">1 Samuel 12:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2sa+1:14">2 Samuel 1:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2sa+1:16">2 Samuel 1:16</span>). Prophets are called "Messiahs," or anointed one (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ch+16:22">1 Chronicles 16:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+105:15">Psalms 105:15</span>). Cyrus is also called "the Lord 's Anointed," because called to the throne to deliver the Jews out of captivity (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:1">Isaiah 45:1</span>). Hence the word "Christ" was representative of our Lord, who united in himself the offices of king, prophet, and priest. </p>
<p>It is interesting to see how anointing attaches to our Lord in other and minor particulars. Anointing was an act of hospitality and a sign of festivity and cheerfulness. Jesus was anointed by the woman when a guest in the house of Simon the Pharisee, and rebuked his host for omitting this mark of respect toward him (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:35">Luke 7:35</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:46">Luke 7:46</span>). In the Epistle to the Hebrews (i. 8, 9), the words of the Messianic psalm (xlv. 7) are applied to Jesus, "God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows." </p>
<p>Anointing was practiced upon the sick (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:13">Mark 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:34">Luke 10:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:14">James 5:14</span>). Jesus, "the Great Physician," is described by Isaiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:2">Isaiah 61:2</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:18">Luke 4:18</span>) as anointed by God to bind up the broken - hearted, and to give the mournful the oil of joy for mourning. He himself anointed the eyes of the blind man (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:6">John 9:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:11">John 9:11</span>); and the twelve, in his name, "anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:13">Mark 6:13</span>). </p>
<p>Anointing was practiced upon the dead. Of her who brake the alabaster upon his head at Bethany, Jesus said, "She hath anointed my body aforehand for the burying" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:8">Mark 14:8</span>; see, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:56">Luke 23:56</span>). </p>
<p>The Son [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιος</span></span>]. The word teknon (child) is often used interchangeably with uiJov (son), but is never applied to Christ. (For teknon, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:1">1 John 3:1</span>.) While in teknon there is commonly implied the passive or dependent relation of the children to the parents, uiJov fixes the thought on the person himself rather than on the dependence upon his parents. It suggests individuality rather than descent; or, if descent, mainly to bring out the fact that the son was worthy of his parent. Hence the word marks the filial relation as carrying with it privilege, dignity, and freedom, and is, therefore, the only appropriate term to express Christ 's sonship. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:13">Colossians 1:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>.) Through Christ the dignity of sons is bestowed on believers, so that the same word is appropriate to Christians, sons of God. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:14">Romans 8:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:26">Romans 9:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:26">Galatians 3:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:5">Galatians 4:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:6">Galatians 4:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:7">Galatians 4:7</span>.)</p>
