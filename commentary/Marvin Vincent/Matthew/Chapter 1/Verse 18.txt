Espoused [μνηστευθεισης : Rev., betrothed; Tyn., maryed]. The narrative implies a distinction between betrothal and marriage. From the moment of her betrothal a woman was treated as if actually married. The union could be dissolved only by regular divorce. Breach of faithfulness was regarded as adultery, and was punishable with death (Deuteronomy 22:23, Deuteronomy 22:24), and the woman 's property became virtually that of her betrothed, unless he had expressly renounced it; but, even in that case, he was her natural heir.
