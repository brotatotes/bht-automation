<p>Not willing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη θελων</span></span>] - was minded [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβουληθη] </span></span>. These two words, describing the working of Joseph 's mind, and evidently intended to express different phases of thought, open the question of their distinctive meanings in the New Testament, where they frequently occur [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω</span></span> much oftener than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλομαι] </span></span>, and where the rendering, in so many cases by the same words, furnishes no clue to the distinction. The original words are often used synonymously in cases where no distinction is emphasized; but their use in other cases reveals a radical and recognized difference. An interchange is inadmissable when the greater force of the expression requires qelein. For instance, boulesqai would be entirely inappropriate at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:3">Matthew 8:3</span>, "I will, be thou cleansed;" or at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:15">Romans 7:15</span>. </p>
<p>The distinction, which is abundantly illustrated in Homer, is substantially maintained by the classical writers throughout, and in the New Testament. </p>
<p>Qelein is the stronger word, and expresses a purpose or determination or decree, the execution of which is, or is believed to be, in the power of him who wills. Boulesqai expresses wish, inclination, or disposition, whether one desires to do a thing himself or wants some one else to do it. Qelein, therefore, denotes the active resolution, the will urging on to action. Boulesqai is to have a mind, to desire, sometimes a little stronger, running into the sense of purpose. Qelein indicates the impulse of the will; boulesqai, its tendency. Boulesqai can always be rendered by qelein, but qelein cannot always be expressed by boulesqai. </p>
<p>Thus, Agamemnon says, "I would not [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εθελον</span></span>] receive the ransom for the maid (i. e., I refused to receive), because I greatly desire [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλομαι</span></span>] to have her at home" (Homer, "Il.," 1 112). So Demosthenes : "It is fitting that you should be willing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθελειν</span></span>] to listen to those who wish [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλομενων</span></span>] to advise" (" Olynth., "1 1). That is to say, It is in your power to determine whether or not you will listen to those who desire to advise you, but who power to do so depends on your consent. Again :" If the gods will it [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελωσι</span></span>] and you wish it [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλησθε</span></span>] "(Demosth.," Olynth., " 2 20). 1 </p>
<p>In the New Testament, as observed above, though the words are often interchanged, the same distinction is recognized. Thus, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:18">Matthew 2:18</span>, "Rachael would not [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηθελε</span></span>] be comforted;" obstinately and positively refused. Joseph, having the right and power under the (assumed) circumstances to make Mary a public example, resolved [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελων</span></span>] to spare her this exposure. Then the question arose - What should he do? On this he thought, and, having thought [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενθυμηθεντος] </span></span>, his mind inclined (tendency), he was minded [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβουληθη</span></span>] to put her away secretly. </p>
<p>Some instances of the interchanged use of the two words are the following : <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:15">Mark 14:15</span>, "Pilate willing" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλομενος] </span></span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:20">Luke 23:20</span>, "Pilate willing" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελων] </span></span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:43">Acts 27:43</span>, "The centurion willing" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλομενος] </span></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:17">Matthew 27:17</span>, "Whom will ye that I release" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελετε] </span></span>; so ver. 21. Joh 18:39, "Will ye that I release" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλεσθε] </span></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:5">Matthew 14:5</span>, "When he would have put him to death" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελων] </span></span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:48">Mark 6:48</span>, "He would have passed by them" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηθελε] </span></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:30">Acts 19:30</span>, "Paul would have entered" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλομενου] </span></span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:27">Acts 18:27</span>, "He was disposed to pass" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλομενου] </span></span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:8">Titus 3:8</span>, "I will that thou affirm" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλομαι] </span></span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:25">Mark 6:25</span>, "I will that though give me" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω] </span></span>, etc., etc. </p>
<p>In the New Testament qelw occurs in the following senses : </p>
<p>1. A decree or determination of the will. </p>
<p>(a) Of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:7">Matthew 12:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:16">Romans 9:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:18">Romans 9:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:21">Acts 18:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:19">1 Corinthians 4:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:18">1 Corinthians 12:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:38">1 Corinthians 14:38</span>). </p>
<p>(b) Of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:3">Matthew 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21">John 5:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:22">John 21:22</span>). </p>
<p>(c) Of men (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:9">Acts 25:9</span>). Festus, having the power to gratify the Jews, and determining to do so, says to Paul, who has the right to decide, "Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem ?" <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:67">John 6:67</span>, Others of the disciples had decided to leave Jesus. Christ said to the twelve, "Will ye also go away?" Is that your determination? <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:17">John 7:17</span>, I any man sets his will, is determined to do God 's will. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>, The lusts of your father your will is set to do. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:6">Acts 24:6</span>. </p>
<p>2. A wish or desire. Very many of the passages, however, which are cited under this head (as by Grimm) may fairly be interpreted as implying something stronger than a wish; notably <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:36">Mark 14:36</span>, of Christ in Gethsemane. Our Lord would hardly have used what thou wilt in so feeble a sense as that of a desire or wish on God 's part. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:43">Mark 10:43</span>, "Whosoever will be great," expresses more than the desire for greatness. It is the purpose of the life. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:15">Matthew 27:15</span>, It was given to the Jews to decide what prisoner should be released. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:62">Luke 1:62</span>, The name of the infant John was referred to Zacharias' decision. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span>, Surely Christ does more than desire that those whom the Father has given him shall be with him. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:54">Luke 9:54</span>, It is for Jesus to command fire upon the Samaritan villages if he so wills. (See, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:7">John 14:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:21">1 Corinthians 4:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:25">Matthew 16:25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:17">Matthew 19:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:22">John 21:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:28">Matthew 13:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:12">Matthew 17:12</span>.) In the sense of wish or desire may fairly be cited <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:12">2 Corinthians 11:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:38">Matthew 12:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:20">Luke 8:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:8">Luke 23:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:21">John 12:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:20">Galatians 4:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:12">Matthew 7:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:35">Mark 10:35</span>. </p>
<p>3. A liking (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:38">Mark 12:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:46">Luke 20:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:43">Matthew 27:43</span>). (See note there.) </p>
<p>Boulomai occurs in the following senses : </p>
<p>1. Inclination or disposition (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:27">Acts 18:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:30">Acts 19:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:22">Acts 25:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:18">Acts 28:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:15">2 Corinthians 1:15</span>). </p>
<p>2. Stronger, with the idea of purpose (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:9">1 Timothy 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:18">James 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:4">James 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:11">1 Corinthians 12:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:17">Hebrews 6:17</span>). </p>
<p>In most, if not all of these cases, we might expect qelein; but this use of boulomai there is an implied emphasis on the element of free choice or self - determination, which imparts to the desire or inclination a decretory force. This element is in the human will by gift and consent. In the divine will it is inherent. At this point the Homeric usage may be compared in its occasional employment of boulomai to express determination, but only with reference to the gods, in whom to wish is to will. Thus, "Whether Apollo will [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλεται</span></span>] ward off the plague" (" Il., "1 67)." Apollo willed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλετο</span></span>] victory to the Trojans "(Il.," 7 21). </p>
<p>To make a public example [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειγματισαι] </span></span>. The word is kindred to deiknumi, to exhibit, display, point out. Here, therefore, to expose Mary to public shame (Wyc., publish her; Tyn., defame her). The word occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:15">Colossians 2:15</span>, of the victorious Savior displaying the vanquished powers of evil as a general displays his trophies or captives in a triumphal procession. "He made a show of them openly." A compound of the same word [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδειγματιζω</span></span>] appears in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:6">Hebrews 6:6</span>, "They crucify the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame."</p>
