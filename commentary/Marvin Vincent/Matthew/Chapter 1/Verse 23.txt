<p>The virgin [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η παρθενος] </span></span>. Note the demonstrative force of the article, pointing to a particular person. Not, some virgin or other. </p>
<p>They shall call [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλεσουσιν] </span></span>. In ver. 21, it is thou shalt call. The original of Isaiah (vii. 14) has she shall call; but Matthew generalized the singular into the plural, and quotes the prophecy in a form suited to its larger and final fulfilment : men shall call his name Immanuel, as they shall come to the practical knowledge that God will indeed dwell with men upon the earth. </p>
<p>Immanuel (Hebrew, God is with us). To protect and save. A comment is furnished by <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:10">Isaiah 8:10</span>, "Devise a device, but it shall come to naught; speak a word, but it shall not stand, for with us is God." Some suppose Isaiah embodied the purport of his message in the names of his children : Mahershalal - hash - baz (speed - prey), a warning of the coming of the fierce Assyrians; Shear - Jashub (a remnant shall return), a reminder of God 's mercy to Israel in captivity, and Immanuel (God is with us), a promise of God 's presence and succor. However this may be, the promise of the name is fulfilled in Jesus (compare "Lo, I am with you always," <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:20">Matthew 28:20</span>) by his helpful and saving presence with his people in their sorrow, their conflict with sin, and their struggle with death.</p>
