<p>Shake off [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτιναξατε] </span></span>. "The very dust of a heathen country was unclean, and it defiled by contact. It was regarded like a grave, or like the putrescence of death. If a spot of heathen dust had touched an offering, it must at once be burnt. More than that, if by mischance any heathen dust had been brought into Palestine, it did not and could not mingle with that of 'the land, ' but remained to the end what it had been - unclean, defiled and defiling everything to which it adhered." The apostles, therefore, were not only to leave the house or city which should refuse to receive the, "but it was to be considered and treated as if it were heathen, just as in the similar case mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:17">Matthew 18:17</span>. All contact with such must be avoided, all trace of it shaken off" (Edersheim, " Jewish Social Life in the Days of Christ "). The symbolic act indicated that the apostles and their Lord regarded them not only as unclean, but as entirely responsible for their uncleanness. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:6">Acts 18:6</span>.</p>
