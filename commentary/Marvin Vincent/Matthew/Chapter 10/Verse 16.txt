I send you forth [εγω αποστελλω] . Cognate to the word ajpostolov (apostle). The I is emphatic : "It is I that send you forth." Wise [φρονιμοι] . So A. V. and Rev. Denoting prudence with regard to their own safety. Wyc., wary. Harmless [ακεραιοι] . Lit., unmixed, unadulterated. Used of wine without water, and of metal without alloy. Hence guileless. So Luther, without falsity. Compare Romans 16:19; Philippians 2:15. They were to imitate the serpent 's wariness, but not his wiliness. "The presence of the wolves demands they ye be wary; the fact that ye are my apostles (compare" I send you ") demands that ye be guileless " (Dr. Morison on Matthew).
