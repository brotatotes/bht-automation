<p>Apostles [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστολων] </span></span>. Compare disciples, ver. 1. Apostles is the official term, used here for the first time. They were merely learners (disciples, maqhtai), until Christ gave them authority. From ajpostellw, to send away. An apostle is one sent forth. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:16">John 13:16</span> and Rev., one that is sent. Cremer (" Biblico - Theological Lexicon ") suggests that it was the rare occurrence of the word in profane Greek that made it all the more appropriate as the distinctive appellation of the twelve. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13">Luke 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:2">Acts 1:2</span>. Also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:18">John 17:18</span>, I have sent. The word is once used of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>), and in a very general sense to denote any one sent (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23">2 Corinthians 8:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:25">Philippians 2:25</span>).</p>
