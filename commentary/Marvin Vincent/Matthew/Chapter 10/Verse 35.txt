<p>Set at variance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διχασαι] </span></span>. Lit., part asunder. Wyc., to depart = part. </p>
<p>Daughter - in - law [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυμφην] </span></span>. So. A. V. and Rev.; but the full force is lost in this rendering. The word means bride, and though sometimes used in classical Greek of any married woman, it carries a notion of comparative youth. Thus in Homer, "Odyssey," 4 743, the aged nurse, Euryclea, addresses Penelope (certainly not a bride) as numfa filh (dear bride), of course as a term of affection or petting. Compare "Iliad," 3 130, where Iris addressed Helen in the same way. The radical and bitter character of the division brought into households by the Gospel is shown by the fact of its affecting domestic relations in their very freshness. They newly - married wife shall be set at variance with her mother - in - law. Wycliffe's rendering is peculiar : And the son's wife against the wife 's or husband 's mother.</p>
