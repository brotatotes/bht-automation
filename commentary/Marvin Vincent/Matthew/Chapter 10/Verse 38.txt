<p>His cross [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον σταυρον αυτου] </span></span>. This was no Jewish proverb, crucifixion not being a Jewish punishment; so that Jesus uses the phrase anticipatively, in view of the death which he himself was to die. This was one of those sayings described in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:16">John 12:16</span>, which the disciples understood not at the first, but the meaning of which was revealed in the light of later events. The figure itself was borrowed from the practice which compelled criminals to bear their own cross to the place of execution. His cross : his own. All are not alike. There are different crosses for different disciples. The English proverb runs : "Every cross hath its inscription" - the name of him for whom it is shaped.</p>
