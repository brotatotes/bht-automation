<p>Judas Iscariot [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ισκαριωτης] </span></span>. The article distinguishes him from others of the name of Judas (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:22">John 14:22</span>). Iscariot is usually explained as a compound, meaning the man of Kerioth, with reference to his native town, which is given in Joshua (xv. 25) as one of the uttermost cities of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward. </p>
<p>In the four catalogues of the apostles (here; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:16">Mark 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:14">Luke 6:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:13">Acts 1:13</span>) Simon Peter always stands first. Here expressly; "first Simon." Notice that Matthew names them in pairs, and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:7">Mark 6:7</span>, "sent them forth two and two." The arrangement of the different lists varies; but throughout, Peter is the leader of the first four, Philip of the second, and James, son of Alphaeus, of the third.</p>
