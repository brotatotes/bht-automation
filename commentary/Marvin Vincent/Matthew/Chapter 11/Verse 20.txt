Mighty works [δυναμεις] . The supernatural works of Christ and his apostles are denoted by six different words in the New Testament, exhibiting these works under different aspects and from different points of view. These will be considered in detail as they occur. Generally, a miracle may be regarded : 1. As a portent or prodigy [τερας] ; as Acts 7:36, of the wonders shown by Moses in Egypt. 2. As a sign [σημειον] , pointing to something beyond itself, a mark of the power or grace of the doer or of his connection with the supernatural world. So Matthew 12:38. 3. As an exhibition of God 's glory [ενδοξον] , Luke 13:17; glorious things. 4. As a strange thing [παραδοξον] , Luke 5:26. 5. As a wonderful thing (qaumasion), Matthew 21:15. 6. As a power [δυναμις] ; so here : a mighty work.
