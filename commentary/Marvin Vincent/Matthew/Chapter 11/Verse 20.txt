<p>Mighty works [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμεις] </span></span>. The supernatural works of Christ and his apostles are denoted by six different words in the New Testament, exhibiting these works under different aspects and from different points of view. These will be considered in detail as they occur. Generally, a miracle may be regarded : </p>
<p>1. As a portent or prodigy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τερας] </span></span>; as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:36">Acts 7:36</span>, of the wonders shown by Moses in Egypt. </p>
<p>2. As a sign [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον] </span></span>, pointing to something beyond itself, a mark of the power or grace of the doer or of his connection with the supernatural world. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:38">Matthew 12:38</span>. </p>
<p>3. As an exhibition of God 's glory [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδοξον] </span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:17">Luke 13:17</span>; glorious things. </p>
<p>4. As a strange thing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδοξον] </span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:26">Luke 5:26</span>. </p>
<p>5. As a wonderful thing (qaumasion), <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:15">Matthew 21:15</span>. </p>
<p>6. As a power [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις] </span></span>; so here : a mighty work.</p>
