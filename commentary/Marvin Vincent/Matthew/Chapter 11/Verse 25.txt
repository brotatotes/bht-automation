<p>I thank [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξομολογουμαι] </span></span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:6">Matthew 3:6</span>, of confessing sins. Lit., I confess. I recognize the justice and wisdom of thy doings. But with the dative, as here (soi, to thee), it means to praise, with an undercurrent of acknowledgment; to confess only in later Greek, and with an accusative of the object. Rev. gives praise in the margin here, and at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:11">Romans 14:11</span>. Tynd., I praise. </p>
<p>Prudent [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνετων] </span></span>. Rev., understanding; Wyc., wary. From the verb sunihmi, to bring together, and denoting that peculiarity of mind which brings the simple features of an object into a whole. Hence comprehension, insight. Compare on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:33">Mark 12:33</span>, understanding [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεσεως] </span></span>. Wise [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφων</span></span>] and understanding are often joined, as here. The general distinction is between productive and reflective wisdom, but the distinction is not always recognized by the writer.</p>
