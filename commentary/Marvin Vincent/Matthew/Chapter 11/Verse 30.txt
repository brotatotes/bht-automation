<p>Easy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρηστος] </span></span>. Not a satisfactory rendering. Christ 's yoke is not easy in the ordinary sense of that word. The word means originally, good, serviceable. The kindred noun, crhstothv, occurring only in Paul 's writings, is rendered kindness in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:6">2 Corinthians 6:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:4">Titus 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:7">Ephesians 2:7</span> (Rev.), and goodness, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span> (Rev.). At <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:39">Luke 5:39</span>, it is used of old wine, where the true reading, instead of better, is good [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρηστος] </span></span>, mellowed with age. Plato (" Republic, "424) applies the word to education." Good nurture and education [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τροφη γαρ και παιδευσις χρηστη</span></span>] implant good [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαθας</span></span>] constitutions; and these good [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρησται</span></span>] constitutions improve more and more; "thus evidently using crhstov and ajgaqov as synonymous. The three meanings combine in the word, though it is impossible to find an English word which combines them all. Christ 's yoke is wholesome, serviceable, kindly." Christ 's yoke is like feathers to a bird; not loads, but helps to motion " (Jeremy Taylor). </p>
