<p>As they departed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων δε πορευομενων] </span></span>. Rev., more literal and better, as these went their way; or while they, John's disciples, were departing : thus giving the simultaneousness of Jesus ' words with the act of departure. </p>
<p>To see [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεασασθαι] </span></span>. Rev., to behold. qeasqai, like qewrein, expresses the calm, continuous contemplation of an object which remains before the spectator. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>. Another verb is used in Christ 's repetition of the question, vv. 8, 9; iJudein in the ordinary sense of seeing. The more earnest expression suits the first question.</p>
