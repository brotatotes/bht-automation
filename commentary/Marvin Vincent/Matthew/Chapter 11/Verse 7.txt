As they departed [τουτων δε πορευομενων] . Rev., more literal and better, as these went their way; or while they, John's disciples, were departing : thus giving the simultaneousness of Jesus ' words with the act of departure. To see [θεασασθαι] . Rev., to behold. qeasqai, like qewrein, expresses the calm, continuous contemplation of an object which remains before the spectator. Compare John 1:14. Another verb is used in Christ 's repetition of the question, vv. 8, 9; iJudein in the ordinary sense of seeing. The more earnest expression suits the first question.
