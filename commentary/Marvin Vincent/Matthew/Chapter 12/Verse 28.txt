<p>Is come unto you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφθασεν εφ υμας] </span></span>. The verb is used in the simple sense to arrive at (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:14">2 Corinthians 10:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:16">Philippians 3:16</span>), and sometimes to anticipate (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>). Here with a suggestion of the latter sense, which is also conveyed by the Rev., "come upon." It has come upon you before you expected it.</p>
