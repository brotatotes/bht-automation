<p>Bringeth forth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβαλλει] </span></span>. But the translation is feeble. The word means to throw or fling out. The good or evil things come forth out of the treasure of the heart (34). "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." The issues of the heart are thrown out, as if under pressure of the abundance within.</p>
