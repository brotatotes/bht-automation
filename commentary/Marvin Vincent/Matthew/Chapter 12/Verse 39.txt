Adulterous [μοιχαλις] . A very strong and graphic expression, founded upon the familiary Hebrew representation of the relation of God 's people to him under the figure of marriage. See Psalms 73:27; Isaiah 57:3 sqq.; Isaiah 61:5; Ezekiel 23:27. Hence idolatry and intercourse with Gentiles were described as adultery; and so here, of moral unfaithfulness to God. Compare James 4:4; Revelation 2:20 sqq. Thus Dante : "Where Michael wrought Vengeance upon the proud adultery." Inf., 7, 12.
