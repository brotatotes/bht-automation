<p>One greater [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζων] </span></span>. The correct reading makes the adjective neuter, so that the right rendering is something greater (Rev., in margin). The reference is, of course, to Christ himself (compare vv. 41, 42, where the neuter pleion, more (so Rev., in margin), is used in the same way). Compare, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span>, where Christ speaks of his own body as a temple. The indefiniteness of the neuter gives a more solemn and impressive sense.</p>
