Mysteries [μυστηρια] . From muw, to close or shut. In classical Greek, applied to certain religious celebrations to which persons were admitted by formal initiation, and the precise character of which is unknown. Some suppose them to have been revelations of religious secrets; others of secret politico - religious doctrines; others, again, scenic representations of mythical legends. In this latter sense the term was used in the Middle Ages of miracle - plays - rude drams representing scenes from scripture and from the apocryphal gospels. Such plays are still enacted among the Basque mountaineers. (See Vincent, " In the Shadow of the Pyrenees. ") A mystery does not denote an unknowable thing, but one which is withdrawn from knowledge or manifestation, and which cannot be known without special manifestation of it. Hence appropriate to the things of the kingdom of heaven, which could be known only by revelation. Paul (Philippians 4:12) says, "I am instructed [μεμυημαι] both to be full and to be hungry," etc. But Rev. gives more correctly the force of instructed, by rendering I have learned the secret : the verb being muew (from the same root as musthria) to initiate into the mysteries.
