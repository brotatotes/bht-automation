Dureth for a while [προσκαιρος εστιν] . Rev., endureth. Lit., is temporary : thus bringing out the quality of the hearer. He is a creature of circumstances, changing as they change. Wyc., is temporal, with explanation, lasteth but a little time. For [δε] . Rev. better, and, for the following clause does not give a reason for the temporariness, but adds something to the description of the hearer. Tribulation [θλιψεως] . qlibw, to press or squeeze. Tribulation is perhaps as accurate a rendering as is possible, being derived from tribulum, the threshing - roller of the Romans. In both the idea of pressure is dominant, though qliyiv does not convey the idea of separation (as of corn from husk) which is implied in tribulatio. Trench cites, in illustration of qliyiv, pressure, the provision of the old English law, by which those who wilfully refused to plead had heavy weights placed on their breasts, and so were pressed and crushed to death (" Synonyms of the New Testament ").
