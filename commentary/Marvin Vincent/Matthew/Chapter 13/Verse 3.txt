<p>Parables [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβολαις] </span></span>. From para, beside, and ballw, to throw. A parable is a form of teaching in which one thing is thrown beside another. Hence its radical idea is comparison. Sir John Cheke renders biword, and the same idea is conveyed by the German Beispiel, a pattern or example; bei, beside, and the old high German spel, discourse or narration. </p>
<p>The word is used with a wide range in scripture, but always involves the idea of comparison : </p>
<p>1. Of brief sayings, having an oracular or proverbial character. Thus Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:15">Matthew 14:15</span>), referring to the words "If the blind lead the blind," etc., says, "declare unto us this parable." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:39">Luke 6:39</span>. So of the patched garment (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:36">Luke 5:36</span>), and the guest who assumes the highest place at the feast (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:7">Luke 14:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:11">Luke 14:11</span>). Compare, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:32">Matthew 24:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:28">Mark 13:28</span>. </p>
<p>2. Of a proverb. The word for proverb [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παροιμια</span></span>] has the same idea at the root as parable. It is para, beside, oimov, a way or road. Either a trite, wayside saying (Trench), or a path by the side of the high road (Godet). See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:23">Luke 4:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+24:13">1 Samuel 24:13</span>. </p>
<p>3. Of a song or poem, in which an example is set up by way of comparison. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mic+2:4">Micah 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:6">Habakkuk 2:6</span>. </p>
<p>4. Of a word or discourse which is enigmatical or obscure until the meaning is developed by application or comparison. It occurs along with the words ainigma, enigma, and problhma, a problem, something put forth or proposed (pro, in front, ballw, to throw). See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+49:0">Psalms 49:0</span>. (Sept. 48) 4; 78 (Sept. 77) 2; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+1:6">Proverbs 1:6</span>, where we have parabolhn, parable; skoteinon logon, dark saying; aijnigmata, enigmas. Used also of the saying of Balaam (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+23:7">Numbers 23:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+23:18">Numbers 23:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+24:3">Numbers 24:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+24:15">Numbers 24:15</span>). </p>
<p>In this sense Christ uses parables symbolically to expound the mysteries of the kingdom of God; as utterances which conceal from one class what they reveal to another (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:11-17">Matthew 13:11-17</span>), and in which familiar facts of the earthly life are used figuratively to expound truths of the higher life. The unspiritual do not link these facts of the natural life with those of the supernatural, which are not discerned by them (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14">1 Corinthians 2:14</span>), and therefore they need an interpreter of the relation between the two. Such symbols assume the existence of a law common to the natural and spiritual worlds under which the symbol and the thing symbolized alike work; so that the one does not merely resemble the other superficially, but stands in actual coherence and harmony with it. Christ formulates such a law in connection with the parables of the Talents and the Sower. "To him that hath shall be given. From him that hath not shall be taken away." That is a law of morals and religion, as of business and agriculture. One must have in order to make. Interest requires capital. Fruit requires not only seed but soil. Similarly, the law of growth as set forth in the parable of the Mustard Seed, is a law common to nature and to the kingdom of God. The great forces in both kingdoms are germinal, enwrapped in small seeds which unfold from within by an inherent power of growth. </p>
<p>5. A parable is also an example or type; furnishing a model or a warning; as the Good Samaritan, the Rich Fool, the Pharisee and the Publican. The element of comparison enters here as between the particular incident imagined or recounted, and all cases of a similar kind. </p>
<p>The term parable, however, as employed in ordinary Christian phraseology, is limited to those utterances of Christ which are marked by a complete figurative history or narrative. It is thus defined by Goebel (" Parables of Jesus "). "A narrative moving within the sphere of physical or human life, not professing to describe an event which actually took place, but expressly imagined for the purpose of representing, in pictorial figure, a truth belonging to the sphere of religion, and therefore referring to the relation of man or mankind to God." </p>
<p>In form the New Testament parables resemble the fable. The distinction between them does not turn on the respective use of rational and irrational beings speaking and acting. There are fables where the actors are human. Nor does the fable always deal with the impossible, since there are fables in which an animal, for instance, does nothing contrary to its nature. The distinction lies in the religious character of the New Testament parable as contrasted with the secular character of the fable. While the parable exhibits the relations of man to God, the fable teaches lessons of worldly policy or natural morality and utility. "The parable is predominantly symbolic; the fable, for the most part, typical, and therefore presents its teaching only in the form of example, for which reason it chooses animals by preference, not as symbolic, but as typical figures; never symbolic in the sense in which the parable mostly is, because the higher invisible world, of which the parable sees and exhibits the symbol in the visible world of nature and man, lies far from it. Hence the parable can never work with fantastic figures like speaking animals, trees," etc. (Goebel, condensed). </p>
<p>The parable differs from the allegory in that there is in the latter "an interpenetration of the thing signified and the thing signifying; the qualities and properties of the first being attributed to the last," and the two being this blended instead of being kept distinct and parallel. See, for example, the allegory of the Vine and the Branches (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:0">John 15:0</span>) where Christ at once identifies himself with the figure : "I am the true vine." Thus the allegory, unlike the parable, carries its own interpretation with it. </p>
<p>Parable and proverb are often used interchangeably in the New Testament; the fundamental conception being, as we have seen, the same in both, the same Hebrew word representing both, and both being engimatical. They differ rather in extent than in essence; the parable being a proverb expanded and carried into detail, and being necessarily figurative, which the proverb is not; though the range of the proverb is wider, since the parable expands only one particular case of a proverb. (See Trench, "Notes on the Parables," Introd.) </p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:3">Matthew 13:3</span> A sower [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο σπειρων] </span></span>. Rev., the sower. Generic, as representing a class. </p>
<p>To sow [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του σπειρειν] </span></span>. "According to Jewish authorities, there was twofold sowing, as the seed was either cast by the hand or by means of cattle. In the latter case, a sack with holes was filled with corn and laid on the back of the animal, so that, as it moved onward, the seed was thickly scattered" (Edersheim, " Life and Times of Jesus ").</p>
