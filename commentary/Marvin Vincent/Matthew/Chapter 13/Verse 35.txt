I will utter [ερευξομαι] . The verb, in which the sound corresponds to the sense [ερευξομαι] , means originally to belch, to disgorge. Homer uses it of the sea surging against the shore (" Iliad, "17 265). Pindar of the eruption of Aetna (" Pyth.," 1 40). There seems to lie in the word a sense of full, impassioned utterance, as of a prophet. From the foundation [απο καταβολης] . "It is assumed by the Psalmist (Psalms 78:2) that there was a hidden meaning in God 's ancient dealings with his people. A typical, archetypical, and prefigurative element ran through the whole. The history of the dealings is one long Old Testament parable. Things long kept secret, and that were hidden indeed in the depths of the divine mind from before the foundation of the world, were involved in these dealings. And hence the evangelist wisely sees, in the parabolic teaching of our Lord, a real culmination of the older parabolic teaching of the Psalmist. The culmination was divinely intended, and hence the expression that it might be fulfilled" (Morison on Matthew).
