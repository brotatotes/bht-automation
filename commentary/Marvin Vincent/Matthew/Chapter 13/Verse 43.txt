<p>Shine forth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλαμψουσιν] </span></span>. The compound verb with ejk, forth, is designedly used to express a dissipating of darkness which has hidden : a bursting into light. The righteous shall shine forth as the sun from behind a cloud. The mixture of evil with good in the world obscures the good, and veils the true glory of righteous character.
