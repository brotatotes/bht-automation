Shine forth [εκλαμψουσιν] . The compound verb with ejk, forth, is designedly used to express a dissipating of darkness which has hidden : a bursting into light. The righteous shall shine forth as the sun from behind a cloud. The mixture of evil with good in the world obscures the good, and veils the true glory of righteous character. Compare Daniel 12:3.
