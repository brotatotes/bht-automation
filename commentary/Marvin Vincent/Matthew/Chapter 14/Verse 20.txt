<p>Baskets [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοφινους] </span></span>. Wyc., coffins, a transcription of the Greek word. Juvenal, the Roman satirist, describes the grove of Numa, near the Capenian gate of Rome, as being "let out to the Jews, whose furniture is a basket [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χοπηινυσ</span></span>] and some hay" (for a bed), "Sat." 3 14. These were small hand - baskets, specially provided for the Jews to carry levitically clean food while travelling in Samaria or other heathen districts. The word for basket used in relating the feeding of the four thousand (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:37">Matthew 14:37</span>) is spuriv, a large provision - basket or hamper, of the kind used for letting Paul down over the wall at Damascus (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:25">Acts 9:25</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:9">Matthew 16:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:10">Matthew 16:10</span>, Christ, in alluding to the two miracles, observes the distinctive term in each narrative; using kofinouv in the case of the five thousand, and spuridav in the other. Burgon (" Letters from Rome ") gives a drawing of a wicker basket used by the masons in the cathedral at Sorrento, and called coffano. He adds, "Who can doubt that the basket of the gospel narrative was of the shape here represented, and that the denomination of this basket exclusively has lingered in a Greek colony, where the Jews (who once carried the cophinus as a personal equipment) formerly lived in great numbers?"</p>
