<p>Wash not their hands. Washing before meals was along regarded as a commandment; washing after meals only as a duty. By and by the more rigorous actually washed between the courses, although this was declared to be purely voluntary. The distinctive designation for washing after meals was the lifting of the hands; while for washing before meat a term was used which meant, literally, to rub. If "holy," i e., sacrificial food was to be partaken of, a complete immersion of the hands, and not a mere "uplifting" was prescribed. As the purifications were so frequent, and care had to be taken that the water had not been used for other purposes, or something fallen into it that might discolor or defile it, large vessels or jars were generally kept for the purpose (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:6">John 2:6</span>). It was the practice to draw water out of these with a kind of ladle or bucket - very often of glass - which must hold at least one and a half egg - shells (compare draw out now, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:8">John 2:8</span>). The water was poured on both hands, which must be free of anything covering them, such as gravel, mortar, etc. The hands were lifted up so as to make the water run to the wrist, in order to insure that the whole hand was washed, and that the water polluted by the hand did not again run down the fingers. Similarly, each hand was rubbed with the other (the fist,) provided the hand that rubbed had been affused; otherwise, the rubbing might be done against the head, or even against a wall. But there was one point on which special stress was laid. In the "first affusion," which was all that originally was required when the hands were not levitically "defiled," the water had to run down to the wrist. If the water remained short of the wrist, the hands were not clean. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:3">Mark 7:3</span> (Edersheim, " Life and Times of Jesus ").</p>
