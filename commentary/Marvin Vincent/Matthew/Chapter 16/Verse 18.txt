<p>Thou art Peter [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου ει πετρος] </span></span>. Christ responds to Peter's emphatic thou with another, equally emphatic. Peter says, "Thou art the Christ." Christ replies, "Thou art Peter." Petrov (Peter) is used as a proper name, but without losing its meaning as a common noun. The name was bestowed on Simon at his first interview with Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:42">John 1:42</span>) under the form of its Aramaic equivalent, Cephas. In this passage attention is called, not to the giving of the name, but to its meaning. In classical Greek the word means a piece of rock, as in Homer, of Ajax throwing a stone at Hector (" Iliad, "7 270), or of Patroclus grasping and hiding in his hand a jagged stone (" Iliad," 16 734). </p>
<p>On this rock [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι ταυτη τη πετρα] </span></span>. The word is feminine, and mean a rock, as distinguished from a stone or a fragment of rock (petrov, above). </p>
<p>Used of a ledge of rocks or a rocky peak. In Homer (" Odyssey, "9 243), the rock [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πετρην</span></span>] which Polyphemus places at the door of his cavern, is a mass which two - and - twenty wagons could not remove; and the rock which he hurled at the retreating ships of Ulysses, created by its fall a wave in the sea which drove the ships back toward the land (" Odyssey," 9 484). The word refers neither to Christ as a rock, but to Peter himself, in a sense defined by his previous confession, and as enlightened by the "Father in Heaven." </p>
<p>The reference of petra to Christ is forced and unnatural. The obvious reference of the word is to Peter. The emphatic this naturally refers to the nearest antecedent; and besides, the metaphor is thus weakened, since Christ appears here, not as the foundation, but as the architect : "On this rock will I build." Again, Christ is the great foundation, the "chief corner - stone," but the New Testament writers recognize no impropriety in applying to the members of Christ 's church certain terms which are applied to him. For instance, Peter himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:4">1 Peter 2:4</span>), calls Christ a living stone, and, in ver. 5, addresses the church as living stones. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:14">Revelation 21:14</span>, the names of the twelve apostles appear in the twelve foundation - stones of the heavenly city; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>, it is said, "Ye are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets (i. e., laid by the apostles and prophets), Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner - stone." </p>
<p>Equally untenable is the explanation which refers petra to Simon 's confession. Both the play upon the words and the natural reading of the passage are against it, and besides, it does not conform to the fact, since the church is built, not on confessions, but on confessors - living men. "The word petra," says Edersheim, "was used in the same sense in Rabbinic language. According to the Rabbins, when God was about to build his world, he could not rear it on the generation of Enos, nor on that of the flood, who brought destruction upon the world; but when he beheld that Abraham would arise in the future, he said : 'Behold, I have found a rock to build on it, and to found the world, ' whence, also, Abraham is called a rock, as it is said : 'Look unto the rock whence ye are hewn. ' The parallel between Abraham and Peter might be carried even further. If, from a misunderstanding of the Lord 's promise to Peter, later Christian legend represented the apostle as sitting at the gate of heaven, Jewish legend represents Abraham as sitting at the gate of Gehenna, so as to prevent all who had the seal of circumcision from falling into its abyss" (" Life and Times of Jesus "). </p>
<p>The reference to Simon himself is confirmed by the actual relation of Peter to the early church, to the Jewish portion of which he was a foundation - stone. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15">Acts 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:14">Acts 2:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:37">Acts 2:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:13">Acts 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:8">Acts 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:15">Acts 5:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:29">Acts 5:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:34">Acts 9:34</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:40">Acts 9:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:25">Acts 10:25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:26">Acts 10:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:18">Galatians 1:18</span>. </p>
<p>Church [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλησιαν] </span></span>, ejk, out, kalew, to call or summon. This is the first occurrence of this word in the New Testament. Originally an assembly of citizens, regularly summoned. So in New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:39">Acts 19:39</span>. The Septuagint uses the word for the congregation of Israel, either as summoned for a definite purpose (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:65">1 Kings 8:65</span>), or for the community of Israel collectively, regarded as a congregation (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+28:3">Genesis 28:3</span>), where assembly is given for multitude in margin. In New Testament, of the congregation of Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:38">Acts 7:38</span>); but for this there is more commonly employed sunagwgh, of which synagogue is a transcription; sun, together, agw, to bring (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:43">Acts 13:43</span>). In Christ 's words to Peter the word ejkklhsia acquires special emphasis from the opposition implied in it to the synagogue. The Christian community in the midst of Israel would be designated as ejkklhsia, without being confounded with the sunagwgh, the Jewish community. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:11">Acts 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:1">Acts 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:27">Acts 14:27</span>, etc. Nevertheless sunagwgh is applied to a Christian assembly in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:2">James 2:2</span>, while ejpisunagwgh (gathering or assembling together) is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1">2 Thessalonians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:25">Hebrews 10:25</span>. Both in Hebrew and in New Testament usage ejkklhsia implies more than a collective or national unity; rather a community based on a special religious idea and established in a special way. In the New Testament the term is used also in the narrower sense of a single church, or a church confined to a particular place. So of the church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span>); the church at Corinth, the churches in Judea, the church at Jerusalem, etc. </p>
<p>Gates of hell [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυλαι αδου] </span></span>. Rev., Hades. Hades was originally the name of the God who presided over the realm of the dead - Pluto or Dis. Hence the phrase, house of Hades. It is derived from aj, not, and iJudein, to see; and signifies, therefore, the invisible land, the realm of shadow. It is the place to which all who depart this life descend, without reference to their moral character. </p>
<p>By this word the Septuagint translated the Hebrew Sheol, which has a similar general meaning. The classical Hades embraced both good and bad men, though divided into Elysium, the abode of the virtuous, and Tartarus, the abode of the wicked. In these particulars it corresponds substantially with Sheol; both the godly and the wicked being represented as gathered into the latter. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+42:38">Genesis 42:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+9:17">Psalms 9:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+139:8">Psalms 139:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:9">Isaiah 14:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:2">Isaiah 57:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+32:27">Ezekiel 32:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ho+13:14">Hosea 13:14</span>. Hades and Sheol were alike conceived as a definite place, lower than the world. The passage of both good and bad into it was regarded as a descent. The Hebrew conception is that of a place of darkness; a cheerless home of a dull, joyless, shadowy life. See Psalms <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+6:5">Psalms 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+94:17">Psalms 94:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+115:17">Psalms 115:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+88:5">Psalms 88:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+88:6">Psalms 88:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+88:10">Psalms 88:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+10:21">Job 10:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+3:17-19">Job 3:17-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+14:10">Job 14:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+14:11">Job 14:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ec+4:5">Ecclesiastes 4:5</span>. Vagueness is its characteristic. In this the Hebrew's faith appears bare in contrast with that of the Greek and Roman. The pagan poets gave the popular mind definite pictures of Tartarus and Elysium; of Styx and Acheron; of happy plains where dead heroes held high discourse, and of black abysses where offenders underwent strange and ingenious tortures. </p>
<p>There was, indeed, this difference between the Hebrew and the Pagan conceptions; that to the Pagan, Hades was the final home of its tenants, while Sheol was a temporary condition. Hence the patriarchs are described (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:16">Hebrews 11:16</span>) as looking for a better, heavenly country; and the martyrs as enduring in hope of "a better resurrection." Prophecy declared that the dead should arise and sing, when Sheol itself should be destroyed and its inmates brought forth, some to everlasting life, and others to shame and contempt (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+26:19">Isaiah 26:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ho+13:14">Hosea 13:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+12:2">Daniel 12:2</span>). Paul represents this promise as made to the fathers by God, and as the hope of his countrymen (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:7">Acts 26:7</span>). God was the God of the dead as well of the living; present in the dark chambers of Sheol as well as in heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+139:8">Psalms 139:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:10">Psalms 16:10</span>). This is the underlying thought of that most touching and pathetic utterance of Job (xiv. 13 - 15), in which he breathes the wish that God would him with loving care in Hades, as a place of temporary concealment, where he will wait patiently, standing like a sentinel at his post, awaiting the divine voice calling him to a new and happier life. This, too, is the thought of the familiar and much - disputed passage, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+19:23-27">Job 19:23-27</span>. His Redeemer, vindicator, avenger, shall arise after he shall have passed through the shadowy realm of Sheol. "A judgment in Hades, in which the judge will show himself his friend, in which all the tangled skein of his life will be unravelled by wise and kindly hands, and the insoluble problem of his strange and self - contradicting experience will at last be solved - this is what Job still looks for on that happy day when he shall see God for himself, and find his Goel (vindicator) in that Almighty Deliverer" (Cox, " Commentary on the Book of Job "). </p>
<p>In the New Testament, Hades is the realm of the dead. It cannot be successfully maintained that it is, in particular, the place for sinners (so Cremer, "Biblico - Theological Lexicon "). The words about Capernaum (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:23">Matthew 11:23</span>), which it is surprising to find Cremer citing in support of this position, are merely a rhetorical expression of a fall from the height of earthly glory to the deepest degradation, and have no more bearing upon the moral character of Hades than the words of Zophar (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+11:7">Job 11:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+11:8">Job 11:8</span>) about the perfection of the Almighty." It is high as heaven - deeper than Sheol. "Hades is indeed coupled with Death (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+6:8">Revelation 6:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:13">Revelation 20:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:14">Revelation 20:14</span>), but the association is natural, and indeed inevitable, apart from all moral distinctions. Death would naturally be followed by Hades in any case. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:13">Revelation 20:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:14">Revelation 20:14</span>, the general judgment is predicted, and not only Death and Hades, but the sea give up their dead, and only those who are not written in the book of life are cast into the lake of fire (ver. 15). The rich man was in Hades (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:23">Luke 16:23</span>), and in torments, but Lazarus was also in Hades," in Abraham 's bosom. "The details of this story" evidently represent the views current at the time among the Jews. According to them, the Garden of Eden and the Tree of Life were the abode of the blessed.... We read that the righteous in Eden see the wicked in Gehenna and rejoice; and similarly, that the wicked in Gehenna see the righteous sitting beatified in Eden, and their souls are troubled (Edersheim, " Life and Times of Jesus "). Christ also was in Hades (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:27">Acts 2:27</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:31">Acts 2:31</span>). Moreover, the word geenna, hell, (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:22">Matthew 5:22</span>), is specially used to denote the place of future punishment. </p>
<p>Hades, then, in the New Testament, is a broad and general conception, with an idea of locality bound up with it. It is the condition following death, which is blessed or the contrary, according to the moral character of the dead, and is therefore divided into different realms, represented by Paradise or Abraham 's bosom, and Gehenna. </p>
<p>The expression Gates of Hades is an orientalism for the court, throne, power, and dignity of the infernal kingdom. Hades is contemplated as a mighty city, with formidable, frowning portals. Some expositors introduce also the idea of the councils of the Satanic powers, with reference to the Eastern custom of holding such deliberations in the gates of cities. Compare the expression Sublime Porte, applied to the Ottoman court. The idea of a building is maintained in both members of the comparison. The kingdom or city of Hades confronts and assaults the church which Christ will build upon the rock. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+38:17">Job 38:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+9:13">Psalms 9:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+107:18">Psalms 107:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+38:10">Isaiah 38:10</span>.</p>
