<p>Keys [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλειδας] </span></span>. The similitude corresponding to build. The church or kingdom is conceived as a house, of which Peter is to be the steward, bearing the keys. "Even as he had been the first to utter the confession of the church, so was he also privileged to be the first to open its hitherto closed gates to the Gentiles, when God made choice of him, that, through his mouth, the Gentiles should first hear the words of the Gospel, and at his bidding first be baptized" (Edersheim, " Life and Times of Jesus "). </p>
<p>Bind - loose [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δησηςλυσης] </span></span>. In a sense common among the Jews, of forbidding or allowing. No other terms were in more constant use in Rabbinic canon - law than those of binding and loosing. They represented the legislative and judicial powers of the Rabbinic office. These powers Christ now transferred, and that not in their pretension, but in their reality, to this apostles; the first, here, to Peter, as their representative, the second, after his resurrection, to the church (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:23">John 20:23</span>, Edersheim). "This legislative authority conferred upon Peter can only wear an offensive aspect when it is conceived of as possessing an arbitrary character, and as being in no way determined by the ethical influences of the Holy Spirit, and when it is regarded as being of an absolute nature, as independent of any connection with the rest of the apostles. Since the power of binding and loosing, which is here conferred upon Peter, is ascribed (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:18">Matthew 18:18</span>) to the apostles generally, the power conferred upon the former is set in its proper light, and shown to be of necessity a power of a collegiate nature, so that Peter is not to be regarded as exclusively endowed with it, either in whole or in part, but is simply to be looked upon as first among his equals" (Meyer on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:18">Matthew 18:18</span>).</p>
