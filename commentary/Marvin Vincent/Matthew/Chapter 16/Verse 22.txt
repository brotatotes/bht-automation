<p>Be it far from thee [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλεως σοι] </span></span>. Rev., in margin, God have mercy on thee. In classical usage, of the gods as propitious, gracious toward men, in consideration of their prayers and sacrifices. The meaning here is, may God be gracious to thee. </p>
<p>Shall not be [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη εσται] </span></span>. The double negative is very forcible : "Shall in no case be." Rev. renders it by never.</p>
