Is lunatic [σεληνιαζεται] . Rev., epileptic. The A. V. preserves the etymology of the word (selhnh, the moon), but lunatic conveys to us the idea of demented; while the Rev. epileptic gives the true character of the disease, yet does not tell us the fact contained in the Greek word, that epilepsy was supposed to be affected by the changes of the moon. See on Matthew 4:24.
