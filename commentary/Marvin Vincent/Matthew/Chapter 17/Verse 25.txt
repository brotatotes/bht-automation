<p>Yes [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναι] </span></span>. Indicating that Jesus had paid the tax on former occasions. </p>
<p>Prevented [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προεφθασεν] </span></span>. Rev., rather awkwardly, but following Tynd., Spake first to him. Prevent, in its older sense, to anticipate, get before, was a correct translation. Compare Shakspeare : </p>
<p>"So shall my anticipation prevent your discovery." </p>
<p>Hamlet, 2 1. </p>
<p>Out of this grew the secondary meaning, to hinder. By getting before another, one hinders him from accomplishing his purpose. This meaning has supplanted the other. Wyc. renders came before him. The meaning is that Jesus did not wait for Peter to tell him of the demand of the collectors. He anticipated him in speaking about it. </p>
<p>Custom or tribute [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελη η κηνσον] </span></span>. Rev. gives toll for custom. Toll is duty upon goods; tribute, tax upon individuals. Khnsov, tribute, is merely a transcription of the Latin census, which means, first, a registration with a view to taxation, and then the tax itself. </p>
<p>Strangers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλοτριων] </span></span>. Not foreigners, but others than those of their own families; their subjects. In other words, Does a king tax his own children or his subjects?</p>
