<p>Hook [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγκιστρον] </span></span>. The only mention in the New Testament of fishing with a hook. A single fish is wanted. </p>
<p>A piece of money [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στατηρα] </span></span>. The A. V. is very inadequate, because Christ names a definite sum, the stater, which is a literal transcription of the Greek word, and represents two didrachmas, or a shekel. Hence Rev., a shekel. </p>
