Hook [αγκιστρον] . The only mention in the New Testament of fishing with a hook. A single fish is wanted. A piece of money [στατηρα] . The A. V. is very inadequate, because Christ names a definite sum, the stater, which is a literal transcription of the Greek word, and represents two didrachmas, or a shekel. Hence Rev., a shekel.
