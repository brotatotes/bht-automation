Leave upon the mountains. The text here is disputed. Both A. V. and Rev. follow a text which reads : "Doth he not, leaving the ninety and nine, go into the mountains ?" Rather join leave with on the mountains, and read, "Will he not leave the ninety and nine upon (ejpi, scattered over) the mountains, and go," etc. This also corresponds with ajfhsei, leaving, letting out, or letting loose.
