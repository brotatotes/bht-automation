<p>The will of your Father [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελημα εμπροσθεν του πατρος υμων] </span></span>. Though some read my Father [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μου] </span></span>. Lit., There is not a will before your (my) Father. So Wyc., It is not will before your Father. Meyer paraphrases, There is not before the face of God and determination having as its object that one of these, etc.</p>
