Go [υπαγε] . Do not wait for him to come to you. Tell him his fault [ελεγξον] . Rev., shew him. The verb means, first, to test, try, search out; therefore, to cross - examine with a view of convincing or refuting; thence to rebuke or chide. The Rev. shew is better than tell, which implies merely naming the fault; whereas the injunction is, go and prove to him how he has erred. Wyc., reprove, with snub as explanation.
