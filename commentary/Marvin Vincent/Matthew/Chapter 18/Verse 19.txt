<p>Shall agree [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφωνησουσιν] </span></span>. From sun, together, and fwnh, sound or voice. Transcribed in our word symphony. It has so far lost its distinctive character as a concord of voices as to be used for agreement in the deeper and more inward sense. </p>
<p>Concerning anything that they shall ask [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περι παντος πραγματος ου εαν αιτηςωνται] </span></span>. The literal rendering is, if any thing, stronger : Everything, whatever it be, for which they may have asked. Wyc., Shall consent of everything whatever they shall ask. Tynd., Shall agree in any manner thing whatsoever they shall desire. The word pragma, thing, is used like the Latin res; a matter, affair, business, with the meaning at bottom of something to be done, since it is cognate to the verb prassw, to do. Shall be done, however, is genhsetai, it shall come to pass.</p>
