<p>A certain king [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπω βασιλει] </span></span>. Lit., a man, a king. The kingdom of heaven is like unto a human king. </p>
<p>Take account of his servants [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναραι λογον μετα των δουλων αυτου] </span></span>. The rendering of the A. V. is loose and inadequate, and might be taken to mean to reckon the number of his servants. The verb sunarai is compounded of sun, with, and airw, to take up, and means literally to take up together, i e., cast up, as an account. The A. V. also overlooks the force of meta, with. Therefore, Rev., better, make a reckoning with his servants.</p>
