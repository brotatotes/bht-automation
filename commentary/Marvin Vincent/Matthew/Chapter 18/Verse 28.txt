<p>Found. Either went in search of him, as he himself had been sought out by his Lord, or came upon him accidentally in the street. </p>
<p>A hundred pence [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκατον δηναρια] </span></span>. Less than a millionth part of his own debt. </p>

Compare were choked, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:13">Mark 5:13</span>. Creditors often dragged their debtors before the judge, as the Roman law allowed them to do, holding them by the throat. Thus Livy (iv. 53), relates how, a difficulty having arisen between the consul Valerius and one Menenius, the tribunes put an end to the contest, and the consul ordered into prison (collum torsisset, twisted the neck) the few who appealed. And Cicero (" Pro Cluentio, " 21) : </p>
<p>"Lead him to the judgment - seat with twisted neck [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χολλο οβτορτο] </span></span>." Compare Cicero, "In 100 Verrem," 4 10. </p>
<p>What thou owest [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ει τι οφειλεις] </span></span>. Lit., If thou owest anything. Not that the creditor is uncertain about the fact of the debt, though some uncertainty about the exact amount may be implied. This would agree with found, in the sense of coming upon accidentally. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:44">Matthew 13:44</span>. He came suddenly upon him and recognized him as a debtor, though not certain as to the amount of his debt. Meyer remarks, "The if is simply the expression of a pitiless logic. If thou owest anything (as thou dost) pay!" The word pay [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδος</span></span>] is emphatic in position.</p>
