<p>Be converted [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στραφητε] </span></span>. The word converted has acquired a conventional religious sense which is fundamentally truthful, but the essential quality of which will be more apparent if we render literally, as Rev., except ye turn. The picture is that of turning round in a road and facing the other way. </p>
<p>Shall not enter [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη εισελθητε] </span></span>. But the double negative is very forcible, and is given in Rev. in noise. So far from being greatest in the kingdom of heaven, ye shall not so much as enter.</p>
