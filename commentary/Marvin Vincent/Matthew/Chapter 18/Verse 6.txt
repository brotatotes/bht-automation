<p>A millstone [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυλος ονικος] </span></span>. Two kinds of millstones were in use; the one turned by hand, the other, and larger, by an ass [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονος] </span></span>. Here Jesus says an ass - millstone; or, as Rev., a great millstone; Wyc., millstone of asses.</p>
