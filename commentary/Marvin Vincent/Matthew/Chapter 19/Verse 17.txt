Why callest thou me good? [τι με λεγεις αγαθον] . But the true reading is, ti me ejrwtav peri tou ajgaqou; Why askest thou me concerning the good? There is none good but one, that is God [ουδεις αγαθος ει υη εις ο θεος] . But the reading is, ei=v ejstin oJ ajgaqov, One there is who is good. The saying of Christ appears especially appropriate in the light of the Rabbinic apothegm, "There is nothing else that is good but the law."
