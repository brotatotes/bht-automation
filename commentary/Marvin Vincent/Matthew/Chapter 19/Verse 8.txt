<p>It was not so [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γεγονεν ουτως] </span></span>. The A. V. is commonly understood to mean, it was not so in the beginning. But that is not Christ 's meaning. The verb is in the perfect tense (denoting the continuance of past action or its results down to the present).
