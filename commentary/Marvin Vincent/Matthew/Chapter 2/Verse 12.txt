<p>Being warned [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρηματισθεντες] </span></span>. The verb means to give a response to one who asks or consults : hence, in the passive, as here, to receive an answer. The word therefore implies that the wise men had sought counsel of God; and so Wycliffe, "And answer taken in sleep."</p>
