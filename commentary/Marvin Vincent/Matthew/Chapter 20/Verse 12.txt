<p>Heat [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυσωνα] </span></span>. Rev., the scorching heat. The word is from kaiw, to burn. It refers to the dry, scorching heat born by the east wind. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+27:21">Job 27:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ho+13:15">Hosea 13:15</span>. The wind blows from the Arabian desert, parching, dry, exciting the blood, and causing restlessness and sleeplessness. It seldom brings storms, but when it does, they are doubly destructive. During harvest the corn cannot be winnowed if the east wind blows, for it would carry away both chaff and corn. In Pharaoh 's dream (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+41:6">Genesis 41:6</span>) the ears are blasted by it : Jonah's gourd is withered by it (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jon+4:8">Jonah 4:8</span>), and the vine in Ezekiel's parable of the Babylonian captivity is blighted by it (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+17:10">Ezekiel 17:10</span>).</p>
