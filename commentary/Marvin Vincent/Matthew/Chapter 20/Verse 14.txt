Take [αρον] . Lit., as Rev., take up, as if the money had been laid down for him on a table or counter. I will give [θελω δουναι] . But, as in other cases in the A. V., this may be mistaken for the simple future of the verb; whereas there are two verbs. Therefore, Rev., rightly, It is my will to give. See on Matthew 14:32.
