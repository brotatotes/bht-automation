<p>Take [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρον] </span></span>. Lit., as Rev., take up, as if the money had been laid down for him on a table or counter. </p>
<p>I will give [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω δουναι] </span></span>. But, as in other cases in the A. V., this may be mistaken for the simple future of the verb; whereas there are two verbs. Therefore, Rev., rightly, It is my will to give. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:32">Matthew 14:32</span>.</p>
