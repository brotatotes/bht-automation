<p>Will be great [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελη ειναι] </span></span>. See on ver. 14. Rev. would be. </p>
<p>Minister [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονος] </span></span>. Servant, ver. 27 [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος] </span></span>. Doulov, perhaps from dew, to bind, is the bondman, representing the permanent relation of servitude. Diakonov, probably from the same root as diwkw, to pursue, represents a servant, not in his relation, but in his activity. The term covers both slaves and hired servants. The attendants at the feast at Cana (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:5">John 2:5</span>) are called diakonoi. In the epistles diakonov is often used specifically for a minister of the Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5">1 Corinthians 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:7">Ephesians 3:7</span>). The word deacon is, moreover, almost a transcription of it (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8">1 Timothy 3:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:12">1 Timothy 3:12</span>). It is applied to Phoebe (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:1">Romans 16:1</span>).</p>
