<p>Say [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγουσιν] </span></span>. The Rev. is more graphic, are saying. While the songs and shouts are rising, the priests turn angrily to Christ with the question, "Hearest thou what these are saying?" </p>
<p>Thou has perfected [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηρτισω] </span></span>. The same word as at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:21">Matthew 4:21</span>, where it is used of adjusting or mending nets. Its secondary meaning is to furnish completely, equip; hence to perfect. Thou has provided the perfection of praise. The quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:2">Psalms 8:2</span>, follows the Septuagint, and not the Hebrew, which is, "Thou hast founded strength."</p>
