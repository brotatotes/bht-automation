Say [λεγουσιν] . The Rev. is more graphic, are saying. While the songs and shouts are rising, the priests turn angrily to Christ with the question, "Hearest thou what these are saying?" Thou has perfected [κατηρτισω] . The same word as at Matthew 4:21, where it is used of adjusting or mending nets. Its secondary meaning is to furnish completely, equip; hence to perfect. Thou has provided the perfection of praise. The quotation from Psalms 8:2, follows the Septuagint, and not the Hebrew, which is, "Thou hast founded strength."
