<p>The Lord [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κυριος] </span></span>. From kurov, supreme power, authority. Hence kuriov, one having authority, Lord, owner, ruler. In classical Greek, used of the gods, and in inscriptions applied to different gods, as Hermes, Zeus, etc.; also of the head of the family, who is Lord, [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριος</span></span>] of the wife and children (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+1:8">1 Samuel 1:8</span>, Sept.); while to the slaves he is despothv. In the Pauline writings, however, the master of slaves is called both despothv (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:1">1 Timothy 6:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:2">1 Timothy 6:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:9">Titus 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18">1 Peter 2:18</span>), and kuriov (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:9">Ephesians 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+4:1">Colossians 4:1</span>). </p>
<p>In the Septuagint it is used by Sarah of her husband (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:12">Genesis 18:12</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:6">1 Peter 3:6</span>). Joseph is called Lord of the country (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+42:33">Genesis 42:33</span>), and is addressed by his brethren as my Lord (xlii. 10). It is applied to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:27">Genesis 18:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:10">Exodus 4:10</span>). In the New Testament it is a name for God (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:20">Matthew 1:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:22">Matthew 1:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:24">Matthew 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:15">Matthew 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:16">Acts 11:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:11">Acts 12:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:17">Acts 12:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+1:8">Revelation 1:8</span>). As applied to Christ, it does not express his divine nature and power. These are indicated by some accompanying word or phrase, as my God (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:28">John 20:28</span>); of all (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:36">Acts 10:36</span>); to the glory of God the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:11">Philippians 2:11</span>); of glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:8">1 Corinthians 2:8</span>); so that, as a title of Christ, Lord is used in the sense of Master or Ruler, or in address, Sir (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:43">Matthew 22:43</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:45">Matthew 22:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:11">Luke 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:46">Luke 6:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:13">John 13:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:14">John 13:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:6">1 Corinthians 8:6</span>). O kuriov, the Lord, is used of Christ by Matthew only once (xxi. 3) until after the resurrection (xxviii. 6). In the other gospels and in the Acts it occurs far oftener. Nevertheless, in the progress of Christian thought in the New Testament, the meaning develops toward a specific designation of the divine Savior, as may be seen in the phrases Jesus Christ our Lord, Our Lord Jesus Christ, Our Lord, Jesus our Lord.</p>
