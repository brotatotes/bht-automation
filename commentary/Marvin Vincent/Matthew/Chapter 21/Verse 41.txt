He will miserably destroy those wicked men [κακους κακως απολεσει αυτους] . There is a play upon the words which the A. V. missed and the Rev. preserves by rendering "miserably destroy those miserable men." So the Rheims version : "The naughty men will he bring to naught." Tynd., "He will evil destroy those evil persons." The order of the Greek words is also striking : Miserable men, miserably he will destroy them. Which [οιτινες] . The compound Greek pronoun marks the character of the new husbandmen more distinctly than the simple which; husbandmen of such a character that, or belonging to that class of honest men who will give him his due.
