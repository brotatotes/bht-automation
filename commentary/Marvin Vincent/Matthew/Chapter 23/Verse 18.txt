<p>He is guilty [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφειλει] </span></span>. In the rendering of this word the A. V. seems to have been shaped by the earlier and now obsolete sense of guilt, which was probably a fine or payment. Compare Anglo - Saxon gyld, a recompense, and German geld, money. There is a hint of this sense in Shakspeare, Henry Xiv (Second Part), <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:0">Acts 4:0</span> Sc. 4 </p>
<p>"England shall double gild his treble guilt," </p>
<p>where the play upon the words hovers between the sense of bedeck and recompense. Wyc. renders oweth, and Tynd., he is debtor. Rev., he is a debtor.</p>
