He is guilty [οφειλει] . In the rendering of this word the A. V. seems to have been shaped by the earlier and now obsolete sense of guilt, which was probably a fine or payment. Compare Anglo - Saxon gyld, a recompense, and German geld, money. There is a hint of this sense in Shakspeare, Henry Xiv (Second Part), Acts 4:0 Sc. 4 "England shall double gild his treble guilt," where the play upon the words hovers between the sense of bedeck and recompense. Wyc. renders oweth, and Tynd., he is debtor. Rev., he is a debtor.
