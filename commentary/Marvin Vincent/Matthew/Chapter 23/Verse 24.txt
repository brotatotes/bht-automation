<p>Strain at [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διυλιζοντες] </span></span>. dia, thoroughly or through, and uJlizw, to filter or strain. Strain at is an old misprint perpetuated. Hence the Rev. correctly, as Tynd., strain out. Insects were ceremonially unclean (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+11:20">Leviticus 11:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+11:23">Leviticus 11:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+11:41">Leviticus 11:41</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+11:42">Leviticus 11:42</span>), so that the Jews strained their wine in order not to swallow any unclean animal. Moreover, there were certain insects which bred in wine. Aristotle uses the word gnat [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωνωπα</span></span>] of a worm or larva found in the sediment of sour wine. "In a ride from Tangier to Tetuan I observed that a Moorish soldier who accompanied me, when he drank, always unfolded the end of his turban and placed it over the mouth of this bota, drinking through the mulin to strain out the gnats, whose larvae swarm in the water of that country" (cited by Trench, " On the Authorized Version "). </p>
<p>Swallow [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταπινοντες] </span></span>. The rendering is feeble. It is drink down [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα] </span></span>; gulp. Note that the camel was also unclean (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+11:4">Leviticus 11:4</span>).</p>
