<p>To be seen [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς το θεαθηναι] </span></span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1">Matthew 6:1</span>, where the same word occurs. The scribes and Pharisees deport themselves with a view to being contemplated as actors in a theatre; so that men may fix their gaze upon them admiringly. </p>
<p>Phylacteries - Borders of their garments [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλακτηριακρασπεδα] </span></span>. Phylacteries, called by the Rabbis tephillin, prayer - fillets, were worn on the left arm, toward the heart, and on the forehead. They were capsules containing on parchment these four passages of Scripture : <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:1-10">Exodus 13:1-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:11-16">Exodus 13:11-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+6:4-9">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+11:13-21">Deuteronomy 11:13-21</span>. That for the head was to consist of a box with four compartments, each containing a slip of parchment inscribed with one of the four passages. Each of these slips was to be tied up with well - washed hair from a calf 's tail; lest, if tied with wool or thread, any fungoid growth should ever pollute them. The phylactery of the arm was to contain a single slip, with the same our passages written in four columns of seven lines each. The black leather straps by which they were fastened were wound seven times round the arm and three times round the hand. They were reverenced by the Rabbis as highly as the scriptures, and, like them, might be rescued from the flames on a Sabbath. They profanely imagined that God wore the tephillin. </p>
<p>The Greek word transcribed phylacteries in our version is from fulassw, to watch or guard. It means originally a guarded post, a fort; then, generally, a safeguard or preservative, and therefore an amulet. Sir J. Cheke renders guards. They were treated as such by the Rabbis. It is said, for instance, that the courtiers of a certain king, intending to kill a Rabbi, were deterred by seeing that the straps of his phylacteries shone like bands of fire. It was also said that they prevented all hostile demons from injuring any Israelite. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:20">Matthew 9:20</span>, for borders.</p>
