Went out and departed from the temple [εξελθων απο του ιερου επορευετο] . Rev., better : Went out from the temple and was going on his way. The temple, iJerou, not naou : the whole of the buildings connected with the temple, all of which, including the naov, or sanctuary, and the porches and courts, constituted the iJeron. See on Matthew 4:5.
