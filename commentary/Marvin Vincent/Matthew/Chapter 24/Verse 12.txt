V. in omitting the definite article, misses the force of Christ 's saying. It is not the love of many people only that shall be chilled, but of the many, the majority, the great body. Wax cold [ψυγησεται] . The verb means originally to breathe or blow; and the picture is that of spiritual energy blighted or chilled by a malign or poisonous wind.
