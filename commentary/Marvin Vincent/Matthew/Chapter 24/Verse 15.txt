<p>Abomination of desolation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βδελυγμα της ερημωσεως] </span></span>. The cognate verb, bdelussomai, means to feel a nausea or loathing for food : hence used of disgust generally. In a moral sense it denotes an object of moral or religious repugnance. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ch+14:8">2 Chronicles 14:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+13:27">Jeremiah 13:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+11:21">Ezekiel 11:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+9:27">Daniel 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+11:31">Daniel 11:31</span>. It is used as equivalent to idol in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+11:17">1 Kings 11:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+7:26">Deuteronomy 7:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ki+23:13">2 Kings 23:13</span>. It denotes anything in which estrangement from God manifests itself; as the eating of unclean beasts, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="le+11:11">Leviticus 11:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+14:3">Deuteronomy 14:3</span>; and, generally, all forms of heathenism. This moral sense must be emphasized in the New Testament used of the word. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:15">Luke 16:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+17:4">Revelation 17:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+17:5">Revelation 17:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:27">Revelation 21:27</span>. It does not denote mere physical or aesthethic disgust. The reference here is probably to the occupation of the temple precincts by the idolatrous Romans under Titus, with their standards and ensigns. Josephus says that, after the burning of the temple the Romans brought their ensigns and set them over against the eastern gate, and there they offered sacrifices to them, and declared Titus, with acclamations, to be emperor.</p>
