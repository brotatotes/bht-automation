<p>Signs and wonders [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημεια και τερατα] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:20">Matthew 11:20</span>. The two words often joined in the New Testament. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:48">John 4:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22">Acts 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:30">Acts 4:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:12">2 Corinthians 12:12</span>. The words do not denote different classes of supernatural manifestations, but these manifestations regarded from different points of view. The same miracle may be a mighty work, or a glorious work, regarded with reference to its power and grandeur; or a sign of the doer's supernatural power; or a wonder, as it appeals to the spectator. Terav (derivation uncertain) is a miracle regarded as a portent or prodigy, awakening amazement. It most nearly corresponds, therefore, to the etymological sense of the word miracle (Lat., miraculum, a wonderful thing, from mirari, to wonder).</p>
