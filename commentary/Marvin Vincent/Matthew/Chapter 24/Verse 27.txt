<p>Shineth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαινεται] </span></span>. Rev., better, is seen. The coming of the Lord will be a plain, unmistakable fact, like the lightning which lightens both ends of the heaven at once, and is seen of all. It will not be connected with some particular place, but will manifest itself and be recognized over the whole world. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+1:7">Revelation 1:7</span> : "Every eye shall see him."</p>
