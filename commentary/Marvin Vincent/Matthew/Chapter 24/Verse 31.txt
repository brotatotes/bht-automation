With a great sound of a trumpet [μετα σαλπιγγος φωνης μεγαλης] . Some read with a great trumpet. The blowing of trumpets was anciently the signal for the host of Israel on their march through the desert. I summoned to war, and proclaimed public festivals, and marked the beginnings of months; Numbers 10:1-10; Psalms 81:3. Hence the symbolism of the New Testament. Jehovah 's people shall be summoned before their king by sound of trumpet. Compare the proclamation of Christ as king at the trumpet of the seventh angel, Revelation 11:15.
