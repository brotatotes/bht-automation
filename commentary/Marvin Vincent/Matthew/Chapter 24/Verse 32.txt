A parable [την παραβολην] . More strictly, the parable which she has to teach. Rightly, therefore, Rev., her parable. Branch [κλαδος] . From klaw, to break. Hence a young slip or shoot, such as is broken off for grafting. Such were the "branches" which were cut down and strewed in the Lord 's path by the multitudes (Matthew 21:8).
