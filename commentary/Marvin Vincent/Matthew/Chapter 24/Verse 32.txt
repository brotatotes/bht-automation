<p>A parable [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την παραβολην] </span></span>. More strictly, the parable which she has to teach. Rightly, therefore, Rev., her parable. </p>
<p>Branch [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαδος] </span></span>. From klaw, to break. Hence a young slip or shoot, such as is broken off for grafting. Such were the "branches" which were cut down and strewed in the Lord 's path by the multitudes (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:8">Matthew 21:8</span>).</p>
