Hard [σκληρος] . Stronger than the austere [αυστηρος] of Luke 19:21 (see there), which is sometimes used in a good sense, as this never is. It is an epithet given to a surface which is at once dry and hard. Strawed [διεσκορπισας] . Rev., didst scatter. Not referring to the sowing of seed, for that would be saying the same thing twice. The scattering refers to the winnowing of the loosened sheaves spread out upon the threshing - floor. "The word," as Trench observes "could scarcely be applied to the measured and orderly scattering of the sower's seed. It is rather the dispersing, making to fly in every direction." Hence used of the pursuit of a routed enemy (Luke 1:51); of the prodigal scattering his good; making the money fly, as we say (Luke 14:13); of the wolf scattering the sheep (Matthew 26:31). Wyc., spread abroad.
