<p>Put [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλειν] </span></span>. Lit., throw or fling down, as one would throw a bag of coin upon the exchanger's table. </p>
<p>Exchangers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τραπεζιταις] </span></span>. Taking their name from the table or counter at which they sat [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τραπεζα] </span></span>. The Jewish bankers bore precisely the same name. </p>
<p>Usury [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοκω] </span></span>. A very graphic word, meaning first childbirth, and then offspring. Hence of interest, which is the product or offspring of capital. Originally it was only what was paid for the use of money; hence usury; but it became synonymous with extortionate interest. Rev., better, with interest. The Jewish law distinguished between interest and increase. In Rome very high interest seems to have been charged in early times. Practically usury was unlimited. It soon became the custom to charge monthly interest at one per cent a month. During the early empire legal interest stood at eight per cent, but in usurious transactions it was lent at twelve, twenty - four, and even forty - eight. The Jewish bankers of Palestine and elsewhere were engaged in the same undertakings. The law of Moses denounced usury in the transactions of Hebrews with Hebrews, but permitted it in dealing with strangers (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+23:19">Deuteronomy 23:19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+23:20">Deuteronomy 23:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:5">Psalms 14:5</span>).</p>
