<p>There was a cry made [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραυγη γεγονεν] </span></span>. Rev., there is a cry. The verb is in the perfect tense, representing the past event as perpetuated in the present result, and hence is rendered by the English present. A great and decisive change was the result of the cry. No more sleeping, waiting, or silence. There is a cry, and behold the awaking, the bustle, the trimming of lamps and the running to the oil - vendors. </p>
<p>To meet him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις απαντησιν] </span></span>. The translation can hardly convey the meaning of the Greek phrase, which implies a custom or familiar ceremony. Come forth unto meeting.</p>
