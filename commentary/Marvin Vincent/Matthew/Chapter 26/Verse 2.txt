<p>Is betrayed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδοται] </span></span>. The present tense expresses here something which, though future, is as good as present, because already determined, or because it must ensue in virtue of an unalterable law. Thus the passover is [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινεται</span></span>] : it must come round at the fixed season. The Son of Man is betrayed according to the divine decree. Compare ver. 24.</p>
