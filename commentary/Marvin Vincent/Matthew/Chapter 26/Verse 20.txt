<p>He sat down [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεκειτο] </span></span>. But this rendering missed the force of the imperfect tense, which denotes something in progress. The Evangelist says he was sitting or reclining, introducing us to something which has been going on for some time.</p>
