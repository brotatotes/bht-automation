<p>Testament [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαθηκης] </span></span>. From diatiqhmi, to distribute; dispose of. Hence of the disposition of one's property. On the idea of disposing or arranging is based that of settlement or agreement, and thence of a covenant. The Hebrew word of which this is a translation is primarily covenant, from a verb meaning to cut. Hence the phrase, to make a covenant, in connection with dividing the victims slain in ratification of covenants (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:9-18">Genesis 14:9-18</span>). Covenant is the general Old Testament sense of the word (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+20:34">1 Kings 20:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:15">Isaiah 28:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+18:3">1 Samuel 18:3</span>); and so in the New Testament. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:24">Mark 14:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:72">Luke 1:72</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:20">Luke 22:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:25">Acts 3:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:8">Acts 7:8</span>. Bishop Lightfoot, on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:15">Galatians 3:15</span>, observes that the word is never found in the New Testament in any other sense that that of covenant, with the exception of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15-17">Hebrews 9:15-17</span>, where it is testament. We cannot admit this exception, since we regard that passage as one of the best illustrations of the sense of covenant. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15-17">Hebrews 9:15-17</span>. Render here as Rev., covenant. </p>
<p>Is shed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκχυννομενον] </span></span>. The present participle, is being shed. Christ 's thought goes forward to the consummation.</p>
