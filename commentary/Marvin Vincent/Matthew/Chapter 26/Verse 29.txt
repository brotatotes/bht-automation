<p>New [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινον] </span></span>. Another adjective, neon, is employed to denote new wine in the sense of freshly - made (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:17">Matthew 9:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:22">Mark 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:37">Luke 5:37</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:38">Luke 5:38</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:39">Luke 5:39</span>). The difference is between newness regarded in point of time or of quality. The young, for instance, who have lately sprung up, are neoi or newteroi (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:12">Luke 14:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:13">Luke 14:13</span>). The new garment (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:36">Luke 5:36</span>) is contrasted as to quality with a worn and threadbare one. Hence kainou. So a new heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:13">2 Peter 3:13</span>) is kainov, contrasted with that which shows signs of dissolution. The tomb in which the body of Jesus was laid was kainon (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:60">Matthew 27:60</span>); in which no other body had lain, making it ceremonially unclean; not recently hewn. Trench (" Synonyms ") cites a passage from Polybius, relating a stratagem by which a town was nearly taken, and saying "we are still new [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινοι</span></span>] and young [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ςεοι</span></span>] in regard of such deceits." Here kainoi expresses the inexperience of the men; neoi, their youth. Still, the distinction cannot be pressed in all cases. Thus, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span>, "Purge out the old leaven that ye may be a new neon lump;" and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:10">Colossians 3:10</span>, "Put on the new [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεον</span></span>] man," plainly carry the sense of quality. In our Lord 's expression, "drink it new," the idea of quality is dominant. All the elements of festivity in the heavenly kingdom will be of a new and higher quality. In the New Testament, besides the two cases just cited, neov is applied to wine, to the young, and once to a covenant.</p>
