New [καινον] . Another adjective, neon, is employed to denote new wine in the sense of freshly - made (Matthew 9:17; Mark 2:22; Luke 5:37, Luke 5:38, Luke 5:39). The difference is between newness regarded in point of time or of quality. The young, for instance, who have lately sprung up, are neoi or newteroi (Luke 14:12, Luke 14:13). The new garment (Luke 5:36) is contrasted as to quality with a worn and threadbare one. Hence kainou. So a new heaven (2 Peter 3:13) is kainov, contrasted with that which shows signs of dissolution. The tomb in which the body of Jesus was laid was kainon (Matthew 27:60); in which no other body had lain, making it ceremonially unclean; not recently hewn. Trench (" Synonyms ") cites a passage from Polybius, relating a stratagem by which a town was nearly taken, and saying "we are still new [καινοι] and young [ςεοι] in regard of such deceits." Here kainoi expresses the inexperience of the men; neoi, their youth. Still, the distinction cannot be pressed in all cases. Thus, 1 Corinthians 5:7, "Purge out the old leaven that ye may be a new neon lump;" and Colossians 3:10, "Put on the new [νεον] man," plainly carry the sense of quality. In our Lord 's expression, "drink it new," the idea of quality is dominant. All the elements of festivity in the heavenly kingdom will be of a new and higher quality. In the New Testament, besides the two cases just cited, neov is applied to wine, to the young, and once to a covenant.
