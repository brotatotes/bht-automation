Gethsemane. Meaning oil - press. Beyond the brook Kedron, and distant about three - quarters of a mile from the walls of Jerusalem. Dean Stanley says of the olive - trees there : "In spite of all the doubts that can be raised against their antiquity, the eight aged olive - trees, if only by their manifest difference from all others on the mountain, have always struck the most indifferent observers. They will remain, so long as their already protracted life is spared, the most venerable of their race on the surface of the earth. Their gnarled trunks and scanty foilage will always be regarded as the most affecting of the sacred memorials in or about Jerusalem; the most nearly approaching to the everlasting hills themselves in the force with which they carry us back to the events of the gospel history" (" Sinai and Palestine ").
