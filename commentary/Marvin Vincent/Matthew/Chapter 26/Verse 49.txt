<p>Kissed him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεφιλησεν] </span></span>. The compound verb has the force of an emphatic, ostentatious salute. Meyer says embraced and kissed. The same word is used of the tender caressing of the Lord 's feet by the woman in the Pharisee 's house (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:38">Luke 7:38</span>), of the father 's embrace of the returned prodigal (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:20">Luke 14:20</span>), and of the farewell of the Ephesian elders to Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:37">Acts 20:37</span>).</p>
