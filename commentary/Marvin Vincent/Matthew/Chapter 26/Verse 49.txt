Kissed him [κατεφιλησεν] . The compound verb has the force of an emphatic, ostentatious salute. Meyer says embraced and kissed. The same word is used of the tender caressing of the Lord 's feet by the woman in the Pharisee 's house (Luke 7:38), of the father 's embrace of the returned prodigal (Luke 14:20), and of the farewell of the Ephesian elders to Paul (Acts 20:37).
