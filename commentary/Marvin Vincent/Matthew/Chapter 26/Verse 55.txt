A thief [ληστην] . Better Rev., a robber. See John 10:1, John 10:8; and Luke 23:39-43. It is more than a petty stealer; rather one with associates, who would require an armed band to apprehend him. Hence the propriety of the reference to swords and staves. I sat [εκαθεζομην] . The imperfect tense, denoting something habitual. I was accustomed to sit.
