<p>Golgotha. An Aramaic word, Gulgoltha, = the Hebrew, Gulgoleth, and translated skull in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:9">Jude 1:9</span>:53; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ki+9:35">2 Kings 9:35</span>. The word Calvary comes through the Latin calvaria, meaning skull, and used in the Vulgate. The New Testament narrative does not mention a mount or hill. The place was probably a rounded elevation. The meaning is not, as Tynd., a place of dead men's skulls, but simply skull.</p>
