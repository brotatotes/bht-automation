"Early on Friday afternoon the new course of priests, of Levites, and of the 'stationary men' who were to be the representatives of all Israel, arrived Jerusalem, and having prepared themselves for the festive season went up to the temple. The approach of the Sabbath, and then its actual commencement, were announced by threefold blasts from the priests ' trumpets. The first three blasts were blown when one - third of the evening - sacrifice service was over, or about the ninth hour; that it, about 3 P. M. on Friday" (Edersheim, " The Temple ").
