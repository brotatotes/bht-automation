Yielded up the ghost [αφηκε το πνευμα] . Lit., dismissed his spirit. Rev., yielded up his spirit. The fact that the evangelists, in describing our Lord 's death, do not use the neuter verb, eqanen, he died, but he breathed out his life (ejxepneuse, Mark 14:37), he gave up his spirit (paredwke to pneuma, John 19:30), seems to imply a voluntary yielding up of his life. Compare John 10:18. Augustine says, "He gave up his life because he willed it, when he willed it, and as he willed it."
