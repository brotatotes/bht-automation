The veil of the temple. According to the Rabbis this was a handbreadth in thickness, and woven of seventy - two twisted plaits, each plait consisting of twenty - four threads. It was sixty feet long and thirty wide. Two of them were made every year, and according to the exaggerated language of the time it needed three hundred priests to manipulate it. This veil was the one which covered the entrance to the holy of holies, and not, as has been asserted, the veil which hung before the main entrance to the sanctuary. The holy of holies contained only a large stone, on which the high - priest sprinkled the blood on the day of atonement, occupying the place where the ark with the mercy - seat had stood.
