<p>Magdalene [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η μαγδαληνη] </span></span>. Neither Mary of Bethany (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:6-13">Matthew 26:6-13</span>) nor the woman who had been a sinner (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:37-48">Luke 7:37-48</span>). The word denotes merely her town : She of Magdala.</p>
