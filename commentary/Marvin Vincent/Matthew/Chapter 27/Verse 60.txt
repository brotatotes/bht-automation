New tomb [καινω] . See on Matthew 26:29. Not newly hewn, but fresh, undefiled by anybody. A great stone. Though in the Jews ' sepulchres in general there were doors hung on hinges, the grooves and perforations for which may still be seen. Joseph 's tomb may have been differently constructed, or else was in an unfinished state.
