<p>We remember [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμνησθημεν] </span></span>. Lit., we remembered : i e., it occurred to us : we have just remembered, and have come to tell you before it shall be too late. </p>
<p>That deceiver [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος ο πλανος] </span></span>. The pronoun that is very picturesque; being used of distant objects, and therefore here as pointing to one who is out of the way and far removed. Planov, deceiver, is akin to planaw, to wander; and hence a vagabond imposter.</p>
