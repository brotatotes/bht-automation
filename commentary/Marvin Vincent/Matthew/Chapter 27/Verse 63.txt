We remember [εμνησθημεν] . Lit., we remembered : i e., it occurred to us : we have just remembered, and have come to tell you before it shall be too late. That deceiver [εκεινος ο πλανος] . The pronoun that is very picturesque; being used of distant objects, and therefore here as pointing to one who is out of the way and far removed. Planov, deceiver, is akin to planaw, to wander; and hence a vagabond imposter.
