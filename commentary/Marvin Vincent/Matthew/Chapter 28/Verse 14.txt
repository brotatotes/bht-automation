<p>We will persuade [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεισομεν] </span></span>. i e., satisfy or appease. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:10">Galatians 1:10</span>. "Do I conciliate men or God ?" </p>
<p>Secure you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμας αμεριμνους ποιησομεν] </span></span>. Lit., make you without care. The word secure, however, is, etymologically, a correct rendering. It is from the Latin se = sine, without, and cura, care. It has passed into the popular meaning to make safe. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:32">1 Corinthians 7:32</span>. "I would have you to be free from cares" (Rev.).</p>
