<p>Spake - saying [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλησενλεγων] </span></span>. Two different words are here used to express speech, with a nice distinction which can hardly be conveyed without paraphrase. The verb lalein is used of speaking, in contrast with or as a breaking of silence, voluntary or imposed. Thus the dumb man, after he was healed, spake [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλησεν] </span></span>; and Zacharias, when his tongue was loosed, began to speak [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλει] </span></span>. In the use of the word the writer contemplates the fact rather than the substance of speech. Hence it is used of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1">Hebrews 1:1</span>), the point being, not what God said, but the fact that he spake to men. On the contrary, legein refers to the matter of speech. The verb originally means to pick out, and hence to use words selected as appropriate expressions of thought, and to put such words together in orderly discourse. Here, then, we have Jesus first breaking silence [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλησεν] </span></span>, and then discoursing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγων] </span></span>. </p>
