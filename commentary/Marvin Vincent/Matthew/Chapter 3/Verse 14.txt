<p>Forbad [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεκωλυεν] </span></span>. The A. V., following Wyc. and Tynd., misses the meaning of the verb. As in so many instances, it overlooks the force of the imperfect tense, which expresses past action, either in progress or in process of conception, in the agent's mind. John did not forbid Jesus, but had it in mind to prevent him : was for hindering him. Hence Rev., properly, would have hindered him. Again, the preposition [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>] intensifies the verb, and represents strong feeling on John's part. He was moved to strenuous protest against Jesus ' baptism by him.</p>
