Were baptized [εβαπτιζοντο] . See on Mark 7:4. Confessing their sins [εξομολογουμενοι τας αμαρτιας αυτων] . The words imply : 1. That confession was connected with baptism. They were baptized while in the act of confessing. 2. An open confession, not a private one to John (ejx, compare Acts 19:18; James 5:16). 3. An individual confession; possibly a specific one. (See Luke 3:10-15.)
