<p>The Devil [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του διαβολου] </span></span>. The word means calumniator, slanderer. It is sometimes applied to men, as to Judas (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:70">John 6:70</span>); in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:11">1 Timothy 3:11</span> (slanderers); and in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:3">2 Timothy 3:3</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:3">Titus 2:3</span> (false accusers). In such cases never with the article. The Devil, Satan, the God of this world [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο διαβολος] </span></span>, is always with the article and never plural. This should be distinguished from another word, also wrongly rendered devil in the A. V. - daimwn, and its more common neuter form diamonion, both of which should be translated demon, meaning the unclean spirits which possessed men, and were cast out by Christ and his apostles. The Rev., unfortunately, and against the protest of the American revisers, retains devil for both words, except in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span>, where it renders as A. V. gods. </p>
<p>The Son of God. By its position in the sentence Son is emphatic. "If thou standest to God in the relation of Son." </p>
<p>Bread [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτοι] </span></span>. Lit., loaves or cakes. So Wyc., loaves. These stones were perhaps those "silicious accretions," which assume the exact shape of little loaves of bread, and which were represented in legend as the petrified fruits of the cities of the plain. By a similar fancy certain crystallizations on Mount Carmel and near Bethlehem are called "Elijah 's melons," and the "Virgin Mary 's peas;" and the black and white stones found along the shores of the Lake of Galilee have been transformed into traces of the tears of Jacob in search of Joseph. The very appearance of these stones, like the bread for which the faint body hungered, may have added force to the temptation. This resemblance may have been present to Christ 's mind in his words at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:9">Matthew 7:9</span>.</p>
