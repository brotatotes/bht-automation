<p>To preach [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυσσειν] </span></span>. Originally, to dischard the duty of a herald [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυξ] </span></span>; hence to cry out, proclaim (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span>). The standing expression in the New Testament for the proclamation of the Gospel; but confined to the primary announcement of the message and facts of salvation, and not including continuous instruction in the contents and connections of the message, which is expressed by didaskein (to teach). (Both words are used in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23">Matthew 4:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:35">Matthew 9:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:1">Matthew 11:1</span>).</p>
