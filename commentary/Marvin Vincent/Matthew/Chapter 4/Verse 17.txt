To preach [κηρυσσειν] . Originally, to dischard the duty of a herald [κηρυξ] ; hence to cry out, proclaim (see on 2 Peter 2:5). The standing expression in the New Testament for the proclamation of the Gospel; but confined to the primary announcement of the message and facts of salvation, and not including continuous instruction in the contents and connections of the message, which is expressed by didaskein (to teach). (Both words are used in Matthew 4:23; Matthew 9:35; Matthew 11:1).
