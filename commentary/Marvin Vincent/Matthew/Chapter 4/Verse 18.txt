<p>The sea [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την θαλασσαν] </span></span>. The small lake of Gennesaret, only thirteen miles long and six wide in its broadest part, is called the sea, by the same kind of popular usage by which Swiss and German lakes are called See; as the Konigsee, the Trauensee. So, also, in Holland we have the Zuyder Zee. The Latin mare (the sea) likewise becomes meer in Holland, and is used of a lake, as Haarlemmer Meer; and in England, mere, as appears in Windermere, Grasmere, etc. </p>
<p>A net [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμφιβληστρον] </span></span>. From ajmfi, around, and ballw, to throw. Hence the casting - net, which, being cast over the shoulder, spreads into a circle [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμφι] </span></span>. The word is sometimes used by classical Greek writers to denote a garment which encompasses the wearer. In ver. 20, the word net again occurs, but representing a different Greek word [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικτυον</span></span>] which is the general name for all kinds of nets, whether for taking fish or fowl. Still another word occurs at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:47">Matthew 13:47</span>, saghnh, the draw - net. See farther on that passage.</p>
