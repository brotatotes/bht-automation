It is written [γεγραπται] . The perfect tense. "It has been written, and stands written." The first recorded words of Jesus after his entrance upon his ministry are an assertion of the authority of scripture, and that though he had the fulness of the Spirit. When addressing man, our Lord seldom quoted scripture, but said I say unto you. In answer to Satan he says, It is written.
