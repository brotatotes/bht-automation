<p>A mountain [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ορος] </span></span>. The Rev. recognized the force of the definite article, and renders "the mountain," that particular mountain in the place where Jesus saw the multitudes. The mountain itself cannot be identified. Delitzsch calls the Mount of Beatitudes "The Sinai of the New Testament." </p>
<p>When he was set [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθισαντος] </span></span>, following Tyndale. Rev., more literally, when he had sat down (compare Wyc., when he had set). After the manner of the rabbis, he seated himself ere he began to teach.</p>
