<p>A bushel [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον μοδιον] </span></span>. Rev., rightly, "the bushel;" since the definite article is designed to indicate a familiar object - the grain - measure which is found in every house. </p>
<p>A candlestick [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την λυχνιαν] </span></span>. Rev., the stand. Also a part of the furniture of every house, and commonly but one in the house : hence the article. The word, which occurs four times in the Gospels and eight times elsewhere, means, in every case, not a candlestick, but a lamp - stand. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:2">Hebrews 9:2</span>, the golden "candlestick" of the tabernacle is called lucnia; but in the description of this article (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:31">Exodus 25:31</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:39">Exodus 25:39</span>), we read, "Thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof;" and in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:2">Zechariah 4:2</span>, where the imagery is drawn from the sanctuary, we have a "candlestick" with a bowl on the top of it, "and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes (for the oil) to the lamps which are upon the top thereof."</p>
