A bushel [τον μοδιον] . Rev., rightly, "the bushel;" since the definite article is designed to indicate a familiar object - the grain - measure which is found in every house. A candlestick [την λυχνιαν] . Rev., the stand. Also a part of the furniture of every house, and commonly but one in the house : hence the article. The word, which occurs four times in the Gospels and eight times elsewhere, means, in every case, not a candlestick, but a lamp - stand. In Hebrews 9:2, the golden "candlestick" of the tabernacle is called lucnia; but in the description of this article (Exodus 25:31, Exodus 25:39), we read, "Thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof;" and in Zechariah 4:2, where the imagery is drawn from the sanctuary, we have a "candlestick" with a bowl on the top of it, "and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes (for the oil) to the lamps which are upon the top thereof."
