<p>Officer [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπηρετη] </span></span>. Denoting a subordinate official, as a herald or an orderly, and in this sense applied to Mark as the "minister" or attendant of Paul and Barnabas (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:5">Acts 13:5</span>). It furnishes an interesting instance of the expansion of a word from a limited and special meaning into a more general one; and also of the influence of the Gospel in lifting words into higher and purer associations. Formed with the verb ejressw, to row, it originally signified a rower, as distinguished from a soldier, in a war - galley. This word for a galley - slave comes at last, in the hands of Luke and Paul, to stand for the noblest of all offices, that of a minister of the Lord Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:2">Luke 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:16">Acts 26:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:1">1 Corinthians 4:1</span>).</p>
