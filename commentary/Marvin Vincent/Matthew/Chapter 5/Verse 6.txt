<p>Shall be filled [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χορτασθησονται] </span></span>. A very strong and graphic word, originally applied to the feeding and fattening of animals in a stall. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+19:21">Revelation 19:21</span>, it is used of the filling of the birds with the flesh of God 's enemies. Also of the multitudes fed with the loaves and fishes (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:20">Matthew 14:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:8">Mark 8:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:17">Luke 9:17</span>). It is manifestly appropriate here as expressing the complete satisfaction of spiritual hunger and thirst. Hence Wycliffe's rendering, fulfilled, is strictly true to the original.</p>
