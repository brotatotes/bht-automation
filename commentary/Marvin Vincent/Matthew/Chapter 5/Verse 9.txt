<p>The peacemakers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οι ειρηνοποιοι] </span></span>. Should be held to its literal meaning, peace - makers; not as Wyc., peaceable men. The founders and promoters or peace are meant; who not only keep the peace, but seek to bring men into harmony with each other. Tynd. renders, the maintainers of peace.</p>
