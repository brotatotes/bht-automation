<p>Debts [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφειληματα] </span></span>. So rightly, A. V., and Rev. (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:4">Luke 11:4</span>). Sin is pictured as a debt, and the sinner as a debtor (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:28">Matthew 18:28</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:30">Matthew 18:30</span>). Accordingly the word represents sin both as a wrong and as requiring satisfaction. In contrast with the prayer, "Forgive us our debts," Tholuck (" Sermon on the Mount ") quotes the prayer of Apollonius of Tyana, "O ye gods, give me the things which are owing to me." </p>
<p>Forgive [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφηκαμεν] </span></span>. Lit., to send away, or dismiss. The Rev. rightly gives the force of the past tense, we have forgiven; since Christ assumes that he who prays for the remission of his own debts has already forgiven those indebted to him. 4</p>
