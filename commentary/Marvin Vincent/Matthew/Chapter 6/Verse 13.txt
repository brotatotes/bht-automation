<p>Temptation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειρασμον] </span></span>. It is a mistake to define this word as only solicitation to evil. It means trial of any kind, without reference to its moral quality. Thus, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:1">Genesis 22:1</span> (Sept.), "God did tempt Abraham;" " This he said to prove him "(<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:6">John 6:6</span>); Paul and Timothy assayed to go to Bithynia (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:7">Acts 16:7</span>);" Examine yourselves "(<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:5">2 Corinthians 13:5</span>). Here, generally of all situations and circumstances which furnish an occasion for sin. We cannot pray God not to tempt us to sin," for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man " (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:13">James 1:13</span>).</p>
