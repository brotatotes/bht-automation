<p>Trespasses [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραπτωματα] </span></span>. The Lord here uses another word for sins, and still another [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτιας</span></span>] appears in Luke's version of the prayer, though he also says, "every one that is indebted to us." There is no difficulty in supposing that Christ, contemplating sins in general, should represent them by different terms expressive of different aspects of wrong - doing (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>). This word is derived from parapiptw, to fall or thrown one's self beside. Thus it has a sense somewhat akin to aJmartia, of going beside a mark, missing. In classical Greek the verb is often used of intentional falling, as of throwing one's self upon an enemy; and this is the prevailing sense in biblical Greek, indicating reckless and wilful sin (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ch+5:25">1 Chronicles 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ch+10:13">1 Chronicles 10:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ch+26:18">2 Chronicles 26:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ch+29:6">2 Chronicles 29:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ch+29:19">2 Chronicles 29:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+14:13">Ezekiel 14:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+28:26">Ezekiel 28:26</span>). It does not, therefore, imply palliation or excuse. It is a conscious violation of right, involving guilt, and occurs therefore, in connection with the mention of forgiveness (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16">Romans 5:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:13">Colossians 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span>). Unlike parabasiv (transgression), which contemplates merely the objective violation of law, it carries the thought of sin as affecting the sinner, and hence is found associated with expressions which indicate the consequences and the remedy of sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>).</p>
