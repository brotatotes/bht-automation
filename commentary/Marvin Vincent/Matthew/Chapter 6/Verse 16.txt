<p>Ye fast [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νηστευητε] </span></span>. Observe the force of the present tense as indicating action in progress : Whenever ye may be fasting. </p>
<p>Of a sad countenance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οκυθρωποι] </span></span>. An uncommon word in the New Testament, occuring only here and at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:17">Luke 24:17</span>. Trench (" Studies in the Gospels ") explains it by the older sense of the English dreary, as expressing the downcast look of settled grief, pain, or displeasure. In classical Greek it also signifies sullenness and affected gravity. Luther renders, Look not sour. </p>
<p>Disfigure [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφανιζουσιν] </span></span>. The idea is rather conceal than disfigure. There is a play upon this word and fanwsin (they may appear) which is untranslatable into English : they conceal or mask their true visage that they may appear unto men. The allusion is to the outward signs of humiliation which often accompanied fasting, such as being unwashed and unshaven and unanointed. "Avoid," says Christ, "the squalor of the unwashed face and of the unkempt hair and beard, and the rather anoint thy head and wash thy face, so as to appear [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανης</span></span>] not unto men, but unto God as fasting." Wycliffe's rendering is peculiar : They put their faces out of kindly terms.</p>
