The other [ετερον] . Implying distinction in quality rather than numerical distinction [αλλος] . For example, " whoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other [την αλλην] ; i e., the other one of the two (Matthew 5:39). At Pentecost, the disciples began to speak with other [ετεραις] tongues; i e., different from their native tongues. Here the word gives the idea of two master of distinct or opposite character and interests, like God and Mammon. Hold to [ανθεξεται] . The preposition ajnti, against, indicates holding to the one master as against the other. He who is for God must be against Mammon.
