<p>Strait gate [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στενης πυλης] </span></span>. Rev., narrow. A remarkable parallel to this passage occurs in the "Pinax" or "Tablet" of Cebes, a writer contemporary with Socrates. In this, human life, with its dangers and temptations, is symbolically represented as on a tablet. The passage is as follows : "Seest thou not, then, a little door, and a way before the door, which is not much crowded, but very few travel it? This is the way which leadeth into true culture." </p>
<p>Leadeth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαγουσα] </span></span>. Lit., leadeth away, from death, or, perhaps, from the broad road. Note that the gate is not at the end, but at the beginning of the road.</p>
