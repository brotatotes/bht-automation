Profess [ομολογησω] . The word which is used elsewhere of open confession of Christ before men (Matthew 10:32; Romans 10:9); of John's public declaration that he was not the Christ (John 1:20); of Herod 's promise to Salome in the presence of his guests (Matthew 14:7). Hence, therefore, of Christ 's open, public declaration as Judge of the world. "There is great authority in this saying," remarks Bengel. 24 sqq. I will liken him, etc. The picture is not of two men deliberately selecting foundations, but it contrasts one who carefully chooses and prepares his foundation with one who builds at hap - hazard. This is more strongly brought out by Luke (vi. 48) : "Who digged and went deep, and laid a foundation upon the rock" (Rev.).

Dr. Robinson was entertained in the house of a Greek Arab. The house had just been built, and was not yet finished. In order to lay the foundations he had dug down to the solid rock, as is usual throughout the country here, to the depth of thirty feet, and then built up arches." The abrupt style of ver. 25 pictures the sudden coming of the storm which sweeps away the house on the sand : "Descended the rain, and came the floods, and blew the winds."
