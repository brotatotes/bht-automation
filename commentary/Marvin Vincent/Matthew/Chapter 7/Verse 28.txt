<p>Were astonished [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεπλησσοντο] </span></span>. From ejk, out of, and plhssw, to strike. Often to drive one out of his senses by a sudden shock, and therefore here of amazement. They were astounded. We have a similar expression, though not so strong : "I was struck with this or that remarkable thing."</p>
