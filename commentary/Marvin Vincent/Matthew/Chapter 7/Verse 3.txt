Beholdest [βλεπεις] . Staring at from without, as one who does not see clearly. Considerest [κατανοεις] . A stronger word, apprehendest from within, what is already there. Mote [καρφος] . A. V. and Rev. The word mote, however, suggests dust; whereas the figure is that of a minute chip or splinter, of the same material with the beam. Wyc. renders festu, with the explanation, a little mote. In explaining the passage it is well to remember that the obstruction to sight is of the same material in both cases. The man with a great beam in his eye, who therefore can see nothing accurately, proposes to remove the little splinter from his brother 's eye, a delicate operation, requiring clear sight. The figure of a splinter to represent something painful or annoying is a common oriental one. Tholuck (" Sermon on the Mount ") quotes from the Arabic several passages in point, and one which is literally our Lord 's saying : "How seest thou the splinter in thy brother 's eye, and seest not the cross - beam in thine eye ?" Beam [δοκον] . A log, joist, rafter; indicating a great fault.
