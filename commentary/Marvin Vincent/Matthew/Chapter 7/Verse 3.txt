<p>Beholdest [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπεις] </span></span>. Staring at from without, as one who does not see clearly. </p>
<p>Considerest [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατανοεις] </span></span>. A stronger word, apprehendest from within, what is already there. </p>
<p>Mote [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρφος] </span></span>. A. V. and Rev. The word mote, however, suggests dust; whereas the figure is that of a minute chip or splinter, of the same material with the beam. Wyc. renders festu, with the explanation, a little mote. In explaining the passage it is well to remember that the obstruction to sight is of the same material in both cases. The man with a great beam in his eye, who therefore can see nothing accurately, proposes to remove the little splinter from his brother 's eye, a delicate operation, requiring clear sight. The figure of a splinter to represent something painful or annoying is a common oriental one. Tholuck (" Sermon on the Mount ") quotes from the Arabic several passages in point, and one which is literally our Lord 's saying : "How seest thou the splinter in thy brother 's eye, and seest not the cross - beam in thine eye ?" </p>
<p>Beam [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκον] </span></span>. A log, joist, rafter; indicating a great fault.</p>
