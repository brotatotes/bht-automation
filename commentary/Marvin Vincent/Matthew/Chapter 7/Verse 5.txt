<p>See clearly [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαβλεψεις] </span></span>. The preposition dia, through, giving the sense of thoroughness. Compare the simple verb blepeiv (beholdest), ver. 3. With the beam in thine eye thou starest at thy brother 's little failing. Pull out the beam; then thou shalt see clearly, not only the fault itself, but how to help thy brother get rid of it. </p>
<p>To cast out [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβαλειν] </span></span>. The Lord 's words assume that the object of scrutiny is not only nor mainly detection, but correction. Hence thou shalt see clearly, not the mote, but to cast out the mote.</p>
