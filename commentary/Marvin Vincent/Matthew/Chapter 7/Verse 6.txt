That which is holy [το αγιον] . The holy thing, as of something commonly recognized as sacred. The reference is to the meat offered in sacrifice. The picture is that of a priest throwing a piece of flesh from the altar of burnt - offering to one of the numerous dogs which infest the streets of Eastern cities. Pearls before swine [μαργαριτας εμπροσθεν των χοιρων] . Another picture of a rich man wantonly throwing handfuls of small pearls to swine. Swine in Palestine were at best but half - tamed, the hog being an unclean animal. The wild boar haunts the Jordan valley to this day. Small pearls, called by jewellers seed - pearls, would resemble the pease or maize on which the swine feed. They would rush upon them when scattered, and, discovering the cheat, would trample upon them and turn their tusks upon the man who scattered them. Turn [στραφεντες] . The Rev. properly omits again. The word graphically pictures the quick, sharp turn of the boar. Rend [ρηξωσιν] . Lit., break; and well chosen to express the peculiar character of the wound made by the boar's tusk, which is not a cut, but a long tear or rip.
