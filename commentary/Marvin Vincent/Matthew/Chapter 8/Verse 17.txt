<p>Bare [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβαστασεν] </span></span>. This translation is correct. The word does not mean "he took away," but "he bore," as a burden laid upon him. This passage is the corner - stone of the faith - cure theory, which claims that the atonement of Christ includes provision for bodily no less than for spiritual healing, and therefore insists on translating "took away." Matthew may be presumed to have understood the sense of the passage he was citing from Isaiah, and he could have used no word more inadequate to express his meaning, if that meaning had been that Christ took away infirmities.</p>
