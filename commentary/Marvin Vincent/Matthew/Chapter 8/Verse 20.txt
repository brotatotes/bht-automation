Holes [φωλεους] . Wyc. has ditches, with burrows in explanation. Nests [κατασκηνωσεις] . Only here and in the parallel, Luke 9:58. Nests is too limited. The word, derived from skhnh, a tent, has the more general meaning of shelter or habitation. In classical Greek it is used of an encampment. The nest is not to the bird what the hole is to the fox, a permanent dwelling - place, since the bird frequents the nest only during incubation. The Rev. retains nests, but puts lodging - places in the margin.
