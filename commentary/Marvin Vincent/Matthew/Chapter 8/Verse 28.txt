The tombs [μνημειων] . Chambers excavated in the mountain, which would afford a shelter to the demoniac. Chandler (" Travels in Asia Minor ") describes tombs with two square rooms, the lower containing the ashes, while the upper, the friends performed funeral rites, and poured libations through a hole in the floor. Dr. Thomson (" Land and Book ") thus describes the rock - cut tombs in the region between Tyre and Sidon : "They are nearly all of the same form, having a small chamber in front, and a door leading from that into the tomb, which is about six feet square, with niches on three sides for the dead." A propensity to take up the abode in the tombs is mentioned by ancient physicians as a characteristic of mad - men. The Levitical uncleanness of the tombs would insure the wretches the solitude which they sought. Trench (" Notes on the Miracles ") cites the following incident from Warburton (" The Crescent and the Cross ") : "On descending from these heights I found myself in a cemetery whose sculptured turbans showed me that the neighboring village was Moslem. The silence of night was not broken by fierce yells and howling, which I discovered proceeded from a naked maniac who was fighting with some wild dogs for a bone. The moment he perceived me he left his canine comrades, and bounding along with rapid strides, seized my horse 's bridle, and almost forced him backward over the cliff." Fierce [χαλεποι] . Originally, difficult, hard. Hence hard to manage; intractable.
