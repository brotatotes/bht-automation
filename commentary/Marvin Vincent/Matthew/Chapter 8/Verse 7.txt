<p>Heal [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεραπευσω] </span></span>. So A. V. and Rev. The word, however, originally means to attend, and to treat medically. The centurion uses another and stronger word, shall be healed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιαθησεται] </span></span>. Luke, who as a physician is precise in the use of medical terms, uses both words in one verse (ix. 11). Jesus healed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιατο</span></span>] all who had need of treatment [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεραπειας] </span></span>. Still, Luke himself does not always observe the distinction. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:15">Luke 5:15</span>.</p>
