Bottles [ασκους] . Rev., rightly, wine - skins, though our word bottle originally carried the true meaning, being a bottle of leather. In Spanish, bota means leather bottle, a boot, and a butt. In Spain wine is still brought to market in pig - skins. In the East, goat - skins are commonly used, with the rough side inward. When old, they break under the fermentation of the wine.
