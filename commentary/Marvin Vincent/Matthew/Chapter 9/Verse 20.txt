Hem [κρασπεδου] . Rev., border. The fringe worn on the border of the outer garment, according to the command in Numbers 14:38. Dr. Edersheim (" Life and Times of Jesus ") says that, according to tradition, each of the white fringes was to consist of eight threads, one of them wound round the others; first seven times, with a double knot; then eight times with a double knot; then eleven times with a double knot; and, lastly, thirteen times. The Hebrew characters representing these numbers formed the words Jehovah One.
