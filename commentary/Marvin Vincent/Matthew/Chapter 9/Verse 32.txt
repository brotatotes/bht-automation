<p>Dumb [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωφον] </span></span>. The word is also used of deafness (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:5">Matthew 11:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:32">Mark 7:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:22">Luke 7:22</span>). It means dull or blunted. Thus Homer applies it to the earth; the dull, senseless earth (" Iliad, "24 25). Also to a blunted dart (" Iliad," 11 390). The classical writers use it of speech, hearing, sight, and mental perception. In the New Testament, only of hearing and speech, the meaning in each case being determined by the context.</p>
