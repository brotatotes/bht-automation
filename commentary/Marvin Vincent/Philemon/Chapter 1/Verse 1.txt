A prisoner of Jesus Christ [δεσμιος] . A prisoner for Christ 's sake. This is the only salutation in which Paul so styles himself. The word is appropriate to his confinement at Rome. Apostle would not have suited a private letter, and one in which Paul takes the ground of personal friendship and not of apostolic authority. A similar omission of the official title occurs in the Epistles to the Thessalonians and Philippians, and is accounted for on the similar ground of his affectionate relations with the Macedonian churches. Contrast the salutation to the Galatians. Timothy, our brother. Lit., the brother. Timothy could not be called an apostle. He is distinctly excluded from this office in 2 Corinthians 1:1; Colossians 1:1; compare Philippians 1:1. In Philippians and Philemon, after the mention of Timothy the plural is dropped. In Col. it is maintained throughout the thanksgiving only. The title brother is used of Quartus, Romans 16:23; Sosthenes, 1 Corinthians 1:1; Apollos, 1 Corinthians 16:12. Philemon. An inhabitant, and possibly a native of Colossae in Phrygia. The name figured in the beautiful Phrygian legend of Baucis and Philemon, related by Ovid (" Metamorphoses, " 8, 626 sqq. See note on Acts 14:11). He was one of Paul 's converts (ver. 19), and his labors in the Gospel at Colossae are attested by the title fellow - laborer, and illustrated by his placing his house at the disposal of the Colossian Christians for their meetings (ver. 2). The statements that he subsequently became bishop of Colossae and suffered martyrdom are legendary.
