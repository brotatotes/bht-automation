<p>I have sent again [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεπεμψα] </span></span>. Rev., sent back. The epistolary aorist, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:12">1 Peter 5:12</span>. Our idiom would be I send back. That Onesimus accompanied the letter appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+4:7-9">Colossians 4:7-9</span>. Thou therefore receive. Omit, and render aujton him as Rev., in his own person; his very self.</p>
