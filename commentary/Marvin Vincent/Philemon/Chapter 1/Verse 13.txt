<p>In the bonds of the Gospel. Connect with me. Bonds with which he is bound for the sake of the Gospel : with which Christ has invested him. A delicate hint at his sufferings is blended with an intimation of the authority which attaches to his appeal as a prisoner of Christ. This language of Paul is imitated by Ignatius. "My bonds exhort you" (Tralles, 12.). "He (Jesus Christ) is my witness, in whom I am bound" (Philadelphia, 7.). "In whom I bear about my bonds as spiritual pearls" (Ephesians, 11.). "In the bonds which I bear about, I sing the praises of the churches" (Magnesians, 1.).</p>
