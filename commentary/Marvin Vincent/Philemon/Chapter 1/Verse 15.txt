"We are not to be too sure of what God means by such and such a thing, as some of us are wont to be, as if we had been sworn of God 's privy council.... A humble 'perhaps' often grows into a 'verily, verily' - and a hasty, over - confident 'verily, verily' often dwindles to a hesitating 'perhaps. ' Let us not be in too great a hurry to make sure that we have the key of the cabinet where God keeps his purposes, but content ourselves with 'perhaps' when we are interpreting the often questionable ways of His providence, each of which has many meanings and many ends" [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαχλαρεν] </span></span>. </p>
<p>He therefore departed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τουτο εχωρισθη] </span></span>. The A. V. misses the ingenious shading of Paul 's expression.

The former is suggested by was parted, and would fain have kept : but the latter by ver. 16, no longer as a servant, but more. The latter is preferable. Compare the use of ajpecw in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:2">Matthew 6:2</span>, they have received.
