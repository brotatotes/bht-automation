For perhaps. I sent him back, for, if I had kept him, I might have defeated the purpose for which he was allowed to be separated from you for a time. "We are not to be too sure of what God means by such and such a thing, as some of us are wont to be, as if we had been sworn of God 's privy council.... A humble 'perhaps' often grows into a 'verily, verily' - and a hasty, over - confident 'verily, verily' often dwindles to a hesitating 'perhaps. ' Let us not be in too great a hurry to make sure that we have the key of the cabinet where God keeps his purposes, but content ourselves with 'perhaps' when we are interpreting the often questionable ways of His providence, each of which has many meanings and many ends" [μαχλαρεν] . He therefore departed [δια τουτο εχωρισθη] . The A. V. misses the ingenious shading of Paul 's expression. Not only does he avoid the word ran away, which might have irritated Philemon, but he also uses the passive voice, not the middle, separated himself, as an intimation that Onesimus' flight was divinely ordered for good.

The compounded preposition ajpo may mean back again, after the temporary separation, or in full, wholly. The former is suggested by was parted, and would fain have kept : but the latter by ver. 16, no longer as a servant, but more. The latter is preferable. Compare the use of ajpecw in Matthew 6:2, they have received. (see note); Matthew 6:16; Luke 6:24; Philippians 4:18; and ajpolambanw receive, Galatians 4:5.
