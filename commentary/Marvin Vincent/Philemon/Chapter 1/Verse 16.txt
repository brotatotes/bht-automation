<p>Not now [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκετι] </span></span>. Rev., more correctly, no longer. The negative adverb oujketi states the fact absolutely, not as it may be conceived by Philemon [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηκετι] </span></span>. However Philemon may regard Onesimus, as a fact he is now no longer as a slave. </p>
<p>Above [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ] </span></span>. Rev., more than. More than a slave - a whole man. Especially [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλιστα] </span></span>. Connect with beloved. Especially to me as compared with other Christians. </p>
<p>How much more [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποσω μαλλον] </span></span>. Beloved most to Paul, how much more than most to Philemon, since he belonged to him in a double sense, as a slave and as a Christian brother : in the flesh and in the Lord. "In the flesh Paul had the brother for a slave : in the, Lord he had the slave for a brother" (Meyer).</p>
