If he hath wronged [ει ηδικδσεν] . The indicative mood with the conditional particle may imply that what is put hypothetically is really a fact : if he wronged thee as he did. Oweth. Perhaps indicating that Onesimus had been guilty of theft. Notice the general word wronged instead of the more exact specification of the crime. Put that on my account [τουτο εμοι ελλογα] . For the verb, compare Romans 5:13 (note).
