<p>I Paul have written, etc. Rev., write. A promissory note. The mention of his autograph here, rather than at the end of the letter, may indicate that he wrote the whole epistle with his own hand, contrary to his usual custom of employing an amanuensis. </p>
<p>Albeit I do not say [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη λεγω] </span></span>. Lit., that I may not say. Connect with I write. I thus give my note of hand that I may avoid saying that thou owest, etc. Rev., that I say not unto thee. </p>
<p>Thou owest [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσοφειλεις] </span></span>. Lit., owest in addition. I have laid you under obligation, not only for an amount equal to that due from Onesimus, but for yourself as made a Christian through my ministry.</p>
