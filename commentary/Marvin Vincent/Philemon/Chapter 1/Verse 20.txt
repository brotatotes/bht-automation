Yea [ναι] . A confirmatory particle, gathering up the whole previous intercession for Onesimus. So Matthew 11:26. even so; Rev., yea. Luke 11:51, verily; Rev., yea. Luke 12:5, yea. Let me have joy [οναιμην] . Or help. Lit., may I profit. Again a play upon the name Onesimus. The verb is frequently used with reference to filial doties. Ignatius employs it, in one instance, directly after an allusion to another Onesimus (Ephesians, 2.).
