<p>Epaphras my fellow prisoner [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαφρας ο συναιχμαλωτος μου] </span></span>. Epaphras is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:7">Colossians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+4:12">Colossians 4:12</span>. Some identify him with Epaphroditus, but without sufficient reason. Epaphroditus appears to have been a native of Philippi (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:25">Philippians 2:25</span>), and Epaphras of Colossae (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+4:12">Colossians 4:12</span>). Epaphroditus is always used of the Philippian, and Epaphras of the Colossian. The names, however, are the same, Epaphras being a contraction. </p>
<p>It is disputed whether fellow - prisoner is to be taken in a literal or in a spiritual sense. For the latter see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:5">2 Corinthians 10:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:8">Ephesians 4:8</span>. Compare fellow - soldier, ver. 2, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:25">Philippians 2:25</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:7">Romans 16:7</span>, the word used here is applied to Andronicus and Junia. Paul was not strictly an aijcmalwtov prisoner of war (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:18">Luke 4:18</span>). The probabilities seem to favor the spiritual sense. Lightfoot suggests that Epaphras' relations with Paul at Rome may have excited suspicion and led to his temporally confinement; or that he may voluntarily have shared Paul 's imprisonment.</p>
