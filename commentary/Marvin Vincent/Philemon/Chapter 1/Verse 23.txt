Epaphras my fellow prisoner [επαφρας ο συναιχμαλωτος μου] . Epaphras is mentioned Colossians 1:7; Colossians 4:12. Some identify him with Epaphroditus, but without sufficient reason. Epaphroditus appears to have been a native of Philippi (Philippians 2:25), and Epaphras of Colossae (Colossians 4:12). Epaphroditus is always used of the Philippian, and Epaphras of the Colossian. The names, however, are the same, Epaphras being a contraction. It is disputed whether fellow - prisoner is to be taken in a literal or in a spiritual sense. For the latter see Romans 7:23; 2 Corinthians 10:5; Ephesians 4:8. Compare fellow - soldier, ver. 2, and Philippians 2:25. In Romans 16:7, the word used here is applied to Andronicus and Junia. Paul was not strictly an aijcmalwtov prisoner of war (see on Luke 4:18). The probabilities seem to favor the spiritual sense. Lightfoot suggests that Epaphras' relations with Paul at Rome may have excited suspicion and led to his temporally confinement; or that he may voluntarily have shared Paul 's imprisonment.
