<p>Grace - with your spirit. As in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:18">Galatians 6:18</span>, with the omission here of brother. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span>. </p>
<p>Out of many private letters which must have been written by Paul, this alone has been preserved. Its place in the New Testament canon is vindicated, so far as its internal character is concerned, by its picture of Paul as a christian gentleman, and by its exhibition of Paul 's method of dealing with a great social evil. </p>
<p>Paul 's dealing with the institution of slavery displayed the profoundest christian sagacity. To have attacked the institution as such would have been worse than useless. To one who reads between the lines, Paul 's silence means more than any amount of denunciation; for with his silence goes his faith in the power of christian sentiment to settle finally the whole question. He knows that to bring slavery into contact with living Christianity is to kill slavery. He accepts the social condition as a fact, and even as a law. He sends Onesimus back to his legal owner. He does not bid Philemon emancipate him, but he puts the christian slave on his true footing of a christian brother beside his master. As to the institution, he knows that the recognition of the slave as free in Christ will carry with it, ultimately, the recognition of his civil freedom. </p>
<p>History vindicated him in the Roman empire itself. Under Constantine the effects of christian sentiment began to appear ill the Church and in legislation concerning slaves. Official freeing of slaves became common as an act of pious gratitude, and burial tablets often represent masters standing before the Good Shepherd, with a band of slaves liberated at death, and pleading for them at judgment. In A. D. 312 a law was passed declaring as homicide the poisoning or branding of slaves, and giving them to be torn by beasts. The advance of a healthier sentiment may be seen by comparing the law of Augustus, which forbade a master to emancipate more than one - fifth of his slaves, and which fixed one hundred males as a maximum for one time - and the unlimited permission to emancipate conceded by Constantine. Each new ruler enacted some measure which facilitated emancipation. Every obstacle was thrown by the law in the way of separating families. Under Justinian all presumptions were in favor of liberty. If a slave had several owners, one could emancipate him, and the others must accept compensation at a reduced valuation. The mutilated, and those who had served in the army with their masters' knowledge and consent, were liberated. All the old laws which limited the age at which a slave could be freed, and the number which could be emancipated, were abolished. A master's marriage with a slave freed all the children. Sick and useless slaves must be sent by their masters to the hospital. </p>
<p>Great and deserved praise has been bestowed on this letter. Bengel says : "A familiar and exceedingly courteous epistle concerning a private affair is inserted among the New Testament books, intended to afford a specimen of the highest wisdom as to how Christians should arrange civil affairs on loftier principles." Franke, quoted by Bengel, says : "The single epistle to Philem. very far surpasses all the wisdom of the world." Renan : "A true little chef - d'oeuvre of the art of letter - writing." Sabatier : "This short epistle gleams like a pearl of the most exquisite purity in the rich treasure of the New Testament." 214 ===<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:0">Hebrews 1:0</span> </p>
<p>CHAPTER I </p>
<p>THEME OF THE EPISTLE. - God has given a revelation of salvation in two stages. The first was preparatory and transient, and is completed. The second, the revelation through Jesus Christ, is final. The readers who have accepted this second revelation are warned against returning to the economy of the first.</p>
