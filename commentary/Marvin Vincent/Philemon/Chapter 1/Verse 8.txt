Wherefore. Seeing that I have these proofs of thy love. Connect with I rather beseech (ver. 9). I might be much bold [πολλην παρρησιαν εχων] . Better, as Rev., I have all boldness. ParjrJhsia boldness is opposed to fear, John 7:13; to ambiguity or reserve, John 11:14. The idea of publicity may attach to it as subsidiary, John 7:4. In Christ. As holding apostolic authority from Christ. That which is convenient [το ανηκον] . Rev., befitting. Convenient is used in A. V., in the earlier and stricter sense of suitable. Compare Ephesians 5:4. Thus Latimer : "Works which are good and convenient to be done." Applied to persons, as Hooper : "Apt and convenient persons." The modern sense merges the idea of essential fitness. The verb ajnhkw originally means to come up to; hence of that which comes up to the mark; fitting. Compare Colossians 3:18; Ephesians 5:4. It conveys here a delicate hint that the kindly reception of Onesimus will be a becoming thing.
