<p>Wherefore. Seeing that I have these proofs of thy love. Connect with I rather beseech (ver. 9). </p>
<p>I might be much bold [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλην παρρησιαν εχων] </span></span>. Better, as Rev., I have all boldness. ParjrJhsia boldness is opposed to fear, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:13">John 7:13</span>; to ambiguity or reserve, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:14">John 11:14</span>. The idea of publicity may attach to it as subsidiary, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:4">John 7:4</span>. </p>
<p>In Christ. As holding apostolic authority from Christ. </p>
<p>That which is convenient [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ανηκον] </span></span>. Rev., befitting. Convenient is used in A. V., in the earlier and stricter sense of suitable. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:4">Ephesians 5:4</span>. Thus Latimer : "Works which are good and convenient to be done." Applied to persons, as Hooper : "Apt and convenient persons." The modern sense merges the idea of essential fitness. The verb ajnhkw originally means to come up to; hence of that which comes up to the mark; fitting. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:18">Colossians 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:4">Ephesians 5:4</span>. It conveys here a delicate hint that the kindly reception of Onesimus will be a becoming thing.</p>
