<p>Being such an one as Paul the aged [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοιουτος ων ως παυλος πρεσβυτης] </span></span>. Being such an one, connect with the previous I rather beseech, and with Paul the aged. Not, being such an one (armed with such authority), as Paul the aged I beseech (the second beseech in ver. 10); but, as Rev., for love 's sake I rather beseech, being such an one as Paul the aged. The beseech in ver. 10 is resumptive. Aged; or ambassador (so Rev., in margin). The latter rendering is supported by presbeuw I am an ambassador, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:10">Ephesians 6:10</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:21">Ephesians 6:21</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:0">Ephesians 6:0</span> There is no objection to aged on the ground of fact. Paul was about sixty years old, besides being prematurely aged from labor and hardship. For aged see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:18">Luke 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:2">Titus 2:2</span>.</p>
