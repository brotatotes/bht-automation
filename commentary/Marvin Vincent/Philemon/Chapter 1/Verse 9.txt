Being such an one as Paul the aged [τοιουτος ων ως παυλος πρεσβυτης] . Being such an one, connect with the previous I rather beseech, and with Paul the aged. Not, being such an one (armed with such authority), as Paul the aged I beseech (the second beseech in ver. 10); but, as Rev., for love 's sake I rather beseech, being such an one as Paul the aged. The beseech in ver. 10 is resumptive. Aged; or ambassador (so Rev., in margin). The latter rendering is supported by presbeuw I am an ambassador, Ephesians 6:10. Ephesians 6:21 Ephesians 6:0 There is no objection to aged on the ground of fact. Paul was about sixty years old, besides being prematurely aged from labor and hardship. For aged see Luke 1:18; Titus 2:2.
