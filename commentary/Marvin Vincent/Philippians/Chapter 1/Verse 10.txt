<p>Approve [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμαζειν] </span></span>. Sanction on test. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>. </p>
<p>Things which are excellent [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα διαφεροντα] </span></span>. Unnecessary difficulty has been made in the explanation of this phrase. Love displays itself in knowledge and discernment. In proportion as it abounds it sharpens the moral perceptions for the discernment of what is best. The passage is on the line of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span>, "Covet earnestly the best gifts," and the "more excellent way" to attain these gifts is love (ch. 13.). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:18">Romans 2:18</span>, where the same phrase occurs, but with a different meaning. Some explain things which are morally different. </p>
<p>Sincere [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειλικρινεις] </span></span>. See on pure, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:1">2 Peter 3:1</span>. </p>
<p>Without offense [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απροσκοποι] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:16">Acts 24:16</span>. It may be explained, not stumbling, or not causing others to stumble, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:32">1 Corinthians 10:32</span>. Both senses may be included. If either is to be preferred it is the former, since the whole passage contemplates their inward state rather than their relations to men. </p>
<p>Till the day, etc. [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις] </span></span>. Rev., unto. Better, against; with a view to.</p>
