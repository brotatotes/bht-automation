<p>Rather [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλλον] </span></span>. For the furtherance of the Gospel rather than, as might have been expected, for its hindrance. </p>
<p>Furtherance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προκοπην] </span></span>. Only here, ver. 25, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:15">1 Timothy 4:15</span>. The metaphor is uncertain, but is supposed to be that of pioneers cutting [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπτω</span></span>] a way before [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ</span></span>] an army, and so furthering its march. The opposite is expressed by ejgkoptw to cut into; hence to throw obstacles in the way, hinder. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:7">Galatians 5:7</span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:7">1 Peter 3:7</span>.</p>
