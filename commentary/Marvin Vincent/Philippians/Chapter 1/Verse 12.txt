Rather [μαλλον] . For the furtherance of the Gospel rather than, as might have been expected, for its hindrance. Furtherance [προκοπην] . Only here, ver. 25, and 1 Timothy 4:15. The metaphor is uncertain, but is supposed to be that of pioneers cutting [κοπτω] a way before [προ] an army, and so furthering its march. The opposite is expressed by ejgkoptw to cut into; hence to throw obstacles in the way, hinder. Galatians 5:7. See on 1 Peter 3:7.
