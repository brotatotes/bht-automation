Many [τους πλειονας] . Rev., correctly, the most. Lit., the more. Implying that there were a few who held back. Brethren in the Lord. In the Lord should be rather connected with being confident. The expression brethren in the Lord does not occur in the New Testament; while to have confidence in one in the Lord is found Galatians 5:10; 2 Thessalonians 3:4; compare ch. 2 24. In the Lord is thus emphatic. It may be correlative with in Christ, ver. 13; but this is not certain. 175 In the Lord trusting my bonds, signifies that the bonds awaken confidence as being the practical testimony to the power of the Gospel for which Paul is imprisoned, and therefore an encouragement to their faith. Are much more bold [περισσοτερως τολμαν] . Rev., more abundantly bold, thus holding more closely to the literal meaning of the adverb. For are bold, see on 2 Corinthians 10:2.

It is a caricature of Christ on the cross, with an ass's head, while on the left appears a christian youth in an attitude of adoration. Underneath are scrawled the words Alexamenos worships God. 176 To speak [λαλειν] . The verb denotes the fact rather than the substance of speaking. See on Matthew 28:18. They have broken silence.
