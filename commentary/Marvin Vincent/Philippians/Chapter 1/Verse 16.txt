The one preach Christ of contention. The order of vers. 16, 17, is reversed in the best texts. Of contentions [εξ εριθειας] . See on strife, James 3:14. Rev., better, faction. Compare Chaucer : "For mine entente is not but for to winne And nothing for correction of sinne" " Pardouere's Tale, " 12337 - 8. Sincerely [αγνως] . Purely, with unmixed motives. The adjective aJgnov means pure, in the sense of chaste, free from admixture of evil, and is once applied to God, 1 John 3:3. See on Acts 26:10, foot - note. Not sincerely is explained by in pretense, ver. 18. To add affliction [θλιψιν επιφερειν] . Lit., to bring affliction to bear. But the correct reading is ejgeirein to raise up, as Rev. : to waken or stir up affliction. The phrase is striking in the light of the original meaning of qliyiv, namely, pressure. They would make his bonds press more heavily and gall him. See on Matthew 13:21.
