<p>I am set [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κειμαι] </span></span>. Or appointed. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:34">Luke 2:34</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:3">1 Thessalonians 3:3</span>. Some, instead of rendering the one (or some) preach Christ of contention - but the other of love, join oiJ men some, oiJ de others, in each instance with the succeeding word, making one phrase, thus : " they who are of love do so knowing that I am set, etc. : they who are of faction proclaim Christ not sincerely, etc. The phrase those who are of faction occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:8">Romans 2:8</span>; and a similar phrase, him who is of faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:26">Romans 3:26</span>. There seems no sufficient reason for altering A. V. and Rev.</p>
