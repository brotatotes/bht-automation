"Declare unto him if the light wherewith Blossoms your substance shall remain with you Eternally the same that it is now, And if it do remain, say in what manner, After ye are again made visible, It can be that it injure not your sight. As by a greater gladness urged and drawn They who are dancing in a ring sometimes Uplift their voices and their motions quicken; So, at that orison devout and prompt, The holy circles a new joy displayed In their revolving and their wondrous song. Who so lamenteth him that here we die That we may live above, has never there Seen the refreshment of the eternal rain." DANTE, "Paradiso," 14, 13 - 27.
