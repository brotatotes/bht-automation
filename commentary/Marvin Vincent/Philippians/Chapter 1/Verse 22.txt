<p>If I live [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ει το ζην] </span></span>. Rev., better, if to live : the living, as ver. 21. This is the fruit of my labor. According to the A. V. these words form the offset of the conditional clause, and conclude the sentence : if I live - this is the fruit. It is better to make the two clauses parallel, thus : if living after the flesh, (if) this is fruit of labor. The conditional suspended clause will then be closed by what I shall choose I do not declare. Fruit of labor, advantage accruing from apostolic work. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:13">Romans 1:13</span>. </p>
<p>Yet what I shall choose I wot not [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και τι αιρησομαι ου γνωριζω] </span></span>. Kai rendered yet has the force of then. If living in the flesh be, etc., then what I shall choose, etc. Wot is obsolete for know. In classical Greek gnwrizw means : 1, to make known point out; 2, to become acquainted with or discover; 3, to have acquaintance with. In the Septuagint the predominant meaning seems to be to make known. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="pr+22:19">Proverbs 22:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+44:23">Ezekiel 44:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+2:6">Daniel 2:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+2:10">Daniel 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+5:7">Daniel 5:7</span>. The sense here is to declare or make known, as everywhere in the New Testament. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:15">Luke 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:26">John 17:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:28">Acts 2:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+4:7">Colossians 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16">2 Peter 1:16</span>, etc. If I am assured that my continuing to live is most fruitful for the Church, then I say nothing as to my personal preference. I do not declare my choice. It is not for me to express a choice.</p>
