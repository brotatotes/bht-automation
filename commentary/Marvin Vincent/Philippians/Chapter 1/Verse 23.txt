<p>I am in a strait betwixt two [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεχομαι εκ των δυο] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:14">2 Corinthians 5:14</span>. The picture is that of a man pressed on both sides. Lit. I am held together, so that I cannot incline either way. Betwixt two, lit., from the two. The pressure comes from both sides. Note the article, the two, the two considerations just mentioned, departing or abiding in the flesh. Having a desire. Lit., the desire : my desire, as expressed in ver. 21, for death with its gain. </p>
<p>To depart [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναλυσαι] </span></span>. The verb means originally to unloose, undo again. So of Penelope's web : "During the night she undid it" (Homer, "Odyssey," 2, 105). Of loosing a ship from her moorings : of breaking up a camp. So 2 Macc. 9 1. Antiochus, having entered Persepolis, and having attempted to rob the temple and to hold the city, was put to flight by the inhabitants, and broke up [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναλελυκως</span></span>] and came away with dishonor. We have the same figure in popular usage of one who changes his residence : "He broke up at Chicago and removed to New York." Paul 's metaphor here is the military one, to break camp. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>, where the metaphor is the striking of a tent. Some prefer the nautical image, casting off from shore; but Paul 's circumstances naturally suggested military figures; and, what is somewhat strange in the case of one so familiar with the sea, nautical metaphors are rare in his writings. There is one at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:19">1 Timothy 1:19</span>, of those "who concerning the faith have made shipwreck;" at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span>, "tossed as by waves, and borne about by every wind." Kubernhseiv governments, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span> (see note), is from kubernaw to steer. </p>
<p>To be with Christ. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:6">2 Corinthians 5:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:8">2 Corinthians 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:59">Acts 7:59</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:14">1 Thessalonians 4:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:17">1 Thessalonians 4:17</span>. </p>
<p>Which is far better [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλω μαλλον κρεισσον] </span></span>. Lit., much more better. For similar cumulative expressions, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:17">2 Corinthians 4:17</span>. The best texts insert gar for. So Rev., for it is very far better.</p>
