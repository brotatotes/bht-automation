<p>Rejoicing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυχημα] </span></span>. The matter of rejoicing, wrought through your faith. </p>
<p>In Christ Jesus for me [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν χριστω ιησου εν εμοι] </span></span>. Construe in Christ Jesus with may abound, not with rejoicing. Christ is conceived as the element in which the matter of rejoicing grows and abounds. For me, better, as Rev, in me. The conjunction of the two phrases in Christ, in me, is somewhat confusing Paul 's presence is the immediate cause of their christian joy; hence in me; but their rejoicing in Paul is in Christ - a joy evolved within the sphere of life in Christ, and peculiar to those only to whom to live is Christ. </p>
<p>Coming [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρουσιας] </span></span>. Rev., better, presence.</p>
