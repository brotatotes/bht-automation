<p>Only. This one thing I urge as the only thing needful Let your conversation be [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολιτευεσθε] </span></span>. Only here in Paul 's writings, and elsewhere only <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:1">Acts 23:1</span>. The verb means to be a citizen. Lit., Be citizens worthily of the Gospel. Rev., Let your manner of life be. Margin, Behave as citizens. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:19">Ephesians 3:19</span>, and see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:20">Philippians 3:20</span>. The exhortation contemplates the Philippians as members of the christian commonwealth. The figure would be naturally suggested to Paul by his residence in Rome, and would appeal to the Philippians as a Roman colony, which was a reproduction of the parent commonwealth on a smaller scale. </p>
<p>Ye stand fast [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηκετε] </span></span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:15">2 Thessalonians 2:15</span>. For the verb, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:26">John 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>. </p>
<p>Spirit - mind [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματι - ψυχη] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:4">Romans 8:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:3">Romans 11:3</span>. </p>
<p>Striving together for the faith [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναθλουντες τη πιστει] </span></span>. The verb occurs only here and ch. 4 3. The figure is that of an athletic contest, and is in keeping with standfast. Not to be rendered striving in concert with the faith, thus personifying faith, and making the faith signify the gospel teaching. 177 For the faith as christian doctrine, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:7">Acts 6:7</span>. Faith is to be taken in its usual subjective sense of trust in Christ or in the Gospel. Together refers to the mutual striving of the Philippians; not to their striving in concert with Paul.</p>
