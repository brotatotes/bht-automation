Being confident [πεποιθως] . With a slightly causative force : since I am confident. Hath begun - will perform [εναρξαμενος - επιτελεσει] . The two words occur together, 2 Corinthians 8:6; Galatians 3:3. Both were used of religious ceremonials. So Euripides : "But come! Bring up the sacrificial meal - basket" [εξαρχου κανα] ; that is, begin the offering by taking the barley - meal from the basket (" Iphigenia in Aulis, " 435). Some find the sacrificial metaphor here, and compare ch. 2 17, see note. Perform, better as Rev., perfect. Perform, in its older and literal sense of carrying through (per) or consummating would express the idea; but popular usage has identified it with do.
