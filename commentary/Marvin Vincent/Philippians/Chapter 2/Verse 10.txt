<p>At the name of Jesus [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ονοματι] </span></span>. Rev., better, in the name. The name means here the personal name; but as including all that is involved in the name. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>. Hence the salutation is not at the name of Jesus, as by bowing when the name is uttered, but, as Ellicott rightly says : "the spiritual sphere, the holy element as it were, in which every prayer is to be offered and every knee to bow." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:20">Ephesians 5:20</span>. </p>
<p>Things in heaven, etc. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+5:13">Revelation 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:22">Ephesians 1:22</span>. The words may apply either to all intelligent beings or to all things. The latter is in accord with Paul 's treatment of the creation collectively in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19-22">Romans 8:19-22</span>, and with the Old - Testament passages, in which all nature is represented as praising God, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+148:0">Psalms 148:0</span>; Rom 65:13.</p>
