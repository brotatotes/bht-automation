<p>Not as in my presence only. Connect with work out, not with obeyed. Do not work out your salvation as though impelled to action by my presence merely. </p>
<p>Much more. Than if I were present; for in my absence even greater zeal and care are necessary. </p>
<p>Work out your own salvation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την εαυτων σωτηριαν κατεργαζασθε] </span></span>. Carry out "to the goal" (Bengel). Complete. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8">Romans 7:8</span>. Your own salvation. There is a saving work which God only can do for you; but there is also a work which you must do for yourselves. The work of your salvation is not completed in God 's work in you. God 's work must be carried out by yourselves. "Whatever rest is provided by Christianity for the children of God, it is certainly never contemplated that it should supersede personal effort. And any rest which ministers to indifference is immoral and unreal - it makes parasites and not men. Just because God worketh in him, as the evidence and triumph of it, the true child of God works out his own salvation - works it out having really received it - not as a light thing, a superfluous labor, but with fear and trembling as a reasonable and indispensable service" (Drummond, "Natural Law in the Spiritual World," p. 335). Human agency is included in God 's completed work. In the saving work of grace God imparts a new moral power to work.

Not slavish terror, but wholesome, serious caution. "This fear is self - distrust; it is tenderness of conscience; it is vigilance against temptation; it is the fear which inspiration opposes to high - mindedness in the admonition 'be not highminded but fear. ' It is taking heed lest we fall; it is a constant apprehension of the deceitfulness of the heart, and of the insidiousness and power of inward corruption. It is the caution and circumspection which timidly shrinks from whatever would offend and dishonor God and the Savior. And these the child of God will feel and exercise the more he rises above the enfeebling, disheartening, distressing influence of the fear which hath torment. Well might Solomon say of such fear, 'happy is the man that feareth alway'" (Wardlaw "On Proverbs," 28 14).
