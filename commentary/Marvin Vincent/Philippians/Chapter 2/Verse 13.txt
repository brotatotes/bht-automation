<p>For it is God which worketh in you. Completing and guarding the previous statement. In you, not among you. Worketh [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργων] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:14">Mark 6:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:16">James 5:16</span>. The verb means effectual working. In the active voice, to be at work. In the middle voice, as here (used only by James and Paul, and only of things), to display one's activity; show one's self - operative. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:20">Ephesians 3:20</span>. </p>
<p>To will and to do [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το θελειν και το ενεργειν] </span></span>. Lit., the willing and the doing. Both are from God, and are of one piece, so that he who wills inevitably does. The willing which is wrought by God, by its own nature and pressure, works out into action. "We will, but God works the will in us. We work, therefore, but God works the working in us" (Augustine). For to do, Rev. substitutes to work, thus preserving the harmony in the Greek between "God which worketh" and "to work." </p>
<p>Of His good pleasure [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ της ευδοκιας] </span></span>. Rev., better, for His, etc. Lit., for the sake of; in order to subserve. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:4">1 Timothy 2:4</span>.</p>
