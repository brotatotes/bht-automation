Blameless in the sight of others, guileless in your own hearts. Sons of God [τεκνα] . Rev., better, children. See on John 1:12. Compare Deuteronomy 32:5. Without rebuke [αμωμα] .

Crooked and perverse [σκολιας - διεστραμμενης] . Crooked, see on untoward, Acts 2:40; froward, 1 Peter 2:18. Perverse, lit., warped, twisted. See on Matthew 17:17; Luke 23:14. Ye shine [φαινεσθε] . Rev., more correctly, ye are seen. Compare Matthew 24:27; Revelation 18:23, A. V., where the same error occurs. Shine would require the verb in the active voice, as John 1:5; John 5:35.
