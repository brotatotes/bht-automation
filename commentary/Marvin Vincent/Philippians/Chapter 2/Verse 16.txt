<p>Holding forth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεχοντες] </span></span>. The verb means literally to hold upon or apply. Hence to fix attention upon, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:7">Luke 14:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:5">Acts 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:16">1 Timothy 4:16</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>, stayed : where the idea at bottom is the same - kept to. So in Sept., <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+27:8">Job 27:8</span>, of setting the heart on gain. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+30:26">Job 30:26</span>, "fixed my mind on good." In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+8:10">Genesis 8:10</span>, of Noah waiting. In classical Greek, to hold out, present, as to offer wine to a guest or the breast to an infant. Also to stop, keep down, confine, cease. Here in the sense of presenting or offering, as A. V. and Rev. holding forth. </p>
<p>That I may rejoice [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις καυχημα εμοι] </span></span>. Lit., for a cause of glorying unto me. </p>
<p>In the day of Christ (eijv hJmeran Cristou). Lit., against the day, as ch. 1 10. The phrase day of Christ is peculiar to this epistle. The usual expression is day of the Lord. </p>
<p>Have not run [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εδραμον] </span></span>. Rev., better, did not run. Aorist tense. Ignatius writes to Polycarp to ordain some one "beloved and unwearied, who may be styled God 's courier" (qeodromov. To Polycarp, 7.).</p>
