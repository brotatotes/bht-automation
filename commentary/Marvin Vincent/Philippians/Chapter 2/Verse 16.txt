In Acts 19:22, stayed : where the idea at bottom is the same - kept to. So in Sept., Job 27:8, of setting the heart on gain. Job 30:26, "fixed my mind on good." In Genesis 8:10, of Noah waiting. In classical Greek, to hold out, present, as to offer wine to a guest or the breast to an infant. Also to stop, keep down, confine, cease. Here in the sense of presenting or offering, as A. V. and Rev. holding forth. That I may rejoice [εις καυχημα εμοι] . Lit., for a cause of glorying unto me. In the day of Christ (eijv hJmeran Cristou). Lit., against the day, as ch. 1 10. The phrase day of Christ is peculiar to this epistle. The usual expression is day of the Lord. Have not run [ουκ εδραμον] . Rev., better, did not run. Aorist tense. Ignatius writes to Polycarp to ordain some one "beloved and unwearied, who may be styled God 's courier" (qeodromov. To Polycarp, 7.).
