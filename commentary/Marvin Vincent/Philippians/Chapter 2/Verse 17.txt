<p>I am offered [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπενδομαι] </span></span>. Lit., I am poured out as a libation. The figure is that of a sacrifice, in which the Philippians are the priests, offering their faith to God, and Paul 's life is the libation poured out at this offering. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:15">2 Corinthians 12:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:6">2 Timothy 4:6</span>. Ignatius : </p>
<p>"Brethren, I am lavishly poured out in love for you" (Philadelphia, 5.). Upon the sacrifice, etc. [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι] </span></span>. The image is probably drawn from heathen rather than from Jewish sacrifices, since Paul was writing to converted heathen. According to Josephus, the Jewish libation was poured round and not upon the altar; but the preposition ejpi used here, was also used to describe it. At all events, ejpi may be rendered at, which would suit either. Sacrifice and service [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυσια και λειτουργια] </span></span>. Sacrifice, as uniformly in the New Testament, the thing sacrificed.
