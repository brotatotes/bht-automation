I am offered [σπενδομαι] . Lit., I am poured out as a libation. The figure is that of a sacrifice, in which the Philippians are the priests, offering their faith to God, and Paul 's life is the libation poured out at this offering. Compare 2 Corinthians 12:15; 2 Timothy 4:6. Ignatius : "Brethren, I am lavishly poured out in love for you" (Philadelphia, 5.). Upon the sacrifice, etc. [επι] . The image is probably drawn from heathen rather than from Jewish sacrifices, since Paul was writing to converted heathen. According to Josephus, the Jewish libation was poured round and not upon the altar; but the preposition ejpi used here, was also used to describe it. At all events, ejpi may be rendered at, which would suit either. Sacrifice and service [θυσια και λειτουργια] . Sacrifice, as uniformly in the New Testament, the thing sacrificed. Service, see on ministration, Luke 1:23, and ministered, Acts 13:2. In the Old Testament, used habitually of the ministry of priests and Levites; also of Samuel's service to God; 1 Samuel 2:18; 1 Samuel 3:1. Of service to men, 1 Kings 1:4, 1 Kings 1:15. In the apostolic writings this and its kindred words are used of services to both God and man. See Romans 13:6; Romans 14:16; Luke 1:23; Romans 14:27; 2 Corinthians 9:12; Philippians 2:25. Of your faith. Offered by you as a sacrifice to God. Rejoice with [συγχαιρω] . There seems to be no sufficient reason for rendering congratulate.
