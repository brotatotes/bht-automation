Let nothing be done [μηδεν] . Rev., doing nothing. The Greek is simply nothing, depending either, as A. V. and Rev., on the verb to do understood, or on thinking [φρονουντες] of the preceding verse : thinking nothing. The latter is preferable, since the previous and the following exhortations relate to thinking or feeling rather than to doing. Through strife [κατα εριθειαν] . Rev., correctly, faction. Lit., according to faction. See on James 3:14; and ch. 1 16. According to indicates faction as the regulative state of mind. Vain glory [κενοδοξιαν] . Only here in the New Testament. The kindred adjective kenodoxoi desirous of vain glory, occurs only at Galatians 5:26. In the Septuagint the word is used to describe the worship of idols as folly (see Wisdom 14 14), and in 4 Macc. 5 9, the verb kenodoxew is used of following vain conceits about the truth. The word is compounded of kenov empty, vain, and, doxa opinion (but not in the New Testament), which, through the intermediate sense of good or favorable opinion, runs into the meaning of glory. See on Revelation 1:6. Lowliness of mind [ταπεινοφροσυνη] . See on Matthew 11:29.
