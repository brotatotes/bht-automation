<p>Let nothing be done [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν] </span></span>. Rev., doing nothing. The Greek is simply nothing, depending either, as A. V. and Rev., on the verb to do understood, or on thinking [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρονουντες</span></span>] of the preceding verse : thinking nothing.

In the Septuagint the word is used to describe the worship of idols as folly (see Wisdom 14 14), and in 4 Macc. 5 9, the verb kenodoxew is used of following vain conceits about the truth. The word is compounded of kenov empty, vain, and, doxa opinion (but not in the New Testament), which, through the intermediate sense of good or favorable opinion, runs into the meaning of glory.
