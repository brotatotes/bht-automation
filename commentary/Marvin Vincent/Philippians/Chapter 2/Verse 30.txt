<p>The work of Christ. The text varies : some reading work of the Lord, and others the work absolutely. If the latter, the meaning is labor for the Gospel; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:38">Acts 14:38</span>. If the Lord or Christ, the reference may be to the special service of Epaphroditus in bringing the contribution of the Philippians. </p>
<p>Not regarding his life [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβουλευσαμενος τη ψυχη] </span></span>. The correct reading is paraboleusamenov, meaning to venture, to expose one's self. It was also a gambler's word, to throw down a stake. Hence Paul says that Epaphroditus recklessly exposed his life. Rev., hazarding. The brotherhoods of the ancient Church, who cared for the sick at the risk of their lives, were called parabolani, 181 or reckless persons. </p>
<p>Your lack of service [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το υμων υστερημα λειτουργιας] </span></span>. An unfortunate rendering, since it might be taken to imply some neglect on the Philippians' part. Rev., that which was lacking in your service. The expression is complimentary and affectionate, to the effect that all that was wanting in the matter of their service was their ministration in person, which was supplied by Epaphroditus. </p>
