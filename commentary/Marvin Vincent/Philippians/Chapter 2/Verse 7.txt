<p>Made Himself of no reputation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτον εκενωσεν] </span></span>. 179 Lit., emptied Himself. The general sense is that He divested Himself of that peculiar mode of existence which was proper and peculiar to Him as one with God. He laid aside the form of God. In so doing, He did not divest Himself of His divine nature. The change was a change of state : the form of a servant for the form of God. His personality continued the same. His self - emptying was not self - extinction, nor was the divine Being changed into a mere man. In His humanity He retained the consciousness of deity, and in His incarnate state carried out the mind which animated Him before His incarnation. He was not unable to assert equality with God. He was able not to assert it. </p>
<p>Form of a servant [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μορφην δουλου] </span></span>. The same word for form as in the phrase form of God, and with the same sense. The mode of expression of a slave 's being is indeed apprehensible, and is associated with human shape, but it is not this side of the fact which Paul is developing. It is that Christ assumed that mode of being which answered to, and was the complete and characteristic expression of, the slave 's being. The mode itself is not defined. This is appropriately inserted here as bringing out the contrast with counted not equality with God, etc. What Christ grasped at in His incarnation was not divine sovereignty, but service. </p>
<p>Was made in the likeness of men [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ομοιωματι ανθρωπων γενομενος] </span></span>. Lit., becoming in, etc. Notice the choice of the verb, not was, but became : entered into a new state. Likeness. The word does not imply the reality of our Lord 's humanity, morfh form implied the reality of His deity. That fact is stated in the form of a servant. Neither is eijkwn image employed, which, for our purposes, implies substantially the same as morfh. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>. As form of a servant exhibits the inmost reality of Christ 's condition as a servant - that He became really and essentially the servant of men (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:27">Luke 22:27</span>) - so likeness of men expresses the fact that His mode of manifestation resembled what men are. This leaves room for the assumption of another side of His nature - the divine - in the likeness of which He did not appear. As He appealed to men, He was like themselves, with a real likeness; but this likeness to men did not express His whole self. The totality of His being could not appear to men, for that involved the form of God. Hence the apostle views Him solely as He could appear to men. All that was possible was a real and complete likeness to humanity. What He was essentially and eternally could not enter into His human mode of existence. Humanly He was like men, but regarded with reference to His whole self, He was not identical with man, because there was an element of His personality which did not dwell in them - equality with God. Hence the statement of His human manifestation is necessarily limited by this fact, and is confined to likeness and does not extend to identity. "To affirm likeness is at once to assert similarity and to deny sameness" (Dickson). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span>.</p>
