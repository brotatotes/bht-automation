<p>Wherefore [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διο] </span></span>. In consequence of this humiliation. </p>
<p>Hath highly exalted [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερυψωσεν] </span></span>. Lit., exalted above. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:12">Matthew 23:12</span>. </p>
<p>Hath given [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχαρισατο] </span></span>. Freely bestowed, even as Jesus freely offered Himself to humiliation : </p>
<p>A name. Rev., correctly, the name. This expression is differently explained : either the particular name given to Christ, as Jesus or Lord; or name is taken in the sense of dignity or glory, which is a common Old - Testament usage, and occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21">Ephesians 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4">Hebrews 1:4</span>. Under the former explanation a variety of names are proposed, as Son of God, Lord, God, Christ Jesus. The sense of the personal name Jesus seems to meet all the conditions, and the personal sense is the simpler, since Jesus occurs immediately after with the word name, and again Jesus Christ in ver. 11. The name Jesus was bestowed on Christ at the beginning of His humiliation, but prophetically as the One who should save His people from their sins, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>. It was the personal name of others besides; but if that is an objection here, it is equally an objection in ver. 10. The dignity is expressed by above every name. He bears the name in His glory. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:5">Acts 9:5</span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>.</p>
