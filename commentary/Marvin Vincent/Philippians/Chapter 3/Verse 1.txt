<p>Finally [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το λοιπον] </span></span>. Lit., for the rest. Frequent in Paul 's writings in introducing the conclusions of his letters. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:1">1 Thessalonians 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:1">2 Thessalonians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:11">2 Corinthians 13:11</span>, note. Evidently Paul was about to close his letter, when his thought was directed into another channel - the Judaizing teachers, and their attempts to undermine his influence. </p>
<p>Rejoice [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρετε] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:11">2 Corinthians 13:11</span>. </p>
<p>The same things. It is doubtful what is referred to. Possibly previous letters, or the dissensions in the Church. </p>
<p>Grievous [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οκνηρον] </span></span>. Only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:26">Matthew 25:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:11">Romans 12:11</span>, in both instances rendered slothful. From ojknew to delay. Hence, in classical Greek, shrinking, backward, unready. The idea of delay underlies the secondary sense, burdensome, troublesome. It is the vexation arising from weary waiting, and which appears in the middle English irken to tire or to become tired, cognate with the Latin urgere to press, and English irk, irksome, work.</p>
