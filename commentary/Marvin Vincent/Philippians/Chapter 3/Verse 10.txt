Power of His resurrection and fellowship of His sufferings furnish two specific points further defining the knowledge of Him. By the power of Christ 's resurrection is meant the power which it exerts over believers. Here, more especially, according to the context, in assuring their present justification, and its outcome in their final glorification.

For conformed see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:2">Matthew 17:2</span>, and on form, ch. 2 6.
