Lit., the resurrection, that, namely, from the dead. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:2">Acts 4:2</span>. This compound noun for resurrection is found only here, and expresses the rising from or from among [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ] </span></span>, which is further emphasized by the repetition of the preposition ejk (from). The kindred compound verb occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:19">Mark 12:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:28">Luke 20:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:5">Acts 14:5</span>, but in neither passage of raising the dead. The word here does not differ in meaning from ajnastasiv, commonly used, except that the idea is more vividly conceived as a rising from the earth.

Resurrection of the dead is a generic phrase, denoting the general resurrection of the dead, bad and good. Resurrection from the dead, in the only two passages where it occurs, signifies resurrection unto life. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span>, it is applied to Christ.</p>
