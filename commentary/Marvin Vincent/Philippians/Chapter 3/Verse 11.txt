If by any means [ει πως] . For the form of expression compare Romans 1:10; Romans 11:14. Not an expression of doubt, but of humility. I might attain [καταντησω] . See on Acts 26:7. The resurrection of the dead [την εξαναστασιν την εκ νεκρων] . Rev., more correctly, from the dead. Lit., the resurrection, that, namely, from the dead. Compare Acts 4:2. This compound noun for resurrection is found only here, and expresses the rising from or from among [εξ] , which is further emphasized by the repetition of the preposition ejk (from). The kindred compound verb occurs Mark 12:19; Luke 20:28; Acts 14:5, but in neither passage of raising the dead. The word here does not differ in meaning from ajnastasiv, commonly used, except that the idea is more vividly conceived as a rising from the earth. See Matthew 22:31; Luke 20:35. The phrase resurrection of or from the dead does not often occur in the Gospels, and resurrection ejk from the dead only twice in the New Testament, Acts 4:2; 1 Peter 1:3. For the phrase, see on Luke 16:31. Resurrection of the dead is a generic phrase, denoting the general resurrection of the dead, bad and good. Resurrection from the dead, in the only two passages where it occurs, signifies resurrection unto life. In 1 Peter 1:3, it is applied to Christ.
