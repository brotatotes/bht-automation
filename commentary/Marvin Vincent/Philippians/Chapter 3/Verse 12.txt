<p>Not as though [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ οτι] </span></span>. Lit., not that, as Rev. By this I do not mean to say that. For similar usage, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:22">John 7:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:24">2 Corinthians 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:17">Philippians 4:17</span>. </p>
<p>Had attained - were perfect [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαβον - τετελειωμαι] </span></span>. Rev., have attained, am made perfect. There is a change of tenses which may be intentional; the aorist attained pointing to the definite period of his conversion, the perfect, am made perfect, referring to his present state. Neither when I became Christ 's did I attain, nor, up to this time, have I been perfected. With attained supply the prize from ver. 14. Rev., am made perfect, is preferable, as preserving the passive form of the verb. I follow after [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωκω] </span></span>. Rev., better, press on. The A. V. gives the sense of chasing; whereas the apostle 's meaning is the pressing toward a fixed point. The continuous present would be better, I am pressing. </p>
<p>May apprehend [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλαβω</span></span>] American Rev., lay hold on. Neither A. V. </p>
<p>nor Rev. give the force of kai also; if I may also apprehend as well as pursue. For the verb, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:5">John 1:5</span>. </p>
<p>For which also I am apprehended. Rev., correctly, was apprehended. </p>
<p>American Rev., laid hold on. Paul 's meaning is, " I would grasp that for which Christ grasped me. Paul 's conversion was literally of the nature of a seizure. That for which Christ laid hold of him was indeed his mission to the Gentiles, but it was also his personal salvation, and it is of this that the context treats. Some render, seeing that also I was apprehended. Rev., in margin.</p>
