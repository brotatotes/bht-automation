Ignatius uses the word qema that which is deposited as a prize : a prize of money as distinct from the crown. "Be temperate as God 's athlete. The prize is incorruption and eternal life" (to Polycarp, 2.). Chrysostom says : "He that runs looks not at the spectators, but at the prize. Whether they be rich or poor, if one mock them, applaud them, insult them, throw stones at them - if one plunder their house, if they see children or wife or anything whatsoever - the runner is not turned aside, but is concerned only with his running and winning the prize. He that runneth stoppeth nowhere; since, if he be a little remiss, all is lost. He that runneth relaxeth in no respect before the end, but then, most of all, stretcheth over the course." </p>
