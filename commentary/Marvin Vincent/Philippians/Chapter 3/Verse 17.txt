<p>Followers together of me [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμμιμηται μου] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. Rev., more correctly, imitators. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:1">1 Corinthians 11:1</span>. Not imitators of Christ in common with me, but be together, jointly, imitators of me. </p>
<p>Mark [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκοπειτε] </span></span>. See on looking, ch. 2 4. </p>
<p>So as [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως καθως] </span></span>. Rev., "which so walk even as ye have," etc. The two words are correlative. Briefly, imitate me and those who follow my example.</p>
