Dogs. Rev., correctly, the dogs, referring to a well - known party - the Judaizers. These were nominally Christians who accepted Jesus as the Messiah, but as the Savior of Israel only.

Dogs was a term of reproach among both Greeks and Jews. Homer uses it of both women and men, implying shamelessness in the one, and recklessness in the other. Thus Helen :" Brother - in - law of me, a mischief devising dog "(" Iliad," 6, 344). Teucer of Hector : "I cannot hit this raging dog" (" Iliad, "8, 298). Dr. Thomson says of the dogs in oriental towns :" They lie about the streets in such numbers as to render it difficult and often dangerous to pick one's way over and amongst them - a lean, hungry, and sinister brood. They have no owners, but upon some principle known only to themselves, they combine into gangs, each of which assumes jurisdiction over a particular street; and they attack with the utmost ferocity all canine intruders into their territory. In those contests, and especially during the night, they keep up an incessant barking and howling, such as is rarely heard in any European city. The imprecations of David upon his enemies derive their significance, therefore, from this reference to one of the most odious of oriental annoyances "(" Land and Book," Central palestine and Phoenicia, 593).

<p>Concision [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατατομην] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament.
