What things [ατινα] . The double relative classifies; things which came under the category of gain. Compare Galatians 4:24; Colossians 2:23. Gain [κερδη] . Lit., gains. So Rev., in margin, and better. The various items of privilege are regarded separately. I counted loss [ηγημαι ζημιαν] . Better, as Rev., have counted. The perfect tense implies that he still counts them as loss. See on ver. 8. Notice the singular number loss, and the plural gains. The various gains are all counted as one loss.
