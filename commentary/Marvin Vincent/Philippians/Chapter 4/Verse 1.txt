<p>Joy and crown [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρα και στεφανος] </span></span>. Nearly the same phrase occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:19">1 Thessalonians 2:19</span>. The Philippian converts are his chaplet of victory, showing that he has not run in vain, ch. 2 16.
