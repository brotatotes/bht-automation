Longed for [επιποθητοι] . Only here in the New Testament. Compare I long for you, ch. 1 8; and for kindred words see 2 Corinthians 7:7; Romans 14:23. Joy and crown [χαρα και στεφανος] . Nearly the same phrase occurs 1 Thessalonians 2:19. The Philippian converts are his chaplet of victory, showing that he has not run in vain, ch. 2 16. For crown, see on Revelation 4:4; 1 Peter 5:4. So stand fast. As I have exhorted, and have borne myself in the conflict which you saw and heard to be in me, ch. 1 30.
