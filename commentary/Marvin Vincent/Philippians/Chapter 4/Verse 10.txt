Your care of me hath flourished again [ανεθαλετε το υπερ εμου φρονειν] . Lit., ye caused your thinking on my behalf to bloom anew. Rev., ye revived your thought for me. The verb occurs only here in the New Testament. In the Septuagint it appears as both transitive and intransitive, to flourish, or to cause to flourish. Thus Psalms 27:7, where Septuagint reads for my heart greatly rejoiceth, my flesh flourished [ανεθαλεν] ; Ezekiel 17:24, have made the dry tree to flourish. Wherein. The matter of my wants and sufferings. Implied in your care of me. Ye were careful [εφρονειτε] . Rev., ye did take thought. Note the imperfect tense : ye were all along thoughtful.
