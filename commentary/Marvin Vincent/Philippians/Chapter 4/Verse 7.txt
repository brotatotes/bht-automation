<p>Peace of God. As the antidote to anxiety, ver. 6. </p>
<p>Which passeth all understanding [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η υπερεχουσα παντα νουν] </span></span>. Either, which passes all power of comprehension, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:20">Ephesians 3:20</span>; or, better, which surpasses every (human) reason, in its power to relieve anxiety. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:31">Matthew 6:31</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:32">Matthew 6:32</span>. For understanding, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span>. </p>
<p>Shall keep [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρουρησει] </span></span>. Lit., guard, as Rev., or mount guard over. God 's peace, like a sentinel, patrols before the heart. Compare Tennyson : </p>
<p>"Love is and was my King and Lord, And will be, though as yet I keep Within his court on earth, and sleep Encompassed by his faithful guard, And hear at times a sentinel Who moves about from place to place, And whispers to the worlds of space, In the deep night, that all is well." " In Memoriam. " </p>
<p>Gurnall. a little differently : "The peace of God is said to garrison the believer 's heart and mind. He is surrounded with such blessed privileges that he is as safe as one in an impregnable castle" (" Christian in Complete Armor, " p. 419). </p>
<p>Hearts - minds [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρδιας - νοηματα] </span></span>. For hearts, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21">Romans 1:21</span>. For minds, Rev., thoughts, on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:14">2 Corinthians 3:14</span>. The guardianship is over the source and the issues of thought and will. "Your hearts and their fruits" (Alford).</p>
