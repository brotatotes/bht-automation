Honest [σεμνα] . Rev., honorable, reverend in margin. In classical Greek an epithet of the gods, venerable, reverend. The word occurs only here and in the pastoral epistles, 1 Timothy 3:8, 1 Timothy 3:11; Titus 2:2, where it is rendered grave, both in A. V. and Rev. There lies in it the idea of a dignity or majesty which is yet inviting and attractive, and which inspires reverence. Grave, as Trench observes, does not exhaust the meaning. Gravity may be ridiculous. "The word we want is one in which the sense of gravity and dignity, and of these as inviting reverence, is combined." Ellicott's venerable is perhaps as near as any word, if venerable be divested of its modern conventional sense as implying age, and confined to its original sense, worthy of reverence. Pure [αγνα] . See on 1 John 3:3. Lovely [προσφιλη] . Only here in the New Testament. Adapted to excite love, and to endear him who does such things. Of good report [ευφημα] . Only here in the New Testament. Lit., sounding well. The kindred verb is commonly used in an active sense. Hence not well spoken of, but fairspeaking, and so winning, gracious (Rev., in margin). Virtue [αρετη] . With this exception the word occurs only in Peter's epistles; 1 Peter 2:9; 2 Peter 1:3, 2 Peter 1:5; see notes on both. Praise [επαινος] . Commendation corresponding to the moral value of the virtue. In the Septuagint, ajreth virtue is four times used to translate the Hebrew praise. The two ideas seem to be coordinated. Lightfoot remarks that Paul seems studiously to avoid this common heathen term for moral excellence, and his explanation is very suggestive : "Whatever value may reside in your old heathen conception of virtue, whatever consideration is due to the praise of men."
