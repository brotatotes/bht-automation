<p>The Revelation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαλυψις] </span></span>. The Greek word is transcribed in Apocalypse. The word occurs only once in the Gospels, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:32">Luke 2:32</span>, where to lighten should be rendered for revelation. It is used there of our Lord, as a light to dispel the darkness under which the heathen were veiled. It occurs thirteen times in Paul 's writings, and three times in first Peter. It is used in the following senses : </p>
<p>(a.) The unveiling of something hidden, which gives light and knowledge to those who behold it. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:32">Luke 2:32</span> (above). </p>
<p>Christianity itself is the revelation of a mystery (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>). The participation of the Gentiles in the privileges of the new covenant was made known by revelation (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:3">Ephesians 3:3</span>). Paul received the Gospel which he preached by revelation (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:12">Galatians 1:12</span>), and went up to Jerusalem by revelation (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:2">Galatians 2:2</span>). </p>
<p>(b.) Christian insight into spiritual truth. Paul asks for Christians the spirit of revelation (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span>). Peculiar manifestations of the general gift of revelation are given in Christian assemblies (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:6">1 Corinthians 14:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:26">1 Corinthians 14:26</span>). Special revelations are granted to Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:1">2 Corinthians 12:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span>). </p>
<p>(c.) The second coming of the Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:13">1 Peter 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:7">2 Thessalonians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</span>) in which His glory shall be revealed (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:13">1 Peter 4:13</span>), His righteous judgment made known (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:5">Romans 2:5</span>), and His children revealed in full majesty (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19">Romans 8:19</span>). The kindred verb ajpokaluptw is used in similar connections. Following the categories given above, </p>
<p>(a.) <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:16">Galatians 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:23">Galatians 3:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5">Ephesians 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:12">1 Peter 1:12</span>. </p>
<p>(b.) <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:17">Matthew 16:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:22">Luke 10:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:10">1 Corinthians 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:30">1 Corinthians 14:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:15">Philippians 3:15</span>. </p>
<p>(c.) <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:26">Matthew 10:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:35">Luke 2:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:2">Luke 12:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:30">Luke 17:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18">Romans 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:18">Romans 8:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:13">1 Corinthians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:6">2 Thessalonians 2:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:5">1 Peter 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:1">1 Peter 5:1</span>. </p>
<p>The word is compounded with ajpo from, and kaluptw to cover. Hence, to remove the cover from anything; to unveil. So of Balaam, the Lord opened or unveiled his eyes (ajpekaluyen touv ojfqalmouv : <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:31">Numbers 22:31</span>, Sept.). So Boaz to Naomi 's kinsman : "I thought to advertise thee :" Rev., "disclose it unto thee" (ajpokaluyw to ouv sou : <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ru+4:4">Ruth 4:4</span>, Sept.). Lit., I will uncover thine ear. </p>
<p>The noun ajpokaluyiv revelation, occurs only once in the Septuagint (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+20:30">1 Samuel 20:30</span>), in the physical sense of uncovering. The verb is found in the Septuagint in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+2:19">Daniel 2:19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+2:22">Daniel 2:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+2:28">Daniel 2:28</span>. </p>
<p>In classical Greek, the verb is used by Herodotus (i., 119) of uncovering the head; and by Plato : thus, "reveal [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαλυψας</span></span>] to me the power of Rhetoric" (" Gorgias, "460) :" Uncover your chest and back "(" Protagoras," 352). Both the verb and the noun occur in Plutarch; the latter of uncovering the body, of waters, and of an error. The religious sense, however, is unknown to heathenism. </p>
<p>The following words should be compared with this : jOptasia a vision (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:22">Luke 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:19">Acts 26:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:1">2 Corinthians 12:1</span>). Orama a vision (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:9">Matthew 17:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:10">Acts 9:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:9">Acts 16:9</span>). Orasiv a vision (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+9:17">Revelation 9:17</span>. Of visible form, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+4:3">Revelation 4:3</span>). These three cannot be accurately distinguished. They all denote the thing seen or shown, without anything to show whether it is understood or not. </p>
<p>As distinguished from these, ajpokaluyiv includes, along with the thing shown or seen, its interpretation or unveiling. </p>
<p>Epifaneia appearing (hence our epiphany), is used in profane Greek of the appearance of a higher power in order to aid men. In the New Testament by Paul only, and always of the second appearing of Christ in glory, except in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:10">2 Timothy 1:10</span>, where it signifies His first appearing in the flesh. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:14">1 Timothy 6:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span>. As distinguished from this, ajpolaluyiv is the more comprehensive word. An apocalypse may include several ejpifaneiai appearings. The appearings are the media of the revealings. </p>
<p>Fanerwsiv manifestation; only twice in the New Testament; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:7">1 Corinthians 12:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:2">2 Corinthians 4:2</span>. The kindred verb fanerow to make manifest, is of frequent occurrence. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:1">John 21:1</span>. It is not easy, if possible, to show that this word has a less dignified sense than ajpokaluyiv. The verb fanerow is used of both the first and the second appearing of our Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2">1 John 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:4">Colossians 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span>). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:50">John 21:50</span>. Some distinguish between fanerwsiv as an external manifestation, to the senses, but single and isolated; while ajpokaluyiv is an inward and abiding disclosure. According to these, the Apocalypse or unveiling, precedes and produces the fanerwsiv or manifestation. The Apocalypse contemplates the thing revealed; the manifestation, the persons to whom it is revealed. </p>
<p>The Revelation here is the unveiling of the divine mysteries. </p>
<p>Of Jesus Christ. Not the manifestation or disclosure of Jesus Christ, but the revelation given by Him. </p>
<p>To shew [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειξαι] </span></span>. Frequent in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1">Revelation 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1">Revelation 22:1</span>). Construe with edwken gave : gave him to shew. Compare "I will give him to sit" (chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21">Revelation 3:21</span>) : "It was given to hurt" (chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+7:2">Revelation 7:2</span>) : "It was given him to do;" (A. 5 "had power to do;" chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span>). </p>
<p>Servants [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλοις] </span></span>. Properly, bond - servants. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:26">Matthew 20:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:35">Mark 9:35</span>. </p>
<p>Must [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δει] </span></span>. As the decree of the absolute and infallible God. </p>
<p>Shortly come to pass [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεσθαι εν ταχει] </span></span>. For the phrase ejn tacei shortly, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:8">Luke 18:8</span>, where yet long delay is implied. Expressions like this must be understood, not according to human measurement of time, but rather as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:8">2 Peter 3:8</span>. The idea is, before long, as time is computed by God. The aorist infinitive genesqai is not begin to come to pass, but denotes a complete fulfilment : must shortly come to pass in their entirety. He sent [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστειλας] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:2">Matthew 10:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:16">Matthew 10:16</span>. </p>
<p>Signified [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσημανεν] </span></span>. From shma a sign. Hence, literally, give a sign or token. The verb occurs outside of John's writings only in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:27">Acts 25:27</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:33">John 12:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:32">John 18:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:19">John 21:19</span>. This is its only occurrence in Revelation. The word is appropriate to the symbolic character of the revelation, and so in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:33">John 12:33</span>, where Christ predicts the mode of His death in a figure. Compare sign, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+12:1">Revelation 12:1</span>. </p>
<p>Angel [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγελου] </span></span>. Strictly, a messenger. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:10">Matthew 11:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:24">Luke 8:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:52">Luke 9:52</span>. Compare the mediating angel in the visions of Daniel and Zechariah (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+8:15">Daniel 8:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+8:16">Daniel 8:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+9:21">Daniel 9:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+10:10">Daniel 10:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+1:19">Zechariah 1:19</span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:51">John 1:51</span>. Servant. Designating the prophetic office. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:5">Isaiah 59:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="am+3:7">Amos 3:7</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+22:9">Revelation 22:9</span>. </p>
<p>John. John does not name himself in the Gospel or in the Epistles. Here "we are dealing with prophecy, and prophecy requires the guarantee of the individual who is inspired to utter it" (Milligan). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+8:1">Daniel 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+9:2">Daniel 9:2</span>.</p>
