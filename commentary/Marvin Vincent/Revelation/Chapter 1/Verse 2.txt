<p>Bare record [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμαρτυρησεν] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:7">John 1:7</span>. Rev., bear witness. The reference is to the present book and not to the Gospel. The aorist tense is the epistolary aorist. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:13">1 John 2:13</span>, and compare the introduction to Thucydides' "History :" " Thucydides, an Athenian, wrote [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυνεγραψε</span></span>] the history of the war, " etc.; placing himself at the reader's stand point, who will regard the writing as occurring in the past. </p>
<p>Word of God. Not the personal Word, but the prophetic contents of this book. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span>. </p>
<p>Testimony [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυριαν] </span></span>. For the phrase to witness a witness see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:32">John 4:32</span>. For the peculiar emphasis on the idea of witness in John, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:7">John 1:7</span>. The words and the ides are characteristic of Revelation as of the Gospel and Epistles. </p>
<p>And [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τε</span></span>] Omit. The clause all things that he saw is in apposition with the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, marking these as seen by him. Rev. adds even. </p>
<p>All things that he saw (osa eiden). Lit., as many things as he saw. In the Gospel John uses the word eiden saw, only twice of his own eye - witness (i. 40; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:8">Revelation 20:8</span>). In Apoc. it is constantly used of the seeing of visions. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+1:19">Revelation 1:19</span>. For the verb as denoting the immediate intuition of the seer, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:24">John 2:24</span>.</p>
