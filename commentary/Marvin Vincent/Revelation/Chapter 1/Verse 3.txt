<p>Blessed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακαριος] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span>. </p>
<p>He that readeth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αναγινωσκων] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:16">Luke 4:16</span>. The Reader in the Church. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:14">2 Corinthians 3:14</span>. They that hear, the congregation. The words imply a public, official reading, in full religious assembly for worship. The passage is of some weight in determining the date of this book. The stated reading of the Apostolical writings did not exist as a received form before the destruction of Jerusalem, A. D. 70. </p>
<p>And keep [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και τηρουντες] </span></span>. The absence of the article from thrountev keeping (compare oiJ ajkountev they that hear), shows that the hearers and the keepers form one class. Threin to keep, is a peculiarly Johannine word, and is characteristic of Revelation as of the other writings in its own peculiar sense of "keeping" in the exercise of active and strenuous care, rather than of watching over to preserve. See on reserved, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:4">1 Peter 1:4</span>. </p>
<p>Prophecy. See on prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:26">Luke 7:26</span>. </p>
