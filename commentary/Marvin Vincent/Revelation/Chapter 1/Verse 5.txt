<p>Jesus Christ. The Son. Placed after the Spirit because what is to follow in verses 5 - 8 relates to Him. This is according to John's manner of arranging his thoughts so that a new sentence shall spring out of the final thought of the preceding sentence. Compare the Prologue of the Gospel, and verses 1, 2, of this chapter. </p>
<p>The faithful witness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μαρτυς ο πιστος] </span></span>. For the phraseology see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:9">1 John 4:9</span>. For witness, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:7">John 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:1">1 Peter 5:1</span>. As applied to the Messiah, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:37">Psalms 89:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:4">Isaiah 55:4</span>. The construction again departs from the grammatical rule. The words witness, first - born, ruler, are in the nominative case, instead of being in the genitive, in apposition with Jesus Christ. This construction, though irregular, nevertheless gives dignity and emphasis to these titles of the Lord. See on verse 4. The word pistov, faithful is used (1), of one who shows Himself faithful in the discharge of a duty or the administration of a trust (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:45">Matthew 24:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:42">Luke 12:42</span>). Hence, trustworthy (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:25">1 Corinthians 7:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:2">2 Timothy 2:2</span>). Of things that can be relied upon (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:1">1 Timothy 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:11">2 Timothy 2:11</span>). (2), Confiding; trusting; a believer (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:9">Galatians 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:15">2 Corinthians 6:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:16">1 Timothy 5:16</span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:9">1 John 1:9</span>. The word is combined with ajlhqinov, true, genuine in chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+19:11">Revelation 19:11</span>; 215; 22 6. Richard of St. Victor (cited by Trench) says : "A faithful witness, because He gave faithful testimony concerning all things which were to be testified to by Him in the world. A faithful witness, because whatever He heard from the Father, He faithfully made known to His disciples. A faithful witness, because He taught the way of God in truth, neither did He care for any one nor regard the person of men. A faithful witness, because He announced condemnation to the reprobate and salvation to the elect. A faithful witness, because He confirmed by miracles the truth which He taught in words. A faithful witness, because He denied not, even in death, the Father 's testimony to Himself. A faithful witness, because He will give testimony in the day of judgment concerning the works of the good and of the evil." </p>
<p>The first - begotten of the dead [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πρωτοτοκος εκ των νεκρων] </span></span>. Rev., the first - born. The best texts omit ejk from. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>. The risen Christ regarded in His relation to the dead in Christ. He was not the first who rose from the dead, but the first who so rose that death was thenceforth impossible for Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:9">Romans 6:9</span>); rose with that resurrection - life in which He will finally bring with Him those who sleep in Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:14">1 Thessalonians 4:14</span>). Some interpreters, rendering first - born, find in the phrase the metaphor of death as the womb which bare Him (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:24">Acts 2:24</span>). Others, holding by the rendering first - begotten, connect the passage with <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span>, which by Paul is connected with the resurrection of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:32">Acts 13:32</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:33">Acts 13:33</span>). Paul also says that Jesus "was declared to be the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>). The verb tiktw which is one of the components of prwtotokov first - begotten or born, is everywhere in the New Testament used in the sense of to bear or to bring forth, and has nowhere the meaning beget, unless <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:15">James 1:15</span> be an exception, on which see note. In classical Greek the meaning beget is common. </p>
<p>The Ruler of the kings of the earth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αρχων των βασιλεων της γης] </span></span>. Through resurrection He passes to glory and dominion (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9">Philippians 2:9</span>). The comparison with the kings of the earth is suggested by <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:2">Psalms 2:2</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:27">Psalms 89:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:15">Isaiah 52:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:16">1 Timothy 6:16</span>; and see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+6:15">Revelation 6:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+17:4">Revelation 17:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+19:16">Revelation 19:16</span>. </p>
<p>Unto Him that loved [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω αγαπησαντι] </span></span>. The true reading is ajgapwnti that loveth. So Rev. Christ 's love is ever present See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span>. Washed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λουσαντι] </span></span>. Read lusanti loosed. Trench remarks on the variation of readings as having grown out of a play on the words loutron, a bathing, and lutron a ransom, both of which express the central benefits which redound to us through the sacrifice and death of Christ. He refers to this play upon words as involved in the etymology of the name Apollo as given by Plato; viz., the washer [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο απολουων</span></span>] and the absolver [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο απολυων</span></span>] from all impurities. Either reading falls in with a beautiful circle of imagery. If washed, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:2">Psalms 51:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:16">Isaiah 1:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:18">Isaiah 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:25">Ezekiel 36:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:16">Acts 22:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:26">Ephesians 5:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5">Titus 3:5</span>. If loosed, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:6">1 Timothy 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18">1 Peter 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:5">Galatians 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+14:3">Revelation 14:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+14:4">Revelation 14:4</span>.</p>
