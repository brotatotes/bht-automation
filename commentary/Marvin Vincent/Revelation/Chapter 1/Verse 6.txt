<p>Kings [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλεις] </span></span>. The correct reading is, basileian a kingdom. The term King is never applied in the New Testament to individual Christians. The reigning of the saints is emphasized in this book. See chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+5:10">Revelation 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:6">Revelation 20:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+22:5">Revelation 22:5</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+7:18">Daniel 7:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+7:22">Daniel 7:22</span>. </p>
<p>Priests [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερεις] </span></span>. Kingdom describes the body of the redeemed collectively. Priests indicates their individual position. Peter observes the same distinction (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>) in the phrases living stones (individuals) and a spiritual house (the body collectively), and combines both kings and priests in another collective term, royal priesthood (verse 9). The priesthood of believers grows out of the priesthood of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+60:4">Psalms 60:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+6:13">Zechariah 6:13</span>; Hebrews 7 - 10). This dignity was promised to Israel on the condition of obedience and fidelity to God. "Ye shall be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:6">Exodus 19:6</span>). In the kingdom of Christ each individual is a priest. The priest 's work is not limited to any order of the ministry. All may offer the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving : all have direct access to the holiest through the blood of Jesus : all Christians, as priests, are to minister to one another and to plead for one another. The consummation of this ideal appears in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:22">Revelation 21:22</span>, where the heavenly Jerusalem is represented as without temple. It is all temple. "It is the abolition of the distinction between holy and profane (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:20">Zechariah 14:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:21">Zechariah 14:21</span>) - nearer and more remote from God - through all being henceforth holy, all being brought to the nearest whereof it is capable, to Him" (Trench). </p>
<p>Unto God and His Father [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω θεω και πατρι αυτου] </span></span>. Lit., to the God and Father of Him. Hence Rev., correctly, His God and Father. For the phrase compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:6">Romans 14:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:3">2 Corinthians 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span>. </p>
<p>Glory and dominion [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η δοξα και το κρατος] </span></span>. Rev., correctly, rendering the two articles, "the glory and the dominion." The articles express universality : all glory; that which everywhere and under every form represents glory and dominion. The verb be (the glory) is not in the text. We may render either as an ascription, be, or as a confession, is. The glory is His. Doxa glory means originally opinion or judgment. In this sense it is not used in Scripture. In the sacred writers always of a good or favorable opinion, and hence praise, honor, glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:10">Luke 14:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:3">Hebrews 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span>). Applied to physical objects, as light, the heavenly bodies (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:11">Acts 22:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:40">1 Corinthians 14:40</span>). The visible brightness in manifestations of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:9">Luke 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:55">Acts 7:55</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:32">Luke 9:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7">2 Corinthians 3:7</span>). Magnificence, dignity (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:8">Matthew 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:6">Luke 4:6</span>). Divine majesty or perfect excellence, especially in doxologies, either of God or Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:11">1 Peter 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:25">Jude 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+4:9">Revelation 4:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+4:11">Revelation 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:27">Matthew 16:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:37">Mark 10:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:38">Mark 8:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:26">Luke 9:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>). The glory or majesty of divine grace (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:6">Ephesians 1:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:12">Ephesians 1:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:11">1 Timothy 1:11</span>). The majesty of angels (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:26">Luke 9:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:8">Jude 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:10">2 Peter 2:10</span>). The glorious condition of Christ after accomplishing His earthly work, and of the redeemed who share His eternal glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:26">Luke 24:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:18">Romans 8:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21">Romans 8:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:23">Romans 9:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:17">2 Corinthians 4:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:27">Colossians 1:27</span>). </p>
<p>Trench remarks upon the prominence of the doxological element in the highest worship of the Church as contrasted with the very subordinate place which it often occupies in ours. "We can perhaps make our requests known unto God, and this is well, for it is prayer; but to give glory to God, quite apart from anything to be directly gotten by ourselves in return, this is better, for it is adoration." Dr. John Brown in his Memoir of his father, one of the very finest biographical sketches in English literature, records a formula used by him in closing his prayers on specially solemn occasions : "And now unto Thee, O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the one Jehovah and our God, we would - as is most meet - with the Church on earth and the Church in heaven, ascribe all honor and glory, dominion and majesty, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end, Amen" (" Horae Subsecivae "). Compare the doxologies in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:11">1 Peter 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:5">Galatians 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+4:9">Revelation 4:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+4:11">Revelation 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+5:13">Revelation 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+7:12">Revelation 7:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:25">Jude 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ch+29:11">1 Chronicles 29:11</span>. </p>
<p>Forever and ever [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τους αιωνας των αιωνων] </span></span>. Lit., unto the ages of the ages. For the phrase compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:5">Galatians 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:21">Hebrews 13:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:11">1 Peter 4:11</span>. It occurs twelve times in Revelation, but not in John's Gospel or Epistles. It is the formula of eternity. </p>
<p>Amen [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμην] </span></span>. The English word is a transcription of the Greek and of the Hebrew. A verbal adjective, meaning firm, faithful. Hence oJ ajmhn, the Amen, applied to Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>). It passes into an adverbial sense by which something is asserted or confirmed. Thus often used by Christ, verily. John alone uses the double affirmation, verily, verily. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:51">John 1:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1">John 10:1</span>.</p>
