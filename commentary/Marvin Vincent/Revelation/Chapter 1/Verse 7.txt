He cometh with clouds [ερχεται μετα των νεφελων] . The clouds are frequently used in the descriptions of the Lord 's second coming. See Daniel 7:13; Matthew 24:30; Matthew 26:64; Mark 14:62. Compare the manifestation of God in the clouds at Sinai, in the cloudy pillar, the Shekinah, at the transfiguration, and see Psalms 97:2; Psalms 18:11; Nahum 1:3; Isaiah 19:1. Shall see [οψεται] . The verb denotes the physical act, but emphasizes the mental discernment accompanying it, and points to the result rather than to the act of vision. See on John 1:18. Appropriate here as indicating the quickened spiritual discernment engendered by the Lord 's appearing, in those who have rejected Him, and who now mourn for their folly and sin. They which [οιτινες] . The compound relative describes a class. See on Matthew 13:52; Matthew 21:41; Mark 12:18. Pierced [εξεκεντησαν] . See on John 19:34, and compare Zechariah 12:10; John 19:36. The expression here refers not to the Jews only, but to all who reject the Son of Man; those who "in any age have identified themselves with the Spirit of the Savior 's murderers" (Milligan). The passage is justly cited as a strong evidence that the author of the Gospel is also the author of Revelation. Kindreds [φυλαι] . More correctly, tribes. The word used of the true Israel in chapter Revelation 5:5; Revelation 7:4-8; Revelation 21:12. As the tribes of Israel are the figure by which the people of God, Jew or Gentile, are represented, so unbelievers are here represented as tribes, "the mocking counterpart of the true Israel of God." Compare Matthew 24:30, Matthew 24:31. Shall wail because of Him [κοψονται επ αυτον] . Rev., better, shall mourn over Him. Lit., shall beat their breasts. See on Matthew 11:17.
