<p>He cometh with clouds [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχεται μετα των νεφελων] </span></span>. The clouds are frequently used in the descriptions of the Lord 's second coming. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:64">Matthew 26:64</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:62">Mark 14:62</span>. Compare the manifestation of God in the clouds at Sinai, in the cloudy pillar, the Shekinah, at the transfiguration, and see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+97:2">Psalms 97:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:11">Psalms 18:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="na+1:3">Nahum 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+19:1">Isaiah 19:1</span>. </p>
<p>Shall see [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψεται] </span></span>. The verb denotes the physical act, but emphasizes the mental discernment accompanying it, and points to the result rather than to the act of vision. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>. Appropriate here as indicating the quickened spiritual discernment engendered by the Lord 's appearing, in those who have rejected Him, and who now mourn for their folly and sin. </p>
<p>They which [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιτινες] </span></span>. The compound relative describes a class. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:52">Matthew 13:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:41">Matthew 21:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:18">Mark 12:18</span>. </p>
<p>Pierced [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεκεντησαν] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:34">John 19:34</span>, and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="zec+12:10">Zechariah 12:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:36">John 19:36</span>. The expression here refers not to the Jews only, but to all who reject the Son of Man; those who "in any age have identified themselves with the Spirit of the Savior 's murderers" (Milligan). The passage is justly cited as a strong evidence that the author of the Gospel is also the author of Revelation. </p>
<p>Kindreds [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλαι] </span></span>. More correctly, tribes. The word used of the true Israel in chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+5:5">Revelation 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+7:4-8">Revelation 7:4-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:12">Revelation 21:12</span>. As the tribes of Israel are the figure by which the people of God, Jew or Gentile, are represented, so unbelievers are here represented as tribes, "the mocking counterpart of the true Israel of God." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>. </p>
<p>Shall wail because of Him [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοψονται επ αυτον] </span></span>. Rev., better, shall mourn over Him. Lit., shall beat their breasts. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:17">Matthew 11:17</span>.</p>
