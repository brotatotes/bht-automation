<p>Cried [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκραξεν] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:5">Mark 5:5</span>. </p>
<p>As when. The when of A. V. is unnecessary. </p>
<p>Roareth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυκαται] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. Peter uses wjruomai for the voice of the lion. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:8">1 Peter 5:8</span>. The verb here is originally applied to the lowing of cattle, expressing the sound, moo - ka - omai. Both Aristophanes and Theocritus use it of the roar of the lion, and the former of thunder. Homer, of the ring of the shield and the hissing of meat on the spit. </p>
<p>Seven thunders. The Jews were accustomed to speak of thunder as "the seven voices." Compare the sevenfold "voice of the Lord," <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+29:0">Psalms 29:0</span>. As usual, interpretation has run wild as to the seven thunders. As a few illustrations may be cited : Vitringa, the seven crusades; Daubuz, the seven kingdoms which received the Reformation; Elliott, the bull fulminated against Luther from the seven - hilled city, etc.</p>
