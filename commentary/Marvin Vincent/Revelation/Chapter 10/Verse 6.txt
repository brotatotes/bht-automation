<p>Swear by [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωμοσεν εν] </span></span>. Lit., "swear in," a Hebrew idiom. </p>
<p>Should be time no longer [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρονος ουκ εσται επι] </span></span>. Rev., correctly, shall be, etc. The meaning is not, as popularly understood, that time shall cease to exist, but that there shall be no more delay (so Rev., in margin) before the fulfillment of the divine purposes respecting the Church on earth. Possibly with allusion to the cry how long (ch. 6 10).</p>
