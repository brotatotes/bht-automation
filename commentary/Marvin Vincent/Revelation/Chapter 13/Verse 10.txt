<p>He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ει τις αιχμαλωσιαν συναγει, εις αιχμαλωσιαν υπαγει] </span></span>. Lit., if any one assemble captivity (i. e., bring together captives) into captivity he goeth away. The best texts insert eijv into before the first captivity, and omit assemble, thus reading if any man is for captivity into captivity he goeth. So Rev. See on dispersion, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:35">John 7:35</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+14:2">Jeremiah 14:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+43:11">Jeremiah 43:11</span>. The persecutors of the Church shall suffer that which they inflict on the saints. </p>
<p>Sword [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαχαιρη] </span></span>. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+6:4">Revelation 6:4</span>. </p>
<p>Here. In the thought that God judgeth in the earth.</p>
