<p>An image to the beast [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εικονα τω θηριω] </span></span>. Eijkwn is a figure or likeness. thus <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:20">Matthew 22:20</span>, of the likeness of Caesar on the coin. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:24">Romans 1:24</span>, an image of men, birds, beasts, etc. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:10">Colossians 3:10</span>, "the image of Him that created him;" i e., the moral likeness of renewed men to God. Christ is called the image of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>). Besides the idea of likeness, the word involves the idea of representation, though not of perfect representation. Thus, man is said to be the image of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:7">1 Corinthians 11:7</span>). In this it resembles carakthr image in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>. Caesar's image on the coin, the reflection of the sun in the water (Plato, "Phaedo," 99); and the statue or image of the beast in this passage, are eijkwn. </p>
<p>The word also involves the idea of manifestation. Thus, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>, where, in the image there is an implied contrast with the invisible God. Hence Philo applied the term to the Logos. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>. </p>
<p>The word played an important part in the Arian controversy, in which the distinction was sharply emphasized between eijkwn image as assuming a prototype, and therefore as properly representing the relation of the Son to the Father, and oJmoiwma likeness, as implying mere similitude, and not embodying the essential verity of the prototype. The image involves the likeness, but the likeness does not involve the image. The latter may imply only an accidental resemblance, while the former is a veritable representation. Christ is therefore the eijkwn of God. </p>
<p>The image of the beast occurs ten times in Revelation; four times in this chapter, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+14:9">Revelation 14:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+14:11">Revelation 14:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+14:2">Revelation 14:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+16:2">Revelation 16:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>.</p>
