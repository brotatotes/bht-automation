<p>A leopard [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρδαλει] </span></span>. The ancients do not seem to have distinguished between the leopard, the panther, and the ounce. The word stands for either. Leopard is leo - pard, the lion - pard, which was supposed to be a mongrel between a panther and a lioness.
