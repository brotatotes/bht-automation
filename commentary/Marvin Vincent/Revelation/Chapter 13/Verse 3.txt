<p>I saw [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδον] </span></span>. Omitted in the best texts. </p>
<p>Wounded [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφαγμενην] </span></span>. Lit., slain. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>. The Rev. smitten is questionable. The word occurs eight times in Revelation, and in seven of these it must be rendered slain or slaughtered. Professor Milligan rightly observes that the statement is the counterpart of that in ver. 6, where we read of the lamb as though it had been slaughtered. In both cases there had been actual death, and in both revival. The one is a mocking counterpart of the other. </p>
<p>Deadly wound [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληγη του θανατου] </span></span>. Lit., stroke of death. Rev., death - stroke. </p>
<p>After the beast [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπισω του θηριου] </span></span>. A pregnant construction for wondered at and followed after.</p>
