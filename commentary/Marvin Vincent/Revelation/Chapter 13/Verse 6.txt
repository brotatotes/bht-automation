<p>In blasphemy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις βλασφημιαν] </span></span>. Read blasfhmiav blasphemies. Rev., giving the force of eijv more correctly, "for blasphemies." And them that dwell in heaven [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και τους εν τω ουρανω σκηνουντας] </span></span>. The best texts omit kai and, making the following words in apposition with onoma and skhnhn name and tabernacle. Thus the literal sense would be to blaspheme the name and tabernacle which dwell in heaven. "The meaning is to enhance the enormity of the blasphemy by bringing out the lofty nature of God 's holy name and dwelling - place" (Alford). The word dwell is, literally, tabernacle. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+12:12">Revelation 12:12</span>.</p>
