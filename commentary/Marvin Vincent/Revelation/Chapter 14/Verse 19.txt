<p>The great wine - press [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ληον τον μεγαν] </span></span>. The Greek student will note the masculine adjective with the feminine noun, possibly because the gender of the noun is doubtful. The Rev., in rendering more literally, is more forcible : the wine - press, the great wine - press. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:33">Matthew 21:33</span>.</p>
