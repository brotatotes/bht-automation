<p>And I heard the voice of harpers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και φωνην ηκουσα κιθαρωδων] </span></span>. The correct reading is, kai hJ fwnh hn hkousa wJv kiqarwdwn and the voice which I heard (was) as (the voice) of harpers. Kiqarwdov is from kiqara a harp (see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+5:8">Revelation 5:8</span>) and wjdov a singer. Properly, one who sings, accompanying himself on the harp.</p>
