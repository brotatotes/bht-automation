And I heard the voice of harpers [και φωνην ηκουσα κιθαρωδων] . The correct reading is, kai hJ fwnh hn hkousa wJv kiqarwdwn and the voice which I heard (was) as (the voice) of harpers. Kiqarwdov is from kiqara a harp (see on ch. Revelation 5:8) and wjdov a singer. Properly, one who sings, accompanying himself on the harp.
