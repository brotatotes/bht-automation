"Bounded as it is by the hills of Palestine on both north and south, it would naturally become the arena of war between the lowlanders who trusted in their chariots, and the Israelite highlanders of the neighboring heights. To this cause mainly it owes its celebrity, as the battle - field of the world, which has, through its adoption into the language of Revelation, passed into an universal proverb. If that mysterious book proceeded from the hand of a Galilean fisherman, it is the more easy to understand why, with the scene of those many battles constantly before him, he should have drawn the figurative name of the final conflict between the hosts of good and evil, from the 'place which is called in the Hebrew tongue Harmagedon'" (Stanley, " Sinai and Palestine "). </p>
<p>Megiddo was in the plain of Esdraelon, "which has been a chosen place for encampment in every contest carried on in Palestine from the days of Nabuchodonozor king of Assyria, unto the disastrous march of Napoleon Buonaparte from Egypt into Syria. Jews, Gentiles, Saracens, Christian crusaders, and anti Christian Frenchmen; Egyptians, Persians, Druses, Turks, and Arabs, warriors of every nation that is under heaven, have pitched their tents on the plain of Esdraelon, and have beheld the banners of their nation wet with the dews of Tabor and Hermon" (" Clarke's Travels, "cit. by Lee). See Thomson's" Land and Book "(Central Palestine and Phoenicia), p. 208 sqq.; and Stanley," Sinai and Palestine, "ch. 9 Two great slaughters at Megiddo are mentioned in the Old Testament; the first celebrated in the Song of Deborah (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:5">Jude 1:5</span>:19), and the second, that in which king Josiah fell (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ki+23:29">2 Kings 23:29</span>). Both these may have been present to the seer's mind; but the allusion is not to any particular place or event." The word, like Euphrates, is the expression of an idea; the idea that swift and overwhelming destruction shall overtake all who gather themselves together against the Lord " (Milligan).</p>
