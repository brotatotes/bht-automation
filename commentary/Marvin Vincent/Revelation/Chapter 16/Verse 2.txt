And the first went. Each angel, as his turn comes, with draws (uJpagete, see on John 6:21; John 8:21) from the heavenly scene. There fell [εγενετο] . Lit., there came to pass. Rev., it became. Elliott, very aptly, there broke out. Noisome and grievous [κακον και πονηρον] . Similarly the two cognate nouns kakia and ponria malice and wickedness occur together in 1 Corinthians 5:8. Ponhrov emphasizes the activity of evil. See on Luke 3:19. Sore [ελκος] . See on Luke 16:20. Compare the sixth Egyptian plague, Exodus 9:8-12, where the Septuagint uses this word elkov boil. Also of the boil or scab of leprosy, Leviticus 13:18; king Hezekiah 's boil, 2 Kings 20:7; the botch of Egypt, Deuteronomy 28:27, Deuteronomy 28:35. In Job 2:7 (Sept.) the boils are described as here by ponhrov sore.
