<p>Hail. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+9:18">Exodus 9:18</span>. </p>
<p>Every stone about the weight of a talent [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ταλαντιαια] </span></span>. The adjective, meaning of a talent 's weight, agrees with hail; hail of a talent 's weight; i e., having each stone of that weight. Every stone is therefore explanatory, and not in the text. Hailstones are a symbol of divine wrath. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+30:30">Isaiah 30:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+13:11">Ezekiel 13:11</span>.
