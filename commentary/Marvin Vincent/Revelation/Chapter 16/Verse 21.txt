Hail. See Exodus 9:18. Every stone about the weight of a talent [ως ταλαντιαια] . The adjective, meaning of a talent 's weight, agrees with hail; hail of a talent 's weight; i e., having each stone of that weight. Every stone is therefore explanatory, and not in the text. Hailstones are a symbol of divine wrath. See Isaiah 30:30; Ezekiel 13:11. Compare Joshua 10:11.
