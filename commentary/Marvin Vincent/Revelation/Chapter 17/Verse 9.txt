<p>Here is [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωδε] </span></span>. Bespeaking attention and spiritual discernment for that which follows. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+13:18">Revelation 13:18</span>. </p>
<p>The mind [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο νους] </span></span>. </p>
<p>Nouv is the organ of mental perception and apprehension - of conscious life, the mind, comprising the faculties of perceiving and understanding, of feeling, judging, determining. </p>
<p>(a) The intellectual faculty or understanding (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:45">Luke 24:45</span>). So here, according to some. </p>
<p>(b) The reason, regarded as the faculty of perceiving divine things : of recognizing goodness and hating evil (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:28">Romans 1:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17">Ephesians 4:17</span>). </p>
<p>(c) The power of calm and impartial judgment (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span> )2_Nouv is a particular mode of thinking and judging : moral consciousness as a habit of mind or opinion. Hence thoughts, feelings, purposes (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:5">Romans 14:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:10">1 Corinthians 1:10</span>). Some render here meaning. </p>
<p>Seven mountains. Many interpreters regard this as conclusively defining the reference of the woman to Rome, which was built upon seven hills. Others deny the local reference, and understand the principle of worldly greatness and ambition. Others again claim that many cities besides Rome can boast of their seven hills, as Constantinople, Brussels, and especially Jerusalem. </p>
<p>Upon them. Redundant, the idea being already expressed by where. A Hebraism.</p>
