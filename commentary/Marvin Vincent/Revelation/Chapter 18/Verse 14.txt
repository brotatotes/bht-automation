<p>The fruits [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η οπωρα] </span></span>. Originally, the late summer or early autumn; then, generally, used of the ripe fruits of trees. Only here in the New Testament. Compare the compound fqinopwrina autumn (trees). See on whose fruit withereth, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:12">Jude 1:12</span>, and compare Summer - fruits, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+40:10">Jeremiah 40:10</span>. </p>
<p>That thy soul lusted after [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της επιθυμιας της ψυχης σου] </span></span>. Lit., of the desire of thy soul. </p>
<p>Dainty [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιπαρα] </span></span>. From lipov grease. Hence, literally, fat. Only here in the New Testament. Homer uses it once in the sense of oily or shiny with oil, as the skin anointed after a bath. "Their heads and their fair faces shining" (" Odyssey, "14, 332). So Aristophanes (" Plutus," 616), and of oily, unctuous dishes (" Frogs, "163). Of the oily smoothness of a calm sea, as by Theocritus. The phrase liparoi podev shining feet, i e., smooth, without wrinkle, is frequent in Homer. Thus, of Agamemnon rising from his bed." Beneath his shining feet he bound the fair sandals "(" Iliad," 2, 44). Also of the condition of life; rich, comfortable : so Homer, of a prosperous old age, "Odyssey," 11, 136. Of things, bright, fresh. Of soil, fruitful. The city of Athens was called liparai, a favorite epithet. Aristophanes plays upon the two senses bright and greasy, saying that if any one flatteringly calls Athens bright, he attaches to it the honor of sardines - oiliness (" Acharnians, " 638, 9). </p>
<p>Goodly [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμπρα] </span></span>. A too indefinite rendering. Better, Rev., sumptuous.
