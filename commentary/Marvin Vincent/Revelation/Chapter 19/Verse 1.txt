<p>Hallelujah [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλληλουια] </span></span>. Hebrew. Praise ye the Lord. Only in Revelation and in this chapter. Fifteen of the Psalms either begin or end with this word. The Jewish anthem of praise (Psalm 104 - 109), sung chiefly at the feasts of the Passover and of Tabernacles, derived its title of the Great Hallel from the frequent use of that phrase. </p>
<p>Honor. Omit. On the doxologies in Revelation, see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+1:6">Revelation 1:6</span>.</p>
