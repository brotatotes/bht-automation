Hallelujah [αλληλουια] . Hebrew. Praise ye the Lord. Only in Revelation and in this chapter. Fifteen of the Psalms either begin or end with this word. The Jewish anthem of praise (Psalm 104 - 109), sung chiefly at the feasts of the Passover and of Tabernacles, derived its title of the Great Hallel from the frequent use of that phrase. Honor. Omit. On the doxologies in Revelation, see on ch. Revelation 1:6.
