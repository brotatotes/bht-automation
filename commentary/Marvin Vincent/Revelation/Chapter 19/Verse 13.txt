Dipped [βεβαμμενον] . The readings differ; some giving rJerantismenon sprinkled, others perirerammenon sprinkled round. Rev., sprinkled. Compare Isaiah 63:2, Isaiah 63:3. The Word of God [ο λογος του θεου] . This name for our Lord is found in the New Testament only in the writings of John. It is one of the links which connects Revelation with John's other writings. Compare John 1:1-14; 1 John 1:1. Some object to this on the ground that, in the Gospel of John, the term is used absolutely, the Word, whereas here it is qualified, the Word of God, which the Evangelist nowhere employs, and in 1 John 1:1, the Word of life. But, as Alford observes : "It may be left to any fair - judging reader to decide whether it be not a far greater argument for identity that the remarkable designation oJ Logov the Word is used, than for diversity, that, on the solemn occasion described in the Apocalypse, the hitherto unheard adjunct of God is added." The idea of God which is represented here, underlies the absolute term the Word in John 1:1. It is further urged that in the Gospel oJ Logov is applied to the prehistoric Christ, while in this passage it is applied to the historic Christ. But the Dame of the historic Christ is that referred to in ver. 12, not in ver. 13. It is the name "which no one knoweth but He Himself," expressing the character of His whole redeeming work. The name in ver. 13 is that which belongs originally and essentially to Him.
