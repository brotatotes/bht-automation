On His thigh. Some explain, on the garment where it covers the thigh to which the sword is bound. Compare Psalms 45:3. Others, partly on the vesture, partly on the thigh itself, where, in an equestrian figure, the robe drops from the thigh. According to the former explanation kai and is to be taken as explanatory or definitive of the words on His vesture. Others again suppose a sword on the hilt of which the name is inscribed. Expositors refer to the custom of engraving the artist's name on the thigh of a statue. Thus Cicero says : "A most beautiful statue of Apollo, on the thigh of which the name of Myron had been graven in tiny letters of silver" (" Against Verres, "4, 43). Herodotus describes a figure of Sesostris, bearing across the breast from shoulder to shoulder the inscription written in the sacred character of Egypt :" With my own shoulders I conquered this land " (ii., 106). Rawlinson says that Assyrian figures are found with arrow - headed inscriptions engraved across them, and over the drapery as well as the body.
