Dwellest [κατοικεις] . See on Luke 11:26; Acts 2:5. Seat [θρονος] . Rev., rightly, throne, which is a transcript of the Greek word. Better than seat, because it is intended to represent Satan as exercising dominion there. The word is used in the New Testament of a kingly throne (Luke 1:32, Luke 1:52; Acts 2:30) : of the judicial tribunal or bench (Mt 29:28; Luke 22:30) : of the seats of the elders (Revelation 4:4; Revelation 11:16). Also, by metonymy, of one who exercises authority, so, in the plural, of angels (Colossians 1:16), thrones belonging to the highest grade of angelic beings whose place is in the immediate presence of God. Holdest fast [κρατεις] . See on Matthew 7:3; Acts 3:11. My name. See on 1 John 1:7. My faith. See on Acts 6:7. Antipas. There is no other record of this martyr.
