<p>To eat. Omit. </p>
<p>Of the hidden manna [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του μαννα του κεκρυμμενου] </span></span>. The allusion may be partly to the pot of manna which was laid up in the ark in the sanctuary. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:32-34">Exodus 16:32-34</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:4">Hebrews 9:4</span>. That the imagery of the ark was familiar to John appears from chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+11:19">Revelation 11:19</span>. This allusion however is indirect, for the manna laid up in the ark was not for food, but was a memorial of food once enjoyed. Two ideas seem to be combined in the figure : </p>
<p>1. Christ as the bread from heaven, the nourishment of the life of believers, the true manna, of which those who eat shall never die (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:31-43">John 6:31-43</span>; 48 - 51); hidden, in that He is withdrawn from sight, and the Christian 's life is hid with Him in God (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:3">Colossians 3:3</span>). 2. The satisfaction of the believer 's desire when Christ shall be revealed. The hidden manna shall not remain for ever hidden. We shall see Christ as He is, and be like Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>). Christ gives the manna in giving Himself "The seeing of Christ as He is, and, through this beatific vision, being made like to Him, is identical with the eating of the hidden manna, which shall, as it were, be then brought forth from the sanctuary, the holy of holies of God 's immediate presence where it was withdrawn from sight so long, that all may partake of it; the glory of Christ, now shrouded and concealed, being then revealed to His people" (Trench). </p>
<p>This is one of numerous illustrations of the dependence of Revelation upon Old Testament history and prophecy. "To such an extent is this the case," says Professor Milligan, "that it may be doubted whether it contains a single figure not drawn from the Old Testament, or a single complete sentence not more or less built up of materials brought from the same source." See, for instance, Balaam (ii. 14); Jezebel (ii. 20); Michael (xii. 7, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+10:13">Daniel 10:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1">Daniel 12:1</span>); Abaddon (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+9:11">Revelation 9:11</span>); Jerusalem, Mt. Zion, Babylon, the Euphrates, Sodom, Egypt (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+16:19">Revelation 16:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+9:14">Revelation 9:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+11:8">Revelation 11:8</span>); Gog and Magog (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:8">Revelation 20:8</span>, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+38:39">Ezekiel 38:39</span>.). Similarly, the tree of life, the sceptre of iron, the potter 's vessels, the morning - star (ii. 7, 17, 27, 28). Heaven is described under the figure of the tabernacle in the wilderness (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+11:1">Revelation 11:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+11:19">Revelation 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+8:3">Revelation 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+11:19">Revelation 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+4:6">Revelation 4:6</span>). The song of the redeemed is the song of Moses (xv. 3). The plagues of Egypt appear in the blood, fire, thunder, darkness and locusts (chapter 8). " The great earthquake of chapter 6. is taken from Haggai; the sun becoming black as sackcloth of hair and the moon becoming blood (chapter 8) from Joel : the stars of h </p>
