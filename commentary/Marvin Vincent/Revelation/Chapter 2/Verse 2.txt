Thy works [τα εργα σου] . See on John 4:47. Labor [κοπον] . Originally suffering, weariness; hence exhausting labor. The kindred verb kopiaw is often used of apostolic and ministerial labor (Romans 16:12; 1 Corinthians 14:10; Galatians 4:11). Patience [υπομονην] . See on 2 Peter 1:6; James 5:1. Compare Paul 's exhortation to Timothy in Ephesus, 2 Timothy 2:25, 2 Timothy 2:26. Bear [βαστασαι] . See on John 10:31; John 12:6. Compare Galatians 6:2, where the word is used of Christians bearing each others' burdens. Them which are evil [κακους] . Trench observes that "it is not a little remarkable that the grace or virtue here ascribed to the angel of the Ephesian Church (compare verse 6) should have a name in classical Greek : misoponhria hatred of evil; the person of whom the grace is predicated being misoponhrov hater of evil; while neither of these words, nor yet any equivalent to them occurs in the New Testament. It is the stranger, as this hatred of evil, purely as evil, however little thought of or admired now, is eminently a Christian grace." Hast tried [επειρασω] Rev., didst try. See on tried, 1 Peter 1:7; and compare 1 John 4:1; 1 Corinthians 12:10.
