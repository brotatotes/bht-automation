<p>Thy works [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα εργα σου] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:47">John 4:47</span>. </p>
<p>Labor [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπον] </span></span>. Originally suffering, weariness; hence exhausting labor. The kindred verb kopiaw is often used of apostolic and ministerial labor (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:12">Romans 16:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:10">1 Corinthians 14:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:11">Galatians 4:11</span>). </p>
<p>Patience [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπομονην] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:6">2 Peter 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:1">James 5:1</span>. Compare Paul 's exhortation to Timothy in Ephesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:25">2 Timothy 2:25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:26">2 Timothy 2:26</span>. </p>
<p>Bear [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαστασαι] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:31">John 10:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:6">John 12:6</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:2">Galatians 6:2</span>, where the word is used of Christians bearing each others' burdens. </p>
<p>Them which are evil [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακους] </span></span>. Trench observes that "it is not a little remarkable that the grace or virtue here ascribed to the angel of the Ephesian Church (compare verse 6) should have a name in classical Greek : misoponhria hatred of evil; the person of whom the grace is predicated being misoponhrov hater of evil; while neither of these words, nor yet any equivalent to them occurs in the New Testament. It is the stranger, as this hatred of evil, purely as evil, however little thought of or admired now, is eminently a Christian grace." </p>
<p>Hast tried [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επειρασω</span></span>] Rev., didst try. See on tried, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>; and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:10">1 Corinthians 12:10</span>.</p>
