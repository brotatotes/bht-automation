<p>Somewhat. Not in the text, and unnecessary. The following clause is the object of I have. "I have against thee that thou hast left," etc. "It is indeed a somewhat which the Lord has against the Ephesian Church; it threatens to grow to be an everything; for see the verse following" (Trench). For the phrase have against, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:23">Matthew 5:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:25">Mark 11:25</span>; Col. iii. : 13. </p>
<p>Hast left [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφηκας</span></span>] Rev., more correctly, rendering the aorist, didst leave. The verb originally means to send, away or dismiss. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:3">John 4:3</span>. First love. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span>. The first enthusiastic devotion of the Church to her Lord, under the figure of conjugal love.</p>
