<p>New [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινον] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:29">Matthew 26:29</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:17">Isaiah 65:17</span>. There was no more sea [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η θαλασσα ουκ εστιν επι] </span></span>. Lit., as Rev., the sea is no more. Here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:13">Revelation 20:13</span>. Some explain the sea as the ungodly world. I cannot help thinking this interpretation forced. According to this explanation, the passage is in the highest degree tautological. The first earth was passed away, and the ungodly world was no more.</p>
