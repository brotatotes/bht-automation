New [καινον] . See on Matthew 26:29. Compare Isaiah 65:17. There was no more sea [η θαλασσα ουκ εστιν επι] . Lit., as Rev., the sea is no more. Here as in Revelation 20:13. Some explain the sea as the ungodly world. I cannot help thinking this interpretation forced. According to this explanation, the passage is in the highest degree tautological. The first earth was passed away, and the ungodly world was no more.
