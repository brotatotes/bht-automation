Four square [τετραγωνος] . From tetra four and gwnia an angle. Only here in the New Testament. Compare Ezekiel 48:16, Ezekiel 48:20. Twelve - thousand furlongs [επι σταδιων δωδεκα χιλιαδων] . Strictly, to the length of [επι] twelve, etc. For the collective term ciliadev thousands, see on ch. Revelation 5:11. For furlongs see on ch. Revelation 14:20. The twelve - thousand furlongs would be 1378. 97 English miles. Interpretations vary hopelessly. The description seems to be that of a vast cube, which may have been suggested by the Holy of Holies of the tabernacle, which was of that shape. 83 But opinions differ as to whether the twelve thousand furlongs are the measure of the four sides of the city taken together, in which ease each side will measure three thousand furlongs; or whether the twelve - thousand furlongs are intended to represent the length of each side. The former explanation is prompted by the desire to reduce the vast dimensions of the city. Another difficulty is raised about the height. Dusterdieck, for example, maintains that the houses were three - thousand stadia in height. The question arises whether the vertical surface of the cube includes the hill or rock on which the city was placed, a view to which Alford inclines. These are enough to show how utterly futile are attempts to reduce these symbolic visions to mathematical statement. Professor Milligan aptly remarks : "Nor is it of the smallest moment to reduce the enormous dimensions spoken of. No reduction brings them within the bounds of verisimilitude; and no effort in that direction is required. The idea is alone to be thought of."
