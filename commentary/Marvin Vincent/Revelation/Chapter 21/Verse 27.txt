That defileth [κοινουν] . The participle. But the correct reading is the adjective koinon common, hence unhallowed. Rev., unclean. Worketh [ποιουν] . Lit,, maketh or doeth. "In this present life, I reckon that we make the nearest approach to knowledge when we have the least possible communion or fellowship with the body, and are not infected with the bodily nature, but remain pure until the hour when God himself is pleased to release us. And then the foolishness of the body will be cleared away, and we shall be pure and hold converse with other pure souls, and know of ourselves the clear light everywhere, which is no other than the light of truth. For no impure thing is allowed to approach the pure" (Plato, "Phaedo," 67).
