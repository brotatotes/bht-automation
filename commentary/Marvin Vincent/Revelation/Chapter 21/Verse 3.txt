<p>With men. Men at large. No longer with an isolated people like Israel. He shall dwell [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνωσει] </span></span>. Lit., tabernacle. Only in Revelation and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>. The word "denotes much more than the mere general notion of dwelling. There lies in it one of the particulars of that identification of Christ and His people which is fundamental to the seer." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:27">Ezekiel 37:27</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:28">Ezekiel 37:28</span>. </p>
<p>People [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαοι] </span></span>. Notice the plural, peoples (so Rev.), because many nations shall partake of the fulfillment of the promise. Compare ver. 24. And God Himself shall be with them and be their God. And be is inserted. The Greek is shall be with them their God.</p>
