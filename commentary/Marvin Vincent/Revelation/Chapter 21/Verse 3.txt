The word "denotes much more than the mere general notion of dwelling. There lies in it one of the particulars of that identification of Christ and His people which is fundamental to the seer." See on John 1:14. Compare Ezekiel 37:27, Ezekiel 37:28. People [λαοι] . Notice the plural, peoples (so Rev.), because many nations shall partake of the fulfillment of the promise. Compare ver. 24. And God Himself shall be with them and be their God. And be is inserted. The Greek is shall be with them their God.
