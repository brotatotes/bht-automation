And God shall wipe away. Omit God. Read, as Rev., and He shall wipe away. All tears [παν δακρυον] . Lit., every tear. Compare Isaiah 25:8. There shall be no more death [ο θανατος ουκ εσται ετι] . Render, as Rev., death shall be no more. Sorrow [πενθος] . Better, as Rev., mourning, since the word signifies manifested grief. See on Matthew 5:4; James 4:9. Compare Isaiah 65:19. "That soul I say," observes Socrates, "herself invisible, departs to the invisible world - to the divine and immortal and rational : thither arriving, she is secure of bliss, and is released from the error and folly of men, their fears and wild passions, and all other human ills, and forever dwells, as they say of the initiated, in company with the gods" (Plato, "Phaedo," 81). So Sophocles : "Sorrow touches not the dead." " Oedipus Coloneus, " 966 "How thrice happy those of mortals, who, having had these ends in view, depart to Hades; for to them alone is it given there to live; but to others, all things there are evil" (" Fragment "). And Euripides : "The dead, tearless, forgets his pains." " Troades, " 606
