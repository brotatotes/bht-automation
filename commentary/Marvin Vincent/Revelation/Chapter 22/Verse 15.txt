Dogs [οι κυνες] . The A. V. omits the article "the dogs." Compare Philippians 3:2. This was the term of reproach with which the Judaizers stigmatized the Gentiles as impure. In the Mosaic law the word is used to denounce the moral profligacies of heathen worship (Deuteronomy 23:18). Compare Matthew 14:26. Here the word is used of those whose moral impurity excludes them from the New Jerusalem. "As a term of reproach, the word on the lips of a Jew, signified chiefly impurity; of a Greek, impudence. The herds of dogs which prowl about Eastern cities, without a home and without an owner, feeding on the refuse and filth of the streets, quarreling among themselves, and attacking the passer - by, explain both applications of the image" (Lightfoot, on Philippians 3:2). Sorcerers. See on ch. Revelation 9:21, and compare ch. 21 8. Whoremongers [πορνοι] . Rev., better, fornicators. Maketh [ποιων] . Or doeth. Compare doeth the truth, John 3:21; 1 John 1:6.
