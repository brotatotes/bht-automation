I John saw [εγω ιωαννης ο βλεπων] . The A. V. overlooks the article with the participle - the one seeing. Hence Rev., correctly, I John am he that heard and saw. Had heard and seen [ηκουσα και εβλεψα] . Aorist tense. There is no need of rendering it as a pluperfect. Rev., rightly, I heard and saw. The appeal to hearing and seeing is common to all John's writings. See John 1:14; John 19:35; John 21:14; 1 John 1:1, 1 John 1:2; John 4:14.
