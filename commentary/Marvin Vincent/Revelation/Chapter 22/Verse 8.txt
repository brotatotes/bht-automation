<p>I John saw [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω ιωαννης ο βλεπων] </span></span>. The A. V. overlooks the article with the participle - the one seeing. Hence Rev., correctly, I John am he that heard and saw. </p>
<p>Had heard and seen [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσα και εβλεψα] </span></span>. Aorist tense. There is no need of rendering it as a pluperfect. Rev., rightly, I heard and saw. The appeal to hearing and seeing is common to all John's writings. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:35">John 19:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:14">John 21:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2">1 John 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:14">John 4:14</span>.</p>
