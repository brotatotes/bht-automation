<p>Behold. Omit. </p>
<p>That no one take thy crown [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μηδεις λαβη τον στεφανον] </span></span>. Take it away. The idea is not that of one believer stepping into the place which was designed for another, but of an enemy taking away from another the reward which he himself has forfeited. The expression is explained by <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>. It is related by Mahomet that, after having attempted, in vain, to convert one Abdallah to the faith, and having been told by him to go about his business and to preach only to those who should come to him - he went, downcast, to a friend 's house. His friend, perceiving that he was sad, asked him the reason; and on being told of Abdallah's insult, said, "Treat him gently; for I swear that when God sent thee to us, we had already strung pearls to crown him, and he seeth that thou hast snatched the kingdom out of his grasp." For crown, see on chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+2:10">Revelation 2:10</span>. Thy crown is not the crown which thou hast, but the crown which thou shalt have if thou shalt prove faithful.</p>
