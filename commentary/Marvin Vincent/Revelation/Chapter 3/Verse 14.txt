<p>Of the Laodiceans [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ααοδικεων] </span></span>. Read ejn Aaodikeia in Laodicea. Laodicea means justice of the people. As Laodice was a common name among the ladies of the royal house of the Seleucidae, the name was given to several cities in Syria and Asia Minor. The one here addressed was on the confines of Phrygia and Lydia, about forty miles east of Ephesus, and was known as Laodicea on the Lycus. It had born successively the names of Diospolis and Rhoas, and was named Laodicea when refounded by Antiochus Theos, B. C. 261 - 246. It was situated on a group of hills between two tributaries of the Lycus - the Asopus and the Caprus. Towards the end of the Roman Republic, and under the first emperors, it became one of the most important and flourishing cities of Asia Minor. One of its citizens, Hiero, bequeathed all his enormous property to the people, and adorned the city with costly gifts. It was the seat of large money transactions and of an extensive trade in wood. The citizens developed a taste for Greek art, and were distinguished in science and literature. Laodicea was the seat of a great medical school. During the Roman period it was the chief city of a Roman conventus or political district, in which courts were held by the proconsul of the province, and where the taxes from the subordinate towns were collected. Cicero held his court there, and many of his letters were written thence. The conventus represented by Laodicea comprised not less than twenty - five towns, and inscriptions refer to the city as "the metropolis." The Greek word dioikhdiv, corresponding to the Latin conventus was subsequently applied to an ecclesiastical district, and appears in diocese. The tutelary deity of the city was Zeus (Jupiter). Hence its earlier name, Diospolis, or City of Zeus. Many of its inhabitants were Jews. It was subject to frequent earthquakes, which eventually resulted in its abandonment. It is now a deserted place, but its ruins indicate by their magnitude its former importance. Among these are a racecourse, and three theatres, one of which is four hundred and fifty feet in diameter. An important church council was held there in the fourth century. </p>
<p>The Amen. Used only here as a proper name. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:16">Isaiah 65:16</span>, where the correct rendering is the God of the Amen, instead of A. V. God of truth. The term applied to the Lord signifies that He Himself is the fulfilment of all that God has spoken to the churches. </p>
<p>Faithful [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστος] </span></span>. The word occurs in the New Testament in two senses : trusty, faithful <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:45">Matthew 24:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:21">Matthew 25:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:23">Matthew 25:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:42">Luke 12:42</span>); and believing, confiding (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:27">John 20:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:9">Galatians 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span>). Of God, necessarily only in the former sense. </p>
<p>True [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθινος] </span></span>. See on verse 7. The veracity of Christ is thus asserted in the word faithful, true being not true as distinguished from false, but true to the normal idea of a witness. </p>
<p>The beginning [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αρχη] </span></span>. The beginner, or author; not as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>, the first and most excellent creature of God 's hands. </p>
<p>"The stress laid in the Epistle to the Colossians on the inferiority of those to whom the self - same name of ajrcai, beginnings principalities was given... to the One who was the true beginning, or, if we might venture on an unfamiliar use of a familiar word, the true Principality of God 's creation, may account for the prominence which the name had gained, and therefore for its use here in a message addressed to a church exposed, like that of Colossae, to the risks of angelolatry, of the substitution of lower principalities and created mediators for Him who was the Head over all things to His Church" (Plumptre).
