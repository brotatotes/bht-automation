Cold [ψυχρος] . Attached to the world and actively opposed to the Church. "This," as Alford remarks, "as well as the opposite state of spiritual fervor, would be an intelligible and plainly - marked condition; at all events free from the danger of mixed motive and disregarded principle which belongs to the lukewarm state : inasmuch as a man in earnest, be he right or wrong, is ever a better man than one professing what he does not feel." Hot [ζεστος] . From zew to boil or seethe. See on fervent, Acts 18:25.
