<p>I counsel [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμβουλευω] </span></span>. With a certain irony. Though He might command, yet He advises those who are, in their own estimation, supplied with everything. </p>
<p>To buy. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+4:1">Isaiah 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:44">Matthew 13:44</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:46">Matthew 13:46</span>. Those who think themselves rich, and yet have just been called beggars by the Lord, are advised by Him to buy. The irony, however, covers a sincere and gracious invitation. The goods of Christ are freely given, yet they have their price - renunciation of self and of the world. </p>
<p>Gold [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρυσιον] </span></span>. Often of gold money or ornaments.

Also of native gold and gold which has been smelted and wrought (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:4">Hebrews 9:4</span>). There may very properly be a reference to the extensive money transactions of Laodicea. </p>
<p>Tried in the fire [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπυρωμενον εκ πορος] </span></span>. The verb means to burn, to be on fire : in the perfect passive, as here, kindled, made to glow; thence melted by fire, and so refined. Rev., refined by, fire. By fire is, literally, out of the fire (ejk; see on Chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+2:7">Revelation 2:7</span>). </p>
<p>White raiment. Rev., garments. See on verse 4. </p>

<p>Anoint thine eyes with eye - salve [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολλουριον εγχρισον τους οφθαλμους σου] </span></span>. The correct reading is egcrisai, the infinitive, to anoint, instead of the imperative. So Rev., eye - salve to anoint thine eyes. Kollourion, of which the Latin collyrium is a transcript, is a diminutive of kollura a roll of coarse bread. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+14:3">1 Kings 14:3</span>, Sept.; A. V., cracknels. Here applied to a roll or stick of ointment for the eyes. Horace, describing his Brundisian journey, relates how, at one point, he was troubled with inflamed eyes, and anointed them with black eye - salve (nigra collyria. Sat., 1, 5, 30). Juvenal, describing a superstitious woman, says : "If the corner of her eye itches when rubbed, she consults her horoscope before calling for salve" (collyria; 6., 577). The figure sets forth the spiritual anointing by which the spiritual vision is purged. Compare Augustine, "Confessions, 7, 7, 8." Through my own swelling was I separated from Thee; yea, my pride - swollen face closed up mine eyes.... It was pleasing in Thy sight to reform my deformities; and by inward goads didst Thou rouse me, that I should be ill at ease until Thou wert manifested to my inward sight. Thus, by the secret hand of Thy medicining, was my swelling abated, and the troubled and bedimmed eyesight of my mind, by the smarting anointings of healthful sorrows, was from day to day healed.
