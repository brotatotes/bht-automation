The former of these verbs is in the perfect tense : thou hast received the truth as a permanent deposit. It remains with thee whether thou regardest it or not.

<p>Thou shalt not know what hour l will come upon thee. The Greek proverb says that the feet of the avenging deities are shod with wool. The sentiment is voiced in the two following fragments from Aeschylus : </p>
<p>"Whether one sleep or walk or sit at ease, Unseen and voiceless Justice dogs his steps, Striking athwart his path from right or left; Nor what is foully done will night conceal : Whate'er thou doest some God beholdeth thee." " And dost thou deem that thou shalt e'er o'ercome Wisdom divine ? That retribution lies Somewhere remote from mortals ? Close at hand, Unseen itself, it sees and knows full well Whom it befits to smite. But thou know'st not The hour when, swift and sudden, it shall come And sweep away the wicked from the earth. "</p>
