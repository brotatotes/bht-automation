Thou hast received and heard [ειληφας και ηκουσας] . The former of these verbs is in the perfect tense : thou hast received the truth as a permanent deposit.

Thou shalt not know what hour l will come upon thee. The Greek proverb says that the feet of the avenging deities are shod with wool.

" And dost thou deem that thou shalt e'er o'ercome Wisdom divine ? That retribution lies Somewhere remote from mortals ? Close at hand, Unseen itself, it sees and knows full well Whom it befits to smite. But thou know'st not The hour when, swift and sudden, it shall come And sweep away the wicked from the earth. "
