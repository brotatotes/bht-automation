I have set [δεδωκα] . Lit., I have given. For a similar phrase see Luke 12:51. An open door (quran ajnewgmenhn). Rev., more literally, a door opened. This is variously explained. Some refer it to the entrance into the joy of the Lord; others to the initiation into the meaning of scripture; others again to the opportunity for the mission - work of the Church. In this last sense the phrase is often used by Paul. See 1 Corinthians 16:9; 2 Corinthians 2:12; Colossians 4:3. Compare Acts 14:27. Acts 14:77 I have given is appropriate, since all opportunities of service are gifts of God. See on chapter Revelation 2:7. For thou hast [οτι εχεις] . Some texts make behold - shut parenthetical, and render oti that, defining thy works, etc. So Rev. A little strength [μικραν δυναμιν] . This would mean, thou hast some power, though small. Many, however, omit the indefinite article in translating, and render thou hast little strength; i e., thou art poor in numbers and worldly resources. So Alford, Trench, and D?ieck. And [και] . John's single copula instead of a particle of logical connection. See on John 1:10; John 6:46; 1 John 1:5; John 8:20. Hast kept my word [ετηρησας μου τον λογον] . Rev., rendering the aorist more strictly, didst keep. For the phrase, see John 17:6, John 17:8.
