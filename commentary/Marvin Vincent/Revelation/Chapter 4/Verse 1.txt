<p>After this [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα ταυτα] </span></span>. Rev., literally, after these things. Not indicating a break in the ecstatic state of the seer, but only a succession of separate visions. </p>
<p>I looked [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδον] </span></span>. Rev., better, I saw. Not of the directing of attention, but of the simple reception of the vision. </p>
<p>A door was opened [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυρα ανεωγμενη] </span></span>. Rev., rightly, omits was. A door set open. The A. V. implies that the seer witnessed the opening of the door. In Heaven. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:1">Ezekiel 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:56">Acts 7:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:11">Acts 10:11</span>. In all these heaven itself is opened. </p>
<p>Was. Omit. Render, as Rev., "a voice as of a trumpet." </p>
<p>A trumpet [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαλπιγγος] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>. Properly a war - trumpet, though the word was also used of a sacred trumpet, with the epithet iJera sacred. </p>
<p>Speaking - saying [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλουσης - λεγουσα] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span>. The former verb indicates the breaking of the silence, the latter the matter of the address. </p>
<p>Hereafter [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα ταυτα] </span></span>. Some editors connect these words with the succeeding verse, substituting them for kai and at the beginning of that verse, and rendering, "I will show thee the things which must come to pass. After these things straightway I was," etc.</p>
