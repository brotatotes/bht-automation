After this [μετα ταυτα] . Rev., literally, after these things. Not indicating a break in the ecstatic state of the seer, but only a succession of separate visions. I looked [ειδον] . Rev., better, I saw. Not of the directing of attention, but of the simple reception of the vision. A door was opened [θυρα ανεωγμενη] . Rev., rightly, omits was. A door set open. The A. V. implies that the seer witnessed the opening of the door. In Heaven. Compare Ezekiel 1:1; Matthew 3:16; Acts 7:56; Acts 10:11. In all these heaven itself is opened. Was. Omit. Render, as Rev., "a voice as of a trumpet." A trumpet [σαλπιγγος] . See on Matthew 24:31. Properly a war - trumpet, though the word was also used of a sacred trumpet, with the epithet iJera sacred. Speaking - saying [λαλουσης - λεγουσα] . See on Matthew 28:18. The former verb indicates the breaking of the silence, the latter the matter of the address. Hereafter [μετα ταυτα] . Some editors connect these words with the succeeding verse, substituting them for kai and at the beginning of that verse, and rendering, "I will show thee the things which must come to pass. After these things straightway I was," etc.
