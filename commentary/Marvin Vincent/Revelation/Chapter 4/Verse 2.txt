Thus Dante describes his unconscious rapture into Paradise : "And suddenly it seemed that day to day Was added, as if He who had the power Had with another sun the heaven adorned." Beatrice, noticing his amazement, says : "Thou makest thyself so dull With false imagining, that thou seest not What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off. Thou art not upon earth as thou believest; But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site, Ne'er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest." " Paradiso, " 1, 60 - 93. A throne. See Ezekiel 1:26-28. Was set [εκειτο] . Denoting merely position, not that the seer saw the placing of the throne. Compare John 2:6. One sitting.

He is commonly understood to be God the Father; but some understand the triune God. 79
