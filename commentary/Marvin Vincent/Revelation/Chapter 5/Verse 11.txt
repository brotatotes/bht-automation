So, literally, Acts 19:19, ajrguriou muriadav pente fifty - thousand pieces of silver; lit., five ten - thousands. In the plural used for an unlimited number. See Luke 12:1; Acts 21:20; Hebrews 12:22; Jude 1:14. Thousands [χιλιαδες] . Ciliav, a collective term like, muriav, meaning the number one thousand, is almost invariably used with men in Revelation. See chapter Revelation 7:4; Revelation 11:13. Only once with a material object (chapter Revelation 21:16). With inferior objects cilioi a thousand is used. See chapter Revelation 11:3; Revelation 12:6. These words are the theme of Alford's noble hymn - "Ten thousand times ten thousand In sparkling raiment bright, The armies of the ransomed saints Throng up the steeps of light : 'Tis finished, all is finished, Their fight with death and sin; Fling open wide the golden gates, And let the victors in."
