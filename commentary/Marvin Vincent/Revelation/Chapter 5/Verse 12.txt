Power, etc. Rev., "the power." Compare the ascription in chapter Revelation 4:11, on which see note, and notice that each separate particular there has the article, while here it is attached only to the first, the power, the one article including all the particulars, as if they formed but one word. On the doxologies, see on chapter Revelation 1:6. Riches [πλουτον] . Not limited to spiritual riches, but denoting the fulness of every gift of God. James 1:17; Acts 17:25. Only here in a doxology. Blessing [ευλογιαν] . See on the kindred word eujloghtov blessed, 1 Peter 1:3.
