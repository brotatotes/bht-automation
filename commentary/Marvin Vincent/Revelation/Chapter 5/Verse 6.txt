And lo! Omit. In the midst of. Not on the throne, but perhaps in the space in the center of which is the throne, and which is surrounded by the twenty - four elders. A Lamb [αρνιον] . The diminutive, very frequent in Revelation, and once in the Gospel of John (xxi. 15). Nowhere else in the New Testament. Compare Isaiah 53:7; John 1:29, John 1:36. Christ had just been spoken of as a lion. He now appears as a lamb. Some interpreters emphasize the idea of gentleness, others that of sacrifice. Slain [εσφαγμενον] . The verb indicates violence, butchery. See on 1 John 3:12. It is also the sacrificial word. Exodus 12:6. Stood [εστηκος] . Rev., more correctly, standing. Though slaughtered the lamb stands. Christ, though slain, is risen and living. Seven horns and seven eyes. See remarks on the Apocalyptic imagery, chapter Revelation 1:16. The horn is the emblem of might. See 1 Samuel 2:10; 1 Kings 22:11; Psalms 112:9; Daniel 7:7, Daniel 7:20 sqq.; Luke 1:69. Compare Matthew 28:18. The eyes represent the discerning Spirit of God in its operation upon all created things. Sent forth [απεσταλμενα] . See on Mark 3:14.
