<p>And lo! Omit. </p>
<p>In the midst of. Not on the throne, but perhaps in the space in the center of which is the throne, and which is surrounded by the twenty - four elders. A Lamb [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρνιον] </span></span>. The diminutive, very frequent in Revelation, and once in the Gospel of John (xxi. 15). Nowhere else in the New Testament. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:7">Isaiah 53:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:36">John 1:36</span>. Christ had just been spoken of as a lion. He now appears as a lamb. Some interpreters emphasize the idea of gentleness, others that of sacrifice. </p>
<p>Slain [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσφαγμενον] </span></span>. The verb indicates violence, butchery. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:12">1 John 3:12</span>. It is also the sacrificial word. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:6">Exodus 12:6</span>. </p>
<p>Stood [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστηκος] </span></span>. Rev., more correctly, standing. Though slaughtered the lamb stands. Christ, though slain, is risen and living. </p>
<p>Seven horns and seven eyes. See remarks on the Apocalyptic imagery, chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>. The horn is the emblem of might. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+2:10">1 Samuel 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:11">1 Kings 22:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+112:9">Psalms 112:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+7:7">Daniel 7:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="da+7:20">Daniel 7:20</span> sqq.; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:69">Luke 1:69</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span>. The eyes represent the discerning Spirit of God in its operation upon all created things. </p>
<p>Sent forth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεσταλμενα] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:14">Mark 3:14</span>.</p>
