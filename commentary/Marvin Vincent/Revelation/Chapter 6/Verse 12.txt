<p>The sixth seal. "The Apocalypse is molded by the great discourse of our Lord upon 'the last things' which has been preserved for us in the first three Gospels (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:4">Matthew 24:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:0">Matthew 25:0</span>.; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:5-37">Mark 13:5-37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:8-36">Luke 21:8-36</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+17:20-37">Revelation 17:20-37</span>). The parallelism between the two is, to a certain extent, acknowledged by all inquirers, and is indeed, in many respects, so obvious, that it can hardly escape the notice of even the ordinary reader. Let any one compare, for example, the account of the opening of the sixth seal with the description of the end (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>), and he will see that the one is almost a transcript of the other. It is remarkable that we find no account of this discourse in the Gospel of St. John; nor does it seem as sufficient explanation of the omission that the later Evangelist was satisfied with the records of the discourse already given by his predecessors" (Milligan). </p>
<p>Earthquake [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεισμος] </span></span>. Lit., shaking. Used also of a tempest. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:24">Matthew 8:24</span>, and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:7">Matthew 24:7</span>. The word here is not necessarily confined to shaking the earth. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span>, it is predicted that the powers of the heavens shall be shaken (saleuqhsontai, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:26">Luke 21:26</span>). Here also the heaven is removed (verse 14). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:26">Hebrews 12:26</span>, where the verb seiw to shake (kindred with seismov) is used. </p>
<p>Black as sackcloth of hair [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελας ως σακκος] </span></span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:3">Isaiah 50:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:10">Isaiah 13:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+4:23">Jeremiah 4:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+32:7">Ezekiel 32:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+32:8">Ezekiel 32:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:31">Joel 2:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joe+3:15">Joel 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="am+8:9">Amos 8:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="am+8:10">Amos 8:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mic+3:6">Micah 3:6</span>. For sackcloth, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:13">Luke 10:13</span>. The moon [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η σεληνη] </span></span>. Add olh whole.
