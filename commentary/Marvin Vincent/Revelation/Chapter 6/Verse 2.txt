<p>White horse. For white, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:29">Luke 19:29</span>.

All the figures of this verse are those of victory. The horse in the Old Testament is the emblem of war.

So Virgil : </p>
<p>" But I beheld upon the grass four horses, snowy white, Grazing the meadows far and wide, first omen of my sight. </p>
<p>Father Anchises seeth, and saith : 'New land and bear'st thou war ? For war are horses dight; so these war - threatening herd - beasts are. ' "" Aeneid," 3, 537. </p>
<p>So Turnus, going forth to battle : </p>
<p>"He spake, and to the roofed place now swiftly wending home, Called for his steeds, and merrily stood there before their foam E'en those that Orithyia gave Pilumnus, gift most fair, Whose whiteness overpassed the snow, whose speed the winged air." " Aeneid, " 12, 81 - 83. </p>
<p>Homer pictures the horses of Rhesus as whiter than snow, and swift as the winds (" Iliad, "10, 436, 437); and Herodotus, describing the battle of Plataea says :" The fight went most against the Greeks where Mardonius, mounted on a white horse, and surrounded by the bravest of all the Persians, the thousand picked men, fought in person " (ix., 63). The horses of the Roman generals in their triumphs were white. </p>

Compare Homer's picture of Telemachus' attempt to draw Ulysses' bow : </p>
<p>"And then he took his place Upon the threshold, and essayed the bow; And thrice he made the attempt and thrice gave o'er." " Odyssey, " 21, 12425. </p>
<p>The suitors propose to anoint the bow with fat in order to soften it. </p>
<p>"Bring us from within An ample roll of fat, that we young men By warming and anointing may make soft The bow, and draw the cord and end the strife." " Odyssey, " 21, 178 - 80. </p>
