<p>Pair of balances [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζυγον] </span></span>. Rev., a balance. Properly, anything which joins two bodies; hence a yoke (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:10">Acts 14:10</span>).

The judgment of this seal is scarcity, of which the balance is a symbol, representing the time when food is doled out by weight.
