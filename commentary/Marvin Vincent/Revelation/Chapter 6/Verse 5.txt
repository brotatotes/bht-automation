Come and see. Omit and see. Black. The color of mourning and famine. See Jeremiah 4:28; Jeremiah 8:21; Malachi 3:14, where mournfully is, literally, in black. Pair of balances [ζυγον] . Rev., a balance. Properly, anything which joins two bodies; hence a yoke (Matthew 11:29; Acts 14:10). The cross - beam of the loom, to which the warp was fixed; the thwarts joining the opposite sides of a ship; the beam of the balance, and hence the balance itself. The judgment of this seal is scarcity, of which the balance is a symbol, representing the time when food is doled out by weight. See Leviticus 26:26; Ezekiel 4:16.
