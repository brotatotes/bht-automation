<p>Measure [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χοινιξ] </span></span>. Choenix. Only here in the New Testament. A dry measure, according to some, a quart; to others a pint and a half. Herodotus, speaking of the provisions for Xerxes' army, assigns a choenix of corn for a man's daily supply, evidently meaning a minimum allowance (vii., 187); and Thucydides, speaking of the terms of truce between the Lacedaemonians and the Athenians, mentions the following as one of the provisions : "The Athenians shall permit the Lacedaemonians on the mainland to send to those on the island a fixed quantity of kneaded flour, viz., two Attic quarts [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χοινικας</span></span>] of barley - meal for each man" (iv., 16). Jowett (" Thucydides ") says that the choenix was about two pints dry measure. So Arnold (" Thucydides "), who adds that the allowance of two choenixes of barley - meal daily to a man was the ordinary allowance of a Spartan at the public table. See Herodotus, 6, 57. </p>
