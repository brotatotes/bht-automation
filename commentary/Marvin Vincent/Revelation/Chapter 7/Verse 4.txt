<p>An hundred and forty and four thousand. Not literally, but the number symbolical of fixedness and full completion (12 x 12). The interpretations, as usual, vary greatly, dividing generally into two great classes : one holding that only Jews are meant, the other including the whole number of the elect both Jew and Gentile. Of the former class some regard the sealed as representing Jewish believers chosen out of the literal Israel. Others add to this the idea of these as forming the nucleus of glorified humanity to which the Gentiles are joined. Others again regard them as Jews reserved by God until Antichrist comes, to maintain in the bosom of their nation a true belief in Jehovah and His law, like the seven thousand in the days of Elijah. </p>
<p>The interpretation of the latter class seems entitled to the greater weight. According to the Apocalyptic usage, Jewish terms are "christianized and heightened in their meaning, and the word" Israel "is to be understood of all Christians, the blessed company of all faithful people, the true Israel of God." See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:28">Romans 2:28</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:6">Romans 9:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:7">Romans 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:16">Galatians 6:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3">Philippians 3:3</span>. The city of God, which includes all believers, is designated by the Jewish name, New Jerusalem. In verse 3, the sealed are designated generally as the servants of God. In chapter 14 the one hundred and forty - four thousand sealed are mentioned after the description of the enemies of Christ, who have reference to the whole Church of Christ; and the mention of the sealed is followed by the world - wide harvest and vintage of the earth. The one hundred and forty - four thousand in chapter 14., have the Father 's name written in their foreheads; and in chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+22:4">Revelation 22:4</span>, all the inhabitants of the New Jerusalem are so marked. In chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:12">Revelation 21:12</span>, the twelve tribes include all believers. The mark of Satan which is in the forehead, is set upon all his servants without distinction of race. See chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+13:16">Revelation 13:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+13:17">Revelation 13:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+14:9">Revelation 14:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+16:2">Revelation 16:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>. The plagues threaten both Jews and Gentiles, as the sealing protects all.</p>
