At the altar [επι το θυσιαστηριον] . The best texts read qusiasthriou, which justifies the Rev., "over the altar." For altar, see on chapter Revelation 6:9. Interpreters differ as to whether the altar meant is the brazen altar, as in chapter Revelation 6:9, or the altar of incense, as in chapter Revelation 9:13. There seems to be no reason for changing the reference from the brazen altar (see on chapter Revelation 6:9), especially as both altars are mentioned in this verse. The officiating priest in the tabernacle or temple took the fire for his censer from the brazen altar, and then offered the incense upon the golden altar. Censer. See on chapter Revelation 5:8. Incense. See on chapter Revelation 5:8. Offer it with the prayers [δωση ταις προσευχαις] . Lit., should give it unto the prayers. Rev., add it unto the prayers. So that the prayers and the incense might ascend together. Proseuch is always used of prayer to God. Golden altar. The altar of incense. Exodus 30:1-6; Exodus 39:38.
