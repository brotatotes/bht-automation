<p>At the altar [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι το θυσιαστηριον] </span></span>. The best texts read qusiasthriou, which justifies the Rev., "over the altar." For altar, see on chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span>. Interpreters differ as to whether the altar meant is the brazen altar, as in chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span>, or the altar of incense, as in chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+9:13">Revelation 9:13</span>. There seems to be no reason for changing the reference from the brazen altar (see on chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span>), especially as both altars are mentioned in this verse. The officiating priest in the tabernacle or temple took the fire for his censer from the brazen altar, and then offered the incense upon the golden altar. </p>
<p>Censer. See on chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+5:8">Revelation 5:8</span>. </p>
<p>Incense. See on chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+5:8">Revelation 5:8</span>. </p>
<p>Offer it with the prayers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωση ταις προσευχαις] </span></span>. Lit., should give it unto the prayers. Rev., add it unto the prayers. So that the prayers and the incense might ascend together. Proseuch is always used of prayer to God. </p>
<p>Golden altar. The altar of incense. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:1-6">Exodus 30:1-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+39:38">Exodus 39:38</span>.</p>
