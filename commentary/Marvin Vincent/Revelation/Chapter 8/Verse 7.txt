<p>The first angel. Omit angel. </p>
<p>Hail and fire mingled with blood [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλαζα και πυρ μεμιγμενα αιματι] </span></span>. Insert ejn in before aimati blood. Instead of "with blood" as A. V., and Rev., we should render "in blood." The hailstones and fire - balls fell in a shower of blood. Compare the account of the plague of fire and hail in Egypt (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+9:24">Exodus 9:24</span>) to which the reference is here, where the Septuagint reads and there was hail and the fire flaming in the hail. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:30">Joel 2:30</span>. </p>
<p>And the third part of the earth was burnt up. This is added by the best texts. </p>
<p>Green [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χλωρος] </span></span>. See on pale, chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+6:8">Revelation 6:8</span>.</p>
