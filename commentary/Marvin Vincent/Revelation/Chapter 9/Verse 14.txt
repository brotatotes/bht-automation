<p>Euphrates. The Euphrates was known as the great River, the River, the Flood. It rises in the mountains of Armenia, breaks through the Taurus range and runs south and southeast until it joins the Tigris in lower Babylonia Its total length is from 1, 600 to 1, 800 miles, and it is navigable for small craft twelve hundred miles from its mouth. It was the boundary - line of Israel on the northeast (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:18">Genesis 14:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+1:7">Deuteronomy 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jos+1:4">Joshua 1:4</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2sa+8:3-8">2 Samuel 8:3-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ki+4:21">1 Kings 4:21</span>). It thus formed the natural defense of the chosen people against the armies of Assyria. The melting of the mountain snows causes an annual flood, beginning in March and increasing until May. These floods became an emblem of the judgments inflicted by God upon Israel by means of Babylon and Assyria. The brook of Shiloah which flowed past Zion and Moriah was a type of the temple and of its mighty and gracious Lord; and the refusal of allegiance to God by the chosen people is represented as their rejection of the waters of Shiloah which flows softly, and their punishment therefor by the bringing in of the waters of the mighty and great river (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:5-8">Isaiah 8:5-8</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:13">Jeremiah 17:13</span>). To the prophets the Euphrates was the symbol of all that was disastrous in the divine judgments.</p>
