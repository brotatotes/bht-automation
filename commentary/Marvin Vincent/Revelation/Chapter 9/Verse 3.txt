<p>Locusts [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακριδες] </span></span>. The idea of this plague is from the eighth plague in Egypt (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+10:14">Exodus 10:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+10:15">Exodus 10:15</span>). Compare the description of a visitation of locusts in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:0">Joel 2:0</span>. There are three Hebrew words in the Old Testament which appear to mean locust, probably signifying different species. Only this word is employed in the New Testament. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:4">Matthew 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:6">Mark 1:6</span>. </p>
<p>Scorpions. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+2:6">Ezekiel 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:19">Luke 10:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:12">Luke 11:12</span>. Shaped like a lobster, living in damp places, under stones, in clefts of walls, cellars, etc. The sting is in the extremity of the tail. The sting of the Syrian scorpion is not fatal, though very painful. The same is true of the West Indian scorpion. Thomson says that those of North Africa are said to be larger, and that their poison frequently causes death. The wilderness of Sinai is especially alluded to as being inhabited by scorpions at the time of the Exodus (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+8:15">Deuteronomy 8:15</span>); and to this very day they are common in the same district. A part of the mountains bordering on Palestine in the south was named from these Akrabbim, Akrab being the Hebrew for scorpion.</p>
