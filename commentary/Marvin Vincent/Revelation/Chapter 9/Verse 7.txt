Shapes [ομοιωματα] . Lit., likenesses. Horses. Compare Joel 2:4. The likeness of a locust to a horse, especially to a horse equipped with armor, is so striking that the insect is named in German Heupferd hay - horse, and in Italian calvaletta little horse. Crowns. Not actual crowns, but as crowns. Milligan remarks that any yellow brilliancy about the head of the insect is a sufficient foundation for the figure. As the faces of men. There is a distant resemblance to the human countenance in the face of the locust. Men [ανθρωπων] is to be taken not as distinguishing sex, but in the generic sense : human faces.
