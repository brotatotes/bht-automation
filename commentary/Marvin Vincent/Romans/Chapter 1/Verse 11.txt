Some spiritual gift [τι χαρισμα] . Note the modesty in some. Carisma is a gift of grace [χαρις] a favor received without merit on the recipient's part. Paul uses it both in this ordinary sense (ch. Acts 5:15, Acts 5:16; Acts 6:23), and in a special, technical sense, denoting extraordinary powers bestowed upon individuals by the Holy Spirit, such as gifts of healing, speaking with tongues, prophecy, etc. See Romans 12:6; 1 Corinthians 1:7; 1 Corinthians 12:4, 1 Corinthians 12:31; 1 Peter 4:10. In 1 Timothy 4:14; 2 Timothy 1:6, it is used of the sum of the powers requisite for the discharge of the office of an evangelist. To the end ye may be established [εις το στηριχθηναι υμας] . Not that I may establish you. The modest use of the passive leaves out of view Paul 's personal part. For established, see on Luke 22:32; 1 Peter 5:10. The word shows that he had in view their christian character no less than their instruction in doctrine.
