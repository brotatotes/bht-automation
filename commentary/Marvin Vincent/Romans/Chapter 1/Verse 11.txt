<p>Some spiritual gift [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τι χαρισμα] </span></span>. Note the modesty in some. Carisma is a gift of grace [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις</span></span>] a favor received without merit on the recipient's part. Paul uses it both in this ordinary sense (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:15">Acts 5:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:16">Acts 5:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:23">Acts 6:23</span>), and in a special, technical sense, denoting extraordinary powers bestowed upon individuals by the Holy Spirit, such as gifts of healing, speaking with tongues, prophecy, etc. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:6">Romans 12:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4">1 Corinthians 12:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:10">1 Peter 4:10</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span>, it is used of the sum of the powers requisite for the discharge of the office of an evangelist. </p>
<p>To the end ye may be established [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το στηριχθηναι υμας] </span></span>. Not that I may establish you. The modest use of the passive leaves out of view Paul 's personal part. For established, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:32">Luke 22:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:10">1 Peter 5:10</span>. The word shows that he had in view their christian character no less than their instruction in doctrine.</p>
