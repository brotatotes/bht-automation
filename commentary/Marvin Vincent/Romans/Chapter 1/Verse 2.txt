<p>Had promised afore [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προεπηγγειλατο] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. Rev., He promised afore. Paul 's Old Testament training is manifest. Naturally, in beginning the more precise description of the new revelation, he refers first to its connection with ancient prophecy. The verb ejpaggellomai; means more than to proclaim. It occurs frequently, and always in the sense of profess or promise. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:11">Mark 14:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:5">Acts 7:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:10">1 Timothy 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:21">1 Timothy 6:21</span>. </p>
<p>Prophets. Not limited to the prophets proper, but including all who, in the Old Testament, have prophesied the Gospel - Moses, David, etc. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1">Hebrews 1:1</span>. </p>
<p>In the holy scriptures [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν γραφαις αγιαις] </span></span>. Or, more strictly, in holy writings. The scriptures would require the article. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:47">John 5:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:22">John 2:22</span>. Here again the absence of the article denotes the qualitative character of the phrase - books which are holy as conveying God 's revelations. On agiov holy, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span>. This is the only passage in which it is applied to scriptures.</p>
