<p>The invisible things of Him. The attributes which constitute God 's nature, afterward defined as "His eternal power and divinity." From the creation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο] </span></span>. From the time of. Rev., since. </p>
<p>Are clearly seen [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθοραται] </span></span>.

See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:41">Acts 5:41</span>. Illustrations are sometimes furnished by single words, as glukupikrov bittersweet; qrasudeilov a bold coward. In English compare Shakespeare : </p>
<p>"Dove - feathered raven, fiend angelical; Beautiful tyrant, wolfish - ravening lamb." </p>

<p>So that they are [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το ειναι] </span></span>. The A. V. expresses result; but the sense is rather purpose. The revelation of God 's power and divinity is given, so that, if, after being enlightened, they fall into sin, they may be without defense. </p>
<p>Without excuse [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναπολογητους] </span></span>. See on answer, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:15">1 Peter 3:15</span>. Only here and ch. 2 1.</p>
