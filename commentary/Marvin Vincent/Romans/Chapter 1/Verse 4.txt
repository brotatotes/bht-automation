<p>Declared [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορισθεντος] </span></span>. Rev., in margin, determined. The same verb as in the compound separated in ver. 1 Bengel says that it expresses more than "separated," since one of a number is separated, but only one is defined or declared. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:42">Acts 10:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:31">Acts 17:31</span> It means to designate one for something, to nominate, to instate. There is an antithesis between born (ver. 3) and declared. As respected Christ 's earthly descent, He was born like other men. As respected His divine essence, He was declared. The idea is that of Christ 's instatement or establishment in the rank and dignity of His divine sonship with a view to the conviction of men. This was required by His previous humiliation, and was accomplished by His resurrection, which not only manifested or demonstrated what He was, but wrought a real transformation in His mode of being. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:36">Acts 2:36</span>; "God made," etc. </p>
<p>With power [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν δυναμει] </span></span>. Lit., in power. Construe with was declared. He was declared or instated mightily; in a striking, triumphant manner, through His resurrection. </p>
<p>Spirit of holiness. In contrast with according to the flesh. The reference is not to the Holy Spirit, who is nowhere designated by this phrase, but to the spirit of Christ as the seat of the divine nature belonging to His person. As God is spirit, the divine nature of Christ is spirit, and its characteristic quality is holiness. </p>
<p>Resurrection from the dead [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστασεως νεκρων] </span></span>. Wrong, since this would require the preposition ejk from. Rev., correctly, of the dead Though this resurrection is here represented as actually realized in one individual only, the phrase, as everywhere in the New Testament, signifies the resurrection of the dead absolutely and generically - of all the dead, as exemplified, included, and involved in the resurrection of Christ. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:11">Philippians 3:11</span></p>
