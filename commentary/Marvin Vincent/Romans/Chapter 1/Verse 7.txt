<p>In Rome [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ρωμη] </span></span>. The words are omitted in a MS. Of the tenth or eleventh century, and in a cursive 14 of the eleventh or twelfth. The words ejn Efesw in Ephesus, are also omitted from <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:1">Ephesians 1:1</span>, by two of the oldest MSS. On which fact has arisen the theory that the Ephesian Epistle was encyclical, or addressed to a circle of churches, and not merely to the church at Ephesus. This theory has been very widely received. With this has been combined the omission of in Rome from the Roman Epistle, and the attempt has been made to show that the Roman Epistle was likewise encyclical, and was sent to Ephesus, Thessalonica, and possibly to some other churches. Archdeacon Farrar advocates this view in "The Expositon," first ser., 9, 211; and also in his "Life and Work of Paul," 2, 170. This theory is used to defend the view which places the doxology of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:25-27">Acts 16:25-27</span> at the end of ch. 14. See note there. </p>
<p>Called to be saints [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλητοις αγιοις] </span></span>. Or, saints by way of call. See on called to be an apostle, ver. 1. It is asserted that they are what they are called. The term agioi saints is applied to Christians in three senses in the New Testament. 1, As members of a visible and local community (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:32">Acts 9:32</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:41">Acts 9:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span>); 2, as members of a spiritual community (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:2">1 Corinthians 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12">Colossians 3:12</span>); 3, as individually holy (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:12">Colossians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+13:10">Revelation 13:10</span>).</p>
