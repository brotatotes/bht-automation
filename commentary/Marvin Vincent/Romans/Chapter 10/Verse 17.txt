By hearing [εξ ακοης] . The same word as report, above, and in the same sense, that which is heard. Word of God [ρηματος θεου] . The best texts read of Christ. Probably not the Gospel, but Christ 's word of command or commission to its preachers; thus taking up except they be sent (ver. 15), and emphasizing the authority of the message. Belief comes through the message, and the message through the command of Christ.
