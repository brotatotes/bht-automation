<p>By hearing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ ακοης] </span></span>. The same word as report, above, and in the same sense, that which is heard. </p>
<p>Word of God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρηματος θεου] </span></span>. The best texts read of Christ. Probably not the Gospel, but Christ 's word of command or commission to its preachers; thus taking up except they be sent (ver. 15), and emphasizing the authority of the message. Belief comes through the message, and the message through the command of Christ.</p>
