Did they not hear? [μη ουκ ηκουσαν] . A negative answer is implied by the interrogative particle. "Surely it is not true that they did not hear." Sound [φθογγος] . Only here and 1 Corinthians 14:7, on which see note. Paul uses the Septuagint translation of Psalms 19:4, where the Hebrew line or plummet - line (others musical chord) is rendered sound. The voice of the gospel message is like that of the starry sky proclaiming God 's glory to all the earth. The Septuagint sound seems to be a free rendering in order to secure parallelism with words. Of the world [της οικουμενης] . See on Luke 2:1; John 1:9.
