<p>Did they not hear? [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ουκ ηκουσαν] </span></span>. A negative answer is implied by the interrogative particle. "Surely it is not true that they did not hear." Sound [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθογγος] </span></span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:7">1 Corinthians 14:7</span>, on which see note. Paul uses the Septuagint translation of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+19:4">Psalms 19:4</span>, where the Hebrew line or plummet - line (others musical chord) is rendered sound. The voice of the gospel message is like that of the starry sky proclaiming God 's glory to all the earth. The Septuagint sound seems to be a free rendering in order to secure parallelism with words. </p>
<p>Of the world [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της οικουμενης] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:1">Luke 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span>.</p>
