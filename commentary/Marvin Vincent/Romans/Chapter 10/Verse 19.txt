<p>Did Israel not know? As in ver. 18, a negative answer is implied. "It is surely not true that Israel did not know." Did not know what? That the Gospel should go forth into all the earth. Moses and Isaiah had prophesied the conversion of the Gentiles, and Isaiah the opposition of the Jews thereto. </p>
<p>First Moses. First in order; the first who wrote. </p>
<p>I will provoke you to jealousy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω παραζηλωσω υμας] </span></span>. From <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+32:21">Deuteronomy 32:21</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:11">Romans 11:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:14">Romans 11:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:22">1 Corinthians 10:22</span>. Used only by Paul. The Septuagint has them instead of you. </p>
<p>By them that are no people [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ ουκ εθνει] </span></span>. Lit., upon a no - people. The relation expressed by the preposition is that of the no - people as forming the basis of the jealousy. The prediction is that Israel shall be conquered by an apparently inferior people. No - people as related to God 's heritage, not that the Gentiles were inferior or insignificant in themselves. For people render nation, as Rev. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>. </p>
<p>By a foolish nation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι εθνει ασυνετω] </span></span>. Lit., upon a foolish nation as the basis of the exasperation. For foolish, see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21">Romans 1:21</span>. </p>
<p>I will anger [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παροργιω] </span></span>. Or provoke to anger. The force of the compounded preposition para in this verb and in parazhlwsw provoke to jealousy, seems to be driving to the side of something which by contact or comparison excites jealousy or anger.</p>
