<p>The end of the law [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελος νομου] </span></span>. First in the sentence as the emphatic point of thought. Expositors differ as to the sense. 1. The aim. Either that the intent of the law was to make men righteous, which was accomplished in Christ, or that the law led to Him as a pedagogue (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:24">Galatians 3:24</span>). 2. The fulfillment, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17">Matthew 5:17</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span>. The termination. To believers in Christ the law has no longer legislative authority to say, "Do this and live; do this or die" (Morison). The last is preferable. Paul is discussing two materially exclusive systems, the one based on doing, the other on believing. The system of faith, represented by Christ, brings to an end and excludes the system of law; and the Jews, in holding by the system of law, fail of the righteousness which is by faith. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:16">Galatians 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:2-14">Galatians 3:2-14</span>.</p>
