<p>The word is nigh thee. Septuagint, Very nigh thee is the word. The word is the whole subject - matter of the Gospel. See ver. 9. Moses used it of the law. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:37">Luke 1:37</span>. The whole quotation in the Hebrew is as follows : "It (the commandment) is not in heaven, that ye should say, Who will ascend for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and make us hear it that we may do it? And it is not beyond the sea, that ye should say, Who will go over for us beyond the sea, and bring it to us, and make us hear it that we may do it? But the word is very near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, to do it." The object of the passage is to contrast the system of faith with the system of law, and that, especially, with reference to the remoteness and difficulty of righteousness. Moses says that the commandment of God to Israel is not incapable of accomplishment, nor is it a distant thing to be attained only by long and laborious effort. The people, on the contrary, carries it in its mouth, and it is stamped upon its heart. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:9">Exodus 13:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+6:6-9">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</span>. In applying these words to the system of faith, Paul, in like manner, denies that this system involves any painful search or laborious work. Christ has accomplished the two great things necessary for salvation. He has descended to earth and has risen from the dead. All that is necessary is to accept by faith the incarnate and risen Christ, instead of having recourse to the long and painful way of establishing one's own righteousness by obedience to the law. </p>
<p>Word of faith. The phrase occurs only here. "Which forms the substratum and object of faith" (Alford). Others, the burden of which is faith. </p>
