<p>Diminishing [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηττημα] </span></span>. The literal translation. Rev. renders loss. Referring apparently to the diminution in numbers of the Jewish people. Other explanations are defeat, impoverishment, injury, minority. Fullness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρωμα] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span>. The word may mean that with which anything is filled (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:26">1 Corinthians 10:26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:28">1 Corinthians 10:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:16">Matthew 9:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:43">Mark 6:43</span>); that which is filled (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span>); possibly the act of filling (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:10">Romans 13:10</span>), though this is doubtful. 57 Here in the first sense : the fullness of their number contrasted with the diminution. They will belong as an integral whole to the people of God.</p>
