<p>Mystery [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυστηριον] </span></span>. In the Septuagint only in Daniel. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:18">Romans 2:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:19">Romans 2:19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:27">Romans 2:27</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:28">Romans 2:28</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:30">Romans 2:30</span>, of the king's secret. It occurs frequently in the apocryphal books, mostly of secrets of state, or plans kept by a king in his own mind. This meaning illustrates the use of the word in passages like <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:11">Matthew 13:11</span>, "mysteries of the kingdom of heaven" - secret purposes or counsels which God intends to carry into effect in His kingdom. So here; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:9">Ephesians 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:9">Ephesians 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:26">Colossians 1:26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:27">Colossians 1:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+4:3">Colossians 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+10:7">Revelation 10:7</span>. In Justin Martyr (second century) it is commonly used in connection with sumbolon symbol, tupov type, parabolh parable, and so is evidently closely related in meaning to these words. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+17:7">Revelation 17:7</span>, This meaning may possibly throw light on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:32">Ephesians 5:32</span>. In early ecclesiastical Latin musthrion was rendered by sacramentum, which in classical Latin means the military oath. The explanation of the word sacrament, which is so often founded on this etymology, is therefore mistaken, since the meaning of sacrament belongs to musthrion and not to sacramentum in the classical sense. </p>
<p>In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:3-6">Ephesians 3:3-6</span>, Paul uses the word as here, of the admission of the Gentiles. </p>
<p>Wise [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρονιμοι] </span></span>. See on the kindred noun fronhsiv wisdom, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:17">Luke 1:17</span>. Mostly in the New Testament of practical wisdom, prudence; thus distinguished from sofia which is mental excellence in its highest and fullest sense; and from sunesiv intelligence, which is combinative wisdom; wisdom in its critical applications. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:9">Colossians 1:9</span>, and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:8">Ephesians 1:8</span>. </p>
<p>Blindness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πωρωσις] </span></span>. See on ver. 7. Rev., hardening. </p>
<p>In part [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο μερους] </span></span>. Merov part is never used adverbially in the Gospels, Acts, and Revelation. In the Epistles it is rarely used in any other way. The only exceptions are <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:10">2 Corinthians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:3">2 Corinthians 9:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:9">Ephesians 4:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:16">Ephesians 4:16</span>. Paul employs it in several combinations. With ajpo from (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:5">1 Corinthians 2:5</span>), and ejk out of (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:27">1 Corinthians 12:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:9">1 Corinthians 13:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:10">1 Corinthians 13:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span>), in which a thing is conceived as looked at from the part, either [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>] as a simple point of view, or [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>] as a standard according to which the whole is estimated. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:27">1 Corinthians 12:27</span>, " members ejk merouv severally, i e., members from a part of the whole point of view. Also with ejn in, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:16">Colossians 2:16</span>, with respect to, literally, in the matter of. With ajna up, the idea being of a series or column of parts reckoned upward, part by part. Merov ti with regard to some part, partly, occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:18">1 Corinthians 11:18</span>; and kata merov, reckoning part by part downward; according to part, particularly, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:5">Hebrews 9:5</span>. </p>
<p>Construe here with hath happened : has partially befallen. Not partial hardening, but hardening extending over a part.</p>
