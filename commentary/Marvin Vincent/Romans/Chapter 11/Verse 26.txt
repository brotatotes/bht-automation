<p>The deliverer [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ρυομενος] </span></span>. The Hebrew is goel redeemer, avenger. The nearest relative of a murdered person, on whom devolved the duty of avenger, was called goel haddam avenger of blood. So the goel was the nearest kinsman of a childless widow, and was required to marry her (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+25:5-10">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</span>). It is the word used by Job in the celebrated passage <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="job+19:25">Job 19:25</span>. See, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ru+3:12">Ruth 3:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ru+3:13">Ruth 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ru+4:1-10">Ruth 4:1-10</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ru+4:5">Ruth 4:5</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ru+4:9">Ruth 4:9</span></p>
