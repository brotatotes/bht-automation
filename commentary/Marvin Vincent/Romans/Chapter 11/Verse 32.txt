<p>Concluded [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεκλεισεν] </span></span>. Only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:6">Luke 5:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:22">Galatians 3:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:23">Galatians 3:23</span>. A very literal rendering, etymologically considered; con together, claudere to shut. The A. V. followed the Vulgate conclusit. So Hooker : "The person of Christ was only touching bodily substance concluded within the grave." The word has lost this sense. Rev., hath shut up. Some explain in the later Greek sense, to hand over to a power which holds in ward. </p>
<p>All [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους παντας] </span></span>. Lit., the all. The totality, Jews and Gentiles, jointly and severally.</p>
