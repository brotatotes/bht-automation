<p>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge. So both A. V. and Rev., making depth govern riches, and riches govern wisdom and knowledge. Others, more simply, make the three genitives coordinate, and all governed by depth : the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge. "Like a traveler who has reached the summit of an Alpine ascent, the apostle turns and contemplates. Depths are at his feet, but waves of light illumine them, and there spreads all around an immense horizon which his eye commands" (Godet). Compare the conclusion of ch 8. </p>
<p>"Therefore into the justice sempiternal The power of vision which your world receives As eye into the ocean penetrates; Which, though it see the bottom near the shore, Upon the deep perceives it not, and yet 'Tis there, but it is hidden by the depth. There is no light but comes from the serene That never is o'ercast, nay, it is darkness Or shadow of the flesh, or else its poison." DANTE, "Paradio," 19 59 - 62. </p>
<p>Compare also Sophocles : </p>
<p>"In words and deeds whose laws on high are set Through heaven 's clear ether spread, Whose birth Olympus boasts, Their one, their only sire, Whom man's frail flesh begat not, Nor in forgetfulness Shall lull to sleep of death; In them our God is great, In them he grows not old forevermore." " Oedipus Tyrannus, " 865 - 871. </p>
<p>Wisdom - knowledge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφιας - γνωσεως] </span></span>. Used together only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8">1 Corinthians 12:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:3">Colossians 2:3</span>. There is much difference of opinion as to the precise distinction. It is agreed on all hands that wisdom is the nobler attribute, being bound up with moral character as knowledge is not. Hence wisdom is ascribed in scripture only to God or to good men, unless it is used ironically. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:20">1 Corinthians 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span>. Cicero calls wisdom "the chief of all virtues." The earlier distinction, as Augustine, is unsatisfactory : that wisdom is concerned with eternal things, and knowledge with things of sense; for gnwsiv knowledge, is described as having for its object God (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:5">2 Corinthians 10:5</span>); the glory of God in the face of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>); Christ Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:8">Philippians 3:8</span>). As applied to human acquaintance with divine things, gnwsiv knowledge, is the lower, sofia wisdom, the higher stage. Knowledge may issue in self - conceit. It is wisdom that builds up the man (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span>). As attributes of God, the distinction appears to be between general and special : the wisdom of God ruling everything in the best way for the best end; the knowledge of God, His wisdom as it contemplates the relations of things, and adopts means and methods. The wisdom forms the plan; the knowledge knows the ways of carrying it out. 60 Past finding out [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεξιχνιαστοι] </span></span>.
