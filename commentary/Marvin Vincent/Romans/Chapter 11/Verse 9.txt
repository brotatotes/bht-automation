<p>David saith. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:23">Psalms 69:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:24">Psalms 69:24</span>. It is doubtful whether David was the author. Some high authorities are inclined to ascribe it to Jeremiah. David here may mean nothing more than the book of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+56:0">Psalms 56:0</span> Table. Representing material prosperity : feasting in wicked security. Some explain of the Jews ' presumptuous confidence in the law. </p>
<p>Snare [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παγιδα] </span></span>, From phgnumi to make fast. The anchor is called pagiv the maker - fast of the ships. </p>
<p>Trap (qhran). Lit., a hunting. Only here in the New Testament, and neither in the Hebrew nor Septuagint. Many render net, following <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+35:8">Psalms 35:8</span>, where the word is used for the Hebrew resheth net. No kind of snare will be wanting. Their presumptuous security will become to them a snare, a hunting, a stumbling - block. </p>
<p>A recompense [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανταποδομα] </span></span>. Substituted by the Septuagint for the Hebrew, to them at ease. It carries the idea of a just retribution.</p>
