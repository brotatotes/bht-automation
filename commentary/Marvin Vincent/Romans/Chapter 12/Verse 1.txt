<p>I beseech [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλω] </span></span>. See on consolation, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:24">Luke 6:24</span>. </p>
<p>By the mercies [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια των οικτιρμων] </span></span>. By, not as an adjuration, but as presenting the motive for obedience. I use the compassion of God to move you to present, etc. </p>
<p>Present. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:13">Romans 6:13</span>. It is the technical term for presenting the Levitical victims and offerings. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:22">Luke 2:22</span>. In the Levitical sacrifices the offerer placed his offering so as to face the Most Holy Place, thus bringing it before the Lord. </p>
<p>Bodies. Literally, but regarded as the outward organ of the will. So, expressly, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:13">Romans 6:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:19">Romans 6:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5">Romans 7:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span>. Hence the exhortation to glorify God in the body (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:20">1 Corinthians 6:20</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:20">Philippians 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:10">2 Corinthians 4:10</span>). So the body is called the body of sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:11">Colossians 2:11</span>). In later Greek usage slaves were called swmata bodies. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+18:13">Revelation 18:13</span>. </p>
<p>A living sacrifice [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυσιαν ζωσαν] </span></span>. Living, in contrast with the slain Levitical offerings. Compare ch. 6 8, 11. "How can the body become a sacrifice ? Let the eye look on no evil, and it is a sacrifice. Let the tongue utter nothing base, and it is an offering. Let the hand work no sin, and it is a holocaust. But more, this suffices not, but besides we must actively exert ourselves for good; the hand giving alms, the mouth blessing them that curse us, the ear ever at leisure for listening to God" (Chrysostom). Acceptable [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαρεστον] </span></span>. Lit., well - pleasing. </p>
<p>Which is your reasonable service [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την λογικην λατρειαν] </span></span>. Explaining the whole previous clause. Service, see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:4">Romans 9:4</span>. The special word for the service rendered by the Israelites as the peculiar people of God is very significant here. Reasonable, not in the popular sense of the term, as a thing befitting or proper, but rational, as distinguished from merely external or material. Hence nearly equivalent to spiritual. So Rev., in margin. It is in harmony with the highest reason.</p>
