I beseech [παρακαλω] . See on consolation, Luke 6:24. By the mercies [δια των οικτιρμων] . By, not as an adjuration, but as presenting the motive for obedience. I use the compassion of God to move you to present, etc. Present. See on ch. Romans 6:13. It is the technical term for presenting the Levitical victims and offerings. See Luke 2:22. In the Levitical sacrifices the offerer placed his offering so as to face the Most Holy Place, thus bringing it before the Lord. Bodies. Literally, but regarded as the outward organ of the will. So, expressly, Romans 6:13, Romans 6:19; 2 Corinthians 5:10. Compare Romans 7:5, Romans 7:23. Hence the exhortation to glorify God in the body (1 Corinthians 6:20; compare Philippians 1:20; 2 Corinthians 4:10). So the body is called the body of sin (Romans 6:6; compare Colossians 2:11). In later Greek usage slaves were called swmata bodies. See Revelation 18:13. A living sacrifice [θυσιαν ζωσαν] . Living, in contrast with the slain Levitical offerings. Compare ch. 6 8, 11. "How can the body become a sacrifice ? Let the eye look on no evil, and it is a sacrifice. Let the tongue utter nothing base, and it is an offering. Let the hand work no sin, and it is a holocaust. But more, this suffices not, but besides we must actively exert ourselves for good; the hand giving alms, the mouth blessing them that curse us, the ear ever at leisure for listening to God" (Chrysostom). Acceptable [ευαρεστον] . Lit., well - pleasing. Which is your reasonable service [την λογικην λατρειαν] . Explaining the whole previous clause. Service, see on ch. Romans 9:4. The special word for the service rendered by the Israelites as the peculiar people of God is very significant here. Reasonable, not in the popular sense of the term, as a thing befitting or proper, but rational, as distinguished from merely external or material. Hence nearly equivalent to spiritual. So Rev., in margin. It is in harmony with the highest reason.
