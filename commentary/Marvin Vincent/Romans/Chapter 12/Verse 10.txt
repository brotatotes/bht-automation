<p>Be kindly affectioned [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλοστοργοι] </span></span>. Only here in the New Testament. From stergw to love, which denotes peculiarly a natural affection, a sentiment innate and peculiar to men as men, as distinguished from the love of desire, called out by circumstance. Hence of the natural love of kindred, of people and king (the relation being regarded as founded in nature), of a tutelary God for a people. The word here represents Christians as bound by a family tie. It is intended to define more specifically the character of filadelfia brotherly love, which follows, so that the exhortation is "love the brethren in the faith as though they were brethren in blood" (Farrar). Rev., be tenderly affectioned; but the A. V., in the word kindly gives the real sense, since kind is originally kinned; and kindly affectioned is having the affection of kindred. </p>
<p>In honor preferring one another [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη τιμη αλληλους προηγουμενοι] </span></span>. The verb occurs only here. It means to go before as a guide. Honor is the honor due from each to all. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:3">Philippians 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:17">1 Peter 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:5">1 Peter 5:5</span>. Hence, leading the way in showing the honor that is due. Others render antcipating and excelling.</p>
