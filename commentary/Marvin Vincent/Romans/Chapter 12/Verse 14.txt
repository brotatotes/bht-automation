Bless [ευλογειτε] . See on blessed, 1 Peter 1:3. Them that persecute [τους διωκοντας] . See on John 5:16. It has been suggested that the verb pursuing in ver. 13 may have suggested the persecutors here. Pursue hospitality toward the brethren as the wicked pursue them. Curse not. Plutarch relates that when a decree was issued that Alcibiades should be solemnly cursed by all the priests and priestesses, one of the latter declared that her holy office obliged her to make prayers, but not execrations (" Alcibiades ").
