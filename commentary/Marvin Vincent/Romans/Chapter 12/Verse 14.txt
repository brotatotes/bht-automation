<p>Them that persecute [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους διωκοντας] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:16">John 5:16</span>. It has been suggested that the verb pursuing in ver. 13 may have suggested the persecutors here. Pursue hospitality toward the brethren as the wicked pursue them. </p>
