Provide [προνοουμενοι] . The A. V. uses provide in its earlier and more literal meaning of taking thought in advance. This has been mostly merged in the later meaning of furnish, so that the translation conveys the sense of providing honestly for ourselves and our families. Better, as Rev., take thought for. 66 The citation is from Proverbs 3:4, and varies from both Hebrew and Septuagint. Hebrew : And thou shalt find favor and good understanding in the eyes of God and man. Septuagint : And thou shalt find favor and devise excellent things in the sight of the Lord and of men. Compare 2 Corinthians 8:21. Construe in the sight of all men with the verb, not with honorable. Men's estimate of what is honorable is not the standard.
