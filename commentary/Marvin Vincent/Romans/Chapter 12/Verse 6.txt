<p>Prophecy. See on prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:26">Luke 7:26</span>. In the New Testament, as in the Old, the prominent idea is not prediction, but the inspired delivery of warning, exhortation, instruction, judging, and making manifest the secrets of the heart. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:24">1 Corinthians 14:24</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:25">1 Corinthians 14:25</span>. The New - Testament prophets are distinguished from teachers, by speaking under direct divine inspiration. </p>
<p>Let us prophesy. Not in the Greek. </p>
<p>According to the proportion of faith [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα την αναλογιαν της πιστεως] </span></span>. Analogia proportion, occurs only here in the New Testament. In classical Greek it is used as a mathematical term. Thus Plato : "The fairest bond is that which most completely fuses and is fused into the things which are bound; and proportion [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναλογια</span></span>] is best adapted to effect such a fusion" (" Timaeus, "31)." Out of such elements, which are in number four, the body of the world was created in harmony and proportion "(" Timaeus," 32). Compare "Politicus," 257 The phrase here is related to the measure of faith (ver. 3). It signifies, according to the proportion defined by faith. The meaning is not the technical meaning expressed by the theological phrase analogy of faith, sometimes called analogy of scripture, i e., the correspondence of the several parts of divine revelation in one consistent whole. This would require hJ pistiv the faith, to be taken as the objective rule of faith, or system of doctrine (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:7">Acts 6:7</span>), and is not in harmony with ver. 3, nor with according to the grace given. Those who prophesy are to interpret the divine revelation "according to the strength, clearness, fervor, and other qualities of the faith bestowed upon them; so that the character and mode of their speaking is conformed to the rules and limits which are implied in the proportion of their individual degree of faith" (Meyer).</p>
