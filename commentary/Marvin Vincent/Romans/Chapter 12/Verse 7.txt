<p>Ministering [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονια] </span></span>. Let us wait on is supplied. Lit., or ministry in our ministry. The word appears in the New Testament always in connection with the service of the Christian Church, except <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:40">Luke 10:40</span>, of Martha 's serving; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>, of the ministry of angels, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7">2 Corinthians 3:7</span>, of the ministry of Moses. Within this limit it is used, 1. Of service in general, including all forms of christian ministration tending to the good of the christian body (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:5">1 Corinthians 12:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:11">2 Timothy 4:11</span>). Hence, 2. Of the apostolic office and its administration; (a) generally (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:24">Acts 20:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:1">2 Corinthians 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:12">1 Timothy 1:12</span>); or (b) defined as a ministry of reconciliation, of the word, of the Spirit, of righteousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:18">2 Corinthians 5:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:4">Acts 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:8">2 Corinthians 3:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:9">2 Corinthians 3:9</span>). It is not used of the specific office of a deacon; but the kindred word diakonov occurs in that sense (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8">1 Timothy 3:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:12">1 Timothy 3:12</span>). As the word is employed in connection with both the higher and lower ministrations in the Church (see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:4">Acts 6:4</span>), it is difficult to fix its precise meaning here; yet as it is distinguished here from prophecy, exhortation, and teaching, it may refer to some more practical, and, possibly, minor form of ministry. Moule says : "Almost any work other than that of inspired utterance or miracle - working may be included in it here." So Godet : "An activity of a practical nature exerted in action, not in word." Some limit it to the office of deacon. </p>
<p>Teaching. Aimed at the understanding.</p>
