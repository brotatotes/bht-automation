Exhortation. Aimed at the heart and will. See on consolation, Luke 6:24. Compare 1 Corinthians 14:3; Acts 4:36, where Rev. gives son of exhortation. He that giveth [ο μεταδιδους] . Earthly possessions. The preposition meta indicates sharing with. He that imparteth. Compare Ephesians 4:28; Luke 3:11. Simplicity [απλοτητι] . See on single, Matthew 6:22, and compare James 1:5, where it is said that God gives aJplwv simply. See note there. In 2 Corinthians 8:2; 2 Corinthians 9:11, 2 Corinthians 9:13, the A. V. gives liberality; and in James 1:5, liberally. Rev. accepts this in the last - named passage, but gives singleness in margin. In all the others liberality is, at best, very doubtful. The sense is unusual, and the rendering simplicity or singleness is defensible in all the passages. He that ruleth [ο προισταμενος] . Lit., he that is placed in front. The reference is to any position involving superintendence. No special ecclesiastical office is meant. Compare Titus 3:8, to maintain good works; the idea of presiding over running into that of carrying on or practicing. See note there. Compare also prostativ succorer, Romans 16:2, and see note. With diligence [εν σπουδη] . See on Jude 1:3. In Mark 6:25; Luke 1:39, it is rendered haste. In 2 Corinthians 7:11, carefulness (Rev., earnest care). In 2 Corinthians 7:12, care (Rev., earnest care). In 2 Corinthians 8:8, forwardness (Rev., earnestness). In 2 Corinthians 8:16, earnest care. With cheerfulness [εν ιλαροτητι] . Only here in the New Testament. It reappears in the Latin hilaritas; English, hilarity, exhilarate. "The joyful eagerness, the amiable grace, the affability going the length of gayety, which make the visitor a sunbeam penetrating into the sick - chamber, and to the heart of the afflicted."
