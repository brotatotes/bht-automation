<p>And that knowing the time - now. Referring to the injunction of ver. 8. Knowing, seeing that ye know. The time [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον καιρον] </span></span>, the particular season or juncture. Rev., season. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:1">Matthew 12:1</span>. Now [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη] </span></span>, better, already. </p>
<p>Our salvation [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημων η σωτηρια] </span></span>. Others, however, and better, as Rev., construe hJmwn of us (salvation of us, i e., our) with nearer, and render salvation is nearer to us. This is favored by the order of the Greek words. The other rendering would lay an unwarranted emphasis on our. The reference is apparently to the Lord 's second coming, rather than to future glory.</p>
