Honestly [ευσχημονως] . Honest is originally honorable, and so here. Compare Wyclif's version of 1 Corinthians 12:23 : "And the members that be unhonest have more honesty; for our honest members have need of none." From euj well, schma fashion. See on Matthew 17:2. Hence becomingly. Compare 1 Corinthians 14:40; 1 Thessalonians 4:12. The word refers more particularly to the outward life, and thus accords with walk, and in the day the time of observation. Rioting [κωμοις] . Lit., revellings. See on 1 Peter 4:3. Drunkenness [μεθαισ] . See on Luke 21:34; John 2:10. Wantonness [ασελγειαις] . See on lasciviousness, Mark 7:22. All these three are plural : riotings, drunkennesses, wantonnesses. Envying [ζηλω] . Rev., jealousy. See on James 3:14.
