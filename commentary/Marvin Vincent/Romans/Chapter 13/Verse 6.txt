<p>Pay ye tribute [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορους τελειτε] </span></span>. Teleite ye pay is, literally, ye accomplish or fulfill carrying the sense of the fulfillment of an obligation. Forouv tribute is from ferw to bring something brought. Rev. makes the verb indicative, ye pay. </p>
<p>God 's ministers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λειτουργοι θεου] </span></span>. See on ministration, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:23">Luke 1:23</span>, and ministered, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2">Acts 13:2</span>. In ver. 4, diakonov is used for minister. The word here brings out more fully the fact that the ruler, like the priest, discharges a divinely ordained service. Government is thus elevated into the sphere of religion. Hence Rev., ministers of God 's service. </p>
<p>Attending continually. The same word as continuing steadfastly in ch. 12 12.</p>
