Weak in the faith. Probably referring to a class of Jewish Christians with Essenic tendencies. 67 Better, as Rev., in faith, the reference being to faith in Christ, not to christian doctrine. See on Acts 6:7. Receive ye [προσλαμβανεσθε] . Into fellowship. See on Matthew 16:22. Doubtful disputations [διακρισεις διαλογισμων] . Lit., judgings of thoughts. The primary meaning of dialogismov is a thinking - through or over. Hence of those speculations or reasonings in one's mind which take the form of scruples. See on Mark 7:21. Diakrisiv has the same sense as in the other two passages where it occurs (1 Corinthians 12:10; Hebrews 5:14); discerning with a view to forming a judgment. Hence the meaning is, "receive these weak brethren, but not for the purpose of passing judgment upon their scruples."
