<p>As I live, etc. From <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:23">Isaiah 45:23</span>. Hebrew : By myself I swear... that to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. Septuagint the same, except shall swear by God. </p>
<p>Shall confess [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξομολογησεται] </span></span>. Primarily, to acknowledge, confess, or profess from [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span>] the heart. To make a confession to one's honor; thence to praise. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span> (Rev., in margin, praise for thank); <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:9">Romans 14:9</span>. Here, as Rev. in margin, shall give praise. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span>.</p>
