As I live, etc. From Isaiah 45:23. Hebrew : By myself I swear... that to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. Septuagint the same, except shall swear by God. Shall confess [εξομολογησεται] . Primarily, to acknowledge, confess, or profess from [εξ] the heart. To make a confession to one's honor; thence to praise. So Luke 10:21 (Rev., in margin, praise for thank); Romans 14:9. Here, as Rev. in margin, shall give praise. See on Matthew 11:25.
