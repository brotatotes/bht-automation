I know - am persuaded [οιδα - πεπεισμαι] . "A rare conjunction of words, but fitted here to confirm against ignorance and doubt" (Bengel). For I know, see on John 2:4. The persuasion is not the result of his own reasoning, but of his fellowship in the Lord Jesus. So Rev, for by the Lord, etc. Unclean [κοινον] . Lit., common. In the Levitical sense, as opposed to holy or pure. Compare Mark 7:2, "With defiled [κοιναις χομμον] , that is to say, with unwashen hands." See Acts 10:14.
