<p>The kingdom of God. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:20">Luke 6:20</span>, and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>. "The heavenly sphere of life in which God 's word and Spirit govern, and whose organ on earth is the Church" (Lange). Not the future, messianic kingdom. </p>
<p>Meat and drink [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βρωσις και ποσις] </span></span>. Rev., eating and drinking. Both words, however, occur frequently in the sense of A. V. Meat [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βρωμα] </span></span>, that which is eaten, occurs in ver. 15. The corresponding word for that which is drunk [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πωμα</span></span>] is not found in the New Testament, though poma drink occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:4">1 Corinthians 10:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:10">Hebrews 9:10</span>, and both in classical and New - Testament Greek, posiv the act of drinking is used also for that which is drunk. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:55">John 6:55</span>. A somewhat similar interchange of meaning appears in the popular expression, such a thing is good eating; also in the use of living for that by which one lives. </p>
<p>Righteousness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνη] </span></span>. On its practical, ethical side, as shown in moral rectitude toward men. </p>
<p>Peace [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειρηνη] </span></span>. Not peace with God, reconciliation, as ch. 5 1, but mutual concord among Christians. </p>
<p>Joy [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρα] </span></span>. Common joy, arising out of the prevalence of rectitude and concord in the Church. The whole chapter is concerned with the mutual relations of Christians, rather than with their relations to God In the Holy Ghost. Most commentators construe this with joy only. </p>
<p>Meyer says it forms one phrase. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:6">1 Thessalonians 1:6</span> While this may be correct, I see no objection to construing the words with all these terms. So Godet : "It is this divine guest who, by His presence, produces them in the Church."</p>
