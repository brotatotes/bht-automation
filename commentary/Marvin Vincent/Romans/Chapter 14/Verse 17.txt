The kingdom of God. See on Luke 6:20, and compare Matthew 3:2. "The heavenly sphere of life in which God 's word and Spirit govern, and whose organ on earth is the Church" (Lange). Not the future, messianic kingdom. Meat and drink [βρωσις και ποσις] . Rev., eating and drinking. Both words, however, occur frequently in the sense of A. V. Meat [βρωμα] , that which is eaten, occurs in ver. 15. The corresponding word for that which is drunk [πωμα] is not found in the New Testament, though poma drink occurs 1 Corinthians 10:4; Hebrews 9:10, and both in classical and New - Testament Greek, posiv the act of drinking is used also for that which is drunk. See John 6:55. A somewhat similar interchange of meaning appears in the popular expression, such a thing is good eating; also in the use of living for that by which one lives. Righteousness [δικαιοσυνη] . On its practical, ethical side, as shown in moral rectitude toward men. Peace [ειρηνη] . Not peace with God, reconciliation, as ch. 5 1, but mutual concord among Christians. Joy [χαρα] . Common joy, arising out of the prevalence of rectitude and concord in the Church. The whole chapter is concerned with the mutual relations of Christians, rather than with their relations to God In the Holy Ghost. Most commentators construe this with joy only. Meyer says it forms one phrase. Compare 1 Thessalonians 1:6 While this may be correct, I see no objection to construing the words with all these terms. So Godet : "It is this divine guest who, by His presence, produces them in the Church."
