<p>Despise [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουθενειτω] </span></span>. The verb means literally to throw out as nothing. Rev., better, set at nought. </p>
<p>Judge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινετω] </span></span>. Judgment is assigned to the weak brother, contempt to the stronger. Censoriousness is the peculiar error of the ascetic, contemptuousness of the liberal. A distinguished minister once remarked : "The weak brother is the biggest bully in the universe!" Both extremes are allied to spiritual pride. </p>
<p>Hath received [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσελαβετο] </span></span>. The aorist points to a definite time - when he believed on Christ, though there is still a reference to his present relation to God as determined by the fact of his reception then, which may warrant the rendering by the perfect.</p>
