Despise [εξουθενειτω] . The verb means literally to throw out as nothing. Rev., better, set at nought. Judge [κρινετω] . Judgment is assigned to the weak brother, contempt to the stronger. Censoriousness is the peculiar error of the ascetic, contemptuousness of the liberal. A distinguished minister once remarked : "The weak brother is the biggest bully in the universe!" Both extremes are allied to spiritual pride. Hath received [προσελαβετο] . The aorist points to a definite time - when he believed on Christ, though there is still a reference to his present relation to God as determined by the fact of his reception then, which may warrant the rendering by the perfect.
