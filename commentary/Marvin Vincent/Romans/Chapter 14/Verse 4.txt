<p>Who art thou? [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ τις ει</span></span>] Thou, first in the Greek order and peculiarly emphatic. Addressing the weak brother, since judgest corresponds with judge in ver. 3. </p>
<p>Servant [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικετην] </span></span>. Strictly, household servant. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18">1 Peter 2:18</span>. He is a servant in Christ s household. Hence not another man's, as A. V., but the servant of another, as Rev. Allotrion of another is an adjective. </p>
<p>He shall be holden up [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταθησεται] </span></span>. Rev., shall be made to stand; better, both because the rendering is more truthful, and because it corresponds with the kindred verb stand - he standeth, make him stand. </p>
<p>Is able [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυνατει] </span></span>. Stronger than dunatai can. The sense is, is mighty. Hence Rev., hath power.</p>
