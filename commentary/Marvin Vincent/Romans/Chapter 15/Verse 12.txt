Root. See on Nazarene, Matthew 2:23. Root is a sprout from the root. He that shall rise to reign. Rev., that ariseth to reign. Literally from the Septuagint. Ariseth to reign is a paraphrase of the Hebrew stands as banner. Bengel says : "There is a pleasant contrast : the root is in the lowest place, the banner rises highest, so as to be seen even by the remotest nations." Shall - hope. So Septuagint, which is a free rendering of the Hebrew seek or resort to.
