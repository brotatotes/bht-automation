<p>Root. See on Nazarene, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:23">Matthew 2:23</span>. Root is a sprout from the root. He that shall rise to reign. Rev., that ariseth to reign. Literally from the Septuagint. Ariseth to reign is a paraphrase of the Hebrew stands as banner. Bengel says : "There is a pleasant contrast : the root is in the lowest place, the banner rises highest, so as to be seen even by the remotest nations." </p>
<p>Shall - hope. So Septuagint, which is a free rendering of the Hebrew seek or resort to.</p>
