Narcissus. This name was borne by a distinguished freedman, who was secretary of letters to Claudius. Juvenal alludes to his wealth and his influence over Claudius, and says that Messalina, the wife of Claudius, was put to death by his order (" Satire, " 14, 330). His household slaves, passing into the hands of the emperor or of some other master, would continue to bear his name.
