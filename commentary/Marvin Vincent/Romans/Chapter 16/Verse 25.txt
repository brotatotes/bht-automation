<p>This is the only epistle of Paul which closes with a doxology. The doxology (see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</span>) stands at the close of this chapter in most of the very oldest MSS., and in the Peshito or Syriac and Vulgate versions. In a very few MSS. it is omitted or erased by a later hand. In many MSS. including most of the cursives, it is found at the close of ch. 14, and in a very few, at the close of both 14 and 16. 75 Weiss (" Introduction to the New Testament ") says that the attempt to prove its un - Pauline character has only been the result of extreme ingenuity. </p>
