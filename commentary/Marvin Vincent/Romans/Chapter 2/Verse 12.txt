<p>Without law [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανομως] </span></span>. Both law in the abstract and the Mosaic law. The principle laid down is general, though apparently viewed with special reference to the law of Moses. </p>
<p>In the law [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν νομω] </span></span>. Rev., under law, i e., within the sphere of. No decision as to the reference to the law of Moses or otherwise can be based on the presence or absence of the article. Nomov law, is used both with and without the article for the Mosaic law. Cremer correctly says that "the article is usually wanting when the stress is laid, not upon the historical impress and outward form of the law, but upon the conception itself;" or, as Bishop Lightfoot, "law considered as a principle, exemplified no doubt chiefly and signally in the Mosaic law, but very much wider than this in its application." </p>
<p>Shall be judged [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριθησονται] </span></span>. The antithesis shall perish suggests a condemnatory judgment. There is no doubt that the simple krinw is used in the New Testament in the sense of condemning. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:18">John 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:12">2 Thessalonians 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:4">Hebrews 13:4</span>. The change from perish to judge is suggested by by the law. "The Jews alone will be, strictly speaking, subjected to a detailed inquiry such as arises from applying the particular articles of a code" (Godet). Both classes of men shall be condemned; in both the result will be perishing, but the judgment by the law is confined to those who have the law.</p>
