Which shew [οιτινες ενδεικνυνται] . Rev., better, in that they shew, the double relative specifying the class to which they belong, and therefore the reason for what precedes. Shew, properly, in themselves [εν] . The work of the law. The conduct corresponding to the law. Their conscience also bearing witness [συμμαρτυρουσης αυτων της συνειδησεως] . For conscience, see on 1 Peter 3:16. The force of oun with the verb is therewith; i e., with the prescript of the law, respecting the agreement or disagreement of the act with it. So Rev. The meanwhile [μεταξυ] . Rev. renders with one another. Their thoughts one with another. The phrase metaxu ajllhlwn is variously explained. Some alternately, now acquitting and now condemning. Others, among themselves, as in internal debate. So Alford, "thought against thought in inner strife." Others again, accusations or vindications carried on between Gentiles and Gentiles. As the other parts of the description refer to the individual soul in itself and not to relations with others, the explanation expressed in Rev. - the mutual relations and interchanges of the individual thoughts - seems preferable.
