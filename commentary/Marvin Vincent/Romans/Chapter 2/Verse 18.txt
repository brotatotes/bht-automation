<p>The things that are more excellent [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα διαφεροντα] </span></span>. This may be the meaning, and it is adopted by Rev. with the proper omission of more. But it may also mean the things which differ; in which case we shall render provest instead of approvest. The sense will then be : thou dost test with nice discrimination questions of casuistry. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:10">Philippians 1:10</span>. The latter interpretation seems preferable, being borne out by the succeeding being instructed. </p>
<p>Being instructed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηχουμενος] </span></span>. Systematically through catechetical and synagoguic instruction. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:4">Luke 1:4</span>. This formal instruction is the basis of the critical discrimination.</p>
