<p>Forbearance and long - suffering [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοχης και μακροθυμιας] </span></span>. Anoch forbearance, strictly a holding back. In classical Greek mostly of a truce of arms. It implies something temporary which may pass away under new conditions. Hence used in connection with the passing by of sins before Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>). "It is that forbearance or suspense of wrath, that truce with the sinner, which by no means implies that the wrath will not be executed at the last; nay, involves that it certainly will, unless he be found under new conditions of repentance and obedience" (Trench). For makroqumia long - suffering, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:7">James 5:7</span>. This reliance on God 's tolerance to suspend the rule of His administration in your case is contempt (despisest).
