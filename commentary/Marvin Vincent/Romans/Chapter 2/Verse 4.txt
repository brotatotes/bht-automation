Despisest thou [καταφρονεις] . The indicative mood unites a declaration with the question : "Do you despise ? Aye, you do." Riches [πλουτου] . A favorite word with Paul to describe the quality of the divine attributes and gifts. See 2 Corinthians 8:9; Ephesians 1:7, Ephesians 1:18; Ephesians 2:4, Ephesians 2:7; Ephesians 3:8, Ephesians 3:16; Philippians 4:19; Colossians 1:27. Goodness [χρηστοτητος] . See on easy, Matthew 11:30. Forbearance and long - suffering [ανοχης και μακροθυμιας] . Anoch forbearance, strictly a holding back. In classical Greek mostly of a truce of arms. It implies something temporary which may pass away under new conditions. Hence used in connection with the passing by of sins before Christ (Romans 3:25). "It is that forbearance or suspense of wrath, that truce with the sinner, which by no means implies that the wrath will not be executed at the last; nay, involves that it certainly will, unless he be found under new conditions of repentance and obedience" (Trench). For makroqumia long - suffering, see on James 5:7. This reliance on God 's tolerance to suspend the rule of His administration in your case is contempt (despisest). Compare Galatians 6:7. Not knowing [αγνοων] . In that thou dost not know. This very ignorance is contempt. Leadeth [αγει] . The continuous present : is leading all the while thou art despising. Repentance [μετανοιαν] . See on Matthew 3:2; Matthew 21:29.
