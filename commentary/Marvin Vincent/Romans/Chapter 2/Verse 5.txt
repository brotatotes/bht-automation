<p>Treasurest up [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θησαυριζεις] </span></span>. Accumulatest. Glancing back to riches. For thyself. Possibly a tinge of irony. </p>
<p>Wrath against the day of wrath [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οργην εν ημερα οργης] </span></span>. A very striking image - treasuring up wrath for one's self. Rev., better, in the day, etc. The sinner stores it away. Its forthcoming is withheld by the forbearance of God. It will break out in the day when God 's righteous judgment shall be revealed.</p>
