In <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+23:53">Deuteronomy 23:53</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="de+23:57">Deuteronomy 23:57</span>, it describes the confinement of a siege. Trench remarks : "The fitness of this image is attested by the frequency with which, on the other hand, a state of joy is expressed in the Psalms and elsewhere, as a bringing into a large room," <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ps+117:5">Psalms 117:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2sa+22:20">2 Samuel 22:20</span>.
