Tribulation and anguish [θλιψις και στενοχωρια] . For tribulation, see on Matthew 13:21. Stenocwria anguish, which occurs only in Paul (viii. 35; 2 Corinthians 6:4; 2 Corinthians 12:10), literally means narrowness of place. The dominant idea is constraint. In Deuteronomy 23:53, Deuteronomy 23:57, it describes the confinement of a siege. Trench remarks : "The fitness of this image is attested by the frequency with which, on the other hand, a state of joy is expressed in the Psalms and elsewhere, as a bringing into a large room," Psalms 117:5; 2 Samuel 22:20. Aquinas says : loetitia est latitia, joy is breadth.
