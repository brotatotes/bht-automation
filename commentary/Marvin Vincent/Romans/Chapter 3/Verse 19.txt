We know. Often in Paul, of a thing generally conceded. Saith - speaketh [λεγει - λαλει] . See on Matthew 28:18. The former contemplates the substance, the latter the expression of the law. May be stopped [φραγη] . Lit., fenced up. The effect of overwhelming evidence upon an accused party in court. May become guilty before God [υποδικος γενηται τω θεω] . Rev., brought under the judgment of God. Upodikov under judgment, occurs only here. In classical Greek it signifies brought to trial or liable to be tried. So Plato, "Laws," 846, of a magistrate imposing unjust penalties. "Let him be liable to pay double to the injured party." Id., 879, "The freeman who conspired with the slave shall be liable to be made a slave." The rendering brought under judgment regards God as the judge; but He is rather to be regarded as the injured party. Not God 's judgments, but His rights are referred to. The better rendering is liable to pay penalty to God. 28
