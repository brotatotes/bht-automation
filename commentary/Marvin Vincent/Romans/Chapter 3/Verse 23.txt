Have sinned [ημαρτον] . Aorist tense : sinned, looking back to a thing definitely past - the historic occurrence of sin. And come short [υστερουνται] . Rev., fall short : The present tense. The A. V. leaves it uncertain whether the present or the perfect have come is intended. They sinned, and therefore they are lacking. See on Luke 14:14. The word is not merely equivalent to they are wanting in, but implies want under the aspect of shortcoming. The glory of God [της δοξης του θεου] . Interpretations vary greatly. The glory of personal righteousness; that righteousness which God judges to be glory; the image of God in man; the glorying or boasting of righteousness before God; the approbation of God; the state of future glory. The dominant meanings of doxa in classical Greek are notion, opinion, conjecture, repute. See on Revelation 1:6. In biblical usage : 1. Recognition, honor, Philippians 1:11; 1 Peter 1:7. It is joined with timh honor, 1 Timothy 1:17; Hebrews 2:7, Hebrews 2:9; 2 Peter 1:17. Opposed to ajtimia dishonor, 1 Corinthians 11:14, 1 Corinthians 11:15; 1 Corinthians 14:43; 2 Corinthians 6:8. With zhtew to seek, 1 Thessalonians 2:6; John 5:44; John 7:18. With lambanw to receive, John 5:41, John 5:44. With didwmi to give, Luke 17:18; John 9:24. In the ascriptive phrase glory be to, Luke 2:14, and ascriptions in the Epistles. Compare Luke 14:10 Luke 14:2. The glorious appearance which attracts the eye, Matthew 4:8; Luke 4:6; Luke 12:27. Hence parallel with eijkwn image; morfh form; oJmoiwma likeness; eidov appearance, figure, Romans 1:23; Psalms 17:15; Numbers 12:8. The glory of God is used of the aggregate of the divine attributes and coincides with His self - revelation, Exodus 33:22; compare proswpon face, ver. 23. Hence the idea is prominent in the redemptive revelation (Isaiah 60:3; Romans 6:4; Romans 5:2). It expresses the form in which God reveals Himself in the economy of salvation (Romans 9:23; 1 Timothy 1:11; Ephesians 1:12). It is the means by which the redemptive work is carried on; for instance, in calling, 2 Peter 1:3; in raising up Christ and believers with Him to newness of life, Romans 6:4; in imparting strength to believers, Ephesians 3:16; Colossians 1:11; as the goal of Christian hope, Romans 5:2; Romans 8:18, Romans 8:21; Titus 2:13. It appears prominently in the work of Christ - the outraying of the Father 's glory (Hebrews 1:3), especially in John. See Romans 1:14; Romans 2:11, etc. The sense of the phrase here is : they are coming short of the honor or approbation which God bestows. The point under discussion is the want of righteousness. Unbelievers, or mere legalists, do not approve themselves before God by the righteousness which is of the law. They come short of the approbation which is extended only to those who are justified by faith. 30
