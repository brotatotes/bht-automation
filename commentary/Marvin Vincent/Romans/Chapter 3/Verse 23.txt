Hence the idea is prominent in the redemptive revelation (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:3">Isaiah 60:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span>).

It appears prominently in the work of Christ - the outraying of the Father 's glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>), especially in John.

<p>The sense of the phrase here is : they are coming short of the honor or approbation which God bestows. The point under discussion is the want of righteousness. Unbelievers, or mere legalists, do not approve themselves before God by the righteousness which is of the law. They come short of the approbation which is extended only to those who are justified by faith. 30</p>
