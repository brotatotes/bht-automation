<p>Being justified. The fact that they are justified in this extraordinary way shows that they must have sinned. </p>
<p>Freely [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωρεαν] </span></span>. Gratuitously. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:8">Matthew 10:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:25">John 14:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:7">2 Corinthians 11:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+21:6">Revelation 21:6</span>. </p>
<p>Grace [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριτι] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:30">Luke 1:30</span>. </p>
<p>Redemption [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολυτρωσεως] </span></span>. From ajpolutrow to redeem by paying the lutron price. Mostly in Paul. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:28">Luke 21:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:35">Hebrews 11:35</span>. The distinction must be carefully maintained between this word and lutron ransom. The Vulgate, by translating both redemptio, confounds the work of Christ with its result. Christ 's death is nowhere styled lutrwsiv redemption. His death is the lutron ransom, figuratively, not literally, in the sense of a compensation; the medium of the redemption, answering to the fact that Christ gave Himself for us.</p>
