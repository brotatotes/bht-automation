Being justified. The fact that they are justified in this extraordinary way shows that they must have sinned. Freely [δωρεαν] . Gratuitously. Compare Matthew 10:8; John 14:25; 2 Corinthians 11:7; Revelation 21:6. Grace [χαριτι] . See on Luke 1:30. Redemption [απολυτρωσεως] . From ajpolutrow to redeem by paying the lutron price. Mostly in Paul. See Luke 21:28; Hebrews 9:15; Hebrews 11:35. The distinction must be carefully maintained between this word and lutron ransom. The Vulgate, by translating both redemptio, confounds the work of Christ with its result. Christ 's death is nowhere styled lutrwsiv redemption. His death is the lutron ransom, figuratively, not literally, in the sense of a compensation; the medium of the redemption, answering to the fact that Christ gave Himself for us.
