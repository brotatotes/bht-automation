Did not believe [ηπιστησαν] . Rev., were without faith. Not, as some, were unfaithful, which is contrary to New Testament usage. See Mark 16:11, Mark 16:16; Luke 24:11, Luke 24:41; Acts 28:24; Romans 4:20, etc. The Rev. rendering is preferable, as bringing out the paronomasia between the Greek words : were without faith; their want of faith; the faithfulness of God. Faith of God. Better, as Rev., faithfulness; the good faith of God; His fidelity to His promises. For this sense see on Matthew 23:23. Compare Titus 2:10, and see on faithful, 1 John 1:9; Revelation 1:5; Revelation 3:14. Compare 1 Corinthians 1:9; 1 Corinthians 10:13; 2 Corinthians 1:18. Make without effect [καταργησει] . See on Luke 13:7. The word occurs twenty - five times in Paul, and is variously rendered in A. V. make void, destroy, loose, bring to nought, fail, vanish away, put away, put down, abolish, cease. The radical meaning is to make inert or idle. Dr. Morison acutely observes that it negatives the idea of agency or operation, rather than of result or effect. It is rather to make inefficient than to make without effect. So in Luke 13:7, why should the tree be allowed to make the ground idle? 1 Corinthians 13:8, prophecies shall fail, or have no more work to do. 2 Timothy 1:10 Christ abolished death. There is no more work for it. Romans 6:6, the body of sin is rendered inactive. Romans 3:31, Do we deprive the law of its work - render it a dead letter?
