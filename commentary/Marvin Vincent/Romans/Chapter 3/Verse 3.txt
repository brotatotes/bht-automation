<p>Did not believe [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηπιστησαν] </span></span>. Rev., were without faith. Not, as some, were unfaithful, which is contrary to New Testament usage. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:11">Mark 16:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:16">Mark 16:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:11">Luke 24:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:41">Luke 24:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:24">Acts 28:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:20">Romans 4:20</span>, etc. The Rev. rendering is preferable, as bringing out the paronomasia between the Greek words : were without faith; their want of faith; the faithfulness of God. Faith of God. Better, as Rev., faithfulness; the good faith of God; His fidelity to His promises. For this sense see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:23">Matthew 23:23</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:10">Titus 2:10</span>, and see on faithful, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:9">1 John 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>.

<p>Make without effect [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταργησει] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:7">Luke 13:7</span>. The word occurs twenty - five times in Paul, and is variously rendered in A. V. make void, destroy, loose, bring to nought, fail, vanish away, put away, put down, abolish, cease. The radical meaning is to make inert or idle. Dr. Morison acutely observes that it negatives the idea of agency or operation, rather than of result or effect. It is rather to make inefficient than to make without effect. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:7">Luke 13:7</span>, why should the tree be allowed to make the ground idle? <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:8">1 Corinthians 13:8</span>, prophecies shall fail, or have no more work to do. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:10">2 Timothy 1:10</span> Christ abolished death. There is no more work for it. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>, the body of sin is rendered inactive. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:31">Romans 3:31</span>, Do we deprive the law of its work - render it a dead letter?</p>
