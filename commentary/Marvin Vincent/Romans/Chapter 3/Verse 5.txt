<p>Commend [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιστησιν] </span></span>. Only twice outside of Paul 's writings, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:32">Luke 9:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:5">2 Peter 3:5</span>, both in the physical sense. Lit., to place together. Hence of setting one person with another by way of introducing or presenting him, and hence to commend. Also to put together with a vein of showing, proving, or establishing. Expositors render here differently : commend, establish, prove. Commend is the prevailing sense in the New Testament, though in some instances the two ideas blend, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8">Romans 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:11">2 Corinthians 7:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:18">Galatians 2:18</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:1">Romans 16:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:2">2 Corinthians 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:4">2 Corinthians 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:18">2 Corinthians 10:18</span>. </p>
<p>Who taketh vengeance [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο επιφερων την οργην] </span></span>. Rev., much better, who visiteth with wrath. Lit., bringeth the anger to bear. The force of the article it is difficult to render. It may be the wrath, definitely conceived as judicial, or, more probably, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>, referring to something recognized - the wrath to come, the well - understood need of unrighteousness. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:19">Romans 12:19</span>. </p>
<p>As a man [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα ανθρωπον] </span></span>. Rev., after the manner of men; i e., I use a mode of speech drawn from human affairs. The phrase is thrown in apologetically, under a sense that the mode of speech is unworthy of the subject. Morison aptly paraphrases : "When I ask the question, 'Is God unjust who inflicteth wrath ?' I am deeply conscious that I am using language which is intrinsically improper when applied to God. But in condescension to human weakness I transfer to Him language which it is customary for men to employ when referring to human relationships." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:8">1 Corinthians 9:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:19">Romans 6:19</span>.</p>
