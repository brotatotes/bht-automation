Father of circumcision. Of circumcised persons. The abstract term is used for the concrete. See on 11 7. Who not only are - but who also walk. Apparently Paul speaks of two classes, but really of but one, designated by two different attributes. The awkwardness arises from the article toiv, erroneously repeated with stoicousin walk, which latter word expresses an added characteristic, not another class. Paul means that Abraham received a seal, etc., that he might be the father of circumcision to those who not only are circumcised, but who add to this outward sign the faith which Abraham exhibited. Walk (stoicousin). See on elements, 2 Peter 3:10.
