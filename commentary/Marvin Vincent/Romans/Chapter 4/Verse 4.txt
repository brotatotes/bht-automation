<p>The reward [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μισθος] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:13">2 Peter 2:13</span>. </p>
<p>Not of grace but of debt [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου κατα χαριν αλλα κατα οφειλημα] </span></span>. Lit., according to grace, etc. Not grace but debt is the regulative standard according to which his compensation is awarded. The workman for hire represents the legal method of salvation; he who does not work for hire, the gospel method; wages cannot be tendered as a gift. Grace is out of the question when wages is in question.</p>
