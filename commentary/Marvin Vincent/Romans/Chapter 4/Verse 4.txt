The reward [ο μισθος] . See on 2 Peter 2:13. Not of grace but of debt [ου κατα χαριν αλλα κατα οφειλημα] . Lit., according to grace, etc. Not grace but debt is the regulative standard according to which his compensation is awarded. The workman for hire represents the legal method of salvation; he who does not work for hire, the gospel method; wages cannot be tendered as a gift. Grace is out of the question when wages is in question.
