Describeth the blessedness [λεγει τον μακαρισμον] . Makarismov does not mean blessedness, but the declaration of blessedness, the congratulation. So Plato : "The man of understanding will not suffer himself to be dazzled by the congratulation [μακαρισμου] of the multitude (" Republic," 9, 591). Compare Galatians 4:15 (Rev.), and see note there. Rev., correctly, pronounceth blessing.
