We have [εχομεν] . The true reading is ecwmen let us have; but it is difficult if not impossible to explain it. Godet says : "No exegete has been able satisfactorily to account for this imperative suddenly occurring in the midst of a didactic development." Some explain as a concessive subjunctive, we may have; but the use of this in independent sentences is doubtful. Others give the deliberative sense, shall we have; but this occurs only in doubtful questions, as Romans 6:1. A similar instance is found Hebrews 12:28. "Let us have grace," where the indicative might naturally be expected. 32 Compare also the disputed reading, let us bear, 1 Corinthians 14:49, and see note there. Peace [ειρηνην] . Not contentment, satisfaction, quiet, see Philippians 4:7; but the state of reconciliation as opposed to enmity (ver. 10). With God [προς] . See on with God, John 1:1.
