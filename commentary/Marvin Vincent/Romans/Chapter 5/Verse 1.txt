<p>We have [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχομεν] </span></span>. The true reading is ecwmen let us have; but it is difficult if not impossible to explain it. Godet says : "No exegete has been able satisfactorily to account for this imperative suddenly occurring in the midst of a didactic development." Some explain as a concessive subjunctive, we may have; but the use of this in independent sentences is doubtful. Others give the deliberative sense, shall we have; but this occurs only in doubtful questions, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1">Romans 6:1</span>. A similar instance is found <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:28">Hebrews 12:28</span>. "Let us have grace," where the indicative might naturally be expected. 32 Compare also the disputed reading, let us bear, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:49">1 Corinthians 14:49</span>, and see note there. </p>
<p>Peace [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειρηνην] </span></span>. Not contentment, satisfaction, quiet, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+4:7">Philippians 4:7</span>; but the state of reconciliation as opposed to enmity (ver. 10). </p>
<p>With God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς] </span></span>. See on with God, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>.</p>
