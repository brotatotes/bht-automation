<p>Enemies [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχθροι] </span></span>. The word may be used either in an active sense, hating God, or passively, hated of God. The context favors the latter sense; not, however, with the conventional meaning of hated, denoting the revengeful, passionate feeling of human enmity, but simply the essential antagonism of the divine nature to sin. Neither the active nor the passive meaning needs to be pressed. The term represents the mutual estrangement and opposition which must accompany sin on man's part, and which requires reconciliation. </p>
<p>We were reconciled to God [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλλαγημεν τω θεω] </span></span>. The verb means primarily to exchange; and hence to change the relation of hostile parties into a relation of peace; to reconcile. It is used of both mutual and one - sided enmity. In the former case, the context must show on which side is the active enmity. </p>
<p>In the Christian sense, the change in the relation of God and man effected through Christ. This involves, </p>
<p>1. A movement of God toward man with a view to break down man's hostility, to commend God 's love and holiness to him, and to convince him of the enormity and the consequence of sin. It is God who initiates this movement in the person and work of Jesus Christ. See vers. 6, 8; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:18">2 Corinthians 5:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19">2 Corinthians 5:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:6">Ephesians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:19">1 John 4:19</span>. Hence the passive form of the verb here : we were made subjects of God 's reconciling act. </p>
<p>2. A corresponding movement on man's part toward God; yielding to the appeal of Christ 's self - sacrificing love, laying aside his enmity, renouncing his sin, and turning to God in faith and obedience. </p>
<p>3. A consequent change of character in man; the covering, forgiving, cleansing of his sin; a thorough revolution in all his dispositions and principles. </p>
<p>4. A corresponding change of relation on God 's part, that being removed which alone rendered Him hostile to man, so that God can now receive Him into fellowship and let loose upon him all His fatherly love and grace, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3">1 John 1:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span>. Thus there is complete reconciliation. See, further, on ch. 3 25, 26.</p>
