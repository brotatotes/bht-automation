We also joy [και καυχωμενοι] . Lit., but also glorying. The participle corresponds with that in ver. 10, being reconciled. We shall be saved, not only as being reconciled, but as also rejoicing; the certainty of the salvation being based, not only upon the reconciliation, but also upon the corresponding joy. We have now received the atonement [νυν την καταλλαγην ελαβομεν] . Now, in contrast with future glory. Atonement, Rev., properly, reconciliation, the noun being etymologically akin to the verb to reconcile. Atonement at the time of the A. V. signified reconciliation, at - one - ment, the making two estranged parties at one. So Shakespeare : "He and Aufidius can no more atone Than violenist contrarieties." " Coriolanus, " 4, 6. Fuller : "His first essay succeeded so well, Moses would adventure on a second design to atone two Israelites at variance." The word at present carries the idea of satisfaction rather than of reconciliation, and is therefore inappropriate here. The article points to the reconciliation in ver. 10. See on ch. Romans 3:24-26.
