That sinned [αμαρτησαντος] . The better supported reading. Some MSS. and versions read aJmarthmatov transgression. Of one. Some explain, one man, from the preceding (one) that sinned. Others, one trespass, from ver. 17. The judgment [κριμα] . Judicial sentence. Compare 1 Corinthians 6:7; 1 Corinthians 11:29. See on 2 Peter 2:3. Condemnation [κατακριμα] . See on shall be damned, Mark 16:16. A condemnatory sentence. Justification [δικαιωμα] . Not the subjective state of justification, but a righteous act or deed. Revelation 19:8; see on ver. 18. The word is sometimes rendered orinance, Hebrews 9:1, Hebrews 9:10; an appointment of God having the force of law. So Romans 1:32, where Rev. gives ordinance for judgment, and Romans 2:26, ordinances for righteousness.
