<p>Disobedience [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακοης] </span></span>. Only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:6">2 Corinthians 10:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:2">Hebrews 9:2</span>. The kindred verb paralouw to neglect, Rev., refuse, occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:17">Matthew 18:17</span>. From para aside, amiss, and ajkouw to hear, sometimes with the accompanying sense of heeding, and so nearly = obey. Parakoh is therefore, primarily, a failing to hear or hearing amiss. Bengel remarks that the word very appositely points out the first step in Adam 's fall - carelessness, as the beginning of a city's capture is the remissness of the guards. </p>
<p>Were made [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεσταθησαν] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:6">James 3:6</span>. Used elsewhere by Paul only at <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span>, in the sense of to appoint to office or position. This is its most frequent use in the New Testament. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:25">Matthew 24:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:3">Acts 6:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:10">Acts 7:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:1">Hebrews 5:1</span>, etc. The primary meaning being to set down, it is used in classical Greek of bringing to a place, as a ship to the land, or a man to a place or person; hence to bring before a magistrate (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:15">Acts 17:15</span>). From this comes the meaning to set down as, i e., to declare or show to be; or to constitute, make to be. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:8">2 Peter 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:4">James 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:6">James 3:6</span>. The exact meaning in this passage is disputed. The following are the principal explanations : </p>
<p>1. Set down in a declarative sense; declared to be. </p>
<p>2. Placed in the category of sinners because of a vital connection with the first tranegressor. </p>
<p>3. Became sinners; were made. This last harmonizes with sinned in ver. 12. </p>
<p>The disobedience of Adam is thus declared to have been the occasion of the death of all, because it is the occasion of their sin; but the precise nature of this relation is not explained. 36 Obedience [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπακοης] </span></span>. Note the play on the words, parakoe, hypokoe, disobedience, obedience. Upakoh obedience, is also derived from ajkouw to hear (see on disobedience) and uJpo beneath, the idea being submission to what one hears.</p>
