The law entered [παρεισηλθεν] Rev., literally, came in beside, giving the force of para beside. Very significant. Now that the parallel between Adam and Christ is closed, the question arises as to the position and office of the law. How did it stand related to Adam and Christ ? Paul replies that it came in alongside of the sin. "It was taken up into the divine plan or arrangement, and made an occasion for the abounding of grace in the opening of the new way to justification and life" [δωιγητ] . Might abound [πλεοναση] . Not primarily of the greater consciousness and acknowledgment of sin, but of the increase of actual transgression. The other thought, however, may be included. See ch. Romans 7:7, Romans 7:8, Romans 7:9, Romans 7:11. Did much more abound [υπερεπερισσευσεν] . Lit., abounded over and above. Only here and 2 Corinthians 7:4. Compare uJperepleonase abounded exceedingly, 1 Timothy 1:14; uJperperisswv beyond measure, Mark 7:37; uJperauxanei; groweth exceedingly, 2 Thessalonians 1:3.
