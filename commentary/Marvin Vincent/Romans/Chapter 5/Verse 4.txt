Rev. renders probation, which might be defended on the ground of English classical usage. Thus Shakespeare : " And of the truth herein This present object made probation. "Hamlet," 1, 1 Jeremy Taylor : "When by miracle God dispensed great gifts to the laity, He gave probation that He intended that all should prophecy and preach."
