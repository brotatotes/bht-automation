Maketh not ashamed [ου καταισχυνει] . Mostly in Paul; elsewhere only in Luke 13:17; 1 Peter 2:6; 1 Peter 3:16. Rev., putteth not to shame, thus giving better the strong sense of the word, to disgrace or dishonor. Is shed abroad [εκκεχυται] . Rev. renders the perfect tense; hath been shed abroad. Lit., poured out. Compare Titus 3:6; Acts 2:33; Acts 10:45. See on Jude 1:11.
