<p>Righteous - good [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιου - αγαθου] </span></span>. The distinction is : dikaiov is simply right or just; doing all that law or justice requires; ajgaqov is benevolent, kind, generous. The righteous man does what he ought, and gives to every one his due. The good man "does as much as ever he can, and proves his moral quality by promoting the wellbeing of him with whom he has to do." 'Agaqov always includes a corresponding beneficent relation of the subject of it to another subject; an establishment of a communion and exchange of life; while dikaiov only expresses a relation to the purely objective dikh right. Bengel says : "dikaiov, indefinitely, implies an innocent man; oJ ajgaqov one perfect in all that piety demands; excellent, honorable, princely, blessed; for example, the father of his country." </p>
<p>Therefore, according to Paul, though one would hardly die for the merely upright or strictly just man who commands respect, he might possibly die for the noble, beneficent man, who calls out affection. The article is omitted with righteous, and supplied with good - the good man, pointing to such a case as a rare and special exception.</p>
