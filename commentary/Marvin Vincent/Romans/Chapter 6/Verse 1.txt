<p>What shall we say then? "A transition - expression and a debater's phrase" (Morison). The use of this phrase points to Paul 's training in the Rabbinical schools, where questions were propounded and the students encouraged to debate, objections being suddenly interposed and answered. Shall we continue [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιμενωμεν] </span></span>. The verb means primarily to remain or abide at or with, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:8">1 Corinthians 16:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+1:24">Philippians 1:24</span>; and secondarily, to persevere, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:23">Romans 11:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span>. So better here, persist.</p>
