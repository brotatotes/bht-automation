<p>Yield [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παριστανετε] </span></span>. Put at the service of; render. Rev., present. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:22">Luke 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:41">Acts 9:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:3">Acts 1:3</span>. Members [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελη] </span></span>. Physical; though some include mental faculties. </p>
<p>Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:5">Colossians 3:5</span>, where members is expounded by fornication, uncleanness, etc., the physical being a symbol of the moral, of which it is the instrument. </p>
<p>Instruments [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπλα] </span></span>. The word is used from the earliest times of tools or instruments generally. In Homer of a ship 's tackle, smith's tools, implements of war, and in the last sense more especially in later Greek. In the New Testament distinctly of instruments of war (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:3">John 18:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:7">2 Corinthians 6:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:4">2 Corinthians 10:4</span>). Here probably with the same meaning, the conception being that of sin and righteousness as respectively rulers of opposing sovereignties (compare reign, ver. 12, and have dominion, ver. 14), and enlisting men in their armies. Hence the exhortation is, do not offer your members as weapons with which the rule of unrighteousness may be maintained, but offer them to God in the service of righteousness. Of unrighteousness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικιας] </span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:13">2 Peter 2:13</span>. </p>
<p>Yield [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραστησατε] </span></span>. Rev., present. The same word as before, but in a different tense. The present tense, be presenting, denotes the daily habit, the giving of the hand, the tongue, etc., to the service of sin as temptation appeals to each. Here the aorist, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span>, denotes an act of self - devotion once for all. </p>
<p>As those that are alive [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ζωντας] </span></span>. The best texts read wJsei as if alive. This brings out more clearly the figurative character of the exhortation. 37 From the dead [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ νεκρων] </span></span>. Note the preposition out of. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:31">Luke 16:31</span>.</p>
