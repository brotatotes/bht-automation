Yield [παριστανετε] . Put at the service of; render. Rev., present. Compare Luke 2:22; Acts 9:41; Romans 12:1. See on Acts 1:3. Members [μελη] . Physical; though some include mental faculties. Compare Colossians 3:5, where members is expounded by fornication, uncleanness, etc., the physical being a symbol of the moral, of which it is the instrument. Instruments [οπλα] . The word is used from the earliest times of tools or instruments generally. In Homer of a ship 's tackle, smith's tools, implements of war, and in the last sense more especially in later Greek. In the New Testament distinctly of instruments of war (John 18:3; 2 Corinthians 6:7; 2 Corinthians 10:4). Here probably with the same meaning, the conception being that of sin and righteousness as respectively rulers of opposing sovereignties (compare reign, ver. 12, and have dominion, ver. 14), and enlisting men in their armies. Hence the exhortation is, do not offer your members as weapons with which the rule of unrighteousness may be maintained, but offer them to God in the service of righteousness. Of unrighteousness [αδικιας] . See on 2 Peter 2:13. Yield [παραστησατε] . Rev., present. The same word as before, but in a different tense. The present tense, be presenting, denotes the daily habit, the giving of the hand, the tongue, etc., to the service of sin as temptation appeals to each. Here the aorist, as in Romans 12:1, denotes an act of self - devotion once for all. As those that are alive [ως ζωντας] . The best texts read wJsei as if alive. This brings out more clearly the figurative character of the exhortation. 37 From the dead [εκ νεκρων] . Note the preposition out of. See on Luke 16:31.
