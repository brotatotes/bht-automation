<p>Servants [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλους] </span></span>. Every man must choose between two ethical principles. Whichever one he chooses is master, and he is its bond - servant. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:24">Matthew 6:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:18">Matthew 7:18</span>. </p>
<p>Sin unto death - obedience unto righteousness. The antithesis is not direct - sin unto death, obedience unto life; but obedience is the true antithesis of sin, since sin is disobedience, and righteousness is life.</p>
