Servants [δουλους] . Every man must choose between two ethical principles. Whichever one he chooses is master, and he is its bond - servant. Compare Matthew 6:24; Matthew 7:18. Sin unto death - obedience unto righteousness. The antithesis is not direct - sin unto death, obedience unto life; but obedience is the true antithesis of sin, since sin is disobedience, and righteousness is life.
