<p>That ye were. The peculiar form of expression is explained in two ways; either making the thanksgiving bear only on the second proposition, ye obeyed, etc., and regarding the first as inserted by way of contrast or background to the salutary moral change : or, emphasizing were; ye were the servants of sin, but are so no more. Rev. adopts the former, and inserts whereas. </p>
<p>From the heart. See on 1 21. </p>
<p>Form of doctrine [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπον διδαχης] </span></span>. Rev., form of teaching. For tupon, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:3">1 Peter 5:3</span>. The Pauline type of teaching as contrasted with the Judaistic forms of Christianity. Compare my gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:16">Romans 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>. Others explain as the ideal or pattern presented by the gospel. Form of teaching, however, seems to point to a special and precisely defined type of christian instruction. </p>
<p>Was delivered unto you [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις δν παρεδοθητε] </span></span>. But this rendering is impossible. Render, as Rev., whereunto ye were delivered. For the verb, see on 4 25. They had been handed over to the educative power of this form of teaching.</p>
