Fruit. See on 1 13. Had ye [ειχετε] . Imperfect tense, denoting continuance. What fruit were ye having during your service of sin ? In the things whereof [εφ οις] . Some change the punctuation, and read "What fruit had ye at that time? Things whereof ye are now ashamed." But the majority of the best texts reject this, and besides, the question is of having fruit, not of the quality of the fruit.
