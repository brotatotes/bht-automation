<p>Wages [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψωνια] </span></span>. From oyon cooked meat, and later, generally, provisions. At Athens especially fish. Hence ojywnion is primarily provision - money, and is used of supplies for an army, see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:7">1 Corinthians 9:7</span>. The figure of ver. 13 is carried out : Sin, as a Lord to whom they tender weapons and who pays wages. </p>
<p>Death. "Sin pays its serfs by punishing them. Its wages is death, and the death for which its counters are available is the destruction of the weal of the soul" (Morison). </p>
<p>Gift [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρισμα] </span></span>. Rev., rightly, free gift (compare ch. 5 15). In sharp contrast with wages. </p>
