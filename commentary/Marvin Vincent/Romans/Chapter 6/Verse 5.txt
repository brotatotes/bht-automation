<p>We have been planted together [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφυτοι γεγοναμεν] </span></span>. Rev. gives more accurately the meaning of both words. Sumfutoi is not planted, which would be formed from futeuw to plant, while this word is compounded with sun together, and fuw to grow. Gegonaman is have become, denoting process, instead of the simple einai to be. Hence Rev., have become united, have grown together; an intimate and progressive union; coalescence. Note the mixture of metaphors, walking and growing. We shall be also [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα και εσομεθα] </span></span>. It is impossible to reproduce this graphic and condensed phrase accurately in English. It contains an adversative particle ajlla; but. Morison paraphrases : "If we were united with Him in the likeness of His death (that will not be the full extent of the union), but we shall be also united," etc. For similar instances see <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:15">1 Corinthians 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:5">Colossians 2:5</span>.</p>
