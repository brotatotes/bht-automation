<p>Old man [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο παλαιος ανθρωπος] </span></span>., Only in Paul, and only three times; here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22">Ephesians 4:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:9">Colossians 3:9</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:3">John 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5">Titus 3:5</span>. The old, unrenewed self. Paul views the Christian before his union with Christ, as, figuratively, another person. Somewhat in the same way he regards himself in ch. 7. </p>
<p>The body of sin [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το σωμα της αμαρτιας] </span></span>. Swma in earlier classical usage signifies a corpse. So always in Homer and often in later Greek. So in the New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:25">Matthew 6:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:29">Mark 5:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:8">Mark 14:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:43">Mark 14:43</span>. It is used of men as slaves, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="re+18:13">Revelation 18:13</span>. Also in classical Greek of the sum - total. So Plato : to tou kosmou swma the sum - total of the world (" Timaeus, " 31). The meaning is tinged in some cases by the fact of the vital union of the body with the immaterial nature, as being animated by the yuxh soul, the principle of individual life. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:25">Matthew 6:25</span>, where the two are conceived as forming one organism, so that the material ministries which are predicated of the one are predicated of the other, and the meanings of the two merge into one another. </p>
<p>In Paul it can scarcely be said to be used of a dead body, except in a figurative sense, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10">Romans 8:10</span>, or by inference, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:8">2 Corinthians 5:8</span>. Commonly of a living body. It occurs with yuch soul, only <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>, and there its distinction from yuch rather than its union with it is implied. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:28">Matthew 10:28</span>, though even there the distinction includes the two as one personality. It is used by Paul : </p>
<p>1. Of the living human body, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:19">Romans 4:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:13">1 Corinthians 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27">1 Corinthians 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:12-26">1 Corinthians 12:12-26</span>. </p>
<p>2. Of the Church as the body of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:5">Romans 12:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:27">1 Corinthians 12:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>, etc. Sarx flesh, never in this sense. </p>
<p>3. Of plants and heavenly bodies, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:37">1 Corinthians 14:37</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:40">1 Corinthians 14:40</span>. </p>
<p>4. Of the glorified body of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>. </p>
<p>5. Of the spiritual body of risen believers, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:44">1 Corinthians 14:44</span>. It is distinguished from sarx flesh, as not being limited to the organism of an earthly, living body, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:37">1 Corinthians 14:37</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:38">1 Corinthians 14:38</span>. It is the material organism apart from any definite matter. It is however sometimes used as practically synonymous with sarx, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:16">1 Corinthians 7:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:17">1 Corinthians 7:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:28">Ephesians 5:28</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:31">Ephesians 5:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:10">2 Corinthians 4:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:11">2 Corinthians 4:11</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:3">1 Corinthians 5:3</span> with <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+2:5">Colossians 2:5</span>. An ethical conception attaches to it. It is alternated with melh members, and the two are associated with sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:24">Romans 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5">Romans 7:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:24">Romans 7:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:13">Romans 8:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="col+3:5">Colossians 3:5</span>), and with sanctification (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:19">1 Corinthians 6:19</span> sq.; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:4">1 Thessalonians 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>). It is represented as mortal, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>; and as capable of life, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:3">1 Corinthians 13:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:10">2 Corinthians 4:10</span>. </p>
<p>In common with melh members, it is the instrument of feeling and willing rather than sarx, because the object in such cases is to designate the body not definitely as earthly, but generally as organic, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:12">Romans 6:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:13">Romans 6:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:19">Romans 6:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span>. Hence, wherever it is viewed with reference to sin or sanctification, it is the outward organ for the execution of the good or bad resolves of the will. </p>
<p>The phrase body of sin denotes the body belonging to, or ruled by, the power of sin, in which the members are instruments of unrighteousness (ver. 13). Not the body as containing the principle of evil in our humanity, since Paul does not regard sin as inherent in, and inseparable from, the body (see ver. 13; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:10-12">2 Corinthians 4:10-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:1">2 Corinthians 7:1</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:19">Matthew 14:19</span>), nor as precisely identical with the old man, an organism or system of evil dispositions, which does not harmonize with vers. 12, 13, where Paul uses body in the strict sense. "Sin is conceived as the master, to whom the body as slave belongs and is obedient to execute its will. As the slave must perform his definite functions, not because he in himself can perform no others, but because of His actually subsistent relationship of service he may perform no others, while of himself he might belong as well to another master and render other services; so the earthly swma body belongs not of itself to the aJmartia sin, but may just as well belong to the Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:13">1 Corinthians 6:13</span>), and doubtless it is de facto enslaved to sin, so long as a redemption from this state has not set in by virtue of the divine Spirit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:24">Romans 7:24</span>; Dickson). </p>
<p>Destroyed. See on 3 3. </p>
<p>He that is dead [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αποθανων] </span></span>. Rev., literally, he that hath died. In a physical sense. Death and its consequences are used as the general illustration of the spiritual truth. It is a habit of Paul to throw in such general illustrations. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:2">Romans 7:2</span>.</p>
