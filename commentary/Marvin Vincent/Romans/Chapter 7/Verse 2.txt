<p>That hath a husband [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπανδρος] </span></span>. Lit., under or subject to a husband. The illustration is selected to bring forward the union with Christ after the release from the law, as analogous to a new marriage (ver. 4). </p>
<p>Is loosed [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηργηται] </span></span>. Rev., discharged. See on 3 3, Lit., she has been brought to nought as respects the law of the husband. </p>
<p>The law of the husband. Her legal connection with him She dies to that law with the husband 's death. There is an apparent awkwardness in carrying out the figure. The law, in vers. 1, 2, is represented by the husband who rules (hath dominion). On the death of the husband the woman is released. In ver. 4, the wife (figuratively) dies. "Ye are become dead to the law that ye should be married to another." But as the law is previously represented by the husband, and the woman is released by the husband 's death, so, to make the figure consistent, the law should be represented as dying in order to effect the believer 's release. The awkwardness is relieved by taking as the middle term of comparison the idea of dead in a marriage relation. When the husband dies the wife dies (is brought to nought) so far as the marriage relation is concerned. The husband is represented as the party who dies because the figure of a second marriage is introduced with its application to believers (ver. 4). Believers are made dead to the law as the wife is maritally dead - killed in respect of the marriage relation by her husband 's death.</p>
