<p>I was alive - once [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζων ποτε] </span></span>. Referring to the time of childlike innocence previous to the stimulus imparted to the inactive principle of sin by the coming of the law; when the moral self - determination with respect to the law had not taken place, and the sin - principle was therefore practically dead. </p>
<p>The commandment [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντολης] </span></span>. The specific injunction "thou shalt not covet." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:8">James 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:34">John 13:34</span>. </p>
<p>Revived [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεζησεν] </span></span>. Not came to life, but lived again. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:24">Luke 14:24</span>, </p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:3">Romans 7:3</span>2The power of sin is originally and in its nature living; but before the coming of the commandment its life is not expressed. When the commandment comes, it becomes alive again. It lies dormant, like the beast at the door (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:7">Genesis 4:7</span>), until the law stirs it up. </p>
<p>The tendency of prohibitory law to provoke the will to resistance is frequently recognized in the classics. Thus, Horace : "The human race, presumptuous to endure all things, rushes on through forbidden wickedness" (Ode, 1, 3, 25). Ovid : "The permitted is unpleasing; the forbidden consumes us fiercely" (" Amores, "1, 19, 3)." We strive against the forbidden and ever desire what is denied "(Id., 1, 4, 17). Seneca :" Parricides began with the law, and the punishment showed them the crime "(" De Clementia," 1, 23). Cato, in his speech on the Oppian law; says : "It is safer that a wicked man should even never be accused than that he should be acquitted; and luxury, if it had never been meddled with, would he more tolerable than it will be now, like a wild beast, irritated by having been chained and then let loose" (Livy, 34, 4). </p>
<p>I found to be unto death. The A. V. omits the significant auth this. This very commandment, the aim of which was life, I found unto death. Meyer remarks : "It has tragic emphasis." So Rev., this I found. The surprise at such an unexpected result is expressed by I found, literally, was found [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρεθη] </span></span> </p>
