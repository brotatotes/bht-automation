<p>Beareth witness with our spirit [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμμαρτυρει τω πνευματι ημων] </span></span>. This rendering assumes the concurrent testimony of the human spirit with that of the divine Spirit. Others, however, prefer to render to our spirit, urging that the human spirit can give no testimony until acted upon by the Spirit of God. </p>
