'Apo from, implies abstraction, the attention turned from other objects. The classical student will recall the watchman in the opening of Aeschylus' "Agamemnon," awaiting the beacon which is to announce the capture of Troy. Creature [κτισεως] . The word may signify either the creative act (as Romans 1:20), or the thing created (Mark 10:6; Mark 13:19; Mark 16:15; Colossians 1:23; Hebrews 4:13). See on 1 Peter 2:13. Here in the latter sense. The interpretations vary : 1. The whole unredeemed creation, rational and irrational. 2. All creation, except humanity. The point of difference is the inclusion or exclusion of humanity. The second explanation is preferable, the non - rational creation viewed collectively, animate and inanimate. Equivalent to all nature. Waiteth [απεκδεχεται] . Only in Paul and Hebrews 9:28. The whole passage, with the expressions waiting, sighing, hoping, bondage, is poetical and prophetic. Compare Psalms 19:2; Isaiah 11:6; Isaiah 14:8; Isaiah 55:12; Isaiah 65:17; Ezekiel 31:15; Ezekiel 37:0.; Habakkuk 2:11.
