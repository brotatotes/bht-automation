<p>Vanity [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ματαιοτητι] </span></span>. Only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17">Ephesians 4:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:18">2 Peter 2:18</span>. Compare the kindred verb became vain (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21">Romans 1:21</span> note), and the adjective vain (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:20">1 Corinthians 3:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18">1 Peter 1:18</span>). Vain is also used to render kenov (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:14">1 Corinthians 14:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:58">1 Corinthians 14:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:6">Ephesians 5:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:20">James 2:20</span>). Kenov signifies empty; mataiov idle, resultless. Kenov, used of persons, implies not merely the absence of good, but the presence of evil. So <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:20">James 2:20</span>. The Greek proverb runs. "The empty think empty things." Mataiov expresses aimlessness. All which has not God for the true end of its being is mataiov. Pindar describes the vain man as one who hunts bootless things with fruitless hopes. Plato (" Laws, "735) of labor to no purpose. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eze+13:6">Ezekiel 13:6</span>," prophesying vain things [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ματαια] </span></span>, " things which God will not bring to pass. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:9">Titus 3:9</span>. Here, therefore, the reference is to a perishable and decaying condition, separate from God, and pursuing false ends. </p>
<p>By reason of Him who hath subjected [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τον υποταξαντα] </span></span>. God, not Adam nor Satan. Paul does not use the grammatical form which would express the direct agency of God, by Him who hath subjected, but that which makes God 's will the occasion rather than the worker - on account of Him. Adam 's sin and not God 's will was the direct and special cause of the subjection to vanity. The supreme will of God is thus removed "to a wider distance from corruption and vanity" (Alford).</p>
