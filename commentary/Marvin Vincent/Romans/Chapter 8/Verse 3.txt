<p>What the law could not do [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το αδυνατον του νομου] </span></span>. Lit., the impossible (thing) of the law. An absolute nominative in apposition with the divine act - condemned sin. God condemned sin which condemnation was an impossible thing on the part of the law. The words stand first in the Greek order for emphasis. </p>
<p>In the likeness of sinful flesh. Lit., of the flesh of sin. The choice of words is especially noteworthy. Paul does not say simply, "He came in flesh" (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:2">1 John 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>), for this would not have expressed the bond between Christ 's manhood and sin. Not in the flesh of sin, which would have represented Him as partaking of sin. Not in the likeness of flesh, since He was really and entirely human; but, in the likeness of the flesh of sin : really human, conformed in appearance to the flesh whose characteristic is sin, yet sinless. "Christ appeared in a body which was like that of other men in so far as it consisted of flesh, and was unlike in so far as the flesh was not flesh of sin" (Dickson). 42 For sin [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περι αμαρτιας] </span></span>. The preposition expresses the whole relation of the mission of Christ to sin. The special relation is stated in condemned. For sin - to atone, to destroy, to save and sanctify its victims. </p>
<p>Condemned. Deposed from its dominion, a thing impossible to the law, which could pronounce judgment and inflict penalty, but not dethrone. Christ 's holy character was a condemnation of unholiness. Construe in the flesh with condemned.</p>
