<p>Shall lay - to the charge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγκαλεσει] </span></span>. Only here by Paul. Frequent in Acts. See Rom 19:38, 40; Rom 23:28, 29; Rom 26:2, 7. Lit., "to call something in one." Hence call to account; bring a charge against. </p>
<p>The following clauses are differently arranged by expositors. I prefer the succession of four interrogatives : Who shall lay? etc. Is it God ? etc. Who is He that condemneth? Is it Christ ? etc. 47</p>
