Thus, the spirit of the world; another spirit; spirit of slumber. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:8">Romans 11:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:12">1 Corinthians 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:4">2 Corinthians 11:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:7">2 Timothy 1:7</span>. Where these expressions are in negative form they are framed after the analogy of the positive counterpart with which they are placed in contrast. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span> : " Ye have not received the spirit of bondage, but of adoption. In other cases, as <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>, where the expression is positive, the conception is shaped according to Old - Testament usage, where spirits of evil are conceived as issuing from, and dependent upon, God, so far as He permits their operation and makes them subservient to His own ends.

It is also closely associated with life, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:2">Romans 8:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:6">Romans 8:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:13">Romans 8:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:4">1 Corinthians 14:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:5">1 Corinthians 14:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:25">Galatians 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:8">Galatians 6:8</span>. It is the common possession of the Church and its members; not an occasional gift, but an essential element and mark of the christian life; not appearing merely or mainly in exceptional, marvelous, ecstatic demonstrations, but as the motive and mainspring of all christian action and feeling. It reveals itself in confession (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>); in the consciousness of sonship (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:16">Romans 8:16</span>); in the knowledge of the love of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:5">Romans 5:5</span>); in the peace and joy of faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:6">1 Thessalonians 1:6</span>); in hope (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:5">Romans 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:13">Romans 14:13</span>).

Through the Spirit they are sanctified (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span>). It manifests itself in the diversity of forms and operations, appearing under two main aspects : a difference of gifts, and a difference of functions. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1">1 Corinthians 5:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:11">1 Corinthians 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:3">Ephesians 4:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:4">Ephesians 4:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:30">Ephesians 4:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="php+2:1">Philippians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4">1 Corinthians 12:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:7">1 Corinthians 12:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:11">1 Corinthians 12:11</span>. </p>
<p>As compared with the Old - Testament conception, Paul 's pneuma "is the ruach of the Old Testament, conceived as manifesting itself after a manner analogous to, but transcending, its earlier forms. It bears the same characteristic marks of divine origin, of supernatural power, of motive energy in active exercise - standing in intimate relation to the fuller religious life and distinctive character and action of its recipients. But while in the Old Testament it is partial, occasional, intermittent, here it is general, constant, pervading. While in the Old Testament, as well as in the New, its forms of manifestation are diverse, they are expressly referred under the New to one and the same Spirit. While in the Old Testament they contemplate mainly the official equipment of men for special work given them to perform, they include under the New the inward energy of moral action in the individual, no less than the gifts requisite for the edification of the Church; they embrace the whole domain of the religious life in the believer, and in the community to which he belongs. The pneuma of the apostle is not the life - breath of man as originally constituted a creature of God; but it is the life - spirit of" the new creation "in which all things have become new" (Dickson). </p>
<p>With the relation of this word to yuch soul is bound up the complicated question whether Paul recognizes in the human personality a trichotomy, or threefold division into body, soul, and spirit. On the one side it is claimed that Paul regards man as consisting of body, the material element and physical basis of his being; soul, the principle of animal life; and spirit, the higher principle of the intellectual nature. On the other side, that spirit and soul represent different sides or functions of the one inner man; the former embracing the higher powers more especially distinctive of man, the latter the feelings and appetites. The threefold distinction is maintained chiefly on the basis of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:12">Hebrews 4:12</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:43">Hebrews 4:43</span> On the distinction from yuch soul, see, further, on ch. 11 3.</p>
