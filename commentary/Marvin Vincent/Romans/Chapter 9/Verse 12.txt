Elder - younger [μειζων - ελασσονι] . Lit., greater - smaller. Compare Genesis 27:1, here the Hebrew is : "Esau his great son;" Sept., presbuteron elder. Genesis 29:16, Sept., "The name of the greater was Leah, and the name of the younger [τη νεωτερα] Rachel." See a similar use in Aeschylus, "Agamemnon," 349, "Neither old [μεγαν] nor young [νεαρων] could escape the great net of slavery." While in these cases "greater" and "smaller" are evidently used as older and younger, yet the radical meaning is greater and less, and the reference is not to age, but to their relative position in the theocratic plan. Meizwn greater, occurs in forty - four passages in the New Testament, and in no case with the meaning elder. Compare Genesis 25:23 be stronger; Sept., uJperexei; shall surpass. The reference, if to the persons of Jacob and Esau, is to them as representatives of the two nations. See Genesis 25:23. Historically the Edomites, represented by Esau, were for a time the greater, and surpassed the Israelites in national and military development. Moses sent envoys to the king of Edom from Kadesh, asking permission to pass through his country, which was refused, and the Edomite army came out against Israel (Numbers 20:14-21). Later they were "vexed" by Saul (1 Samuel 14:47), and were conquered and made tributary by David (2 Samuel 8:14). Their strength was shown in their subsequent attempts to recover independence (2 Kings 8:20, 2 Kings 8:21; 2 Kings 14:7; 2 Chronicles 28:17). Their final subjugation was effected by John Hyrcanus, who incorporated them into the Jewish nation and compelled them to be circumcised.
