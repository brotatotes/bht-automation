<p>Elder - younger [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζων - ελασσονι] </span></span>. Lit., greater - smaller. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:1">Genesis 27:1</span>, here the Hebrew is : "Esau his great son;" Sept., presbuteron elder. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+29:16">Genesis 29:16</span>, Sept., "The name of the greater was Leah, and the name of the younger [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη νεωτερα</span></span>] Rachel." See a similar use in Aeschylus, "Agamemnon," 349, "Neither old [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγαν</span></span>] nor young [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεαρων</span></span>] could escape the great net of slavery." While in these cases "greater" and "smaller" are evidently used as older and younger, yet the radical meaning is greater and less, and the reference is not to age, but to their relative position in the theocratic plan. Meizwn greater, occurs in forty - four passages in the New Testament, and in no case with the meaning elder. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:23">Genesis 25:23</span> be stronger; Sept., uJperexei; shall surpass. The reference, if to the persons of Jacob and Esau, is to them as representatives of the two nations. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:23">Genesis 25:23</span>. </p>
<p>Historically the Edomites, represented by Esau, were for a time the greater, and surpassed the Israelites in national and military development. Moses sent envoys to the king of Edom from Kadesh, asking permission to pass through his country, which was refused, and the Edomite army came out against Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="nu+20:14-21">Numbers 20:14-21</span>). Later they were "vexed" by Saul (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1sa+14:47">1 Samuel 14:47</span>), and were conquered and made tributary by David (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2sa+8:14">2 Samuel 8:14</span>). Their strength was shown in their subsequent attempts to recover independence (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ki+8:20">2 Kings 8:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ki+8:21">2 Kings 8:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ki+14:7">2 Kings 14:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="2ch+28:17">2 Chronicles 28:17</span>). Their final subjugation was effected by John Hyrcanus, who incorporated them into the Jewish nation and compelled them to be circumcised.</p>
