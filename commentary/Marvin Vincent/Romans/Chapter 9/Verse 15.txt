I will have mercy - compassion [ελεησω - οικτειρησω] , See Exodus 33:19. For mercy see on 2 John 1:3; Luke 1:50. The former verb emphasizes the sense of human wretchedness in its active manifestation; the latter the inward feeling expressing itself in sighs and tears. Have mercy therefore contemplates, not merely the sentiment in itself, but the determination of those who should be its objects. The words were spoken to Moses in connection with his prayer for a general forgiveness of the people, which was refused, and his request to behold God 's glory, which was granted. With reference to the latter, God asserts that His gift is of His own free grace, without any recognition of Moses ' right to claim it on the ground of merit or service.
