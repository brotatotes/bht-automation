He will [θελει] . In a decretory sense. See on Matthew 1:19. Hardeneth [σκληρυνει] . Only here by Paul. See on hard, Matthew 25:24; Jude 1:14; James 3:4. Three words are used in the Hebrew to describe the hardening of Pharaoh 's heart. The one which occurs most frequently, properly means to be strong, and therefore represents the hardness as foolhardiness, infatuated insensibility to danger. See Exodus 14:0. The word is used in its positive sense, hardens, not merely permits to become hard. In Exodus the hardening is represented as self - produced (Exodus 15:32; Exodus 9:34), and as produced by God (Exodus 4:21; Exodus 7:3; Exodus 9:12; Exodus 10:20, Exodus 10:27; Exodus 11:10). Paul here chooses the latter representation.
