<p>He will [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελει] </span></span>. In a decretory sense. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:19">Matthew 1:19</span>. </p>
<p>Hardeneth [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκληρυνει] </span></span>. Only here by Paul. See on hard, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:24">Matthew 25:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:14">Jude 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:4">James 3:4</span>. Three words are used in the Hebrew to describe the hardening of Pharaoh 's heart. The one which occurs most frequently, properly means to be strong, and therefore represents the hardness as foolhardiness, infatuated insensibility to danger. See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:0">Exodus 14:0</span>. The word is used in its positive sense, hardens, not merely permits to become hard. In Exodus the hardening is represented as self - produced (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:32">Exodus 15:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+9:34">Exodus 9:34</span>), and as produced by God (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:21">Exodus 4:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:3">Exodus 7:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+9:12">Exodus 9:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+10:20">Exodus 10:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+10:27">Exodus 10:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ex+11:10">Exodus 11:10</span>). Paul here chooses the latter representation.</p>
