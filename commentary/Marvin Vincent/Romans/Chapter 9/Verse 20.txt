O man. Man as man, not Jew. That repliest [ο ανταποκρινομενος] . Only here and Luke 14:6. Lit., to contradict in reply : to answer by contradicting. Thus, in the case of the dropsical man (Luke 14:0.), Jesus answered [αποκριθεις] the thought in the minds of the lawyers and Pharisees by asking, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath ?" Then He asked, "Who of you would refuse on the Sabbath to extricate his beast from the pit into which it has fallen?" And they were unable to answer Him in reply : to answer by contradicting Him. So here, the word signifies to reply to an answer which God had already given, and implies, as Godet observes, the spirit of contention.
