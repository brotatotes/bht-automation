<p>That my people which was not my people [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον ου λαον μου, λαον μου] </span></span>. The Greek is much more condensed. "I will call the not - my - people my - people." See <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ho+1:6-9">Hosea 1:6-9</span>. The reference is to the symbolical names given by the prophet to a son and daughter : Lo Ammi not my people, and Lo Ruhama not having obtained mercy. The new people whom God will call my people will be made up from both Jews and Gentiles. Hosea, it is true, is speaking of the scattered Israelites only, and not of the Gentiles; but the ten tribes, by their lapse into idolatry had put themselves upon the same footing with the Gentiles, so that the words could be applied to both. A principle of the divine government is enunciated "which comes into play everywhere when circumstances reappear similar to those to which the statement was originally applied. The exiled Israelites being mingled with the Gentiles, and forming one homogeneous mass with them, cannot be brought to God separately from them. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:22">Isaiah 49:22</span> represents the Gentiles as carrying the sons of Israel in their arms, and their daughters on their shoulders, and consequently as being restored to grace along with them" (Godet).</p>
