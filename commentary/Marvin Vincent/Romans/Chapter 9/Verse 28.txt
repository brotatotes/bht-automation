<p>For the reading of the A. V. read as Rev. The Lord will execute His word upon the earth, finishing and cutting it short. Difficulty arises on account of the variation in the Greek text and the difference between the reading adopted by the best authorities and the Septuagint, and again on account of the variation of the latter from the Hebrew. The Hebrew reads : Extirpation is decided, flowing with righteousness, for a consumption and decree shall the Lord of hosts make in the midst of all the land. The Rev. adopts the shorter reading of the Septuagint. </p>
<p>Work [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογον] </span></span>. It does not mean work, but word, utterance, doctrine; not decree, which logov never means, though the idea may underlie it. Better reckoning. </p>
<p>Finish - cut short [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συντελων - συντεμνων] </span></span>. The preposition sun together signifies summarily; bringing to an end at the same time. Compare the peculiar word ejkolobwqhsan should be shortened, in <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:22">Matthew 24:22</span>, and see note. Omit in righteousness.</p>
