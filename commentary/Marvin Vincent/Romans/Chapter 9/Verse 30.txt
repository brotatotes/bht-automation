Attained [κατελαβεν] . See on perceived, Acts 4:13, and taketh, Mark 9:18; John 1:5. Compare attained (efqasen, ver. 31). Rev., arrive at. See on Matthew 12:28. The meaning is substantially the same, only the imagery in the two words differs; the former being that of laying hold of a prize, and the latter of arriving at a goal. The latter is appropriate to following after, and is carried out in stumbling (ver. 32). Even [δε] or and that. Subjoining something distinct and different from what precedes, though not sharply opposed to it. Attained righteousness, that is not that arising from these works, but from faith.
