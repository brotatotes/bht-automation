<p>In Isaac. Not in Ishmael, though Ishmael also was the seed of Abraham. The saying of <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:12">Genesis 21:12</span> is directly added without it is written or it was said, because it is assumed to be well known to the readers as a saying of God. The Hebrew is : "in Isaac shall posterity be named to thee." In the person of Isaac the descendant of Abraham will be represented and recognized. The general principle asserted is that the true sonship of Abraham does not rest on bodily descent. </p>
<p>Shall be called [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κληθησεται] </span></span>. Named. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:17">Romans 4:17</span>. Others, called from nothing. But the promise was made after Isaac was born.</p>
