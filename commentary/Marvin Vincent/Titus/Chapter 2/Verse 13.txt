Looking for [προσδεχομενοι] . In Pastorals only here. Comp. Mark 14:43; Luke 2:25; Luke 12:36. In this sense not in Paul. Primarily, to receive to one's self, admit, accept. So Luke 14:2; Romans 16:2; Philippians 2:29. That which is accepted in faith, is awaited expectantly. That blessed hope [την μακαριαν ελπιδα] . The phrase N. T. o. Makariov blessed, very often in the Gospels. See on Matthew 5:3. In Pastorals, with the exception of this passage, always of God. In Paul, only of men, and so usually in the Gospels. Elpida hope, the object of hope. Why the hope is called blessed, appears from 2 Timothy 4:8; Philippians 3:20, etc. Comp. Jude 1:21, and 1 Peter 1:13. And the glorious appearing [και επιφανειαν της δοξης] . Kai is explanatory, introducing the definition of the character of the thing hoped for. Looking for the object of hope, even the appearing, etc. Glorious appearing is a specimen of the vicious hendiadys by which the force of so many passages has been impaired or destroyed in translation. Rend. appearing of the glory. Of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ [του μεγαλου θεου και σωτηρος ημων χριστου ιησου] . For Jesus Christ rend. Christ Jesus. Megav great with God, N. T. o, but often in LXX According to A. V. two persons are indicated, God and Christ. Revelations with others rend. of our great God and Savior Christ Jesus, thus indicating one person, and asserting the deity of Christ. I adopt the latter, although the arguments and authorities in favor of the two renderings are very evenly balanced. 155
