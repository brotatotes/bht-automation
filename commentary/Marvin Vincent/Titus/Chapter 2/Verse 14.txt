See Exodus 19:5; Exodus 23:22; Deuteronomy 7:6; Deuteronomy 14:2; Deuteronomy 26:18. The phrase was originally applied to the people of Israel, but is transferred here to believers in the Messiah - Jews and Gentiles. Comp. 1 Peter 2:10. Periousiov is from the participle of perieinai to be over and above : hence periousia abundance, plenty. Periousiov also means possessed over and above, that is, specially selected for one's own; exempt from ordinary laws of distribution. Hence correctly represented by peculiar, derived from peculium, a private purse, a special acquisition of a member of a family distinct from the property administered for the good of the whole family. Accordingly the sense is given in Ephesians 1:14, where believers are said to have been sealed eijv ajpolutrwsin thv peripoihsewv with a view to redemption of possession, or redemption which will give possession, thus = acquisition. So 1 Peter 2:9, where Christians are styled laov eijv peripoihsin a people for acquisition, to be acquired by God as his peculiar possession. Comp. 1 Thessalonians 5:9; 2 Thessalonians 2:14, and peripoieisqai to acquire, Acts 20:28. The phrase kaqarizein laon to purify the people, in LXX, Nehemiah 12:30; Judith 16 18. Zealous [ζηλωτην] .
