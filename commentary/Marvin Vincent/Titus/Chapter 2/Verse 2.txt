Note that <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:0">1 Timothy 3:0</span>, in treating of church officers, deals only with Bishops and Deacons. Nothing is said of Presbyters until chapter verse, where Timothy's relations to individual members of the church are prescribed. These church members are classified in this and the following verses as old men, old women, younger men, servants. In LXX presbuthv is occasionally interchanged with presbeuthv ambassador.
