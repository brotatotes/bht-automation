Once in LXX, 3 Macc 5 45, katasthma maniwdev the maddened state into which the war - elephants were excited. Hence the state in which one habitually bears himself - his deportment or demeanor. As becometh holiness [ιεροπρεπεις] . N. T. o. LXX, 4 Macc. 9 25; 11 20. In the Theages (wrongly ascribed to Plato), tw uiJei to onoma eqou kai iJeroprepev you have given your son (Theages) an honorable and reverend name (122 D). It means beseeming a sacred place, person, or matter. Thus Athenaeus, seven, of one who had given a sacred banquet, says that the table was ornamented iJeroprepestata in a manner most appropriate to the sacred circumstances. The meaning here is becoming those who are engaged in sacred service. This is the more striking if, as there is reason to believe, the presbutidev represented a quasi - official position in the church. See on 1 Timothy 5:3, and comp. 1 Timothy 2:10; Ephesians 5:3. Ephesians 5:1 Ephesians 5:51 False accusers [διαβολους] . Better, slanderers. See on Matthew 4:1, and 1 Timothy 3:6, 1 Timothy 3:11. Given to much wine [οινω πολλω δεδουλωμενας] .
