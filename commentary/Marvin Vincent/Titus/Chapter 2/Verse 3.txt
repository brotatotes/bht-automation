<p>Aged women [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτιδας] </span></span>. N. T. o. See on presbuterai, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:2">1 Timothy 5:2</span>. </p>
<p>Behavior [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταστηματι] </span></span>. N. T. o. See on katastolh apparel, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:9">1 Timothy 2:9</span>. It means, primarily, condition or state. Once in LXX, 3 Macc 5 45, katasthma maniwdev the maddened state into which the war - elephants were excited. Hence the state in which one habitually bears himself - his deportment or demeanor. </p>
<p>As becometh holiness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιεροπρεπεις] </span></span>. N. T. o. LXX, 4 Macc. 9 25; 11 20. In the Theages (wrongly ascribed to Plato), tw uiJei to onoma eqou kai iJeroprepev you have given your son (Theages) an honorable and reverend name (122 D). It means beseeming a sacred place, person, or matter. Thus Athenaeus, seven, of one who had given a sacred banquet, says that the table was ornamented iJeroprepestata in a manner most appropriate to the sacred circumstances. The meaning here is becoming those who are engaged in sacred service. This is the more striking if, as there is reason to believe, the presbutidev represented a quasi - official position in the church. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:3">1 Timothy 5:3</span>, and comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:10">1 Timothy 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3">Ephesians 5:3</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:1">Ephesians 5:1</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:51">Ephesians 5:51</span> False accusers [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαβολους] </span></span>. Better, slanderers. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:1">Matthew 4:1</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:6">1 Timothy 3:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:11">1 Timothy 3:11</span>. </p>
<p>Given to much wine [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οινω πολλω δεδουλωμενας] </span></span>. More correctly, enslaved to much wine. The verb only here in Pastorals. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8">1 Timothy 3:8</span>. </p>
<p>Teachers of good things [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλοδιδασκαλους] </span></span>. N. T. o. o LXX, o Class.</p>
