See on James 1:21. In N. T. kakia is a special form of vice, not viciousness in general, as Cicero, Tusc. 4 15, who explains by "vitiositas, a viciousness which includes all vices." Calvin, on Ephesians 4:32, defines as "a viciousness of mind opposed to humanity and fairness, and commonly styled malignity." The homily ascribed to Clement of Rome, describes kakia as the forerunner [προοδοιπορον] of our sins (x). Malice is a correct translation.
