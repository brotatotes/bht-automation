<p>Malice [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακια] </span></span>. Only here in Pastorals. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:21">James 1:21</span>. In N. T. kakia is a special form of vice, not viciousness in general, as Cicero, Tusc. 4 15, who explains by "vitiositas, a viciousness which includes all vices." Calvin, on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:32">Ephesians 4:32</span>, defines as "a viciousness of mind opposed to humanity and fairness, and commonly styled malignity." The homily ascribed to Clement of Rome, describes kakia as the forerunner [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προοδοιπορον</span></span>] of our sins (x). Malice is a correct translation.</p>
