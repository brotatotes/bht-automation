<p>Kindness [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρηστοτης] </span></span>. Only here in Pastorals. Elsewhere only in Paul. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:12">Romans 3:12</span>, and on easy, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:30">Matthew 11:30</span>. </p>
<p>Love [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλανθρωπια] </span></span>. Love is too vague. It is love toward men; comp. verse 2. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:2">Acts 28:2</span> : filanqrwpwv kindly, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:3">Acts 27:3</span> (note). While it cannot be asserted that the heretical characteristics noted in the Pastoral Epistles point collectively to any specific form of error, it is true, nevertheless, that certain characteristics of the economy of grace are emphasized, which are directly opposed to Gnostic ideas. Thus the exhortation that supplications be made for all men, supported by the statement that God wills that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:1">1 Timothy 2:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:4">1 Timothy 2:4</span>), is in the teeth of the Gnostic distinction between men of spirit and men of matter, and of the Gnostic principle that the knowledge [<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγνωσις</span></span>] of truth was only for a limited, intellectual class. To the same effect is the frequent recurrence of all, for all, in connection with the saving and enlightening gifts of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:6">1 Timothy 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:10">1 Timothy 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:13">1 Timothy 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:11">Titus 2:11</span>). So here : not only has the saving grace of God appeared unto all (chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="vnt" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:11">Titus 2:11</span>), but it has revealed itself as kindness and love to man as man.</p>
