1 Corinthians 1:18.  For the word of the cross is to them that are perishing that are pursuing a course ‘whose end is destruction’  foolishness. For if to bid them change their whole course of life would startle them, to expect them to do it by believing in one who died a malefactor’s death would seem nothing less than sheer absurdity.
	 But unto us who are being saved in the sense of Acts 2:40; Acts 2:44 (and see 2 Corinthians 2:15),  it is the power of God- divinely efficacious. Yes, the Gospel attracts or repels, is embraced or rejected, according to the standard by which it is judged and the object in life of those who hear it. This is the great lesson of the parable of the Sower; and see John 5:44; John 7:17; John 12:42-43.
