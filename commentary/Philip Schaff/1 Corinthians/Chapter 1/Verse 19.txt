<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:19">1 Corinthians 1:19</span>. For it is written (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:14">Isaiah 29:14</span>, nearly as in LXX.), I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the prudence of the prudent will I reject. The ‘wise’ are those who pride themselves on their insight, their capacity to search into principles, their speculative attainments; the <em> ‘</em> prudent’ pique themselves on their shrewdness, as men of affairs, their sharp-wittedness or sagacity; a distinction familiar alike to the Greek thinkers and to Jewish moralizers (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span>). God’s purpose to expose the insufficiency of both these, as a cure for the maladies of our fallen nature and a guide to happiness, is variously held forth in the Old Testament (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:20">Isaiah 8:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:14">Isaiah 29:14</span>, here quoted; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jer+8:9">Jeremiah 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jer+9:23-24">Jeremiah 9:23-24</span>, etc.); but it is only in the Gospel of Christ that this is done effectually and once for all.
