1 Corinthians 1:20.  Where is the wise? in general; but particularly,  where is the scribe? to whom the  Jew  looks up for wisdom;  where is the disputer of this world? to whom the  Greek  defers.  hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? [1]  [1] The scholar will observe that two Greek words are here translated by the same word ‘world;’ the former expressing the world in respect of its  reigning character,  the latter the  sphere  itself in which that character is displayed.
