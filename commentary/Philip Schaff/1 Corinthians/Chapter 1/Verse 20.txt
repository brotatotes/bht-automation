<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:20">1 Corinthians 1:20</span>. <strong> Where is the wise?</strong> in general; but particularly, <strong> where is the scribe?</strong> to whom the <em> Jew </em> looks up for wisdom; <strong> where is the disputer of this world?</strong> to whom the <em> Greek </em> defers. <strong> hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</strong> [1] </p>
<p style="margin-left:1.08em;"> [1] The scholar will observe that two Greek words are here translated by the same word ‘world;’ the former expressing the world in respect of its <em> reigning character, </em> the latter the <em> sphere </em> itself in which that character is displayed.
