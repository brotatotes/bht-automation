1 Corinthians 1:21.  For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God. Full time and swing He gave it, to try what it could do for humanity, before disclosing His own sovereign remedy; and it was only when it failed to find any clear light, and get any solid footing on the most elementary of all religious truths, and the knowledge of God Himself (Romans 1:21; Romans 1:23; Romans 1:28; Acts 17:23; Acts 17:27),  that it pleased God by the foolishness of the preaching meaning the message itself, the thing preached  to save them that believe for in the believing reception of it lies its whole saving efficacy.
