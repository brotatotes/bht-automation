1 Corinthians 1:22.  Since the Jews ask for signs and the  Greeks seek after wisdom. [2] The Jews, when our Lord was on earth, clamoured for ‘signs’ supernatural attestation of His claims; but the more they got of them, the less they were satisfied; contrariwise, the Greeks looked with philosophic indifference on the whole field of the supernatural, regarding even the resurrection of Christ as adding but one more to the already plentiful stock of childish fables, fit only for the vulgar. Give us ‘wisdom,’ was their cry anything that will carry its own evidence on its face. Nor was this state of things a peculiarity of that time. Every age has its ‘Jews’ and its ‘Greeks’ its blind devotees of supernatural interposition and its self-sufficient worshippers of human reason.
	 [2] The absence of the Greek article here denotes the  class,  but in such cases the insertion of the article is more suited to the English idiom.
