1 Corinthians 1:25.  Because the foolishness of God  (in the doctrine of the Cross)  is wiser than  (the wisdom of)  men; and the weakness of God  (in the Gospel)  is stronger than  (the strength of)  men. It is the ramâ€™s-horn which throws down the walls of Jericho, the jawbone of an ass which slays its thousand men, and the sling and the stone which lays low alike the giant power and wisdom of men.
	Is proof wanting? Look, says the apostle, at the  classes  whence its conquests are chiefly gained.
