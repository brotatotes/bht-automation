1 Corinthians 1:27.  but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put  to shame them that are wise. There is here a significant transition from the  neuter  of the one class to the  masculine  of the other, to express a passage from the contemptible to the esteemed.  and God chose the weak things of the world that he might put to shame the things that are strong.
