1 Corinthians 1:28.  and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, did God choose, yes, and the things that are not, or as we might say, ‘the  nothings,’ to bring to nought the things that are. Five times in succession is the neuter gender purposely used here the foolish things, the weak things, the base things, the despised things, the no-things, emphatically to hold forth and reiterate the mean condition of the generality of converts, as persons of no culture, of no weight, of no account in any respect in fact, mere nobodies. And is not this the history of all the early triumphs of Christianity? And with what design?
