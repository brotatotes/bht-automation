<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:29">1 Corinthians 1:29</span>. <strong> that no flesh should glory before God. </strong> This has been all along the design of God in the erection and growth of His kingdom of grace (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jer+9:23">Jeremiah 9:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:27">Romans 3:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:8-9">Ephesians 2:8-9</span>); and in the first conquests of the Gospel He kept this end specially in view. No doubt, when once gained to Christ, the rich, the mighty, and the noble were quite as ready to cast their crowns at His feet as the poorest, weakest, rudest of this world; and in doing so, they made a sacrifice proportionably nobler. But had the early converts been chiefly drawn from such influential classes, would not the triumphs of Christianity have been set down rather to the rank, power, and culture which it had contrived to draw within its pale than to the Divine power residing in and going along with the message itself? Now it was to preclude all such surmises that, by a Divine ordination, the bulk of the converts in every church and for a long time consisted of the despised classes, that none might have even a pretext for glorying before God.
