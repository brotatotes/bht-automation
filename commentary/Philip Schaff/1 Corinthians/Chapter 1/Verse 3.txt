1 Corinthians 1:3.  Grace onto you and peace. What in the Old Testament is called ‘mercy,’ is in the New Testament expressed by the richer and more comprehensive term ‘grace,’ that Divine affection whence flows all salvation to Adam’s fallen family (Ephesians 2:10). The first result of this, when it enters any soul, is ‘peace.’ And here both these are solicited for the Corinthian converts,  from God our Father  as the primal  Fountain,  and the  Lord Jesus  as the mediatorial  Channel  of these precious rifts; and by coupling both Persons in one and the same invocation, their equality in the Godhead is brightly confirmed.
