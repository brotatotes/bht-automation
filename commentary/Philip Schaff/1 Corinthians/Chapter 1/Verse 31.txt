1 Corinthians 1:31.  that according as it is written (Jeremiah 9:23, abridged),  He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. Well may we ask with the apostle elsewhere, Where is boasting, then? It is excluded. By what law on what principle? Why, on every principle, and at every avenue, by this method of peerless wisdom.â€™
