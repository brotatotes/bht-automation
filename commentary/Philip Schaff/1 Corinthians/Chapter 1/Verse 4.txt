1 Corinthians 1:4.  I thank my God always.. .for the grace . . . given you in Jesus Christ  (cf. 1 Corinthians 1:2, “Sanctified in Christ Jesus”). But lest it should seem strange that a Church so rich in ‘grace’ should be so severely blamed as in the sequel of this Epistle, the apostle is careful to specify what he refers to namely, certain gifts which are all too compatible with a low-toned moral and spiritual character.
