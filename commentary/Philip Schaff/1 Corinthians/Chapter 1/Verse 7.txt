1 Corinthians 1:7.  so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ. The  faith  of His first coming, to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself, and the  hope  of His second appearing without sin unto salvation to them that look for Him
	these were the two wings on which Christians were taught to mount up as eagles in their spiritual life (1 Thessalonians 1:8-10).
