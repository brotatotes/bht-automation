SUMMARY. ‘I beseech you, study unity. Instead of this, I hear ye are ranging yourselves into schools   and parties, each contending for its favourite preacher as if your salvation hung upon him. Thus is the glory of Christ obscured the attention which ought to be directed to Him being drawn away to the preacher of Him. For myself, fearful   of such a result, I have studiously eschewed every art that might fascinate you with the servant rather than the Master. And though knowing right well that since the cross of Christ is distasteful to the natural man, alike in Jew and Gentile, the ranks   of the Church would be filled for the most part from those who are of no account in the world, I knew   also that its Divine power to transform and   ennoble all who receive it would thus be only more signally displayed, and glory only more manifestly accrue to God.’
