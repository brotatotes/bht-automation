<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:24">1 Corinthians 1:24</span>. <strong> But unto them which are</strong> (internally and efficaciously) <strong> called, both Jews and Greeks</strong>, <strong> Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God</strong> a power by Jews never dreamt of, and a wisdom unimagined by the subtlest Greeks. And if so, why need the preacher, to please the Jew, hide the obnoxious features of his message, and to feed the intellectual pride of the Greek laboriously strive to show how rational the Gospel is?
