1 Corinthians 10:10.  Neither murmur ye, as some of them [2]  murmured, and perished by the destroyer.  The reference here is not so much to the rebellion of Korah and Dathan (Numbers 16:0), as most critics think, for there was nothing in the Corinthian Church analogous to this, but rather to that rebellion which broke out on the return of the spies, when the Lord “sware that they should not enter into His rest” (Numbers 13:14), than which nothing could better fit in with the other warnings here given. he might be led unconsciously to substitute “Lord” here for “Christ.” On these grounds such critics as De Wette, Neander, Billroth, Osiander, and Stanley adhere to the received text here. Still, since the external evidence for “Lord” here decidedly preponderates, and there is nothing obliging us to resist it, we must adopt it. And Meyer does so, contrary to his usual practice in such cases.
	 [2] “Also” in the received text is certainly not genuine.
