1 Corinthians 10:12.  Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall  for since our greatest danger lies in a presumptuous, confidence of our safety (of which Peterâ€™s fall is the great outstanding example), our true safety will be found to lie in a humble distrust of ourselves, and continual watchfulness.
