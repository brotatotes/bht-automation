<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:13">1 Corinthians 10:13</span>. <strong> There hath no temptation taken you but such</strong> <strong> as man can bear </strong> <em> Gr. ‘</em> but what is human.’
	</p>
<p><strong> but God is faithful, who will not suffer</strong> <strong> you</strong> <strong> to be tempted above that ye are able </strong> to bear and overcome.
	</p>
<p><strong> but with the temptation make also the way of escape. </strong> There seems here an evident reference to some special temptation, the severity of which was pressing upon the Corinthians at this time; and as in the next verse the apostle resumes the topic which gave rise to this long digression with the stringent call to “flee from idolatry,” there can be no doubt that the “temptation” specially referred to here arose from difficulties on this subject which were pressing so hard as to endanger their whole Christianity, if not resolutely met.
