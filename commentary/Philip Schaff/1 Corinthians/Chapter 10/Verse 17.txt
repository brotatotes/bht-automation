How much more when Christians, as “one body,” “eat of that bread” in which their Lord would have them see “His body broken for them,” and “drink of that cup” in which they were to see “His blood of the new covenant shed for them,” Thus was their common oneness with Him, in the first instance, and in virtue of this, their oneness among themselves, visibly set forth and palpably expressed.
