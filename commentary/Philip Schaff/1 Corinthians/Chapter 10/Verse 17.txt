1 Corinthians 10:17.  seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we all partake of the one bread.  In all ancient times friends were made one over a common meal; much more is this oneness manifested when, on some festal occasion, great principles are represented and celebrated by those whose principles they are; and they become thereby afresh welded together, impledged to each other, and stimulated to common action in prosecution of those principles. How much more when Christians, as “one body,” “eat of that bread” in which their Lord would have them see “His body broken for them,” and “drink of that cup” in which they were to see “His blood of the new covenant shed for them,” Thus was their common oneness with Him, in the first instance, and in virtue of this, their oneness among themselves, visibly set forth and palpably expressed.
	 Now comes the conclusion to be drawn from this in relation to idolatrous feasts that, on the same principle, all who partake of idol feasts partake of the idolatries themselves, and have fellowship with the idol-deities there represented.
