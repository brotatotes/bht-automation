1 Corinthians 10:18.  Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they which eat the sacrifices communion with the altar? Part of the animal was consumed on the altar, and the rest was divided between the priest and the offerer (Leviticus 7:15, Leviticus 8:31). Thus both “had communion with the altar,” that is, with the sacrifice laid on it, and, through it, with the glorious Object of all true worship.
