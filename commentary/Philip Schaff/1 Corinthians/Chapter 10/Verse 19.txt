1 Corinthians 10:19.  What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is any thing, or that an idol is any thing? [1]   That such an inference might be drawn from the strain of the apostleâ€™s reasoning, is only conceivable on supposition of a pretext being wanted to justify attendance on idolatrous feasts. No, says the apostle.
	 [1] Such is the correct order of these clauses.
