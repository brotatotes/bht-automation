1 Corinthians 10:22.  What? do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? The allusion is to Deuteronomy 32:21, and almost the words are from it. The word “jealousy,” as applied to God, seems to express the sense of slighted love in one of two wedded parties towards the other; an idea familiar to the Old Testament with reference to Jehovah’s relation to His people Israel, and their treatment of Him. Here this idea is transferred to  Christ;  for since “the table of  the Lord”  certainly means Christ’s eucharistic table, “the Lord,” whom they “provoked to jealousy” by partaking both of it and of idol-feasts, must be the Lord Jesus. (And so, with true critical instinct, De Wette, Meyer, Stanley, and Alford understand it) In fact, as all the relations of Jehovah to His covenant people under the ancient economy were appropriated by our Lord to Himself who  served Himself Heir to them all  so  our apostle, applying these to Him as a matter of course, puts the question, Mean ye to try how far His patience will go? Would ye try your strength against His?
