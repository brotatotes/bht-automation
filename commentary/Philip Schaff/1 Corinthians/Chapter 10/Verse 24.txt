<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:24">1 Corinthians 10:24</span>. Let no man seek his own, but <em> each </em> his neighbour’s <em> good</em> <em> Gr. </em> ‘his neighbour’s things,’ meaning his benefit, in the widest sense. As this is God’s own design in all His works, but pre-eminently in redemption, so it is the grand law of the Christian life, and the chiefest ornament of the Christian character. Now for the application.
