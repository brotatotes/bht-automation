1 Corinthians 10:24. Let no man seek his own, but  each  his neighbour’s  good  Gr.  ‘his neighbour’s things,’ meaning his benefit, in the widest sense. As this is God’s own design in all His works, but pre-eminently in redemption, so it is the grand law of the Christian life, and the chiefest ornament of the Christian character. Now for the application.
