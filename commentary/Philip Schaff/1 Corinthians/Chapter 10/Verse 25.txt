<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:25">1 Corinthians 10:25</span>. <strong> Whatsoever is sold in the shambles</strong> <strong> the flesh-market</strong> <strong> eat, asking no question for conscience sake</strong> not another’s conscience, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:29">1 Corinthians 10:29</span>. Bengel, De Wette, and others so take it; but that would yield no proper sense here. The meaning is, ‘ <em> for your own </em> conscience sake.’ ‘If ye go to market, and there see flesh exposed for sale, inquire not whence it came; for should it turn out to have been sacrificed to an idol, your conscience would be defiled by purchasing it; but buy it simply as food, which you can do with a good conscience.’ (So Neander, Meyer, Alford.)
