1 Corinthians 10:25.  Whatsoever is sold in the shambles  the flesh-market  eat, asking no question for conscience sake not another’s conscience, as in 1 Corinthians 10:29. Bengel, De Wette, and others so take it; but that would yield no proper sense here. The meaning is, ‘  for your own  conscience sake.’ ‘If ye go to market, and there see flesh exposed for sale, inquire not whence it came; for should it turn out to have been sacrificed to an idol, your conscience would be defiled by purchasing it; but buy it simply as food, which you can do with a good conscience.’ (So Neander, Meyer, Alford.)
	What   follows confirms this sense.
