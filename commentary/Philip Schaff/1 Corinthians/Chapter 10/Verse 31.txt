1 Corinthians 10:31.  Whether therefore ye eat,  or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.  ‘To give specific directions for every supposable case is neither needful nor possible, for what is proper in one case may in another be the reverse; but, if only guided by the great principle of what is and what   is not for the glory of God, you will be at no loss how to act.’
