1 Corinthians 10:5.  Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased in point of fact, with all that came out of Egypt by Moses, save Caleb and Joshua, because they “had another spirit with them, and followed the Lord fully” (Numbers 14:24).  for  (as the issue shewed)  they were overthrown in the wilderness.
