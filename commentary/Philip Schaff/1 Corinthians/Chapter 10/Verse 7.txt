<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:7">1 Corinthians 10:7</span>. <strong> Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:6">Exodus 32:6</span>), <strong> The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. </strong> The word means to ‘play’ anyhow; more especially to dance to the sound of music. Here it means to <em> dance religiously </em> round an idol; the idol in this case being the golden calf (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:6-19">Exodus 32:6-19</span>). And could any warning be more appropriate to those who thought themselves at liberty, as Christians, to sit down to an idol feast and partake of its idolatrous offerings knowing them to be such on the plausible pretext that an idol was nothing, and all wholesome food allowable to Christians? But this case only suggests another, no less appropriate.
