 Attendance at Idolatrous Feasts, 1 Corinthians 10:14 to 1 Corinthians 11:1
 When the first love of the converts began   to cool, and, as a   natural consequence, they drew closer to their heathen acquaintances and fellow-citizens, invitations would be given them, in the first instance, to the private houses of their friends, and,   by and by, to the religious festivals of their townsmen. For accepting such invitations plausible reasons would easily occur. How such inconsistency was viewed by our apostle we are now to see.
