1 Corinthians 11:25.  In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant [1]  in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink   it,   in remembrance of me.  Here the memorial design of the Lord’s Supper is reiterated, as if to teach that, if this was not its sole design, yet any view of it, which either sinks this altogether or throws it into the shade, must be erroneous.
	 [1] The word here rendered “covenant” is that which the Greek of the Old Testament constantly uses for the Hebrew word “covenant:  ”  and as there is here a manifest allusion to Exodus 24:8 “Behold  the blood of the covenant,  which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words” we cannot doubt that the word should be rendered “covenant” here. But since in classical Greek this word signifies a ‘testament,’ ‘disposition,’ or ‘will,’ and since in Hebrews 9:16-17, the writer seems clearly to avail himself of both ideas gliding out of the  covenant  idea into that of  testament it is not necessary altogether to exclude that idea here. For since it is by the death of Christ that the eternal inheritance becomes ours who believe, one can hardly resist regarding that death as,  in its effect,  that of a testator, bequeathing to us the eternal inheritance.
