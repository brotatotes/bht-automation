1 Corinthians 11:26.  For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, [1]  ye proclaim the Lord’s death  hold it forth as, to you, a certain fact  till he come. [2] This clearly shows not only that the observance of this ordinance was designed to continue from the very time of its first institution till the second appearing of the Lord Jesus, but that the belief of the one as the great  accomplished fact of the past,  and of the other as the great  expected fact of the future,  was as the substance of all Christianity proclaimed by every participant of the Lord’s Supper, and the  faith  of the one and the  hope  of the other are the two “wings as eagles,” on which the Christian mounts up heavenward.

	 [2] The scholar should observe that άν before έλθη is justly omitted in the best text (including the oldest MSS.) Its presence in the received text obscures the  certainty  of the event, which its absence conveys.
