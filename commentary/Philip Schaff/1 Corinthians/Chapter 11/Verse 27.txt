<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] Not “this” bread, as in die received text; “the cup” stands even in the received text.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [2] The Authorised Version has “and drink this cup," though the text before them had “or.” No doubt this was done from fear of giving countenance to the Romish practice of withholding the cup from the laity. But besides that it is die duty of translators to let the text speak for itself, they needed to have DO such apprehension, since the next verse expressly supposes the communicant to partake of both elements “solet him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.” Tyndale, with a noble fidelity, has “or” in his version, and so have Calvin and Beza.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> shall be guilty of the body and the</strong> [1] <strong> blood of the Lord </strong> guilty, that is, of His death. So Chrysostom and Grotius, we think, correctly understand this. The only objection is, that it seems too harsh to charge this upon unworthy communicants. But to eat and drink at the Lord’s Table as at a common meal (for that is the case supposed) is certainly to put an affront upon the body and blood of Christ; and since, in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:29">1 Corinthians 10:29</span>), those who “sin wilfully after having received the knowledge of the truth,” are said to “count the blood of the covenant a common thing” ( <em> i.e.</em> nothing differing from other blood), the two expressions seem so entirely akin, in the general conception intended by them, that there seems no good reason for shrinking from this as the idea in view.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] The article before “blood” is according to the true text.
