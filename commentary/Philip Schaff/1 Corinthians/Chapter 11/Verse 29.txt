1 Corinthians 11:29.  For he that eateth or drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.  (The evidence for the omission of “unworthily” and “Lord’s” before “body” is, we think, conclusive; but the sense is the same.) “Discerning the body” sounds very abrupt to us who are accustomed to the fuller form; but it is perhaps all the more emphatic. [1] By “eating and drinking Judgment” is meant incurring the effects of the Divine displeasure.
	 [1] Stanley’s idea that “the body” here means the Christian society seems too far-fetched to require notice.
