<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:29">1 Corinthians 11:29</span>. <strong> For he that eateth or drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body. </strong> (The evidence for the omission of “unworthily” and “Lord’s” before “body” is, we think, conclusive; but the sense is the same.) “Discerning the body” sounds very abrupt to us who are accustomed to the fuller form; but it is perhaps all the more emphatic. [1] By “eating and drinking Judgment” is meant incurring the effects of the Divine displeasure.

<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] Stanley’s idea that “the body” here means the Christian society seems too far-fetched to require notice.
