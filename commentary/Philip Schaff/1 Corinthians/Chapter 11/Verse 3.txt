But <strong> </strong> (since on this point you may need further direction) <strong> I would have you know that the head of every man </strong> (‘male’) <strong> is</strong> <strong> Christ. </strong> Though this is true universally for “He hath given Him power over all <strong> </strong> flesh, “and to be” Head over all things to the Church,” it is of Christians that the apostle is here speaking in whose case it is used in a higher sense and more particularly of the male sex.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> and the head of the woman </strong> (under Christ) <strong> is the man, and the head of Christ is God</strong> considered as the Father’s Servant (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:1">Isaiah 42:1</span>, Isa 53:13), in which capacity He spake when He said, “I glorified Thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which Thou hast given me to do” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:4">John 17:4</span>). “Though He was a <strong> </strong> Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He suffered,” and “became obedient even unto death.” It is in this aspect of mutual relation in the work of redemption that “the Head of Christ is God” with which His proper Personal Divinity is in entire harmony. These general truths are now applied to the case in hand.
