1 Corinthians 11:31.  But [1]  if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.  ‘If we did but take the case of our spiritual condition faithfully into our own hands, we should thus take it (so to speak) out of God’s hands, and so avert the tokens of His Fatherly displeasure.’
	 [1] “For” is not correct here.
