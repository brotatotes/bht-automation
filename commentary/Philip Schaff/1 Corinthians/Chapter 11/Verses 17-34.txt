<p>The immediate object of this section is to denounce certain gross disorders in the celebration of this ordinance which had crept into the Corinthian church; but this gives occasion to so comprehensive and remarkable an account of the original institution and design of that ordinance, that it is fitted to settle all the questions about it which have divided Christians, and every clause of it has riveted the attention of earnest Christians, and helped them much in their conception and observance of it.
