1 Corinthians 12:13.  For in (or ‘by’) one Spirit were we all baptised into one body. . . and were all made to drink of [1]  one Spirit. The figure of “drinking” of the Spirit may have been suggested by the allusion to their water baptism at the time of their conversion; only that was external, whereas the thing here meant by the figure is internal, and in that view of it such language was familiar in the Old Testament (Isaiah 12:3; Isaiah 44:3; Isaiah 55:1).
	 [1] Not “into one Spirit,” the evidence against which is decisive.
