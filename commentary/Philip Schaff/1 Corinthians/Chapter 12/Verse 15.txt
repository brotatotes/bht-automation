<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] Some excellent critics read this and the following questions affirmatively "it is not therefore not of the body. Winer and Buttmann hold that the interrogative sense is against the usag e of the Greek language with two such negatives ού ού. Bengel was the first to affirm this, and he was followed by Billroth, R ückert, Hofmann, and Meyer, while Lachmann and Tischendorf print their Greek text affirmatively. The grammatical principle is undoubtedly correct; <em> </em> but since very much depends in such cases on how the statement is <em> concerned </em> by the writer, we incline to think that the real sense is conveyed quite as correctly by the interrogative form as by the affirmative. And if legitimate at all, there can be little doubt that it is most accordant with the lively style and strain of the argument; and so Judge the majority of the best critics Erasmus, Beza, Griesbach, De Wette, Osiander, Alford. Stanley, while in his notes he leaves the choice to the reader, renders it interrogatively in his translation. </p>
