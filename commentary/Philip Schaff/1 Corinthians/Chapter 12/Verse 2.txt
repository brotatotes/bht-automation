1 Corinthians 12:2.  Ye know that when [2]  ye were Gentiles  (heathen),  ye were    led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might be led: ‘As for your gods, they were “dumb idols” which, whatever crafty priests and interested statesmen might say, never uttered a word to their votaries. Our worship, as children of Israel, imperfect as it was, was intelligent; yours was blind and senseless: we, when we hearkened to our prophets, were listening to the voice of the living God; ye were imposed upon by your “blind guides” at [their will. No wonder, then, that in the exercise of spiritual gifts some confusion should arise among you, and some instruction should be needed how to use them. Accordingly, under three general principles such instruction is now given.  [2] That ὅτι, ὅτε   is the true reading here (“that when”) is quite clear: and thoug h the construction in this case is imperfect, requiring another ητε (“ye were”) to be understood, this deviation from the natural tense, after “that,” is not unexampled in good Greek.
