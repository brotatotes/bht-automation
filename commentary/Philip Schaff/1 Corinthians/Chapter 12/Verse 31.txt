1 Corinthians 12:31.  But desire earnestly the greater [1]  gifts referring to those mentioned in chap. 14, which were such as tended to edify both the audience and the gifted themselves, in preference to those which merely evinced supernatural power. But ere this comes to be formally handled, an episode on something incomparably “greater” than even these “greater gifts” is here introduced, an episode of surpassing grandeur the way of LOVE. (That chap. 13 is strictly parenthetical, is plain from the first verse of chap. 14, which links itself on, not to 13, but to 1 Corinthians 12:31, as its immediate sequel.)  and a still more excellent way shew I unto you.  [1] Not the “better gifts,” as in the received text.
