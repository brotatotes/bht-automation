But ere this comes to be formally handled, an episode on something incomparably “greater” than even these “greater gifts” is here introduced, an episode of surpassing grandeur the way of LOVE. (That chap. 13 is strictly parenthetical, is plain from the first verse of chap. 14, which links itself on, not to 13, but to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span>, as its immediate sequel.) <strong> and a still more excellent way shew I unto you. </strong></p>
