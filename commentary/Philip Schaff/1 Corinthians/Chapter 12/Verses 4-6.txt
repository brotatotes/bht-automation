<p>Ver. 6. <strong> And there are diversities of workings, but the</strong> <strong> same God, who worketh all things in all</strong> as the absolute Fountain of all good, with whom, by eternal arrangement, all the functions of the Son and of the Spirit are regarded as originating. The systematic precision of these statements as to the way in which the operations of grace for behoof of the Church are distributed among the Persons of the one Godhead, is eminently noteworthy.
