1 Corinthians 13:10.  but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away  the partial of necessity giving place to the perfect, the temporary to the enduring. In the next two verses this is beautifully illustrated by the change that takes place from childhood to manhood, in ideas, in interests, in occupations.
