1 Corinthians 13:11.  When I was a child, I spake as a child  prattling;  I felt as a child, I thought (or ‘reasoned’)  as a child. My thoughts were all a child’s thoughts, my notions of persons and things were childish, and my way of connecting things as causes and effects, premises and conclusions was ludicrous.
	 now that I am become a man,  I have put away childish things  wondering ever so spake, felt, and thought.
