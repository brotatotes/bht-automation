<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:11">1 Corinthians 13:11</span>. <strong> When I was a child, I spake as a child </strong> prattling; <strong> I felt as a child, I thought</strong> (or ‘reasoned’) <strong> as a child.</strong> My thoughts were all a child’s thoughts, my notions of persons and things were childish, and my way of connecting things as causes and effects, premises and conclusions was ludicrous.
	</p>
<p><strong> now that I am become a man,</strong> <strong> I have put away childish things </strong> wondering ever so spake, felt, and thought.
