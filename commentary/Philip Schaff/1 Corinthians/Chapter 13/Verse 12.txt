1 Corinthians 13:12.  For new we see in a mirror [1]  darkly  or ‘dimly:’  Gr.  ‘in a riddle.’ The mirrors of those days were not like ours, but polished metallic surfaces, reflecting objects but imperfectly; and since the figure seemed to be  behind  the mirror, the observer seemed to see “through” it. Bengel notes an allusion here to Numbers 12:8, “With him (Moses) will I speak face to face, and not  in dark speeches ” (or ‘in enigmas’).
	 [1] The word certainly means “mirror” here, as in James 1:23, with which may be compared the Greek verb of the same in 2 Corinthians 3:18, not “window,” as some have been led to think from the word “through” being used with it.
