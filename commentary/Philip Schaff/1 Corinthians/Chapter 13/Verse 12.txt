Bengel notes an allusion here to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:8">Numbers 12:8</span>, “With him (Moses) will I speak face to face, and not <em> in dark speeches</em> ” (or ‘in enigmas’).

<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] The word certainly means “mirror” here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:23">James 1:23</span>, with which may be compared the Greek verb of the same in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>, not “window,” as some have been led to think from the word “through” being used with it.

<p><strong> but then face to face </strong> without a veil, with no obscurity.

<p><strong> now I know in part, but then shall I know</strong> (or ‘know fully’) <strong> even as also I have been known</strong> (or ‘known fully’). As we are here perfectly known of God, so hereafter we shall ourselves know perfectly; in the sense, however, not of absolute but of relative perfection.
