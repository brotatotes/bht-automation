1 Corinthians 13:6.  rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth. Love’s native element is goodness and truth: apart from the truth it knows neither father nor mother, husband nor wife, son nor daughter: its antipathies are only with evil, its sympathies with truth and with those who believe and know the truth, who are ready to “contend earnestly” for it, and if need be to suffer for it. “Thou canst not bear them that are evil,” is the noble testimony borne from heaven to the church of Ephesus (Revelation 2:2). The home of love is among the truthful, the believing, the holy; it breathes its own air in the “kingdom of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.” The four concluding characteristics of love are the crowning ones; and, in view of this, the style changes, and in the successive clauses there is a   fine roll, singularly musical and uplifting.
