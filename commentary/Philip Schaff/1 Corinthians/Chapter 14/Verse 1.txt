1 Corinthians 14:1.  Follow after love, yet desire earnestly spiritual  gifts: ‘If I exalt love above all mere gifts, this is not meant to disparage the gifts, nor to quench the desire to possess and exercise them; only in doing so, forget not that the best and most useful of them all is prophecy.’
