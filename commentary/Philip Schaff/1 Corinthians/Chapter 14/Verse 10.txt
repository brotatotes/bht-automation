1 Corinthians 14:10.  There are so many kinds of  voices (articulate languages [1] )  in the world, and no   kind   is without signification without definite meaning.
	 [1] In the LXX. this word is so used; and in 2 Peter 2:16 the ass that reproved Balaam is called the  voiceless  ass, because its bray is no articulate language.
