1 Corinthians 14:13.  Wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray  i.e. pray ‘in the spirit,’  that he may interpret not ‘pray for the gift of interpretation’ (as most of the old interpreters understood it), but so pray in the unknown tongue as having in view the need of interpretation to give the sense of his prayer. What follows shews this to be the meaning (and so in substance Bengel, De Wette, Osiander, Meyer, and Alford understand it).
