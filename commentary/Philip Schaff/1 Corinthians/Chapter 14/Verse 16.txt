1 Corinthians 14:16.  Else if thou shalt bless probably the Eucharistic blessing, though equally applicable to blessing at any meal (see Acts 27:35),  with the spirit speaking the blessing in an unknown tongue,  how shall he that filleth  the place of the unlearned the place of one unacquainted with the language used,  say the Amen  (the accustomed response)  at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest?  This practice of giving the audible response was borrowed from the synagogue, in which all the worshippers were expected to utter the Amen with such heartiness as to shew that they entered fully into what was said. In the Christian assemblies, says Justin Martyr  (circ.  A.D. 150), “after prayers bread and wine are offered, and water, and the president, according to his ability, offers up prayers and thanksgivings at once.”  (Apol.  c. 65, 67.) This allusion of the apostle to the cordial response of the hearers was much to the point, since it would be meaningless mockery if the thing uttered were unintelligible. In the light of these facts those churches have not done well, we think, that have dropped out the audible response the uttered “Amen” of the congregation, by which alone they have it in their power to express their cordial sympathy with what is uttered in prayer by the officiating minister.
