1 Corinthians 14:2.  For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not onto men,  but unto God the Giver of that gift;  for no man (in the absence of an interpreter)  understandeth him;  but in the spirit  (as distinct from his conscious understanding)  he speaketh mysteries (see 1 Corinthians 14:14-15). By “mysteries” is meant truths which, under the ancient economy, were but partially understood, but now fully disclosed (see on 1 Corinthians 2:7).
