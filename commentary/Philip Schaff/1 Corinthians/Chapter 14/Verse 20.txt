<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:20">1 Corinthians 14:20</span>. <strong> Brethren, be not children in understanding</strong> ‘power of judging,’ <strong> howbeit in malice be children,</strong> <strong> but in understanding be men </strong> <em> (Gr. </em> ‘perfect,’ ‘mature’): let your manly sense be applied to this subject, and ye will need neither direction nor persuasion from me: to babble in an unintelligible tongue better becomes children than men; but in that malice which rivalry, envy, and jealousy beget, ye do well to be as babes.
