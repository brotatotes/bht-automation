1 Corinthians 14:20.  Brethren, be not children in understanding ‘power of judging,’  howbeit in malice be children,  but in understanding be men   (Gr.  ‘perfect,’ ‘mature’): let your manly sense be applied to this subject, and ye will need neither direction nor persuasion from me: to babble in an unintelligible tongue better becomes children than men; but in that malice which rivalry, envy, and jealousy beget, ye do well to be as babes.
