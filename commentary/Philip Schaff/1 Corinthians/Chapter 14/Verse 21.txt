1 Corinthians 14:21.  In the law  (the Old Testament Scriptures)  it is written, By men of strange tongues, and by the lips of strangers   (Gr.  ‘of others’)  will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord  (Isaiah 28:11-12). The Jews were there warned that since they refused the simple teaching of God’s prophet, they should be taught in a tongue they understood not (that of the Assyrians). See Isaiah 36:11. And since this use of an “unknown tongue” was sent in judgment, see (says the apostle) that ye avoid using a tongue which none understand.
