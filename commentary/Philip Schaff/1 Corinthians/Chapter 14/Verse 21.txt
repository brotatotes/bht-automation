<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:21">1 Corinthians 14:21</span>. <strong> In the law </strong> (the Old Testament Scriptures) <strong> it is written, By men of strange tongues, and by the lips of strangers </strong> <em> (Gr. </em> ‘of others’) <strong> will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:11-12">Isaiah 28:11-12</span>). The Jews were there warned that since they refused the simple teaching of God’s prophet, they should be taught in a tongue they understood not (that of the Assyrians). See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+36:11">Isaiah 36:11</span>. And since this use of an “unknown tongue” was sent in judgment, see (says the apostle) that ye avoid using a tongue which none understand.
