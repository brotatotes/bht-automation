1 Corinthians 14:22.  Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving who, on hearing their own language spoken by those who themselves understood it not, would be filled with awe,  but prophesying is   for a sign,   not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.
