1 Corinthians 14:23.  If therefore the whole church be assembled together, and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving not members of the church, and not understanding the tongues, yet not hostile or captious, but such as those in Acts 2:13,  will they not say that ye  are mad? to the scandal of the Christian name.
