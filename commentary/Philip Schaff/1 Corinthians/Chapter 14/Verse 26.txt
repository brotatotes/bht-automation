1 Corinthians 14:26.  What is it, then, brethren?
	Does your practice correspond with the principles now expounded and enforced? Nay,  when ye come together, each one [1]  hath a psalm to “sing in the spirit” (see 1 Corinthians 14:15),  hath a doctrine some truth to utter “in the spirit,”  hath a revelation something revealed to him to be imparted to others,  hath a tongue, hath an interpretation [2] to speak in, while another has the interpretation to give; and each is eager to exercise his own gift, and all to speak at once, or one to step in before another. In place of this confusion,  Let all things be done unto edifying a sufficient general direction for the ordering of public worship. But since specific directions on some points of difficulty seem to have been asked, these are now subjoined.
	 [1] “Of you” is wanting in the best text.
	 [2] This natural order of the clauses putting “tongues” and the “interpretation” of them together has decisive textual authority; the received order has scarcely any good support.
