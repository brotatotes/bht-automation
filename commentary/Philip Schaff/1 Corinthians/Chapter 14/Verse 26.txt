<p>Does your practice correspond with the principles now expounded and enforced? Nay, <strong> when ye come together, each one</strong> [1] <strong> hath a psalm</strong> to “sing in the spirit” (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:15">1 Corinthians 14:15</span>), <strong> hath a doctrine</strong> some truth to utter “in the spirit,” <strong> hath a revelation</strong> something revealed to him to be imparted to others, <strong> hath a tongue, hath an interpretation</strong> [2] to speak in, while another has the interpretation to give; and each is eager to exercise his own gift, and all to speak at once, or one to step in before another. In place of this confusion, <strong> Let all things be done unto edifying</strong> a sufficient general direction for the ordering of public worship. But since specific directions on some points of difficulty seem to have been asked, these are now subjoined.

<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] “Of you” is wanting in the best text.
