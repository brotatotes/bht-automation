1 Corinthians 14:32.  and  (bear in mind that)  the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets not to other prophets (as unhappily is the view of Calvin, Beza, Estius, and one or two recent critics), else how could the apostle have said, “let the first keep silence”? as Meyer well asks, but ‘subject to their own control.’ The statement is thus in glorious contrast with demoniacal impulses, under no control of consciousness and rational will (such cases, for example, as Acts 16:16-18; Acts 19:13-16), and with all wild, incontrollable ravings. The Divine gift of prophecy left the gifted in full possession of their own faculties, enabling them to regulate and exercise their gift according to their own judgment of propriety as to the time and the mode of its exercise.
