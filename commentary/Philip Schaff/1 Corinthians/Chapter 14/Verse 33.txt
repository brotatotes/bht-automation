<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:33">1 Corinthians 14:33</span>. <strong> for God is not </strong> <strong><em> a God </em></strong> <strong> of confusion, but of peace</strong> such as His organs therefore ought to be, <strong> as in all the churches of the saints</strong> and so surely in yours. [1]
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:1.2em;"> [1] The last clause of this verse is made the first of the following sentence by a number of critics (De Wette. Billroth. Meyer, and formerly Stanley) reading thus: “As in all the churches of the saints let the women keep silence,” etc., and so Lachmann and Tischendorf print it in their texts: but not Tregelles. Their grounds appear to us weak, and the proposed connection seems far from natural. All <em> </em> the elder interpreters adhere to the punctuation of the received text, and they are followed by Neander, Osiander, and latterly by Alford.
