1 Corinthians 14:33.  for God is not   a God   of confusion, but of peace such as His organs therefore ought to be,  as in all the churches of the saints and so surely in yours. [1]
	 [1] The last clause of this verse is made the first of the following sentence by a number of critics (De Wette. Billroth. Meyer, and formerly Stanley) reading thus: “As in all the churches of the saints let the women keep silence,” etc., and so Lachmann and Tischendorf print it in their texts: but not Tregelles. Their grounds appear to us weak, and the proposed connection seems far from natural. All   the elder interpreters adhere to the punctuation of the received text, and they are followed by Neander, Osiander, and latterly by Alford.
