1 Corinthians 14:37. [1]    If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual (spiritually gifted),  let him (shew it by being ready to)  acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandment [2]  of the Lord  for inspiration cannot disown inspiration.
	 [1] This is not a new topic, as some deem it, but a sequel to the question of the verse before.  [2] The plural here is ill supported.
