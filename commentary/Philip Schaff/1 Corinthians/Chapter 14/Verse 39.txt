1 Corinthians 14:39.  Wherefore (to wind up),  my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy: ‘If bent on the possession and exercise of spiritual gifts, let prophecy be that which ye most covet,’  and  (at the same time)  forbid not to speak with tongues  though an inferior gift; for that would be to “quench the Spirit”
