1 Corinthians 14:40.  But (whatever ye do in particular cases)  let all things be done decently and in good order  alike as to time, manner, and measure.
	 Note.  This chapter discloses a state of things so singular to which no parallel can be found in later times, and one never to be looked for in future that one might think it furnishes no abiding instruction. But its spirit and principles will be found to go far beyond its details, and to have a voice for every age. For example, is  edification  the great thing to be aimed at in the public services of the Church? Surely, then, whatever is uttered should be intelligible to the worshippers, and hence to conduct the service in a dead language as is done over all Roman Christendom is to incur the apostolic rebuke: “If I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian to me” (1 Corinthians 14:11). Again, if edification is the standard by which to try all methods of public service, then, while everything in oratory, argument, and emotion which is fitted to carry home more powerfully the great truths and duties of the Gospel, is to be encouraged as gifts consecrated to the Master’s use all mere display of such gifts is not only out of place, but offensive alike to the eyes of God’s glory and the better feelings and even good taste of the hearers. Finally, those who subordinate, and all but extrude, preaching and teaching in the public assemblies of the Church giving an all but exclusive place to liturgical and eucharistical services have certainly neither imbibed the apostolical spirit nor copied the primitive model.
