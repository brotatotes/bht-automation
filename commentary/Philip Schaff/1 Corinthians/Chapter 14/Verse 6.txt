<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:6">1 Corinthians 14:6</span>. <strong> But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying,</strong> <strong> or of teaching?</strong> four things nominally, but in reality only two distinct ways of edifying by the exercise of spiritual gifts: the first pair (“revelation” and “knowledge”), those by which the speaker received supernaturally what he had to impart to others; the second pair (“prophesying” and “teaching”), those by which he gave it forth to his audience.
