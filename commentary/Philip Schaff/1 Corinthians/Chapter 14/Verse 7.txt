1 Corinthians 14:7.  Even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp the only kind of musical instruments known to the Greeks.  if they give not a distinction in the sounds or ‘notes,’ such as to denote some musical ideas,  how shall it be known what is piped or harped? what are the ideas intended.
