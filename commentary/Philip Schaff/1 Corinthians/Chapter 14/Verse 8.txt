1 Corinthians 14:8.  For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle? [1] Since in all ages the advance and retreat of armies have been directed by sound of trumpet, it is indispensable that the notes expressing each should be sufficiently distinct, the one from the other, and easily understood.
	 [1] The word signifies ‘war’ in general, but is also used for ‘battle’ in particular, as seems plainly the sense here. So in the best classical writers, and Hebrews 11:34; 1Ma 2:41 ; and surely also in Revelation 9:7; Revelation 16:14. So Meyer, Osiander, Stanley.
