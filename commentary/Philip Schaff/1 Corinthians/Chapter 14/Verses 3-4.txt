1 Corinthians 14:3.  But he that prophesieth speaketh  unto men edification (in general),  and comfort, and consolation.
	1 Corinthians 14:4.  He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself even when not understanding his own words (as the next verse shews to be meant). But how so? Feeling himself to be the immediate organ of the Spirit of God, he would be filled with awe, as standing very near to God,  but he that prophesieth edifieth the church (as already stated, 1 Corinthians 14:3).
