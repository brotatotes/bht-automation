 The certainty of the Resurrection of Believers from the Resurrection of Christ,  1-23.
	1 Corinthians 15:1.  Now I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which  also ye received, by which also ye are saved   (Gr.  ‘being saved,’ see on 1 Corinthians 1:18),  I make known, I say,   in  what words I preached  it unto you  that is, ‘on what footing I placed it,’ namely, on the fact of Christ’s resurrection  if ye hold  it fast, except ye believed in vain (2 Corinthians 6:1). The construction of the sentence is involved, but this seems clearly the sense.
