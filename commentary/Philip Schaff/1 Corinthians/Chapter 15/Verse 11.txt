<p><em> Note.</em> Observe here what the primitive apostolic Gospel consisted of a connected series of <em> historical facts, </em> the story of Christ’s life in its main features: dying for our sins according to the Scriptures; His resurrection from the dead attested by a multitude of competent witnesses; His ascension and session at the right hand of God, as evinced by the promised descent of the Spirit at Pentecost which was to be the proof of it; and His final coming again to judge the quick and the dead, always held forth. In this historical sense our Lord Himself had used the word “Gospel” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:9">Mark 14:9</span>). But not as bare historical facts were these held forth. The <em> truths </em> which the facts embodied constituted their whole value, and these as richly developed in the apostolic epistles were imparted along with the facts, as the converts were able to receive them, as is plain from this very epistle.
