<p><strong> the first-fruits of them that are asleep. </strong> The allusion here is as obvious as it is beautiful. On the morrow after the first Sabbath of the Passover, a sheaf of the first-fruits of the barley harvest was reaped and “waved before the Lord,” as a joyful pledge of the full harvest to come (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+23:10-11">Leviticus 23:10-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+23:15-16">Leviticus 23:15-16</span>). Even so, on the morrow after the first Sabbath of that Passover when our Lord was crucified being the first day of the week did He rise “the First-fruits of His sleeping people.”
