<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:23">1 Corinthians 15:23</span>. <strong> But each in his own order: Christ the first-fruits, then they that are Christ’s at his coming </strong> not each individual of the human race, but each party represented by its respective head. The one head involves “them that are his” in “death;” the other, for “them that are His” secures “life.” But it is <em> Humanity </em> that is meant in both cases as actually lost in Adam, and as actually recovered in Christ. But in this case, where (it may be asked) is the resurrection of the wicked here? The true answer is, Nowhere <em> here. “</em> Life” is a word which, when meant of the future state of believers, is <em> never used of that of the wicked. </em> (See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:47">John 6:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:54">John 6:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:56-57">John 6:56-57</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:26">John 11:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1-4">Ephesians 2:1-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:7">Ephesians 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:1-4">Colossians 3:1-4</span>.) So plain is this, that some now allege that the wicked will either not rise at all, or rise to be thereafter annihilated. But this not only is a baseless inference from anything said here, and contrary to the general teaching of all Scripture, but our Lord, while teaching the resurrection of all, expressly refuses to the wicked a resurrection to <em> life: “</em> The hour cometh in which all that are in the grave shall come forth; they that have done good unto the resurrection of <em> life, </em> and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of <em> judgment</em> ” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29">John 5:29</span>).
