<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:25">1 Corinthians 15:25</span>. <strong> For he must reign, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet. </strong> The “must” here seems a predictive “must,” as if he had said <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:6">Psalms 110:6</span> <em> must </em> be fulfilled; though there is a deeper necessity still, in the nature of the thing God cannot let His enemies for ever prevail. The “He” is not God the Father (as Bera, Bengel, and others take it), but Christ till <em> He </em> has subjugated all the enemies of His authority (as Chrysostom and the best modern interpreters hold).
