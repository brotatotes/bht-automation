1 Corinthians 15:26.  The last enemy that shall be abolished is death.  Though death to the believer, stripped of its sting, only ushers him into the presence of his Lord, yet in itself and to nature instinct with the love of life, it is utterly repulsive, rupturing a tie formed for perpetuity: it is the unnatural and abhorrent divorce of parties formed for sweet and uninterrupted fellowship. Viewed thus, it is even to the believer an “enemy,” but it is “the last.”
