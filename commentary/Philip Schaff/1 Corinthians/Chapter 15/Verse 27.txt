1 Corinthians 15:27.  For (as it is written, Psalms 8:6; Hebrews 7:0)  he put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection,  it is evident that he is excepted, who did put all things under him. The Son, as Mediator, is with His own royal hand to put all enemies under His feet. But since even this mediatorial authority of His is an authority  delegated  to Him by an eternal arrangement for saving purposes (John 3:35; John 5:22-23; John 17:2), this universal subjugation by the Son cannot include the subjugation of the Father to the Son. A strange truism this might seem; but it is only to pave the way for the remarkable piece of information which follows.
