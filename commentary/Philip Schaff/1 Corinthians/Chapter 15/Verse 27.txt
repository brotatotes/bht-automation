<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:27">1 Corinthians 15:27</span>. <strong> For</strong> (as it is written, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:6">Psalms 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:0">Hebrews 7:0</span>) <strong> he put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection,</strong> <strong> it is evident that he is excepted, who did put all things under him.</strong> The Son, as Mediator, is with His own royal hand to put all enemies under His feet. But since even this mediatorial authority of His is an authority <em> delegated </em> to Him by an eternal arrangement for saving purposes (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:35">John 3:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:22-23">John 5:22-23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span>), this universal subjugation by the Son cannot include the subjugation of the Father to the Son. A strange truism this might seem; but it is only to pave the way for the remarkable piece of information which follows.
