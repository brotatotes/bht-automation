<p><em> A Remonstrance, </em> 29-34.
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:29">1 Corinthians 15:29</span>. <strong> Else what shall they do which are baptised for the dead, if the dead rise not at all?</strong> <strong> why are they then baptised for the dead?</strong> a most difficult verse, of which the interpretations that have been given are endless. Some excellent expositors think it refers to the practice of Christians allowing themselves to be baptized as substitutes for converts who were candidates for baptism, but died before being baptized, in order thereby to complete their Christian standing and future prospects. That such a strange practice did exist in the early Church there can be no doubt; but among whom? Only among the heretical followers of Cerinthus, if we may credit Epiphanius <em> (Har. </em> xxviii. 7) and Tertulltan <em> (adv. Marc</em>. v. 10 ). T here is no ground to believe that it was practised in the orthodox churches, and the writers now quoted plainly regarded it as antichristian. But though this is admitted, it is urged that the apostle does not say, ‘What shall <em> we, </em> or <em> ye, </em> do?’ and as this seems a tacit rebuke of the practice, it may have soon ceased. Surely this scarcely deserves notice. Plainly, the allusion is to some act performed in expectation of future benefit to themselves, which benefit would be lost if the dead did not rise. And the following view which is that of all the best interpreters, ancient and modern alone suits the argument and agrees with the context: Foreseeing that their faith would cost them the loss of all things, perhaps of life itself, not a <strong> </strong> few converts, in proceeding to baptism, went to it as their virtual death-warrant, saying virtually with the apostle who knew not how soon it might become a reality ‘We who live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:11">2 Corinthians 4:11</span>). Our verse would then mean: ‘What is to become of those who in advancing to baptism do so as not knowing that it may not prove their death-warrant, if the dead rise not?’ What follows seems to confirm this.
