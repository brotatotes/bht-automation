<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] Four Greek prepositions are used in the New Testament to express the relation of Christ’s death to men as sinners, or to sin itself: (1)’i nstead of’ (άντί), <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>; (2) ‘on behalf of’ [ύπίρ], <em> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:19-20">Luke 22:19-20</span></em>, and here; (3) ‘on account of’ [δι ὰ] with the accus. propter), <em> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span></em>; (4) ‘about,’ ‘on the business of’ [περί], <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span>. The English word “for” expresses what is common to all these shades of meaning; but that which marks the distinction between them could only be expressed in English by a clumsy circumlocution.
