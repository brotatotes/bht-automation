1 Corinthians 15:3.  For I delivered unto you first of all  as being of primary importance (not ‘first’ in point of time)  that which I also received  by immediate revelation (Galatians 1:12)  how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; [1]
	 [1] Four Greek prepositions are used in the New Testament to express the relation of Christ’s death to men as sinners, or to sin itself: (1)’i nstead of’ (άντί), Matthew 20:28; (2) ‘on behalf of’ [ύπίρ],  Luke 22:19-20, and here; (3) ‘on account of’ [δι ὰ] with the accus. propter),  Romans 4:25; (4) ‘about,’ ‘on the business of’ [περί], Romans 8:3. The English word “for” expresses what is common to all these shades of meaning; but that which marks the distinction between them could only be expressed in English by a clumsy circumlocution.
