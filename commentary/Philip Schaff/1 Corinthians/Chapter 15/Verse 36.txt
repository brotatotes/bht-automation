1 Corinthians 15:36.  Senseless man! “ Fool” is too strong a rendering of the word here used (which is not that rightly rendered “fool” in Matthew 23:17; Matthew 23:19; Luke 11:40; Luke 12:20)  that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened, except it die  (compare John 12:24). ‘Not more truly does the grain require to die in the ground, to yield the bread we live on, and not more certainly does it yield it when thus first buried in the earthy than must this mortal body die in order to live again, nor more surely will it then rise to life.’ The next objection “with what manner of body do they come?” is answered more respectfully; for even Christians themselves may be troubled with it  and that which thou lowest, thou lowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind.  What is reaped is not precisely what is sown.
