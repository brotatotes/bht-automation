1 Corinthians 15:38.  but God giveth it a body even as it hath pleased him  at its original creation,  and to each seed a body of its own.  ‘In the vegetable world the Creator has shown inexhaustible resources in point of variety; how easy then to give to the body at its resurrection other properties than those of its mortal state, without destroying its essential identity?’
