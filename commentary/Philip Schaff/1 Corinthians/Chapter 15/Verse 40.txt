1 Corinthians 15:40.  There are also celestial bodies  not those of good angels (as Alford, after De Wette and Meyer, unnaturally), but, as the next verse clearly shews, what we call the ‘heavenly bodies’ sun, moon, and stars (as Bengel, Neander, and Stanley),  and bodies terrestrial  embracing all that distinguishes the organisms of earth from those of the heavens,  but the glory of  the celestial is one,  etc.
