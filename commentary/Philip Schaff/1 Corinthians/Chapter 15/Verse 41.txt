1 Corinthians 15:41.  There is one glory of  the sun,  etc. There is here no reference to the different degrees of glory among the saints in heaven (as some of the Greek fathers thought, and some moderns think). It is simply the amazing variety observable in the spangled vault above us, suggesting the reasonableness of expecting that the resurrection body will differ greatly from the mortal body, consistently with its essential identity. Accordingly, it is added.
	Ver, 42.  So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown.  Observe the word “sown” here, not ‘buried,’ for the similitude of seed cast into the earth is purposely continued,  in corruption  going quickly to decay,  it is raised in incorruption  undecaying.
