1 Corinthians 15:43.  it is sown in dishonour  becoming so repulsive that one is fain to say with Abraham, of the dearest object in life, “Bury my dead out of my sight,”  it is raised in glory  resplendent and ravishing to behold (compare Matthew 28:3; Luke 9:29-31; 1 John 3:2),  it is sown in weakness  the lifeless corpse absolutely powerless,  it is raised in power- endued with inexhaustible energy.
