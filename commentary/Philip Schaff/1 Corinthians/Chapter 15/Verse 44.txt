<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:44">1 Corinthians 15:44</span>. <strong> it is sown a natural body </strong> <em> Gr. </em> ‘an animal body,’ animated by the same vital principle which we have in common with the entire animal kingdom, <strong> it is raised a spiritual body </strong> not meaning a body simply of finer material than the present (the contrast does not lie in that), but a body whose animating principle is “the spirit,” or rational nature in its entirely purified and perfected condition; a body all whose organs and properties will be adapted to the inner and higher nature whose handmaid it is to be. (To be sober and safe on such a <strong> </strong> subject, one needs to keep strictly within the lines of these definitions.)

<p><strong> If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body</strong> [1] the one no less certain than the other and simply an advance from the lower to the higher.

<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] Such is certainly the correct reading.
