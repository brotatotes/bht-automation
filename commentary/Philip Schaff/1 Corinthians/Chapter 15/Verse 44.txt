1 Corinthians 15:44.  it is sown a natural body   Gr.  ‘an animal body,’ animated by the same vital principle which we have in common with the entire animal kingdom,  it is raised a spiritual body  not meaning a body simply of finer material than the present (the contrast does not lie in that), but a body whose animating principle is “the spirit,” or rational nature in its entirely purified and perfected condition; a body all whose organs and properties will be adapted to the inner and higher nature whose handmaid it is to be. (To be sober and safe on such a   subject, one needs to keep strictly within the lines of these definitions.)
	 If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body [1] the one no less certain than the other and simply an advance from the lower to the higher.
	 [1] Such is certainly the correct reading.
