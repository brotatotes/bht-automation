1 Corinthians 15:47.  The first man is of the earth.  The word signifies ‘rubbish,’ ‘loose earth,’ ‘dust’ (as in Genesis 2:7; Ecclesiastes 12:7 in LXX.),  the second man is of heaven. [1] The reference here is not to the properties of Christ’s flesh, as received from the Virgin, but to the properties of His resurrection or spiritual body, as is plain from what follows.
	 [1] “The Lord,” in the received text of this verse, is plainly an addition to the true text; and the remarks above will shew, we think, that it is not wanted.
