<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] Nothing better illustrates the vicious tendency of the early interpreters of the Epistles to give a hortatory turn to statements manifestly affirmative, than the reading “let us bear” in this verse; a reading which is much better supported by external evidence than the affirmative reading “we shall bear.” Critical editors who allow external evidence to overbear the most convincing internal evidence <strong> </strong> as Lachmann, Tregelles, and Tischendorf <strong> </strong> adopt this hortatory reading, making the duty of bearing the <em> moral </em> image of Christ to be what the apostle is expressing; and strange to say, Stanley follows them.

<p><em> Note.</em> So far is the question “with what body do they come?” from being unnatural, that after all the explanation now given, the difficulty will recur in this form: ‘If that which is sown is not that which dies, in what sense is it the resurrection of <em> the dead?</em> ’ <em> </em> In other words, ‘what is that in the two states which constitutes their <em> identity?</em> ’ The best answer to this question is, that the same difficulty applies to our personal identity through out the present life. From infancy to old age there is a <strong> </strong> constant flux in the particles of our natural body; insomuch that it is never at any one period in all respects precisely what it was at any other period; yet in every human being, by a law of his nature, there is an irresistible conviction that whether as <strong> </strong> child, youth, or man, he is <em> the tame </em> individual that he was from the first. Beyond that there is no need to go, nor perhaps shall we ever discover wherein precisely the <em> principle </em> of personal identity consists.
