<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:51">1 Corinthians 15:51</span>. <strong> Behold, I tell you a mystery</strong> in the sense so often explained a thing hitherto undisclosed, and even now known only by revelation. The disclosure here referred to, and the corresponding one in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>, appears to have been made exclusively to the apostle himself

<p><strong> We shall not all sleep</strong> the sleep of death; for a generation of believers will be “alive and remain when the Lord comes” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>), <strong> but we shall all be changed</strong> [1] from mortality to immortality, from corruption to incorruption; a change which in the living will be equivalent to both death and resurrection all but instantaneously occurring, while they are standing, it may be, on their feet, expecting nothing, and working their ordinary work.

<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] The absurd reading, “We shall all sleep, but we shall not all be changed,” is the reading, nevertheless, of two of the oldest MSS., of two later Uncials, and of one good Cursive. Lachmann prints it (though only Touching for its being the traditional text of the fourth century); and what is strange. Stanley has it in his text.
