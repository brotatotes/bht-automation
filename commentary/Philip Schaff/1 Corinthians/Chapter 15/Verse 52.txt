1 Corinthians 15:52.  in a moment, in    the twinkling of an eye a sublime expression of all but instantaneousness. There will, indeed, be an interval between the “resurrection” of the dead and the “changing” of the living saints for “the dead in Christ shall  rise first”  (1 Thessalonians 4:16), but so brief as to be but as the “twinkling of an eye,”  at the last trump  (“the trump of God,” 1 Thessalonians 4:16),  for the trumpet shall sound audibly, it would seem, as the signal for the winding up of all present things,  and we (the living)  shall be changed.
