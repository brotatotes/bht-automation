There will, indeed, be an interval between the “resurrection” of the dead and the “changing” of the living saints for “the dead in Christ shall <em> rise first” </em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>), but so brief as to be but as the “twinkling of an eye,” <strong> at the last trump </strong> (“the trump of God,” <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>), <strong> for the trumpet shall sound</strong> audibly, it would seem, as the signal for the winding up of all present things, <strong> and we</strong> (the living) <strong> shall be changed.
