1 Corinthians 15:53.  For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal  (of ours) [1]  put on immortality.  The same figure of “putting off” and “putting on” the  dress  of our present and future state is found in 2 Corinthians 5:2-4.
	 [1] Not “this mortal” of  mine,  as Meyer and Alford unnaturally take it. It is the mortality of the saints at large, a Cor. 1 Corinthians 5:1, “  our  earthly house.”
