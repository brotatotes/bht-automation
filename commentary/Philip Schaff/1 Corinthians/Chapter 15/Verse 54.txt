1 Corinthians 15:54.  And when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written  (Isaiah 25:8),  Death is swallowed up in victory. [1]   Having closed his argument with these sublime words of one prophet, the apostle’s bosom seems to have so swelled with emotion as to vent itself in the exultant exclamation of another prophet.
	 [1] The apostle departs here from the incorrect rendering of the LXX., and keeps nearer to the Hebrew, which runs thus: “He hath swallowed up death for ever,” But since this idea of ‘completeness’ is often rendered “unto victory” in the LXX. (as Job 36:7; Jeremiah 3:5), he avails himself of the phrase’ here, and all the rather, as after describing death as “the last enemy,” he delights to view the eternal extinction of death as a glorious “victory” over that “last enemy.”
