<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:56">1 Corinthians 15:56</span>. <strong> The sting of death is sin</strong> as it inflicts on the sinner a wound which is mortal (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:23">Romans 6:23</span>), <strong> and the power of sin is the law. </strong> Law <strong> </strong> is the expression of sovereign authority. A law which has “no power” to avenge the breach of itself is no law at all. But the Divine law has deadly “power,” since the breach of it is “death.” It will be seen that “sin”here is viewed in its <em> penal, </em> not its <em> moral </em> character; as criminal, as damnable, as, in its desert, deadly rather than as hateful (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:15">Romans 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:13">Romans 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:4">1 John 3:4</span>); though these two features of sin are of course inseparable.
