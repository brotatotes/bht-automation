1 Corinthians 15:56.  The sting of death is sin as it inflicts on the sinner a wound which is mortal (Romans 6:23),  and the power of sin is the law.  Law   is the expression of sovereign authority. A law which has “no power” to avenge the breach of itself is no law at all. But the Divine law has deadly “power,” since the breach of it is “death.” It will be seen that “sin”here is viewed in its  penal,  not its  moral  character; as criminal, as damnable, as, in its desert, deadly rather than as hateful (as in Romans 4:15; Romans 5:13; 1 John 3:4); though these two features of sin are of course inseparable.
