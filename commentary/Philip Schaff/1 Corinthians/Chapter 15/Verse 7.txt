1 Corinthians 15:7.  then he appeared to James  the James of the Acts (Acts 12:17; Acts 15:13; Acts 21:18 not Acts 12:2). This James, we believe, was “James the Lord’s brother,” not James the apostle. It has been thought that this special manifestation was what removed his last misgivings as to the claims of Jesus (Meyer); for up to a pretty late period of His public ministry, “even His brethren did not believe in Him” (John 7:5) that is, they were from time to time shaken by unfavourable appearances. It has been thought, too, that this special manifestation to James no doubt communicated to the apostles along with his blood-relationship to the Lord Himself, had something to do with the leading place assigned to him at Jerusalem.
