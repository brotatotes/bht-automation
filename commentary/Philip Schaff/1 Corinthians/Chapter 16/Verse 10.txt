We learn from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span> that Timothy and Erastus had been despatched to Macedonia; and Timothy, at least, had been instructed to go by Greece, so as to visit Corinth on his way (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:17">1 Corinthians 4:17</span>). Here he speaks of Timothyâ€™s reaching Corinth as uncertain, but in case he should do so, the apostle is anxious he should be well received, <strong> for he worketh the work of the Lord </strong> (Jesus), <strong> as I also do. </strong> See a similar fine testimony to Timothy in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:19-22">Philippians 2:19-22</span>.
