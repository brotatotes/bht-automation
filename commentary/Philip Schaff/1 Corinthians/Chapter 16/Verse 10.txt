1 Corinthians 16:10.  Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear.  Probably it was his youth (1 Timothy 4:12), his delicate constitution (1 Timothy 5:23), and possibly a certain gentleness and softness of character thereby engendered that dictated this kindly word, to encourage him should he come to Corinth. We learn from Acts 19:22 that Timothy and Erastus had been despatched to Macedonia; and Timothy, at least, had been instructed to go by Greece, so as to visit Corinth on his way (1 Corinthians 4:17). Here he speaks of Timothyâ€™s reaching Corinth as uncertain, but in case he should do so, the apostle is anxious he should be well received,  for he worketh the work of the Lord  (Jesus),  as I also do.  See a similar fine testimony to Timothy in Philippians 2:19-22.
