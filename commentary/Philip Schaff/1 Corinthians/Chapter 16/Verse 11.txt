1 Corinthians 16:11.  let no man therefore despise him: but set him forward  (at parting)  on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren those brethren, probably, mentioned in next verse, besides Erastus. And he came accordingly; for we find him with the apostle when he wrote his Second Epistle (2 Corinthians 1:1).
