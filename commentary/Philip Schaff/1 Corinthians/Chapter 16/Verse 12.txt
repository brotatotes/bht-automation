1 Corinthians 16:12.  But as touching Apollos our brother, I besought him  much to come unto you with the brethren probably a deputation of brethren (Titus and two others) sent to Corinth to complete its “collection” before the apostle’s arrival (2 Corinthians 8:6; 2 Corinthians 8:18; 2 Corinthians 8:22). If so, he probably wished Apollos to take the lead in that deputation, and Titus may only have been fixed on when Apollos declined. In this case, the apostle’s wish that he should go, and the declinature of Apollos, were alike honourable to the high principle and brotherly affection of both, considering the jealousies which their names had respectively aroused at Corinth. Apollos consented, as we shall presently see, to go at a future time; but this time seemed inopportune.
