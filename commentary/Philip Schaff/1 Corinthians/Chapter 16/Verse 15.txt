<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:15">1 Corinthians 16:15</span>. <strong> Now, I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruits of Achaia)</strong> the earliest Achaean converts. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span> this, according to the received text, is said of Epænetus; but the reading there is wrong: it should there be “the first-fruits of Asia unto Christ,” that is, of Roman or Proconsular Asia. Achaia was the name of Southern Greece, whose capital, Corinth, is doubtless meant here, though the province only is named, <strong> and that they have set themselves to minister to the saints</strong> made it their special care (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:3">Luke 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:7">Romans 12:7</span>). The reference here is not to the “collection,” but to such services as were within their own sphere.
