1 Corinthians 16:16.  that ye also be in subjection  unto such in respectful deference unto them, as estimable servants of Christ,  and to  every one that helpeth in the work, and laboureth.  The same collocation of “work” and “labour” is found in 1 Corinthians 15:58; 1 Thessalonians 1:3; Revelation 2:2.
