1 Corinthians 16:17.  And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas the same, no doubt, as in 1 Corinthians 16:15 and 1 Corinthians 1:15,  and Fortunatus [1]  and Achaicus of whom we only know that they were members of the Corinthian Church who had visited the apostle at Ephesus, and probably were the bearers of the Corinthian letter to him to which he refers in 1 Corinthians 7:1, and conveyed, probably, the present letter in reply to it,  for  that what was lacking on your part they supplied that is, ‘the lack of your own presence has been supplied by theirs as your deputies.’
	 [1] Bengel conjectures that this Fortunatus was a son of the above, and Stanley thinks him probably a stave who had received his master’s name; but (as Osiander pertinently asks) why not himself?
