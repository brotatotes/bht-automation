1 Corinthians 16:18.  For they refreshed my spirit and yours as if the refreshing of his spirit by their visit was a refreshing of theirs who sent them, so thoroughly does he identify his feelings with theirs (see 2 Corinthians 7:3),  acknowledge ye therefore them that are such recognise their worth, and   make them suitable returns.
