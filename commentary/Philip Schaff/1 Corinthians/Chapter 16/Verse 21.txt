This, it appears, was far from superfluous; for we learn from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span> that spurious Epistles were palmed off in his name, to enlist his authority for things which he condemned. It was his custom to employ an amanuensis, to whom he dictated his Epistles, merely adding a closing salutation with his own hand. The sole exception is the Epistle to the Galatians, which he tells us he wrote in <strong> </strong> large characters (as the word means) with his own hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:11">Galatians 6:11</span>).
