	1 Corinthians 16:5.  But I will  come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I do pass through Macedonia ‘I   am going to do so.’ (Those who wrote the subscription to this Epistle, misunderstanding these words, as if they meant, ‘I am now passing through Macedonia,’ say that it “was written from Philippi” (see Acts 16:12); whereas the eighth verse of this chapter makes it quite clear that it was written from Ephesus.) The apostle had given the Corinthians to expect two visits from him, one on his way to, the other on his return from, Macedonia (2 Corinthians 1:15-16). He now announces only  one  visit, and that on his return journey. For this change of plan he had been captiously charged with “lightness” (fickleness, insincerity, 2 Corinthians 1:17); whereas it was out of tenderness to them, after the severity with which he had ordered them to expel the incestuous member of their church, that he was induced to defer his visit till his return from Macedonia.
