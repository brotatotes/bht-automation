<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:6">1 Corinthians 16:6</span>. <strong> But with you it may be that I shall abide, or even winter</strong> which he actually did, as we learn from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:2-3">Acts 20:2-3</span>, where it is said, “We came into Greece (meaning Corinth, its capital, with which he had most to do), and there abode three months,” which were “winter” months. The summer months of that year he had spent in Macedonia, and he had to be at Jerusalem at Pentecost (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:16">Acts 20:16</span>); but as the Ægean Sea was not favourable for navigation till spring, he spent the intervening winter at Corinth, <strong> that ye may set me forward on my journey, </strong> or ‘accompany me a little way,’ as this favourite phraseology means (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:3">Acts 15:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:38">Acts 20:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:5">Acts 21:5</span>; Rom 15:24 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:16">2 Corinthians 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:13">Titus 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:6">3 John 1:6</span>), <strong> whithersoever I go</strong> implying that his plans were not then definitely fixed.
