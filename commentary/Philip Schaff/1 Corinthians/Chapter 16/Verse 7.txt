1 Corinthians 16:7.  For I do not wish to see you now by the way as formerly intended (see on 1 Corinthians 16:5),  for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord  (the Lord Jesus, as appears)  permit that is, if when the time comes it appear that the way for it has been left open by Him who is “Head over all things to the Church.”
