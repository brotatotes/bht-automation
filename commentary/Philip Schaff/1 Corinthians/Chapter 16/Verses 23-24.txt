Ver. 23.  The grace of the Lord  Jesus Christ be with you.
	Ver. 24.  My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.  Some critics take this indicatively, “My love  is  with you all.” But this seems flat. That of our Authorised Version is much the more expressive, and the closing “Amen” seems to confirm this.
