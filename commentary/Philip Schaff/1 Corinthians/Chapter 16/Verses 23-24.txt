<p>Ver. 23. <strong> The grace of the Lord</strong> <strong> Jesus Christ be with you.
	</strong></p>
<p>Ver. 24. <strong> My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. </strong> Some critics take this indicatively, “My love <em> is </em> with you all.” But this seems flat. That of our Authorised Version is much the more expressive, and the closing “Amen” seems to confirm this.
