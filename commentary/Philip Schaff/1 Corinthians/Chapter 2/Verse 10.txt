<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:10">1 Corinthians 2:10</span>. <strong> But unto us God revealed them through the Spirit.</strong> [1] <strong> </strong> Though this is true of believers generally, the reference here, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:3">1 Corinthians 2:3</span>, is to the apostles.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] Not (as in the received text) ‘through his Spirit.’
	</p>
<p><strong> For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea,</strong> <strong> the deep things of God </strong> not the depths of His Being, but of His purposes, though in themselves these are inseparable.
	</p>
<p><em> Note </em> here the relation and interaction of ‘God’ and ‘the Spirit.’ Why, it may be asked, does God employ the <strong> </strong> Spirit’s agency to reveal to believers what eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor heart conceived? Because (says this verse) those depths of the Godhead lie open to the Spirit’s penetrating gaze; a unique statement to which there is no actual parallel, save <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26-27">Romans 8:26-27</span>, which throws much light on the statement here. But the following verse contains an equally unique and noteworthy statement.
