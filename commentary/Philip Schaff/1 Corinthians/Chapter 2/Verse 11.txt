1 Corinthians 2:11.  For who among men knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of the man  which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth save the Spirit of God. The relation of ‘the Spirit’ to ‘God’ is here compared to that of a man to his own spirit. As each man’s own spirit is known to no man but himself (Romans 14:10), so the mind of God (says the apostle) is known only by the Spirit of God. But like every other comparison, this one must not be pressed beyond its immediate purpose: for in the case of ourselves, we and our own spirit are  numerically one;  whereas   in this very passage and in every other place where the Holy Spirit is spoken of there is observed  a distinction of conscious personality  between ‘God’ on the one hand and the ‘Spirit of God’ on the other. And not only so, but while the Personal  identity  of these two is certainly never taught, the Personal  Divinity  of the Spirit is here so clearly taught, that on any other supposition the statement in the latter part of this verse would be inept.
