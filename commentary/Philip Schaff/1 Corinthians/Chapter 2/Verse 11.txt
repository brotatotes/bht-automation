<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:11">1 Corinthians 2:11</span>. <strong> For who among men knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of the man</strong> <strong> which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth save the Spirit of God.</strong> The relation of ‘the Spirit’ to ‘God’ is here compared to that of a man to his own spirit. As each man’s own spirit is known to no man but himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:10">Romans 14:10</span>), so the mind of God (says the apostle) is known only by the Spirit of God. But like every other comparison, this one must not be pressed beyond its immediate purpose: for in the case of ourselves, we and our own spirit are <em> numerically one; </em> whereas <strong> </strong> in this very passage and in every other place where the Holy Spirit is spoken of there is observed <em> a distinction of conscious personality </em> between ‘God’ on the one hand and the ‘Spirit of God’ on the other. And not only so, but while the Personal <em> identity </em> of these two is certainly never taught, the Personal <em> Divinity </em> of the Spirit is here so clearly taught, that on any other supposition the statement in the latter part of this verse would be inept.
