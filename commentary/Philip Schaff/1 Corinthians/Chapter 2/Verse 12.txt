1 Corinthians 2:12.  Now we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are  freely  given to us of God.  Not only are the things themselves ‘freely given us,’ but we only ‘know’ them, so as to make them our own, through the Spirit which is given to us of God for that very end.
