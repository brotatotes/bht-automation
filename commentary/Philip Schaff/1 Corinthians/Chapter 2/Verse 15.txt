1 Corinthians 2:15.  But he that is spiritual judgeth all things  not only those spiritual things which the natural man cannot judge, but also those which belong to the natural manâ€™s own domain, and which he only views in their true light.
	 Yet he himself is judged of no man  (who is not spiritual).
