1 Corinthians 2:2.  For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.  He would not only know but one theme, but would hold that forth in precisely the light which he knew would prove the most repulsive to their fastidious ears and corrupt taste. For this being that in which every fact of His life has its explanations, and from which the whole principle of His work takes its character, he felt he could neither keep it back, nor soften it down. Yet this was no bravado. He was tremblingly alive to the possible effect of making this the pivot of His ministry.
