1 Corinthians 2:4.  And my speech and my preaching, the ‘message’ itself as well as its clothing,  were not in persuasive words of wisdom, [1]  but in the power of God.  It was not that he could not have wielded the weapon of ‘man’s wisdom’ to excellent effect, as may be seen in various passages of these very Epistles to the Corinthians, whose eloquence is confessedly surpassing; but that for the reason given, he studiously avoided it. Of course, however, there is nothing here disparaging to the right use of human culture in the Christian ministry.
	 [1] Not (as in the received text) ‘in persuasive words of man’s wisdom.’
