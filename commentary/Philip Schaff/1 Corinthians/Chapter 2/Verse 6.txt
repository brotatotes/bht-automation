<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span>. <strong> Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect. </strong> This is a favourite Pauline word, having one well-defined sense, <strong> </strong> with only varying shades according to the subject treated of. With reference to Christ’s work, it denotes its ‘completion’ by His death (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:10">Hebrews 5:10</span>); with regard to the believer’s standing before God in virtue of that completed work, it expresses his ‘perfect’ acceptance (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:14">Hebrews 10:14</span>, compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:9">1 Corinthians 9:9</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:1">1 Corinthians 10:1</span>); and in relation to his <strong> </strong> stage of advancement in the Christian life, it means his <strong> </strong> ‘full’ apprehension of gospel truth that of full-grown ‘men’ as contrasted with the immaturity of the ‘babes in Christ’ (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:1-2">1 Corinthians 3:1-2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12-14">Hebrews 5:12-14</span>). This last is clearly the sense here. <strong> </strong> For only when <strong> </strong> this stage is reached when the gospel scheme can be grasped as a whole, <strong> </strong> and be surveyed all round can the ‘wisdom’ there is in it be fully discovered.

<p><strong> Yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world,</strong> the rulers <strong> </strong> of its thought even more than of its power, Greek and Jew alike, <strong> that are coming to nought,</strong> through the silently but surely undermining power of the Gospel.
