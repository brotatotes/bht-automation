1 Corinthians 2:7.  but  we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery  i.e.  (in the apostolic sense of the word ‘mystery’) a wisdom long hidden from view, but now   disclosed (see Romans 16:25-26; Ephesians 3:6; 1 Timothy 3:16). In the same sense our Lord uses the word (Matthew 13:11; Matthew 13:17).  even the wisdom that hath been hidden, which God fore-ordained before the worlds unto our glory (see 2 Timothy 2:10  ).
