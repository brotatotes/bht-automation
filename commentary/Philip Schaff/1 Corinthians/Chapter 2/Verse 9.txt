1 Corinthians 2:9.  but as it is  written  (Isaiah 64:4, or 1 Corinthians 2:3 in Heb., which is here recalled in fragmentary form),  Things which eye saw not,  etc. The truth here expressed by the prophet and the apostle is, that what God has in store for His people transcends not only all past experience, but all human conception.
	This leads the apostle into a new line of thought, an episode which extends to the close of the chapter. The ‘wisdom’ of the Gospel, being in its nature purely spiritual, can be apprehended only by the spiritual, as even to the apostles themselves it is disclosed through the teaching of the Spirit.
