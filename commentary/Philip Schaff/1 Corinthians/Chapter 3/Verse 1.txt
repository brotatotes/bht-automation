1 Corinthians 3:1.  And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in    Christ  those in whom the spiritual principles, like the higher faculties in a babe, lie all undeveloped. Spiritual, indeed, they were, for they were “in Christ;” but it was only as babes, unfit to digest the “strong meat” of that “hidden wisdom” which the apostle longed to impart to them as soon as they should reach the stage of “the perfect” (1 Corinthians 2:6).
