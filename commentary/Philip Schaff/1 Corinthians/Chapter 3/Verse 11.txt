<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:11">1 Corinthians 3:11</span>. <strong> For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</strong> The allusion is to that grand announcement, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>, “Behold, I have laid in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner <em> stent, </em> of sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.” There is a peculiar appropriateness in this quotation, from the similarity of the <em> warnings </em> which follow, in both cases. Christ, says the apostle here including all those doctrinal conceptions which are inseparable from right apprehensions of Himself is the great Foundation of faith and ground of hope.
