1 Corinthians 3:11.  For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. The allusion is to that grand announcement, Isaiah 28:16, “Behold, I have laid in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner  stent,  of sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.” There is a peculiar appropriateness in this quotation, from the similarity of the  warnings  which follow, in both cases. Christ, says the apostle here including all those doctrinal conceptions which are inseparable from right apprehensions of Himself is the great Foundation of faith and ground of hope.
