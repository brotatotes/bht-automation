1 Corinthians 3:13.  each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it not ‘some day’ sooner or later (as some critics), nor (with Calvin and others) ‘the day of clearer light’ or advancing knowledge; least of all, that never-failing refuge of poor critics, ‘the day of Jerusalem’s destruction;’ for what had those Corinthians to do with that? One definite day alone suits all that is here said “the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ” (Romans 2:16).
	 because it shall of revealed by fire  (see 2 Thessalonians 1:7) literal fire, as seems clearly taught, the bursting forth of which will perhaps be the visible herald of Christ’s coming. At the same time, this fire as elsewhere so here is but as the symbol of that “fiery” judgment which shall search to the bottom every case, as indeed is immediately expressed.
	 and the fire itself shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is and with what result?
