<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:15">1 Corinthians 3:15</span>. <strong> If any man’s work shall be burned</strong> as consisting of the inflammable “wood, hay, stubble,”
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> he shall suffer loss</strong> loss of his time, his pains, his hopes, his credit; his whole ministry, even though right at bottom, yet all of it which is of this character, disappearing.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> but he himself shall be saved</strong> a statement of vast importance, as showing that the apostle is not speaking here of false teachers, but of the <em> true servants of Christ.
	</em></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> yet so as by fire </strong> as of one who escapes from the fire by a rush, or is plucked out of it, his naked person alone saved.
	</p>
<p><em> Note.</em> That the Church of Rome should deem such a passage any justification of their dogma of a purgatorial fire in the intermediate state is strange. For everything said of “the fire” here would seem to preclude any such interpretation. </p>
<p>(1) This fire is to “try every man’s work;” but no Romanist believes that of the purgatorial fire.
	</p>
<p>(2) The purgatorial fire precedes the judgment, being designed to prepare the imperfectly sanctified to abide it, whereas this fire is the judgment itself
	</p>
<p>(3) Those here spoken of are saved in the judgment, “ <em> so ashy </em> fire,” not <em> by means </em> of the fire, but simply <em> with difficulty; </em> whereas the Romish doctrine is that a purifying process by means of fire will have to be gone through to fit those in it for heaven a totally different idea.
