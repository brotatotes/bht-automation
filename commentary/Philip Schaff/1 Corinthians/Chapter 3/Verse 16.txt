<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>. <strong> Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?</strong> a sudden transition, apparently, from the <em> teachers </em> to the <em> taught; </em> yet this is more in appearance than reality. For the transition is simply from warnings against a dangerous pandering in teachers to the corrupted taste of their hearers to warnings directed to those vitiated hearers themselves.

<p><strong> and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</strong> The word rendered “temple” here means, classically, ‘the dwelling-place of a deity.’ In the New Testament, when applied to the temple of Jerusalem, it denotes the holy of holies that most sacred part of it where of old the Shechinah, or visible symbol of the Divine Presence, was manifested. As applied to believers under the new economy, it means that they are “a habitation of God through the Spirit” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:22">Ephesians 2:22</span>).
