<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:17">1 Corinthians 3:17</span>. <strong> If any man shall destroy the temple of God, him shall God destroy. </strong> The sin and its punishment are in the original purposely expressed by the same word; but this cannot be represented in English.
	</p>
<p><strong> for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye</strong> not, as in the Authorised Version, “which <em> temple</em> ye are;” for that had just before been said, but ‘such holy persons ye are,’ inasmuch as ye are the temple of God.
	</p>
<p>What follows, to the close of this chapter, reiterates what had been said about the mischief which this false wisdom, and their disputes in connection with it, were doing at Corinth.
