<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:23">1 Corinthians 3:23</span>. <strong> and ye are Christ’s </strong> (possession), <strong> and Christ is God’s </strong> (possession). What a climax, and an anti-climax too, from all <strong> </strong> things <em> down </em> to ourselves, and from ourselves <em> up </em> again to God! But while all things are ours, by a seeming paradox there is something which is not ours. “We are not <em> our own</em> ” “we are Christ’s,” and none can pluck us out of His hands, as “Christ is God’s;” His Elect, in whom His soul delighteth, and from whom He cannot be separated. Thus, through Him that loved and gave Himself for us, those who are His are secured by a golden chain reaching up to the eternal throne.
