1 Corinthians 3:6.  I planted: Yes; the first ground at Corinth was indeed broken by me, and I am your spiritual father.
	 Apollos watered  following up what I began. But though in husbandry planting goes before watering, each is necessary at its proper stage. Yet something above both was needed.  but God gave the increase.
