	</p>
<p><strong> but each shall receive his own reward according to his own work.</strong> While the work is one, in one field, to one Master, on one principle, and to one end, each has his own sphere in it, his own gifts for it, his own success in it, his own reward for it. O how ought this to cheer the faithful labourer, who may be but moderately gifted, may be placed in a remote and uninviting part of the field, may have to fight with many obstacles and sore discouragements, and may live to see but little fruit of his best labour! (See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:36-38">John 4:36-38</span>.)
