1 Corinthians 4:17.  For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord for he was his spiritual father as well as theirs (see 1 Timothy 1:2; 1 Timothy 1:18; 2 Timothy 1:2; 2 Timothy 1:2 l). The apostle’s plans at this time are stated in Acts 19:21-22 (see Paley’s  Horae Paulinae, iii. 2).
	 who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church for he would insist on nothing at Corinth but what he required of every church. Timothy, as his chosen companion in missionary travel, was fully cognizant of his whole principles and procedure, character and carriage, in everything. No fitter substitute, then, could have been sent.
