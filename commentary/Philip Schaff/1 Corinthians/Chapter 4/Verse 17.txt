<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church</strong> for he would insist on nothing at Corinth but what he required of every church. Timothy, as his chosen companion in missionary travel, was fully cognizant of his whole principles and procedure, character and carriage, in everything. No fitter substitute, then, could have been sent.
