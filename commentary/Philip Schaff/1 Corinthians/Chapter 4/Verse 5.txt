1 Corinthians 4:5.  Wherefore judge nothing before the time,  until the Lord come  (the second time),  who will . . . make manifest the counsels of the hearts  (Ecclesiastes 12:14; Romans 2:16),  and then shall each man have his praise from God  according to his fidelity; for that is the one   quality which the Judge Himself has announced that He will single out as the characteristic of His true servants “Well done, good and faithful servant” (“good” because “faithful”), “thou hast been faithful over a few things,” etc.
