<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:8">1 Corinthians 4:8</span>. <strong> Now ye</strong> <strong> are filled</strong>, <strong> now ye are rich,</strong> <strong> ye have reigned as kings without us: yea, and I would ye did reign, that we might reign with you. </strong> There is keen irony here: ‘A fine time of it ye have had since ye were relieved of our presence; we stood in your way, we kept you in bondage, it seems; but now ye breathe more freely, and your Christianity is an easy-going thing; ye have got past the suffering, and have reached the reigning period. Would that it were so indeed, for then were it our time to reign along with you as your father in Christ; but alas, the reverse of all this we daily and bitterly feel.’
