1 Corinthians 4:1.  Let a man so account of us as of ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
	1 Corinthians 4:2. Here,   moreover, [1]  i.e. in this matter of stewardship,  it is required in stewards that a man he found faithful. The figure here  is warily changed in order to fasten attention on this property of a   true servant of Christ,  fidelity.  Where this is found, the absence of much else can be borne with, but for the want of this in a steward nothing can compensate.
	 [1] Such is the correct reading. The same expression is found in Revelation 13:10; Revelation 13:18; Revelation 14:12; Revelation 17:9.
