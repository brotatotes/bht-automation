<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:1">1 Corinthians 4:1</span>. <strong> Let a man so account of us as of ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.

<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:2">1 Corinthians 4:2</span>. Here, <strong> </strong> moreover, [1] <em> i.e.</em> in this matter of stewardship, <strong> it is required in stewards that a man he found faithful.</strong> The figure here <strong> is warily changed</strong> in order to fasten attention on this property of a <strong> </strong> true servant of Christ, <em> fidelity. </em> Where this is found, the absence of much else can be borne with, but for the want of this in a steward nothing can compensate.

<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] Such is the correct reading. The same expression is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+13:10">Revelation 13:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+13:18">Revelation 13:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:12">Revelation 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:9">Revelation 17:9</span>.
