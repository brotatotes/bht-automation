1 Corinthians 5:10.  not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out  of the world.  Observe the caution “not  altogether ”   restricting the allowed intercourse with them to what was  necessary  and  safe.  The collocation of “the covetous and extortioners” with “fornicators and idolaters” sounds strange to us; but it is a favourite classification with our apostle (Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:5). Perhaps the explanation of this may be found in Galatians 5:19-21, where these are all ranked under the head of “works of the flesh,” any one of which might, according to individual bent, stir up another.
