1 Corinthians 5:2.  And ye are puffed up  as if all were right with you  and have not rather mourned  that such a blot should come upon your community, (in order)  that he that had done this deed might  (by formal ejection)  be taken away from  among you. Sharp measures are therefore peremptorily ordered to take place.
