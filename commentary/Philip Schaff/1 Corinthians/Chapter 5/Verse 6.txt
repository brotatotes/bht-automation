1 Corinthians 5:6.  Your glorying is not good is out of place, unseemly.  Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth  the whole lamp? ‘’Tis only one case, ye say; but are ye so ignorant as not to know that the communicative properties of good and evil are as leaven (Matthew 13:3; Matthew 5:13; 1 Corinthians 15:33), and that the leavening property of evil is greater than that of good?’ “  One  sinner destroyeth much good.” In a church gathered, like that of Corinth, out of a proverbially licentious city, and themselves before conversion no better than others (1 Corinthians 6:9-11), how dangerous the presence of such an offender, going out and in among them in full fellowship, must be obvious to every one.
