<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span>. <strong> Purge out</strong> [1] <strong> the old leaven. </strong> Referring to the practice enjoined in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:15">Exodus 12:15</span>, and almost superstitiously observed at the Passover time, of removing every particle of leaven from their houses, the apostle would have them put away in the person of this flagrant offender, that corrupt element, “the old man,” which at their conversion they had “put off.”
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] The word “therefore” is not in the genuine text.
	</p>
<p><strong> that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are (already) unleavened</strong> considered as “new creatures,” in whom “all things have become new.”
	</p>
<p><strong> For our Passover also is </strong> <em> (Gr. </em> ‘was,’ or ‘hath been’) <strong> sacrificed, even Christ.</strong> [1] <strong> </strong> ‘Yes, and ours is infinitely more precious than Israel’s. It was the blood of a brute creature, the sprinkling of which on their door-posts was the means of their redemption; we are “redeemed with the precious blood of Christ,” the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world; their redemption was merely national and temporal, ours is world-wide and eternal.’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] The words “for us.” which are without any good authority, are also out of place; for the apostle’s one object was to remind them that we Christians have a Passover, and a Passover-feast to keep, as well as the Jews.
