1 Corinthians 6:12.  All things are lawful for me, but  not all things are expedient.  ‘In things indifferent, such as the eating of meats forbidden under the ceremonial law, the Gospel has made all   things clean, and I can use my liberty without scruple; but there are some of tender conscience who are still afraid to meddle with such things. For their sake, therefore, I must consider whether that which in itself is perfectly lawful is at the same time expedient.’
	 all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any of anything (not ‘any   person’), to become its slave.
