<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:12">1 Corinthians 6:12</span>. <strong> All things are lawful for me, but</strong> <strong> not all things are expedient. </strong> ‘In things indifferent, such as the eating of meats forbidden under the ceremonial law, the Gospel has made all <strong> </strong> things clean, and I can use my liberty without scruple; but there are some of tender conscience who are still afraid to meddle with such things. For their sake, therefore, I must consider whether that which in itself is perfectly lawful is at the same time expedient.’
