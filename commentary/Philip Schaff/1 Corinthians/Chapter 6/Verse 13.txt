<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:13">1 Corinthians 6:13</span>. <strong> Heats for the belly,</strong> <strong> and the belly</strong> <strong> for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them:</strong> ‘Meats, no doubt, are indifferent, but since both they and the mortal body to which they minister are destined to perish in their corruptibility, scorn to become enslaved to them.’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and</strong> <strong> the Lord for the body</strong>: ‘As the body was not made to be pampered by “meats,” much less to be prostituted to vile uses, so the body of every believer is redeemed to be the Lord’s property, and the Lord belongs to it in return.’
