<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] The addition of the word ‘up’ in the second verb is designed to mark the difference between the compound form of the verb here used and the simple form in the first clause. The form would seem to be varied merely from variety’s sake; but since (as Meyer observes) the simple form is invariably used in the fifteenth chapter, both of the resurrection of Christ and that of believers and there, indeed, no fewer than eighteen times whereas the compound form is used <em> here only </em> of the resurrection of believers, it is as well that the distinction should appear in the translation also. And as it was the resurrection of believers <em> </em> that was denied by “some” at Corinth, and that of Christ is brought in only to show what would follow if the views of this party were right, possibly the apostle intentionally departed from his usual style by employing the compound form as more emphatic for the resurrection of believer.
