<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:18">1 Corinthians 6:18</span>. <strong> Flee fornication. </strong> Note the studiously curt and stringent language (as that in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:13">1 Corinthians 5:13</span>), and not for nothing is “flight” here urged. This was what Joseph did (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+39:12">Genesis 39:12</span>), and what the great mediaeval schoolman Thomas Aquinas, when a youth, literally did in exactly similar circumstances.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Every sin that a </strong> man <strong> doeth is without the body. </strong> Surfeiting and drunkenness, for example, are produced by the introduction into the body of foreign elements in excess.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body</strong> against its proper nature and use, prostituting it to base and blasting uses. Viewed in this light, that sin is like nothing else. It is a leprosy, which, when systematically practised, renders the body loathsome, enervates and slowly destroys the whole animal nature, and, what is worse, stupefies all the intellectual and moral powers.
