1 Corinthians 6:19.  What, know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you (see on chap. 1 Corinthians 2:11),  which ye have from God as   His gift through the risen Saviour, and whose presence in you is the presence of God Himself, by reason of their essential oneness: “Will ye then pollute and profane such a temple?”  and ye are not your own?
