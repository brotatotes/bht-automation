1 Corinthians 6:2.  What, know ye not that the saints shall judge the world?  shall sit, after yourselves have been judged (Matthew 25:41), as Christ’s assessors, in judgment on all others. This is   not elsewhere expressly stated; but it is in accordance with Matthew 19:28, and is in strict analogy with angels being represented (in Job 1:2) as in the councils of Heaven sitting as assessors. Perhaps the apostle may refer here to something he himself had taught on this subject.
	 and if the world is to be judged   (Gr.  ‘is being judged’)  by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?  literally, ‘the smallest tribunals.’ (The word means first a ‘test’ or ‘rule of judgment;’ then, a ‘court of judgment,’ and here the cause to be tried an unusual application of the word, but plainly the sense here.)
