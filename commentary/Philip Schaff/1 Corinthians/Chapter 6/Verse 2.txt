<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:2">1 Corinthians 6:2</span>. <strong> What, know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? </strong> shall sit, after yourselves have been judged (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:41">Matthew 25:41</span>), as Christ’s assessors, in judgment on all others. This is <strong> </strong> not elsewhere expressly stated; but it is in accordance with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>, and is in strict analogy with angels being represented (in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="job+1:2">Job 1:2</span>) as in the councils of Heaven sitting as assessors. Perhaps the apostle may refer here to something he himself had taught on this subject.
	</p>
<p><strong> and if the world is to be judged </strong> <em> (Gr. </em> ‘is being judged’) <strong> by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? </strong> literally, ‘the smallest tribunals.’ (The word means first a ‘test’ or ‘rule of judgment;’ then, a ‘court of judgment,’ and here the cause to be tried an unusual application of the word, but plainly the sense here.)
