1 Corinthians 6:4.  If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are of no account in the church  an ironical way of hinting that their differences were so petty that the poorest-witted among them were fit enough to deal with them. [1]
	 [1] To view this as a question ‘Do ye set,   etc.?’   as some do, seems to us very unnatural.
