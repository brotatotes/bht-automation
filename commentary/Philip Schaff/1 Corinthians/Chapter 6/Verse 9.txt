1 Corinthians 6:9.  What, know ye not that the unrighteous  (‘the wrong-doers’)  shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicator, nor idolaters,  whose religion was itself voluptuous, particularly at Corinth,  nor adulterers, nor effeminate  given   to voluptuous ease, encouraging their sensual inclinations,  nor abusers of themselves with men  practising the unnatural vice of Romans 1:27, but which ought not to be named among us as becometh saints. The five grosser forms of vice thus mentioned are next followed by five of a more familiar but not less soul-destroying kind.
