1 Corinthians 7:1.  Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: [1]  It is good for a man not to touch a woman  i.e.  to marry (an Old Testament phrase). Not as if he meant that marriage was wrong in itself, as the next verse and 1 Corinthians 7:28 sufficiently shew. Indeed, the “present distress” (1 Corinthians 7:26) seems to have been his main reason for recommending the single state; and “forbidding to marry” is given as one of the signs of “the apostasy of the later times” (1 Timothy 4:3). In Hebrews 13:4, also, marriage is declared to be “honourable in all,” or “to be had in honour of all;” and see Mark 10:6-9.
