<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span>. <strong> Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote:</strong> [1] <strong> It is good for a man not to touch a woman</strong> <em> i.e. </em> to marry (an Old Testament phrase). Not as if he meant that marriage was wrong in itself, as the next verse and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:28">1 Corinthians 7:28</span> sufficiently shew. Indeed, the “present distress” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:26">1 Corinthians 7:26</span>) seems to have been his main reason for recommending the single state; and “forbidding to marry” is given as one of the signs of “the apostasy of the later times” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:3">1 Timothy 4:3</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:4">Hebrews 13:4</span>, also, marriage is declared to be “honourable in all,” or “to be had in honour of all;” and see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:6-9">Mark 10:6-9</span>.
