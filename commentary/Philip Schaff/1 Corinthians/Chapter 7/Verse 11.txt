1 Corinthians 7:11.  (but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband.)  The case here supposed is that of such disagreement between Christian husband and wife as induces the wife, in spite of the prohibition, to leave her husband. In this case she must either get reconciled to her husband which is best or remain single.
