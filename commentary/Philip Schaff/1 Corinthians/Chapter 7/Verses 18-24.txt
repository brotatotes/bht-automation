<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> And first, <em> Circumcision.
	</em></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:18">1 Corinthians 7:18</span>. <strong> Was any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised </strong> which, under the persecution of Antiochus, the Jews contrived to accomplish, to conceal their nationality ( 1Ma 1:15 ; Joseph. <em> Antt. x</em> ii. 5. 1).
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:19">1 Corinthians 7:19</span>. <strong> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of</strong> <strong> God</strong> is everything in religion. It is worthy of notice that the unimportance of both in religion is thrice expressed, and each time in contrast with something essential. <em> Here, </em> where the point in question is how to <em> act, </em> the essential thing is made <em> obedience; </em> in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:6">Galatians 5:6</span>, where the point is to have the <em> foundation </em> of the Christian life rightly laid, the essential thing is “ <em> faith, </em> working by love;” in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:15">Galatians 6:15</span>, where those are dealt with who think they can “sow to the flesh,” and yet <em> not “</em> reap corruption,” the essential thing is the being “a new creature.”
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:20">1 Corinthians 7:20</span>. <strong> Let each man abide in that calling wherein he is called</strong> not his ‘occupation,’ but his ‘condition in life.’ Secondly, <em> Bond-service.
	</em></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:21">1 Corinthians 7:21</span>. <strong> Wast thou</strong> <strong> called being a bond</strong> - <strong> servant? care not for it: but if thou canst become free</strong>, <strong> use it rather. </strong> Such is the natural sense of the statement, and some of the best expositors so understand it. But looking at the strain of the argument and the strict sense of the words themselves, it has been plausibly argued that the sense must be, ‘nay, even if thou mayest be made free, use it <em> (i.e. </em> your state of slavery) rather.’ But if so, why did the apostle express it in this strange way “use it rather"? why did he not say “seek it not,” “be content,” “abide still,” or some similar phrase? And then, only take this last clause parenthetically, as follows: ‘If called as a slave, think not that to serve Christ in that condition is hopeless (though, of course, if thou mayest be made free, that is to be preferred) and the sense will at once be seen to be good, and quite consistent with the strain of the argument. This sense, too, is all the more probable, as the apostle is about to add (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:23">1 Corinthians 7:23</span>), “Ye were bought with a price, become not bond-servants of men.”
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:22">1 Corinthians 7:22</span>. <strong> For he that was called in the Lord, being a bond-servant, is the Lord’s freedman</strong> or ‘manumitted slave,’ [1] liberated from the slavery of sin; for “whosoever committeth sin is the <strong> </strong> slave of sin” ( Joh 8:34 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:19">2 Peter 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:26">2 Timothy 2:26</span>).
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] ἀ πελεύθερος
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> likewise he that was called, being free, is Christ’s bond-servant. </strong> Thus have these two very dissimilar conditions of life a beautiful meeting - place and bond of union in Christ. Well might it be said (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:9-10">James 1:9-10</span>), “Let the brother of low degree glory in that he is exalted, and the rich in that he is made low” both meeting on the platform of a <strong> </strong> common redemption.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:23">1 Corinthians 7:23</span>. <strong> Ye were bought with a price; become not bond-servants of men. </strong> This does not mean, Get not into actual slavery, but, ‘Being set inwardly free <strong> </strong> at such a <strong> </strong> cost, suffer not yourselves to be despoiled of this higher liberty by any party.’
