<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span>. <strong> Now concerning things sacrificed unto idols:</strong> <strong> we know that we all have knowledge</strong> ‘Ye plead your knowledge; we are at one with you there; but this is a question, not of knowledge, but of love.’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Knowledge puffeth up</strong>, <strong> but love edifieth</strong> <em> Gr. </em> ‘buildeth up.’ The knowing are apt to put on an air of superiority to their less knowing brethren, whereas love <em> </em> identifying itself by sympathy with all akin to itself, whether more or <strong> </strong> less enlightened <em> </em> cements them like stones in one <strong> </strong> building.
