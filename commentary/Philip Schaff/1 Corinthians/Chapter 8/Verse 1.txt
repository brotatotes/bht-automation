1 Corinthians 8:1.  Now concerning things sacrificed unto idols:  we know that we all have knowledge ‘Ye plead your knowledge; we are at one with you there; but this is a question, not of knowledge, but of love.’
	 Knowledge puffeth up,  but love edifieth  Gr.  ‘buildeth up.’ The knowing are apt to put on an air of superiority to their less knowing brethren, whereas love   identifying itself by sympathy with all akin to itself, whether more or   less enlightened   cements them like stones in one   building.
