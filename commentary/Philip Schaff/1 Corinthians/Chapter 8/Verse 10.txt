1 Corinthians 8:10.  For if a man see thee who hast knowledge  of the emptiness of idols and the lawfulness of all food  sitting  at meat in an idol’s  temple. The word here used (in the Greek of the Old Testament and this one place of the New Testament) is used only for  heathen  temple, to mark its idolatrous character; the word employed for the temple of the living God being studiously avoided on such a subject.
	 will not  his conscience, if  (or ‘while’)  he is weak, be emboldened   Gr. ‘ built up,’ just as we speak of one built up in self-conceit  to eat things sacrificed unto idols?
