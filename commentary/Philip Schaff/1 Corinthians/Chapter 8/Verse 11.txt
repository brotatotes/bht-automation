1 Corinthians 8:11.  for through thy knowledge he that  is weak perisheth, the brother [1]  for whose sake Christ died.  It might seem that “for” here is inappropriate; but the thought is this: ‘The wrong you thus do, through your uncalled-for exercise  of  liberty, is far greater than you think;  for  whoever is thus the means of leading a Christian brother to violate his conscience is helping so far to destroy his soul.’ Well might Olshausen say, in view of so affecting a statement, ‘The worth of even the poorest, weakest brother could not be more emphatically expressed.’
	 [1] Such is the correct reading here.
