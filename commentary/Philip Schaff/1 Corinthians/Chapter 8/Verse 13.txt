<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:13">1 Corinthians 8:13</span>. <strong> Wherefore, if meat maketh my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I make not my brother to stumble</strong> a hyperbolical way of expressing the recoil of his soul from any act of selfish gratification by which the soul of a brother might be endangered.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> The question of murderous Cain, and of his children in every age and country “Am I my brother’s keeper?”
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> is abhorrent to the whole spirit of Christianity, which is designed to kill that principle in the bosoms of men. Would that Christians would let that spirit reign in them, in their social intercourse!
