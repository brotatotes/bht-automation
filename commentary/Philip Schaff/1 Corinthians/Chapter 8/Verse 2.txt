1 Corinthians 8:2.  If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth  not yet as he ought to know   has not got upon the right track in his search after knowledge, for what inflates its possessor cannot be true knowledge: all knowledge worthy of the name begets such a consciousness of remaining ignorance as effectually checks self-sufficiency.
