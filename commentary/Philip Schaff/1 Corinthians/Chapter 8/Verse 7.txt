<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:7">1 Corinthians 8:7</span>. <strong> Howbeit in all men there is not that knowledge: but</strong> <strong> some, being used</strong> [1] <strong> until now to the idol,</strong> <strong> eat as of a thing sacrificed unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. </strong> The “weak” here are Gentile converts who, being steeped in idolatry up to the time of their conversion, were unable as yet to shake off the impression that the idol, which by them had so long been regarded as a god, <em> had </em> after all something divine in it. In this view, the argument is, that when such weak brethren saw their stronger-minded brethren openly partaking of meat known to have been sacrificed to an idol, they would be emboldened by their example to do the same, while still regarding the act as idolatrous, and so would defile their conscience.

<p style="margin-left:1.8em;"> [1] The received text here reads, “from conscience of the idol;” and Meyer and Alford think this right. But the above reading is decidedly better supported, and it is the text of Griesbach. Lachmann, Tregelles, and Tischendorf.
