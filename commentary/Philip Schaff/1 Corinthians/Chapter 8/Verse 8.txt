<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:8">1 Corinthians 8:8</span>. <strong> But meat will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat, are we the better; nor if we eat not, are we the worse.</strong> [2]
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:1.8em;"> [2] The order of these clauses is reversed in some texts; but as the evidence is pretty equally balanced, the sense precisely the same, and the matter of no importance either way, the natural English order may be adhered to.
