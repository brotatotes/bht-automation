<p>The substance of this long digression so far as the present chapter is concerned may be thus expressed: ‘I have been urging on you the duty of refraining from things lawful when by indulging in them the consciences of your weaker brethren are wounded, and their souls imperilled. But in this I enjoin nothing which I myself do not practise. For example, though entitled, on every principle of natural right and Scripture precept, to temporal support from the churches to which I minister in holy things, I have studiously refrained from receiving it, both from you and from other churches, lest I should lay myself open to misconstruction, and thus hinder the Gospel of Christ. And on this principle I act in everything, striving only how best to win souls. Nor is this done only with a view to others’ good; for only by such a life of systematic and continued self-denial can I regard even myself to be safe for eternity.’
