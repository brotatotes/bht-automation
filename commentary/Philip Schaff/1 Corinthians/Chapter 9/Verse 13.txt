1 Corinthians 9:13.  Know ye not that they which minister about sacred things eat of    the things of the temple?  of the sacrificial offerings, expressly allocated to the priests. The Gentile converts are supposed to be aware of this, mixing constantly with their Jewish fellow-converts, not to speak of their presumed acquaintance to that extent with the Old Testament; and the practice in their own pagan worship was analogous.
	 and they which  wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar? certain parts of the victim expressly reserved for their use.
