<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:16">1 Corinthians 9:16</span>. <strong> For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of. </strong> ‘To glory in preaching without charge is reasonable enough, but to boast of preaching the Gospel itself were shameful.’
	</p>
<p><strong> for necessity is upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel. </strong> ‘Shut up to it by the call of Heaven, it is at my peril if I shrink from it.’
