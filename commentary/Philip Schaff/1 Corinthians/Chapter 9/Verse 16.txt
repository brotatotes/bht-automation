1 Corinthians 9:16.  For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of.  ‘To glory in preaching without charge is reasonable enough, but to boast of preaching the Gospel itself were shameful.’
	 for necessity is upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel.  ‘Shut up to it by the call of Heaven, it is at my peril if I shrink from it.’
