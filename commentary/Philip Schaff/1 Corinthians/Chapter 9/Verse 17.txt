1 Corinthians 9:17.  For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward the reward of serving gratuitously (as the next verse shews   to be the meaning), and being able thus triumphantly to vindicate the purity of my motives.
	 but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me the yoke of Heaven is upon me, even should I dislike it.
