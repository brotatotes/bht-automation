1 Corinthians 9:26.  I  therefore  (for my part)  so run, not as uncertainly without definite aim, regardless of what is at stake, and what is required in order to win.
	 so fight I.  Here the figure changes from  running  to  wrestling,  from the speed of the racer to the aggressions of the pugilist  as not beating the air who, taking an uncertain or inaccurate aim, misses his antagonist, and strikes only the air: not so do I fight; I put  skill  as well as  energy  into this “good fight of faith.”
