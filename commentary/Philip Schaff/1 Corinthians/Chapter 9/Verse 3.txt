1 Corinthians 9:3.  My defence to them that examine me is this not this which I am  now  to give; for what follows is not an answer to such questioners, but this which I have  already  statedâ€™ (in the preceding verses). Accordingly, 1 Corinthians 9:3 is to be viewed as closing the subject of his apostleship, so far as any question could be raised about it, although in his Second Epistle he takes it up again.
