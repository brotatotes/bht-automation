<p><strong> a wife who is a believer</strong> <em> Gr. </em> ‘a sister.’ An absurd interpretation of these words, which found support even among the best of the fathers, when once the ascetic principle had taken possession of the Church, led Christians to regard celibacy as a holier state than marriage, and by degrees threw discredit on the marriage of the clergy. The interpretation we refer to is, that the apostle is here claiming the right of preachers to follow our Lord’s example (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:1-3">Luke 8:1-3</span>), who allowed rich women to follow Him and His apostles, ministering to them of their substance. But on that view, what is this about “a wife”? For to translate it ‘a woman’ here is absurd. But absurd as it is, modern Romanists even Cornelius à <em> </em> Lapide and Estius are obliged to take refuge in it. In fact, the great fluctuation in the Greek readings of this verse especially that strange reading ‘sisters, women’ is a proof (as has been well observed) of the desperate shifts to which people have been driven to obliterate the testimony against compulsory celibacy in the ministers of Christ which the true text of this verse contains.

<p><strong> even as the rest of the apostles</strong> not necessarily each of them, but the class; for Paul himself was certainly not married (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:7">1 Corinthians 7:7</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> and the brethren of the Lord. </strong> Though named hereafter “the apostles,” it would not necessarily follow that none of these were themselves apostles, for “Cephas,” one of the apostles, is named immediately after them. At the same time, the mode of expression more naturally suits with their <em> not </em> being apostles, as on other grounds we believe can be established.
	</p>
<p><strong> and Cephas</strong> whose marriage none can doubt of (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:30">Mark 1:30</span>).
