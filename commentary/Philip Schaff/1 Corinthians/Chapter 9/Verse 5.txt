1 Corinthians 9:5.  Have we no right to lead about to take along with us in our missionary journeys

The interpretation we refer to is, that the apostle is here claiming the right of preachers to follow our Lord’s example (Luke 8:1-3), who allowed rich women to follow Him and His apostles, ministering to them of their substance.

But absurd as it is, modern Romanists even Cornelius à   Lapide and Estius are obliged to take refuge in it. In fact, the great fluctuation in the Greek readings of this verse especially that strange reading ‘sisters, women’ is a proof (as has been well observed) of the desperate shifts to which people have been driven to obliterate the testimony against compulsory celibacy in the ministers of Christ which the true text of this verse contains.
