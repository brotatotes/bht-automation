1 Corinthians 9:9.  For it is written in the law of Hoses  (Deuteronomy 25:4),  Thou shalt not muzzle the ox,  etc. a favourite illustration of our apostle, for he recurs to it in 1 Timothy 5:18; and no wonder; for it is one of the most beautiful proofs of the humane character of the Mosaic law, that in a matter seemingly so insignificant that even a considerate legislator might easily overlook it, provision was made against the injustice of gagging those animals on whose labour they were so dependent, when the very sight and scent of the corn they were threshing out with their feet would excite a constant craving after what was thus denied them.
	 Is it for the oxen that God careth?  Yes, in the first instance (see Job 38:4; Psalms 147:9; Matthew 6:26).
