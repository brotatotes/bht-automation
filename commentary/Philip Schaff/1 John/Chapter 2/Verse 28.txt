<p><strong> And now, my little children, abide in him: that, when he shall be manifested, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed from him at</strong> <strong> his coming. </strong> This ends the whole section which began with the ‘last time.’ The ‘coming’ of the Lord is His coming to judgment; but St. John here uses, and here only, a gracious word that signifies His presence, though marking the beginning of that presence by the word that signifies its continuance, ‘His coming.’ No reference is made to the time of His return, or to the possibility of their living on earth till He should come. We are exhorted to ‘abide in Him;’ and whether we meet Him or are brought with Him, the confidence will be the same. Its opposition is the ‘speechlessness’ of the marriage guest, ‘ashamed from Him’ or His presence.
