<p>The apostle now introduces a new order of thought, governed by the idea of regeneration as the gift of life in Christ to individual man. He first (down to chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span>) dilates on its glory as a birth of God; as the design of His love; as including both the privileges and the reality of sonship; as awaiting its full dignity at the revelation of Christ; and as inspiring through hope the energy of personal sanctification. Then (to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:10">1 John 2:10</span>) he dwells on the absolute incompatibility between the regenerate life and sin: as the destruction of sin is the object of Christâ€™s atoning; manifestation; as sin is inconsistent with abiding in Him; and as sin is the mark of communion with the devil. By an easy transition he passes to the essential connection between regeneration and brotherly love (down to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span>): showing that the great message to the regenerate was the injunction to love one another; that this involves the abiding difference between the righteous and the unrighteous, between the world and believers, as proved from Cain downwards; that brotherly love is the mark of regeneration; and, finally, that our love to each other has one supreme standard, the sacrifice of Christ for us. The apostle winds up the subject (to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:22">1 John 2:22</span>) by showing the practical issue of obedience to this commandment in the confidence which it inspires towards God as the Judge of our hearts and the Hearer of our prayer.
