1 John 2:4.  Hence he that saith, I know him  the ‘we’ has become ‘he,’ according to St. John’s habit of changing the phrase and making its force more keen and direct,
	 and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. We are sent back to chap. 1 John 1:8; 1 John 1:10; as he lied who said that he had no sin, and the truth of God was not in him, so he lies, and is without the indwelling truth, who, professing to know God in His Son, obeys Him not.
