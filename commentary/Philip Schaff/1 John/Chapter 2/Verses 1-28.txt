<p>First the apostle announces his message that God is light and only light (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>). Then follows (down to chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span>) a universal statement of the evangelical conditions of fellowship with Him in holiness. In chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:3-6">1 John 2:3-6</span> the knowledge of God is exhibited as a stimulant to perfect obedience. From <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:7">1 John 2:7</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:11">1 John 2:11</span> the walk in light is viewed with special reference to brotherly love. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:12-14">1 John 2:12-14</span> bear emphatic and redoubled testimony to the reality and truth of the Christian life generally, and of that of his readers in particular: this being introduced because of the stern contrasts which have preceded and will follow. Then comes an exhortation against the love of the world in its darkness, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:15-17">1 John 2:15-17</span>. From <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:27">1 John 2:27</span> believers are warned and protected against the doctrinal errors of the world. And, lastly, in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:28">1 John 2:28</span>, the whole is wound up by a reference to the coming of Christ and the Christian confidence before Him. It may be said that in the seven sections of this first part the whole sum of the Christian estate, from the revelation of sin to full preparation for judgment, is found, with its perfect opposite. But it is governed by the idea of the holiness of the Gospel as a sphere of light; and two points in it, regeneration and faith through the Holy Ghost, are afterwards more fully evolved.
