1 John 2:26-27. The blessedness of ‘eternal life’ has brought this sad protest against error to an end. But the writer’s heart is lull, and he introduces a final exhortation and encouragement, in the same tone that has been felt throughout, that of confidence in his readers.
	 These things have I written unto you concerning them that are seeking to lead you astray: they, rather than the anointed Christians, gave occasion for all he had said.  And as for you, the anointing which ye have received abideth in you, and ye need not that any one teach you. There is no side-glance here at the teachers who would intrude; but it is the old truth that the abiding of the interior Teacher in the heart is the supreme source of knowledge: however important the instruction of ministers, even of that which the apostle is himself here giving, may be, it derives all its value from the inward demonstration of the Spirit. His unction must sanctify reading and hearing and meditation, and all the subordinate means of learning. There is danger, of course, that this may be perverted. Hence the concluding words are   very strong; compressing into three clauses, not united with perfect concinnity, all that had been said.  But, as  his anointing  His Spirit who is the truth,  teacheth you concerning all things  in all the means He adopts, this letter being among them,  and is true, and is no lie  thus again does the apostle glory against the false teachers,  and even as it taught you, ye abide in him  thus he rejoices over his people safe from the seducers.
