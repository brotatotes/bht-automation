<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24">1 John 3:24</span>. <strong> And he that keepeth his commandments </strong> the commandments are plural again, and the obedience is individual <strong> abideth in him, and he in him.</strong> The mutual indwelling is here and in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:12">1 John 4:12</span> introduced: in the earlier portion it was ‘we in him’ chiefly, as it will be again at the close. But these two passages one individual and the other collective, one said of Christ and the other of God in the heart of the Epistle are the perfect expression of its keynote. </p>
<p><strong> And hereby we know that he abideth in us by the Spirit which he hath given us:</strong> ‘hereby’ refers to the obedience; according to the Lord’s own word, who promised, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:20-24">John 14:20-24</span>, to manifest Himself to him, and dwell with him, who has His commandments and keepeth them. Having that passage in mind, the apostle singles out the indwelling of Christ and makes that supreme. But there is higher testimony than the works, that of the Holy Ghost whose direct assurance is added. He who ‘gave’ the commandment ‘gave’ the Spirit of obedience, whose indwelling presence is the indwelling of Christ and the perfect assurance of it.
