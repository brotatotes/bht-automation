 The relation of regeneration to brotherly love.
	1 John 3:11.  For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. There is deep emphasis on the word ‘message,’ which seems here, as in the first utterance concerning the God of light, to introduce a fundamental truth; and it will be observed that this message is in what follows dwelt upon in its contrasts and deductions just as that early message was: it is like a second and a new great announcement. The ‘commandment’ of chap. 1 John 2:7 is as it were carried higher: it is the fundamental principle of religion ‘from the beginning’ delivered in successive proclamations. ‘That we should love’ must have its force: this has been the design of all.
	1 John 3:12.  Not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him! Because his works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.  The construction of the first clause should not be mended by any additional words. Cain and Abel were the first historical examples of the difference between regenerate love and unregenerate hate. But the opposite to love is alone here exhibited. The first reason that be slew his brother is that he was ‘of the evil one;’ he was not ‘of God.’ The second is the former in another form: as righteousness is the fruit and test of the new birth, Cain’s evil deeds may be said to have been the reason of his murderous violence. Thirdly, in this condensed sentence is included the thought that the righteousness of the children of God evokes for ever the hatred of the unrighteous. The devil is here ‘the evil one,’ because of the ‘evil works’ following; and it must be noted that St. John here gives his authoritative interpretation of the Old Testament both as to the devil’s relation to Cain and the reason of Cain’s hatred.
