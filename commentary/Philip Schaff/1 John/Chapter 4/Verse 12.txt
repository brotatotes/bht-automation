<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:12">1 John 4:12</span>. This verse contains three clauses, which are severally dilated on, though in a rather different order, in the seven verses which follow: the invisibility of God as the object of love; His invisible indwelling nevertheless; and the perfect operation of His love in our hearts as the representative of His invisible self.
