1 John 4:19.  we love because he first loved us.  Looking back, this sublimely shows the possibility that our love here once more absolute or without object, our ‘perfect love’ may become supreme: the argument of ‘because’ is almost equal to ‘even as,’ which is, however, not said. But the words look forward to the next verse, and that again looks back to the first of the three points in 1 John 4:12, which has been in suspense during the interim.
