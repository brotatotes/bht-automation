<p>The ruling idea of the third part is Faith in the Spirit’s testimony concerning the Son of God incarnate. The close of chap. 3 introduces the theme by the first explicit mention of faith and the Spirit. In chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1-6">1 John 4:1-6</span> the two opposite confessions, resulting from two opposite hearings of two opposite classes of spirits, are dwelt upon, with the exhortation to apply the test referred to in the second chapter. The remainder of chap. 4 is occupied with the relation between the love of God manifested in the atonement and its perfect reflection in those who received the evangelical witness of that love: the confession of the Son of God being still the leading principle. Down to chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:5">1 John 5:5</span> we have the victory of faith in Jesus as the only source of that love to God in the strength of which we can love our brethren and overcome the world: these two being strictly interwoven. From <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:6">1 John 3:6</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:13">1 John 3:13</span>, the apostle gives his full and final teaching as to the Spirit’s witness to the manifested Christ, and the nature of that witness. The remainder, from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:14">1 John 3:14</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:17">1 John 3:17</span>, is occupied with the confidence in prayer inspired by this faith.
