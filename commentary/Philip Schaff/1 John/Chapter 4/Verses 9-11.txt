<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:9-11">1 John 4:9-11</span>. God is love; and <strong> in this was the love of God manifested in us</strong>: it had its one supreme expression ‘in our case,’ ‘in us’ as its sphere. This explains what follows, in the perfect. <strong> That God hath sent </strong> as the permanent token of His love <strong> his only-begotten Son into the world that we might live through him. </strong> Here only is the ‘Only-begotten’ in the Epistle. He was sent as the eternal Son, the mystery of whose filial relation is expressed by this word: introduced here partly to indicate the greatness of the love by the measure of the gift, partly to connect our life with His. In the Gospel the Only-begotten is given as a proof of love to the world; but the life is given to those only who believe.

<p>Here the emphasis is on ‘in us;’ but the life must here include, on account of the next verse, deliverance from condemnation as well as the eternal life itself: hence not ‘in Him,’ but ‘through Him.’ The apostle then gees back from the manifestation to the love itself. <strong> Herein is love:</strong> its origination is not in or through the mission, but in God Himself. Our response is in his thought throughout; but it is only as response: ‘love is of <strong> </strong> God.’ <strong> Not that we love God, but that he loved us, and sent </strong> going back again to the past <strong> his Son as the propitiation for our sins</strong>: thus impressively does St. John show what he meant by ‘not that we loved.’ He provided and sent what not our love but our sins required. Not ‘to be’ a propitiation; but ‘He sent His Son,’ whose mission dating from heaven was atonement. </p>
<p><strong> Beloved </strong> always ‘beloved’ in this connection, <strong> since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another:</strong> not ‘so to love,’ as if the example prescribed the kind of love; but we are bound by the nature of the love common to Him and to us: it has been manifested ‘in us’ to that end.
