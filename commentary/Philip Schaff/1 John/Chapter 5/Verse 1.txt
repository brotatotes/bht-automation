<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:1">1 John 5:1</span>. <strong> Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God, and whosoever loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. </strong> Faith in Jesus as the Christ has here the only meaning that St. John ever gives it: that divinely wrought trust in the work as well as the person of Jesus which the Spirit produces, though He does not say, and which the Spirit seals, which He does say (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24">1 John 3:24</span>). The exact link between faith and regeneration is untouched. In both members of the sentence our brother is meant. The argument is, like that of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:20">1 John 4:20</span>, derived from the general nature of the case; but it is carried to the highest region, and here has the emphasis. It may be true generally, but it must be true here.
