<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:13">1 John 5:13</span>. St. John returns now to his one great design, the fulfilling of the Joy of those who believe. <strong> These things have I written to you </strong> the whole Epistle, that is, <strong> that ye may know that ye have eternal life, unto you that believe in the name of the Son of God. </strong> It was not his purpose to establish their assurance, and on that to superinduce a challenge to faith, or to a higher faith, as the reading of our present translation might suggest. Assurance is the final point, and all the blessedness that assurance brings. ‘That ye may know:’ this is one of the watchwords of the Epistle; and it is here finally introduced in such a way as to show that, while it is the gift of God’s Spirit, it is the bounden duty and privilege of every Christian to live in the enjoyment of it.
