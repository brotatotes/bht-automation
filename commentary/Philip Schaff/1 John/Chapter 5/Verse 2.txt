<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:2">1 John 5:2</span>. This is the converse of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:20">1 John 4:20</span>, and as such stands here alone: we know that we love God by the token that we love the brethren; but we also know that we love Godâ€™s children by the very fact of our loving Him. The two cannot be separated. Still, remembering that the commandment is now uppermost, we must closely unite <strong> when we love God and do his commandments. </strong> The last words introduce the customary enlargement upon <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:1">1 John 5:1</span>, which is otherwise only repeated. We love all that are begotten of Him because we love Him: the consciousness of loving God is guarantee that we have in us all that brotherly love means; especially as that love feels in itself the energy of all obedience.
