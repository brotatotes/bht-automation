1 Peter 1:16.  Because it is written, Ye shall be holy;  for I am holy. The future, ‘ye shall be,’ is better supported than the imperative, ‘be ye.’ The sense, however, remains .substantially the same. Peter appends a reason for his counsel, and this he expresses in words which he takes from God’s charge to Israel. They occur repeatedly in the Pentateuch (  e.g. Leviticus 11:44; Leviticus 19:2; Leviticus 20:7; Leviticus 20:26), but they apply with even greater force to the subject of God’s wider choice in the New Testament Israel. They are used by Peter because they mean that the relation which results from God’s call, being a covenant relation, conveys obligations on two sides.
