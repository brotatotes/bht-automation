<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:15">1 Peter 2:15</span>. <strong> for so is the will of God, </strong> <em> i.e </em> the will of God is to <em> the following effect </em> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:18">Matthew 1:18</span>, where the same word is rendered ‘on this wise ‘), namely, <strong> that</strong> <strong> by well doing ye silence the ignorance of the foolish men.</strong> The ‘well-doing,’ which might mean doing deeds of <em> kindness </em> or mercy (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:4">Mark 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:17">Acts 14:17</span>), has here the more general sense of rectitude or dutifulness of conduct. The verb ‘silence’ means literally to <em> muzzle, </em> and might be rendered ‘gag.’ But it has the secondary sense in its other New Testament occurrences, with the single exception of the two passages (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:9">1 Corinthians 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:18">1 Timothy 5:18</span>) in which the Old Testament prohibition of the <em> muzzling </em> of ‘the ox that treadeth out the corn’ is quoted; and, therefore, that sense should be retained here. Those other occurrences are all of picturesque interest viz., <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:12">Matthew 22:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:34">Matthew 22:34</span>, in reference to the <em> speechlessness </em> of the man without the wedding garment, and the <em> silencing </em> of the Sadducees; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:25">Mark 1:25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:35">Luke 4:35</span>, of Christ’s word to the unclean spirit, ‘Hold thy peace;’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:39">Mark 4:39</span>, of Christ’s word to the raging sea, ‘Be still.’ The noun used for ‘ignorance here conveys the idea (which it also has in its only other New Testament occurrence, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:34">1 Corinthians 15:34</span>, and not unfrequently in the Classics) of wilful, habitual ignorance. There is a similar ethical sense in the ‘foolish,’ which here (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:40">Luke 11:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:20">Luke 12:20</span>) has the idea of culpable senselessness, which appears in such Old Testament passages as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:1-2">Psalms 14:1-2</span>, and which is expressed by a different adjective in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21">Romans 1:21</span>. Peter’s phrase, too, may mean not merely ‘of foolish men’ generally (as the A. V. and R. V. both put it), but of ‘ <em> the </em> foolish men, with particular reference to those already mentioned as ‘speaking against them as evil-doers.’ The fact, therefore, that it was God’s purpose to make the good lives of His servants a means of silencing the oppositions of their enemies, was a further reason for proving themselves loyal citizens and submissive subjects.
