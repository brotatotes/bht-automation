<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:19">1 Peter 3:19</span>. <strong> in which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison.</strong> Here, again, the A.V., following the Genevan alone among these earlier English Versions, wrongly renders ‘ <em> by </em> which.’ The sense is, ‘in which,’ i.e <em> </em> in the spiritual form of life which has just been noticed. The verb ‘preached’ is used absolutely here. It is not to be taken, however, in the vague sense of making <em> proclamation, </em> showing Himself, or bearing witness to Himself (Schott, etc.), far less in the sense of preaching <em> judgment, </em> but in the sense which it elsewhere has in the New Testament, where it occurs, both with the object expressed <em> (e.g. the gospel, the kingdom of God, Christ, </em> etc.), and with the object unexpressed <em> (e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:1">Matthew 11:1</span></em>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:38">Mark 1:38</span>, etc.), of Christ’s earthly ministry of preaching, which was a message of grace. The word ‘spirits’ is used here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:23">Hebrews 12:23</span>, in the sense of disembodied spirits. Elsewhere <em> (e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span></em>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>) the term ‘souls’ is used to designate the departed. On the ground of the statement in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:4">2 Peter 2:4</span>, and the application of the word ‘spirit’ in such passages as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:39">Luke 9:39</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:18">Acts 16:18</span>, etc., some have strangely supposed a reference here to the angels who sinned, which is entirely inconsistent with the historical notice which follows. The phrase ‘in prison’ has the definite force which it has in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:4">2 Peter 2:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:6">Jude 1:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+20:7">Revelation 20:7</span>, and is not to be explained away as merely equivalent to ‘in safe-keeping,’ or ‘in the world of the dead’ generally.
