1 Peter 4:5.  Who shall give account; the same phrase as in Hebrews 13:17, Acts 19:40, and found on Christ’s own lips,  e.g. Matthew 12:36; Luke 16:2.

It is for the comfort of suffering believers to know that there is a judgment in waiting for their revilers, and that this judgment is in the hands of Him who will impartially give their rights to all, whether alive or dead, whether heathen or Christian.
