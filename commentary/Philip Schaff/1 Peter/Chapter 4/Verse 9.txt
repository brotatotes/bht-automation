<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:9">1 Peter 4:9</span>. <strong> hospitable one to another without murmuring.</strong> The duty of hospitality occupies a very notable place in the New Testament teaching, in respect both of private Christians and of those in office (cf. <em> e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:13">Romans 12:13</span></em>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:10">1 Timothy 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:8">Titus 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:2">Hebrews 13:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:5-8">3 John 1:5-8</span>, etc.). The characteristic Eastern virtue became of still more urgent importance among Christians in the early times of their uncertainty and trial, when families were broken up, friends divided, and homeless wanderings made a necessity. Taking it for granted, however, that the laws of hospitality are honoured, and that believers who have the power will be ready to open the door to every needy brother, Peter deals here with the spirit in which all should be done. It should be ‘without grudging,’ or rather (as the Rhemish Version and the Revised render it; while the A. V. has the support of Wycliffe, Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Genevan), ‘without murmuring,’ that is, without giving vent to hard or selfish thoughts about the cost and trouble. The word (which is strange to Classical Greek) occurs again in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:12">John 7:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:14">Philippians 2:14</span>, in all which cases the A. V. renders it <em> murmuring. </em> Only when hospitality is offered in this spirit does it answer to the high strain of love which should prevail among Christian brethren.
