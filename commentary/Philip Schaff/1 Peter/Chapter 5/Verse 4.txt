<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span>. <strong> And when the Chief Shepherd is manifested.</strong> The title ‘Chief Shepherd’ is nowhere else given to Christ. It is appropriate here, where the duties and rewards of those are dealt with who are called to act the Shepherd’s part of tending Christ’s flock for Him on earth. In chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:25">1 Peter 2:25</span> He is called simply ‘the Shepherd;’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:20">Hebrews 12:20</span> He is ‘that great Shepherd;’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>, etc., He names Himself ‘the good Shepherd.’ The word ‘manifested’ is the same as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span>, as also in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:31">John 1:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:4">Colossians 3:4</span>; 1Jn 2:28 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>, etc. ye shall receive; on this see on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:9">1 Peter 1:9</span>. the amaranthine crown of glory. In this passage, as also in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:10">Revelation 2:10</span>, the A. V. overlooks the article, and gives <em> ‘a </em> crown.’ Peter speaks of <em> ‘the </em> crown’ the one well known to Christian hope. He calls it ‘the crown <em> of glory,’ </em> meaning by that not merely that it is a <em> glorious </em> one, but that it consists of glory. Glory itself, and nothing less than that, will crown the heads of the elders as their reward for the meek discharge of their vocation. Isaiah speaks of ‘a crown of <em> beauty</em> ’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:3">Isaiah 52:3</span>); Paul of ‘a crown of <em> righteousness</em> ’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>); James (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:12">1 Peter 1:12</span>) and John (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:10">Revelation 2:10</span>) of ‘the crown of <em> life.’ </em> It is doubtful whether the figure is drawn here from the wreath with which the victors in the Greek games were crowned, from the diadem set on the heads of kings, or from the wreath which the Jews themselves made use of on festal occasions. It is less likely in the case of Peter than in that of Paul, that the imagery should be taken from the heathen spectacles. For these were abhorrent to the Palestinian Jews. The word chosen for ‘crown,’ though different from the ordinary term for a <em> diadem, </em> appears to have that sense occasionally <em> (e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:10">Revelation 4:10</span></em>), and it is possible, therefore, that here, as also perhaps in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+2:10">Revelation 2:10</span>, the idea is that of kingship. But it is most probable on the whole that Peter’s term is borrowed from familiar Jewish practice, and that the figure of the ‘crown’ points more generally to the <em> honour and joy </em> into which Christ’s faithful stewards shall enter when He returns. The ‘crown’ is further described by an adjective which differs but slightly from the one already applied to the ‘inheritance’ in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:4">1 Peter 1:4</span>. It may be translated, therefore, simply <em> unwithering. </em> It seems, however, rather to be formed immediately from the noun which denotes the flower known as the ‘amaranth.’ We should translate it, therefore, <em> amaranthine, </em> the figure being that of a wreath constructed of <em> immortelles, </em> which change neither in contour nor in colour. So Milton speaks of the ‘blissful bowers of <em> amarantine </em> shade’ whence ‘the sons of light hasten’ <em> (P. L. </em> Book 11). Compare also the description in the third book of <em> Paradise Lost:
	</em></p>
<p style="margin-left:7.2em;">‘And to the ground </p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> With solemn adoration down they cast </p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> Their crowns inwove with <em> amarant </em> and gold; </p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> Immortal <em> amarant, </em> a flower which once
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> In Paradise, fast by the tree of life, </p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> Began to bloom.’
	</p>
<p>And Cowper’s,
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;">‘The only amaranthine flower on earth </p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> Is virtue; th’ only lasting treasure, truth.’
