<p>The grace of humility closed the foregoing series of counsels. It appeared there as the safeguard against a lordly spirit on the side of those in office in the Church, and a spirit of insubordination on the side of the members and servants of the Church. It is reintroduced as the first of another brief succession of counsels addressed to all. It is enjoined now as a grace to be cherished toward God Himself, to be studied in especial under His afflictive dispensations, and to be valued as the condition upon which He suspends the honour which comes through suffering. It open the way to other kindred duties, sobriety, vigilance, stedfastness in faith. The exhortations are then crowned by a devout assurance of the graciousness of Godâ€™s intention in all the trials of the time.
