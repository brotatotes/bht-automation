 Salutation
	1 Thessalonians 1:1. The omission of the official title  Apostle  can scarcely be accounted for by supposing that Paul had not yet assumed it, but is due to the affection subsisting between him and his Thessalonian converts, which did not require that he should urge his apostolic authority; comp. also Philippians 1:1.
	 Silvanus is the Silas of Acts 15-18, the companion of Paul on his second missionary journey, during which the church of Thessalonica was founded. Timothy had also accompanied the apostle on that journey, though, owing to his extreme youth, his name does not so conspicuously appear in the narrative.
	 In God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. At this early period the ‘Church’ needed some such distinguishing appellation. The former predicate ‘in God the Father,’ distinguishes it from the Gentile assemblies; the latter, ‘in the Lord Jesus Christ,’ from the Jewish congregation. In indicates living union and fellowship.
	 Grace unto you, and peace. A Christian adaptation and blending of the ordinary Greek and Hebrew salutation. Paul wishes them a participation in God’s undeserved favour, the grace that has brought salvation to men (Titus 2:11; John 1:17); and in that peace which the Lord bequeathed to His followers, the restored harmony with God and conscience, the equanimity and confidence of God’s children, the ‘convalescence and healthfulness of the new life.’ ‘Grace the source; peace, the end of all good’ (Aquinas).
