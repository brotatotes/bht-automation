<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:10">1 Thessalonians 1:10</span>. <strong> To wait for his Son from heaven. </strong> The second coming of our Lord was one of the most important and familiar topics, both in His own teaching and in that of His apostles. The expectation of this coming was inculcated as the proper attitude for a Christian; the hope of it enabled them to endure suffering and loss, and prompted them to diligence and unworldliness. The time of the second coming was left uncertain, that it might be considered possible any day, and that thus each generation might live in the apprehension of its close proximity, and feel its chastening and stimulating influence. ‘ <em> Latet ultimus dies, ut observetur omnis dies</em> ’ (Augustine). The Christian who profoundly loves his Lord cannot but say daily, ‘Come, Lord Jesus.’

<p><strong> The coming wrath. </strong> The terrible judgments which were predicted as coming on the world, and through which the wrath, <em> i.e. </em> the punitive justice, of God should be felt (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:9">1 Thessalonians 5:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:7-10">2 Thessalonians 1:7-10</span>).
