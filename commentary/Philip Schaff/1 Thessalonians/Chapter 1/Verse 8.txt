1 Thessalonians 1:8.  For. Paul proceeds to confirm and amplify the assertion of 1 Thessalonians 1:7.
	 Hath sounded out the word of the Lord. The word rendered  sounded out  is used in Sir 40:13 , with the added definition ‘Like a great thunder.’ The word of the Lord, or the Gospel, was received by the Thessalonians with a faith so eager and genuine, and manifested its power by result’s so striking, that the attention and inquiry of the whole population of Greece were awakened, and all thus became more or less acquainted with the Gospel; comp.  Introduction  to this Epistle.
	 In every place. Not strictly speaking, but from all places with which Paul had communication (and the communication between Corinth and all parts of the Roman world was constant); perhaps even from Rome, through Aquila and Priscilla, he was hearing of the interest occasioned by the remarkable faith of the Thessalonians. Paul himself had not yet been out of Greece since leaving Thessalonica; but wherever be did go he found himself anticipated by the tidings regarding the Thessalonian believers, so that he ‘needed not to speak anything.’
