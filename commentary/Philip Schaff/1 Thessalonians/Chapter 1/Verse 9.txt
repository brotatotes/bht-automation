1 Thessalonians 1:9.  For they themselves,  i.e.  the inhabitants of the various places he visited, and who might have been expected to be unacquainted with Paul and his mission and past career; these persons to whom he intended to introduce himself, themselves related to him his ministry and mode of life in Thessalonica, and its success.
	 What manner of entering in. The circumstances in which the Gospel had been preached to them, the character of the preaching, and the reception given to it.
	 How ye turned to God from idols. They were acquainted not only with the fact that Paul had preached in Thessalonica, but also with the results of his preaching. The effect had been greater among the Gentile than among the Jewish population (Acts 17:4). To ‘turn to God’ from whatever has kept as from Him, to turn because we believe in Him and love Him, and mean to listen to, study, and obey Him, this is conversion. Conversion implies repentance,  i.e.  turning away from sin; and faith,  i.e.  turning to God in Christ. The intention, more or less conscious, with which the Thessalonians turned to God, is described in the following words, in which the two grand features of their Christian life are signalized: ‘to serve the living and true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven.’ ‘To serve God’ is a comprehensive expression including the various acts, thoughts, and feelings, whereby a godly person seeks to please God.
	 Living and true, in contrast to the idols which are ‘nothing in the world’ (1 Corinthians 8:4), and ‘are by nature no gods’ (Galatians 4:8).
