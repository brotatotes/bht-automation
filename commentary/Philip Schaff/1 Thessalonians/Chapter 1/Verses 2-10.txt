 Paul thankfully acknowledges the Genuineness and Striking Characteristics of the Conversion of the Thessalonians
	It is merely for convenience’ sake the first three chapters are divided. They really form one paragraph or section. Throughout them Paul is seeking to give utterance to the same general idea and the same sentiments. He wishes to express to the Thessalonians his continued and strong affection for them, and to make them aware of the joy he derives from hearing of their stedfastness in the faith; and he also seeks to encourage them, both by these expressions of thankfulness and affection, and also by reminding them of their initial confidence that his preaching was really the word of God, and of his manner of life among them, well fitted as it had been to deepen their conviction that he was God’s messenger. He opens the Epistle with a burst of affectionate acknowledgment, owning that he ceaselessly thanked God for the proofs they gave that his preaching had not been in vain.
