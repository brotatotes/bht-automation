1 Thessalonians 2:12.  That ye would walk worthy of God.  This was the object of Paul’s exhortations. He found that men could profess to accept God’s calling and yet live very much as they had done before; that they needed to be told to walk worthy of God. And it is a consideration which helps those who are seeking holiness, that God has associated them with Himself; as men are helped by their position to live up to it, and as children naturally strive to be worthy of their parents, so those who know God and are connected with Him are stimulated to higher efforts. This stimulus is imparted by the character in which God appears as calling men  to His own kingdom and glory.  This exhibits the ungrudging nature of His kindness, the intimacy with Himself to which we are united, and the dignity that is put upon those who respond to His invitations.
