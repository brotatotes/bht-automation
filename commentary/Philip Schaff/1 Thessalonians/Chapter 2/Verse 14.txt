1 Thessalonians 2:14. For introduces evidence of the actual working of God’s word in the believing Thessalonians. This evidence was that they had been persecuted by their own countrymen. This persecution was of itself a testimony to the reality of their Christianity. ‘If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, therefore the world hateth you.’ But Paul has probably also in view the manner in which they bore this persecution, else he would scarcely have used the word ‘imitators.’
