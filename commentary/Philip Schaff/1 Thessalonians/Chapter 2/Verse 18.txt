1 Thessalonians 2:18.  Even I Paul.

	 But Satan hindered us. How Satan did so, whether by stirring up the Jews in Thessalonica so that Paul dared not return, or by causing troubles which required Paul’s presence elsewhere, or by the infliction of sickness, we do not know. But this plain matter-of-fact statement shows us that Satan does what he can to hinder the progress and welfare of the Church, and is therefore well called Satan, the Adversary. ‘Without here entering into controversy, it seems not out of place to remark, that the language of the New Testament, if words mean anything, does ascribe a personality to the tempter so distinct and unmistakeable, that a denial of it can be only compatible with a practical denial of scripture inspiration. To the so-called charge of Manichæism, it is enough to answer that if an inspired apostle scruples not to call this fearful being “the god of this world” (2 Corinthians 4:4), no sober thinker can feel any difficulty in ascribing to him permissive powers and agencies of a frightful extent and multiplicity’ (Ellicott).
