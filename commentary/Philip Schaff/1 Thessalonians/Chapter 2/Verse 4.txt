1 Thessalonians 2:4.  Approved by God. This expression indicates a selection on the part of God of men suitable for the work which He designed to do. Paul was chosen to be an apostle, because of a natural fitness for the office. But it is not on any natural fitness Paul leans for his authority, but on God who gave him his commission. And he refers to this here, not for the sake of magnifying his own gifts, but for the sake of bringing out his responsibility to God. We speak as men responsible to God, and are thereby preserved from unworthy motives.
	 Who trieth.  God, who at first approved of Paul as fit for the office, continues to prove him throughout the whole course of his discharge of its functions.
