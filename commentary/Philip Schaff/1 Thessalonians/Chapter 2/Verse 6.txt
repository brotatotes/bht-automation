<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:6">1 Thessalonians 2:6</span>. <strong> Nor of men sought we glory.</strong> It was natural for persons who could not believe in any motives more disinterested than those which commonly animate men, to refer Paulâ€™s conduct to that which undoubtedly does produce many of the greatest actions viz., love of glory and power, of pre-eminence. His Epistles show that he frequently felt it incumbent on him to clear himself from these misconstructions. He does so here, by reminding the Thessalonians that he had not taken the position he might among them.

<p><strong> We might have been burdensome as the apostles of Christ.</strong> We might have stood upon the dignity of our office, and have required those acknowledgments, in respect, submission, and pecuniary aid, which are fairly due to the apostles of Christ. In the other passages in which Paul speaks of not being burdensome to his converts, he means that he did not lay on them the burden of maintaining him; but here he primarily refers to his not having exacted the submission which he might have demanded. This is shown as well by what precedes as by the following verse; but the idea that he did not stand upon his office involves the idea that he did not demand to be supported by his disciples, and accordingly in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span> he passes to this thought. He might have allowed respect to be shown him in the form of providing for his daily wants; but he did not seek such or any glory.
