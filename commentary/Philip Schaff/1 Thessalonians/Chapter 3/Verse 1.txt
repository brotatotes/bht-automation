1 Thessalonians 3:1.  Wherefore. Because of our vehement but thwarted desire to see you.
	 When we could no longer forbear. When the longing to see or at least to hear of you became uncontrollable.
	 To be left behind at Athena alone. The natural interpretation of these and the following words is that Timothy was sent from Athens. In the narrative given in the 17th and 18th chapters of Acts, however, no mention is made of Timothy’s arrival at Athens, and it might be inferred from chap. Acts 18:5 that he first overtook Paul at Corinth. But that narrative does inform us that Paul gave directions that Timothy should come to him  with all steed,  and also that Paul  waited for him at Athens,  The obvious inference is that Timothy did overtake Paul while yet in Athens, and was immediately sent back to Thessalonica, the apostle’s desire to hear of his friends there being stronger even than his desire for Timothy’s company. Silas apparently was also despatched on some similar mission, and the two overtook Paul a second time at Corinth, as related in Acts 18:5 and 1 Thessalonians 3:6. It is just possible that Paul may have countermanded his first order that Silas and Timothy should follow him with all convenient speed, and may thus have turned them back to Macedonia before they reached Athens. But this supposition does not so well agree with the words ‘left behind’ and ‘sent;’ and the other arrangement, proposed above, seems unobjectionable.
