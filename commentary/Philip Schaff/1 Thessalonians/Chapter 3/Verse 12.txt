1 Thessalonians 3:12.  But you may the Lord make to increase. Whatever becomes of us and of our prayer, whether we are allowed to come to you or not, may you be tended by the Lord. As the beginnings, so the increase of love is from the Lord. ‘Love is of God.’ And because it is the ‘bond of perfectness’ and ‘the fulfilling of the law,’ Paul prays that they may abound in love. It is the soil out of which all Christian grace can grow, it contains in itself the germ of all other grace, it is greater than even faith or hope: ‘God is love,’ and the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of love; and therefore Paul, desiring that his converts be established unblameable in holiness, prays that they may abound in love.
