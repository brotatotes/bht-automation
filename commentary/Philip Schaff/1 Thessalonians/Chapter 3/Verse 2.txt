<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:2">1 Thessalonians 3:2</span>. <strong> Our brother and fellow-labourer with God.</strong> This reading is doubtful, but is preferred by the most discriminating editors. The reading followed by the English version is more natural and presents less difficulty. But the expression ‘fellow-labourer with God is supported by <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>. Paul bestows these commendatory titles on Timothy partly from his affection for his young assistant, partly to illustrate still further his love for the Thessalonians, which enabled him to part with so dear and valuable a companion. It has been justly observed, that the fact of Paul’s sending Timothy on this mission sufficiently refutes the charge of timidity and weakness which has sometimes been brought against this young disciple. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:19-22">Philippians 2:19-22</span>.

<p><strong> Exhort you concerning your faith. </strong> Paul’s fear was that the faith of the recent converts might fail under the persecution to which they were exposed. Timothy was sent in the interest of their faith, to explain to them that the troubles in which they were involved were no proof that their faith was foolish, and to encourage them to maintain it.
