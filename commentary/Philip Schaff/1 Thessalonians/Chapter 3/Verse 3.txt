1 Thessalonians 3:3.  For yourselves know. Expected tribulations can be no trial to faith, however they may try our sincerity and integrity. From the first God declares to His people that they may count upon trial; and therefore when trial comes they cannot be inclined to suppose that God is forgetful of them. ‘Seeing that afflictions are appointed to us, and we appointed to them; seeing there is a decree of God concerning them, a decree as to the matter of them, as to the manner of them, as to the measure of them, as to the time of them, when they shall commence, how far they shall advance, how long they shall continue; seeing everything in affliction is under an appointment, how meek and humble, how patient and submissive, ought the Christian’s spirit to be under them, and with what steadiness of expectation may and ought he to look up to heaven for a sanctified use and improvement of them!’ (Burkitt).
