1 Thessalonians 3:7.  We were comforted. The tidings which Paul received of the stedfastness of his Thessalonians under trial, enabled him to endure his own troubles with greater equanimity. Their continued faith showed him that his former labours and trials had not been in vain, their affection and sympathy cheered him, and their uncomplaining endurance was a fresh stimulus to his own patience.
