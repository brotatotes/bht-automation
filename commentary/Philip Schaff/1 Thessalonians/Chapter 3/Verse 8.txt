<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:8">1 Thessalonians 3:8</span>. <strong> For now.</strong> ‘ <em> Now </em> refers to the change of feeling occasioned by the arrival of Timothy’ (Jowett). It is equivalent to <em> in these circumstances, in this condition of things, </em> that is to say, if ye stand fast in the Lord, we live.
	</p>
<p><strong> We live,</strong> <em> i.e. </em> we have the full strength and enjoyment of life: this is enough for us; we no longer feel cramped and depressed by our own troubles.
