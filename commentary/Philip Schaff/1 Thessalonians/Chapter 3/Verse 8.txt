1 Thessalonians 3:8.  For now. ‘  Now  refers to the change of feeling occasioned by the arrival of Timothy’ (Jowett). It is equivalent to  in these circumstances, in this condition of things,  that is to say, if ye stand fast in the Lord, we live.
	 We live,  i.e.  we have the full strength and enjoyment of life: this is enough for us; we no longer feel cramped and depressed by our own troubles.
