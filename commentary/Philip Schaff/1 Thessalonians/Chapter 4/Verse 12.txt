<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:12">1 Thessalonians 4:12</span>. <strong> That ye may make walk becomingly toward them that are without.</strong> This is ‘the regular designation of those who were <em> not </em> Christians;’ a designation which merely defines without passing any judgment on their condition. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:7">1 Timothy 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:5">Colossians 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:12-13">1 Corinthians 5:12-13</span>.) It is probably derived from the expressions ‘without the camp,’ ‘without the synagogue;’ and conveys the idea of exclusion not simply from the Church, but from all that satisfies man. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:15">Revelation 22:15</span>. As the passages just referred to show, Paul was ever solicitous (as Peter also was, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:12-19">1 Peter 2:12-19</span>) that Christians should so excel in the domestic virtues, in the common decencies and courtesies and duties of life, as to afford the heathen no occasion to upbraid, or despise, or suspect them. A decorous and irreproachable demeanour, excellence in the virtues which the world acknowledges, diligence in the public service, these things commend the religion which enjoins them.

<p><strong> And may have lack of</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> <strong> nothing. </strong> Ellicott prefers to render these words ‘may have need of no <em> man,’ </em> that is to say, may, by working with your own hands, be independent of the support other men can afford you. This meaning suits the context very well, but the common rendering is the more natural, and equally <em> suits </em> the context; and the difference between the two renderings is practically inappreciable. Paul desires that they may mind their own business, and work with their own hands, so as to be independent; and to keep the reproach of uselessness and laziness from blotting their religion.
