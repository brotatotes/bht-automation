The bodily ascent will be a token of the new conditions into which the body has passed, and will serve to identify the glorified body of the believer with that of Christ. But, as Luther remarks, this passage is of a symbolical kind, and we most not press each expression to its exact literal significance. The general idea of a <strong> </strong> gathering to the Lord is conveyed, but a literal representation of all the details here mentioned would fail to furnish us with an accurate picture of what will actually take place. ‘Such an attempt is like painting a picture of the scenes in the Apocalypse, which, the moment they are brought together, are seen to have a prophetic and symbolical meaning, not an artistic unity’ (Jowett).

<p><strong> Ever with</strong> <strong> the Lord. </strong> It is this which fills the Christian’s future and makes heaven for him.
