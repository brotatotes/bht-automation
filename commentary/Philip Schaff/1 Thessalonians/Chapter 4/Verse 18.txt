<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:18">1 Thessalonians 4:18</span>. <strong> Wherefore. </strong> There being no ground for your supposing that your dead friends will suffer any disadvantage from dying before Christ comes.
	</p>
<p><strong> Comfort one another with</strong> <strong> these words</strong>. Paul scarcely expects that mourners will themselves remember in their grief that which should alleviate it; but he calls upon their fellow-Christians to assume the office of comforter. And that no one may excuse himself on the score of having no consolation to offer, he gives them wherewithal they may mitigate the bitterness of bereavement.
