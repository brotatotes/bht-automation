1 Thessalonians 4:3.  For  this.  The reason why the precepts had been given and were to be kept, was that God desired their sanctification.
	 The will of God. It is this which God desires and intends when He calls you by the Gospel. What God wills and intends, He also makes provision for: hence the encouragement the Christian has in knowing that all his efforts after holiness are in accordance with that will which accomplishes all it designs.
	 That ye abstain from  fornication.  This is the particular virtue in which their sanctification was to be manifested. And here and elsewhere emphasis is laid upon purity of life, because licentiousness was bred in the bone of the converts from heathenism, and fornication was in Greece considered a   venial transgression.
