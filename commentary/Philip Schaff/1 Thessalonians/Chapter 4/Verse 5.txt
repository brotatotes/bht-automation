1 Thessalonians 4:5.  Not in the lost of concupiscence.  Marriage is to be contracted not for mere bodily gratification, but to gratify purer feelings and yearnings. Married people are so to live that they may be mutually conscious that with them marriage is an honourable estate, with nothing in it that makes them ashamed, and that it promotes their sanctification.
	 Who know not God.  Those who know not God cannot be expected to have the same ideal of holiness and purity. They have not heard the words, ‘Be ye holy, for I am holy;’ neither have they become acquainted with perfect holiness in the incarnate God. Every Christian, therefore, must feel how much more is required of him than of the heathen. Increased knowledge is increased responsibility.
