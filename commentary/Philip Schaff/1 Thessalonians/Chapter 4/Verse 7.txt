1 Thessalonians 4:7.  For God called us not onto uncleanness. Paul returns to the idea of the third verse, the idea that such sins were antagonistic to God’s purpose and work in Christians. If we profess to be responding to God’s call, let us clearly understand what it is; what we must abandon, and what we must seek. It is a call from one moral condition to another.
