1 Thessalonians 4:9.  Brotherly love is love to the ‘brethren,’  i.e. to Christians, who had received the spirit of adoption and power to become the sons of God. As the great motive of Christ’s coming was love for us, so the great object of His coming was to enable us to love God and one another; to set us right with God and men. And He effects this by first of all knitting us to Himself. By loving Him we get into sympathy with all who love Him, and we also contract His own way of looking at men. So that where religion makes men severe rather than tender, censorious rather than meek and hopeful, proud rather than lowly, uncharitable in feeling and act rather than considerate and helpful, their religion is a failure (1 John 4:20, etc.).
	 Ye need not that I write unto you. Paul insinuates his exhortation to further attainment, by giving them credit for what they have already achieved.
	 For you yourselves are taught of God.  You need no one to teach you, for you yourselves are already taught
	taught directly by Him whose ministers we are, taught by Him whose teaching not only enlightens conscience but animates the will, so that the result of His teaching is apparent in your conduct.
