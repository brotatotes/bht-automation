<p><em> Exhortation to Holiness of Life.
	</em></p>
<p>As in all his Epistles Paul at least concludes with a strenuous and full inculcation of moral duties, so here he reiterates to the Thessalonians those precepts and warnings which he had seen to be needful while he was himself among them. Not less than in other Greek cities was there a danger in Thessalonica that sins of impurity might stain the character of the young Christian community. Very earnestly therefore does Paul entreat them to keep themselves pure from such sins, to avail themselves of the natural safeguard against unchastity, and to revert always to the consideration that it was their holiness and purity from all <strong> </strong> defilement which God intended when He called them.
