 Exhortation to Brotherly Love and Industry
	The connection between the two subjects of this paragraph, brotherly love and quiet industry, is somewhat obscure. It may be that those who had abandoned their ordinary callings and were spending their time in idle expectation of the Lord’s coming, or in a gossiping and meddling interference with other men’s affairs, were deadening their own brotherly love, and were tempting their more industrious neighbours to abuse and recrimination. The connection of the whole paragraph with the preceding lies probably in the suggestion made by 1 Thessalonians 4:6 of the subject of brotherly love.
