1 Thessalonians 5:1.  But of the times end seasons.  When our Lord spoke to His disciples of the coming of the Son of man, they naturally felt a desire to know when it should take place; and Paul, not without reason, supposes that a similar desire may be stirring in the minds of those to whom he has announced the same event. Paul therefore passes to this subject, and with instinctive courtesy and skill turns their minds from useless inquiries to profound moral truths. ‘Times and seasons’ became a common expression, giving a greater completeness than either word alone would give; but probably the distinctive meaning of each word was lost sight of. If they are to be distinguished, ‘times’ refers to the periods into which history is divided, ‘seasons’ to the eras at which seasonably occur those great events which give a new momentum to the history.
	 Ye have no need that it be written to you. People are more likely to receive information when their informant presumes they know it already. Paul’s reason for this presumption probably was that he himself had previously told them that the time of the Lord’s coming was unrevealed (comp. 2 Thessalonians 2:5).
