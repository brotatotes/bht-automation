<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:10">1 Thessalonians 5:10</span>. <strong> Who died for us. </strong> How salvation is obtained through Jesus Christ, Paul here explains. Christ died for our sake, and especially to secure for us this grand advantage, viz. <strong> that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</strong> Recurring to the anxieties of the Thessalonians regarding their deceased friends, he reminds them that the very object of Christ in dying was to secure to His people a life which no death could interrupt or destroy. Those who have died before His return suffer no disadvantage, for He has secured that whether we wake or sleep, whether, <em> i.e., </em> we live or die, we should live with Him. It should be remarked that Paul does not here throw any light on the present state of the Christian dead, unless by inference; what he thinks and speaks of is their blessedness when Christ returns.
