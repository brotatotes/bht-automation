1 Thessalonians 5:13.  To esteem them very highly in love.  There was required not merely an outward deference and submission, but an affectionate regard. Little good can be effected in a church in which the ministers are neither respected nor loved. But this respect and love must have a real object, must be excited and maintained by the efficiency of the ministry: as Paul says, it is to be  for their work’s sake.  ‘On account both of the importance of the work (Hebrews 13:17) and the earnest and laborious manner in which it was performed; comp. Philippians 1:22; Philippians 2:30 ’ (Ellicott).
	 Be at peace among yourselves.  This suitably follows on the foregoing admonitions. Do not quarrel with your rulers, nor let their actions produce among; you a   factious spirit. This ecclesiastical organization is new, it brings you into new and delicate relations with persons of various education and habits; there will be difficulties and great need of patience, forbearance, yieldingness of spirit; but see that you live at peace.
