Little good can be effected in a church in which the ministers are neither respected nor loved. But this respect and love must have a real object, must be excited and maintained by the efficiency of the ministry: as Paul says, it is to be <strong> for their work’s sake. </strong> ‘On account both of the importance of the work (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:17">Hebrews 13:17</span>) and the earnest and laborious manner in which it was performed; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+1:22">Philippians 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:30">Philippians 2:30</span> ’ (Ellicott).

<p><strong> Be at peace among yourselves. </strong> This suitably follows on the foregoing admonitions. Do not quarrel with your rulers, nor let their actions produce among; you a <strong> </strong> factious spirit.
