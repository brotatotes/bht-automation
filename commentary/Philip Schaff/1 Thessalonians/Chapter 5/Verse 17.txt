1 Thessalonians 5:17.  Pray  without ceasing. One of the Greek commentators (Theophylact) remarks that the apostle now shows how we may continually rejoice, viz. by continuing in prayer and thanksgiving. We obey this precept when our prayers are not fitful and intermittent, but steady and persistent; when we are careful to lay all our concerns before God, and when day is linked to day in our life by a regular recurrence to Him as our Guide and Father. Paul does not mean that we should employ our whole time in prayer, but that we should not omit those times of devotion we have resolved upon, nor forget to bring any matter before God, nor relax our earnestness through any disappointment or decay of faith
	should, as Barrow says,  ‘ with assiduous urgency drive on the intent of our prayers, never quitting it, or desisting, till our requests are granted, or our desires are accomplished.’ The words do not refer to the spirit of prayer but to the practice of it, although it is of course true that unless the spirit of prayer be maintained, the practice also will be fallen from. ‘In thy prayers wait for God, and think not every hearty prayer can procure everything thou askest. . . . A little omission of any usual exercise of piety cannot happen to thee without some loss and detriment, even though it be upon a considerable cause’ (Jeremy Taylor).
