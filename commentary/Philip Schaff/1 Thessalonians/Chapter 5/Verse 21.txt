1 Thessalonians 5:21.  Prove all things. Neither in regard to these manifestations of the Spirit’s presence, nor in any matter, were they to be led by prejudice and appearances and first impressions, but they were to put things to the proof, to test them. Rules for doing so are furnished by the Apostle John (1 John 4:1-8). In Corinth some Christians enjoyed a special gift of ‘discernment of spirits’ (1 Corinthians 12:10). The Thessalonians were to judge by the moral quality of the prophesyings, or of whatever else came before them. And this moral discernment was to result in a practical choice, as expressed in the two following clauses.
	 From every form of evil. This does not mean, as the Authorised Version might lead a reader to suppose, ‘abstain from everything which has the appearance of being evil,’ for he has just counselled them to look deeper than appearances. Having tested all things by their real character, they are to abstain from evil of every form. Even though it had the appearance of good, even though it was in the form of pretended spiritual wisdom or zeal for Christ, they were to abstain from it.
