1 Thessalonians 5:23.  The God of peace. A term occurring towards the close of many of the Epistles see references.

	 Sanctify you wholly. Both in this and in the succeeding clause the emphasis lies on the completeness of the work of sanctification. The members of the Thessalonian Church were not to suppose that this new religion they professed consisted merely or mainly in certain rites or observances. It called them to holiness, a sanctity of conduct from which no part of their, life might be exempted, a sanctity of person in which their whole nature must partake. This completeness, this harmonious advance of every element of Christian character, is the difficulty.

His words may be compared to similar expressions among ourselves,  e.g., “ with my heart and soul.” Who would distinguish between the two?’(Jowett).
