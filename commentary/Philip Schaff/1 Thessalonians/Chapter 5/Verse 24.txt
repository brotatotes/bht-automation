1 Thessalonians 5:24.  Faithful is he that calleth you. He hath called you to holiness (chap. 1 Thessalonians 4:7), and He will enable you to fulfil His call. He does not mock you; He is in earnest. He abideth faithful; as surely pledged to make you holy as you are commanded to become so. There is a promise implied in His call; and with God to promise is to perform.
