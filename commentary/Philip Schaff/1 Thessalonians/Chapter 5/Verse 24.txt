<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:24">1 Thessalonians 5:24</span>. <strong> Faithful is he that calleth you.</strong> He hath called you to holiness (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:7">1 Thessalonians 4:7</span>), and He will enable you to fulfil His call. He does not mock you; He is in earnest. He abideth faithful; as surely pledged to make you holy as you are commanded to become so. There is a promise implied in His call; and with God to promise is to perform.
