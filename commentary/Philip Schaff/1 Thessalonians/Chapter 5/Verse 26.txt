<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:26">1 Thessalonians 5:26</span>. <strong> Salute all the brethren.</strong> To whom was this addressed? Probably to the office-bearers of the church, to whom the letter would be delivered; although in the parallel passages (see references) the members were to salute one another. But in this case Paul sends his own salutation, which it would be sufficient to read without actually delivering.

<p><strong> An holy kiss.</strong> ‘The oriental custom of kissing in their greetings is here enhanced with Christian characteristics; it is to be an holy kiss. . . no idle, meaningless, and merely pagan custom of salutation’ (Ellicott).
