<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:27">1 Thessalonians 5:27</span>. <strong> I charge you by the Lord.</strong> Why this vehemence of adjuration? Was there a danger that the letter would not be read? No better reason can be given than that Paul’s affectionate anxiety for the spiritual welfare of his converts broke out in this earnest request that his counsels should be delivered to them all. It is, however, matter of congratulation that in this, the first of Paul’s extant Epistles, there should occur this urgent injunction that what he had written should be publicly read. Bengel remarks that what Paul so urgently enjoined is precisely that which the Church of Rome as earnestly prohibits.
