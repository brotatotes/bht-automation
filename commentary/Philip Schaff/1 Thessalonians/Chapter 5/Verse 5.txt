1 Thessalonians 5:5.  For all ye are sons of light and sons of day.  As ‘the children of this world’ are those who wholly belong to it; as ‘the son of perdition’ is the man of whom perdition is the most striking feature, who is bound over to perdition, as that with which he is identified; so ‘the children of the light’ are those who are produced by the light, who belong to it, and live in it as their element. They are what they are because they have accepted Christ as the Light, and have learned from Him the truth about God, sin, life, and all that concerns them. They have gladly faced what  is  thus revealed to them, and desire to act upon it.
	 Not of night nor of darkness. They who are of darkness make nothing of the light which shines in the first ‘day of the Lord,’ of the truth disclosed by His first coming. They have not’ comprehended’ that light, have not set their faces to it, and let it become life to them.
