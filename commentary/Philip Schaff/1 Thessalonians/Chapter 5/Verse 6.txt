Our position as children of light implies a certain corresponding wakefulness. We are the children of light because we live in Christ; it follows that we look and long for His appearing, and do not sleep as other men may who do not desire or expect His coming.

<p><strong> Watch and be sober. </strong> The best commentary on these words is the exhortation of our Lord: ‘Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:34-36">Luke 21:34-36</span>).
