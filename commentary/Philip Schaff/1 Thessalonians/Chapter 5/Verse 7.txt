<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:7">1 Thessalonians 5:7</span>. <strong> They that sleep, sleep in the night. </strong> Every man has a natural shame of being found asleep in the day-time, no matter what good excuse he has for it, however exhausted and unwell he may be. If even nature thus teaches us to be ashamed of sleeping through the hours God <em> gives </em> us for wakeful work, let us, who are of the day, watch.

<p><strong> They that are drunken, are drunken in the night.</strong> Or at least should be, and in most countries are, so ashamed of themselves as to court darkness. When a man begins not only to exceed at night, when weariness or conviviality might tempt him, but, even before the dayâ€™s work is well begun, is found unfit for any duty, he is, humanly speaking, hopeless. Peter thought it enough, when those who were filled with the Spirit at Pentecost were supposed to be drunk, to remind their accusers that it was but the third hoof of the day.
