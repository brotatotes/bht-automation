1 Thessalonians 5:9.  For.  Paul shows the reasonableness of this hope.
	 God hath not appointed us to wrath.  The truest parallel to this expression is that of Peter (1 Peter 2:8), where he speaks of the disobedience of the rejecters of Christ, and adds, ‘whereunto also they were appointed,’ set apart, as it were, in the purpose of God to this end. This end was also the eager choice of their own will; though how these two determining motives both find room we cannot tell. Paul speaks assuredly of the election of the Thessalonians (1 Thessalonians 1:4), because he had witnessed the fruits of it, in their turning from idols to serve the living God. The ‘wrath’ spoken of is the manifestation of the Divine anger against sin in the coming and judgment of Christ. Having negatively described their destiny, Paul goes on to describe it positively.
	 To obtain salvation.  Other passages extend the meaning of ‘salvation’ (see chap. 1 Thessalonians 4:7), but here the leading idea in the apostle’s mind is escape from the destruction with which the unbelieving world was to be visited; though this involves, as he immediately shows, life with Christ.
