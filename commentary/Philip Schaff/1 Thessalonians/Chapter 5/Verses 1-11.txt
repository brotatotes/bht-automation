 Exhortation to Sobriety and Watchfulness, founded in the Suddenness of the Lord’s Coming, and on their Character as Children of Light.
	Having spoken so definitely of the Lord’s coming, Paul anticipates that the Thessalonians will inquire the time of this great consummation. He therefore reminds them that they are already aware that the time is uncertain, the coming sudden; but that it need not alarm them who are prepared for it and desire it. They have, he says, an affinity for that day, living now on those principles which it is to assert and enforce. And from this he takes occasion to exhort them to the conduct which becomes persons who expect their Lord, and who believe themselves to be destined to partake of His glory.
