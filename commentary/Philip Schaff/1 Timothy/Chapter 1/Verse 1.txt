<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:1">1 Timothy 1:1</span>. <strong> According to the commandment. </strong> Characteristic of the Pastoral Epistles (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:3">Titus 1:3</span>, and in another connexion <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:15">Titus 2:15</span>, but also in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:26">Romans 16:26</span>). Stronger and more emphatic than the simple reference to ‘the <em> Will </em> of God’ in the earlier Epistles.

<p><strong> God our Saviour.</strong> This also is a distinctive note of this group. Though the name of Saviour is still given to the Lord Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:4">Titus 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:6">Titus 3:6</span>), it is not limited to Him. The new feature in St. Paul’s later language is that he thinks of the Father as essentially a Saviour, in all senses of the word, as the Preserver and Deliverer of mankind (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:3">1 Timothy 2:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:10">1 Timothy 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:3">Titus 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:10">Titus 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:4">Titus 3:4</span>). Probably we may trace in this the influence of the language of the Magnificat (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:47">Luke 1:47</span>), with which we may well believe him to have become acquainted through his intimacy with St. Luke.

<p><strong> Christ Jesus our hope. </strong> At once the ground of hope in the apostle’s consciousness of His presence, and the object of hope in his anticipations of the future. The phrase is not a common one, but once before St. Paul had spoken of ‘Christ in you, the hope of glory’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:27">Colossians 1:27</span>), and in both passages has used the language of the LXX. Version of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+65:6">Psalms 65:6</span>: ‘God our Saviour, Thou that art the hope of all the ends of the earth. ‘

<p><strong> My own son in the faith.</strong> Better ‘ <em> true child’ </em> The word (more affectionate than ‘son’) is one which St. Paul, in advanced life, was fond of using of the young disciples, such as Timothy (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:20">Philippians 2:20</span>) and Titus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:4">Titus 1:4</span>), in whom he saw a <em> genuine </em> likeness of character to himself. The addition ‘in the faith’ distinguishes the relation from that of actual sonship.
