<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:10">1 Timothy 1:10</span>. Sins against the seventh commandment, recognising the true division of natural and unnatural vices (‘defilers of themselves with <em> males</em> ’), came first; then the worst form of offence against the eighth, the kidnapping and man-stealing to which the prevalence of slavery naturally gave rise, and in the guilt of which Jews were probably known to be sharers; lastly, the two forms of evil forbidden by the ninth, falsehood, with, or without, the added guilt of perjury. It is significant that no reference is made (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:9">Romans 13:9</span>) to the tenth commandment. The apostle prefers resting his case upon concrete evil acts, and does not enter on the less tangible region of desires.

<p><strong> Contrary to sound doctrine.</strong> Here for the first time we come across the word that more than any other is characteristic of the Pastoral Epistles ( 1Ti 6:3 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:13">2 Timothy 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:3">2 Timothy 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:9">Titus 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:13">Titus 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:1-2">Titus 2:1-2</span>), occurring in this figurative sense in them and in them only. What it marks out is the tendency of the true doctrine to a <em> healthy </em> spiritual state, of all departure from the truth to a state morbid and unhealthy. The idea of health presupposed is that of clear perception, calm feeling, a will strong and stedfast the <em> mens sana, </em> even though the <em> corpus sanum </em> be absent. Looking to the fact that when these Epistles were written St. Paul had been for years in intimate companionship with St. Luke, the beloved physician, it is not rash to conjecture that both the thought and term had been derived from him. The word, it may be noted, occurs three times in his Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:31">Luke 5:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:10">Luke 7:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:27">Luke 15:27</span>), and not at all in the other three.
