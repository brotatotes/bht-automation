<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:12">1 Timothy 1:12</span>. <strong> Who hath enabled me.</strong> The order of the Greek is more emphatic. ‘I <em> give thanks to Him who gave me power, to Christ Jesus our Lord.’ </em> It is significant that the same word is used by Luke in his account of St. Paul’s conversion, ‘he was strengthened’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:19">Acts 9:19</span>). The tense points rather to what was done at that time than to a continuous action.

<p>Faithful. In the sense of ‘trustworthy.’ So, with the same thought of this recognition of his faithfulness being an act of mercy, in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:25">1 Corinthians 7:25</span>. Christ in His pity saw, through the rage and fury of the persecutor, the germ of that thoroughness in action, and loyalty to conscience, which was capable of being developed into the higher faithfulness.

<p><strong> Putting.</strong> Better, when used of a Divine act, ‘ <em> appointing,’ </em> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:9">1 Thessalonians 5:9</span>.
