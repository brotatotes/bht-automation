1 Timothy 1:12.  Who hath enabled me. The order of the Greek is more emphatic. ‘I  give thanks to Him who gave me power, to Christ Jesus our Lord.’  It is significant that the same word is used by Luke in his account of St. Paul’s conversion, ‘he was strengthened’ (Acts 9:19). The tense points rather to what was done at that time than to a continuous action.
	Faithful. In the sense of ‘trustworthy.’ So, with the same thought of this recognition of his faithfulness being an act of mercy, in 1 Corinthians 7:25.
