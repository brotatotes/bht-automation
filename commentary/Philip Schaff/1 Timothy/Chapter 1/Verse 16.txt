In him ‘first,’ or <em> ‘chief </em> (as a greater, more typical instance than any other), Christ Jesus would snow forth all the long-suffering which marked God’s dealings with the world. That word, also, St. Paul had been thus taught to place high in the catalogue of Divine attributes (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:22">Romans 9:22</span>), in that of the human excellences which were after the pattern of the Divine (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:6">2 Corinthians 6:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12">Colossians 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:10">2 Timothy 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:2">2 Timothy 4:2</span>), the characteristic of love in man (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:4">1 Corinthians 13:4</span>) as in God.

<p><strong> Life everlasting. </strong> Better perhaps <em> ‘eternal’ </em> Here also, as with <em> ‘</em> coming into the world,’ we note St. Paul’s use of a word which, though not peculiar to St. John, is yet eminently characteristic of him, occurring seventeen times in his Gospel, and six times in his First Epistle.
