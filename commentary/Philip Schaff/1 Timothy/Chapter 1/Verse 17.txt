<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:17">1 Timothy 1:17</span>. As in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36">Romans 11:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:27">Romans 16:27</span>, the thought of God’s great mercy leads the apostle to break out into a jubilant doxology.
	</p>
<p><strong> The King eternal.</strong> Literally <em> ‘the king of the ages,’ </em> of all the æons or periods which man’s thought can apprehend in the remotest past, or future. The phrase is taken from the LXX. of Tob 13:6 and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+145:13">Psalms 145:13</span>, and occurs here only in the New Testament. It is obvious, as in the parallel passages, that the doxology is offered to the Father.
	</p>
<p><strong> Immortal</strong>. Better, as in Rom 1:23 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:52">1 Corinthians 15:52</span>, ‘ <em> incorruptible.’
	</em></p>
<p><strong> The only wise God. </strong> ‘Wise’ is wanting in the later MSS., and has probably been inserted from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:27">Romans 16:27</span>. The word ‘only,’ as applied to God, is not uncommon in the New Testament, but is especially characteristic of this Epistle (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:15-16">1 Timothy 6:15-16</span>) and St. John (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:44">John 5:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+15:4">Revelation 15:4</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> For ever and ever.</strong> Lit. <em> ‘for the ages of the ages,’ </em> periods in which each moment is an æon.
