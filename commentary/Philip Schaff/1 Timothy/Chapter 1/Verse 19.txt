<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:19">1 Timothy 1:19</span>. <strong> Faith.</strong> The personal subjective trust in God, as coupled with the ‘good conscience.’

<p><strong> Having put away. </strong> The Greek implies violence, ‘ <em> thrusting from them.’

<p><strong> Concerning faith have made shipwreck.</strong> The article in the Greek before ‘faith’ implies that (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:9">1 Timothy 3:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:6">1 Timothy 4:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:8">1 Timothy 5:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:21">1 Timothy 6:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:8">2 Timothy 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:3">Jude 1:3</span>) it is taken in the objective sense as <em> ‘the </em> faith which men believe.’ Casting from them the protection of a good conscience, without which real trust or belief was impossible, they drifted on the sea of error, and made shipwreck concerning <em> the </em> faith. The metaphor was common enough, yet we may think of St. Paul’s fourfold experience of shipwreck (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:25">2 Corinthians 11:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:0">Acts 27:0</span>) as giving it a new vividness and power.
