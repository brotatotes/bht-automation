1 Timothy 1:19.  Faith. The personal subjective trust in God, as coupled with the ‘good conscience.’
	 Having put away.  The Greek implies violence, ‘  thrusting from them.’
	 Concerning faith have made shipwreck. The article in the Greek before ‘faith’ implies that (as in 1 Timothy 3:9, 1 Timothy 4:6, 1 Timothy 5:8, 1 Timothy 6:21; 2 Timothy 3:8; Jude 1:3) it is taken in the objective sense as  ‘the  faith which men believe.’ Casting from them the protection of a good conscience, without which real trust or belief was impossible, they drifted on the sea of error, and made shipwreck concerning  the  faith. The metaphor was common enough, yet we may think of St. Paul’s fourfold experience of shipwreck (2 Corinthians 11:25; Acts 27:0) as giving it a new vividness and power.
