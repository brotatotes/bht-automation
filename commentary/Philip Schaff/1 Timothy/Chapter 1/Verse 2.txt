As with the title ‘Saviour,’ it is as though advancing years only led him to dwell more and more on that attribute of which he found so striking an example in God’s treatment of himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:16">1 Timothy 1:16</span>). ‘Mercy’ and ‘peace’ are found together in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:16">Galatians 6:16</span>.

<p><strong> From God the Father.</strong> Not peculiar to these Epistles, and yet characterizing all of them (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:2">2 Timothy 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:4">Titus 1:4</span> <em> ).
