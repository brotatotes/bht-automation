<p><strong> Vain jangling.</strong> The Greek word was possibly a word coined for the occasion. The history of the English word is not without interest. From the Latin <em> joculator, </em> the teller of jests and good stories, came the French <em> jongleur, </em> and the English ‘juggler’ or ‘jangler.’ The word is defined by Chaucer in the <em> Parson’s Tale: </em> ‘Jangelying is when a man speketh to moche beforn folk, and clappeth as a mille, and taketh no keep what he saith.’ Its application to ‘sweet bells jangled out of tune’ was of later date.
