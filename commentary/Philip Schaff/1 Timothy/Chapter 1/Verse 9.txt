<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:9">1 Timothy 1:9</span>. <strong> The law. </strong> There is no article in the Greek, but St. Paul’s use of the words elsewhere <em> (e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:14">Romans 6:14</span></em>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:18">Galatians 5:18</span>) justifies the translation. The law would not be needed but for the lawless element in men which needs correction.

<p><strong> Disobedient. </strong> Better ‘ <em> insubordinate,’ </em> the state of the ‘carnal mind ‘which is not <em> subject </em> to the law of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:7">Romans 8:7</span>). The next four words, while expressing different shades of evil, have this in common, that they all speak of evil in its relation to God, of sins against the First Table the <strong> ungodly</strong>, who have no reverence; the <strong> sinners, </strong> who, apart from special offences, are without God in the world; the <strong> unholy</strong>, in whom there is no inward purity; the <strong> profane</strong>, in whom there is not even any show of consecration to His service. The words that follow, as describing sins against the Second Table, begin naturally with those against the fifth commandment. In the strong words chosen to indicate the sins of deepest dye in each case, we may probably trace a righteous indignation at the sins of the Heathen world, like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:24-32">Romans 1:24-32</span>; possibly also as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:21-24">Romans 2:21-24</span>, to the vices which stained the lives even of these boasters of the law. ‘ <strong> Murderers of fathers,’</strong> The Greek is more generic, ‘ <em> smilers,’ </em> without necessarily implying death as resulting from the blow. It is distinguished here from ‘man-slayers,’ and so sins against the fifth and sixth commandments come in their natural order.
