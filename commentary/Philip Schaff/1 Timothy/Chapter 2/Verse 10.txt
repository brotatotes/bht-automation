<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:10">1 Timothy 2:10</span>. <strong> Becometh.</strong> The same reference to a standard of decorum at once conventional and real, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:13">1 Corinthians 11:13</span>.

<p><strong> Professing godliness. </strong> The usual meaning of the verb is simply ‘promise;’ but here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:21">1 Timothy 6:21</span>, it is the promise implied by outward act, and is therefore rightly rendered by ‘professing.’ The Greek for ‘godliness’ (θεοσέβειαν ) occurs here only in the New Testament, and is somewhat stronger than the εύσεβεία <em> </em> commonly so rendered; ‘reverence for God ‘would express its meaning fairly.
