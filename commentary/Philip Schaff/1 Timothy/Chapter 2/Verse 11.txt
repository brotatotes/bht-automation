1 Timothy 2:11.  Let the woman learn in silence.  Better ‘a woman.’ As before noted, the words indicate that St. Paul is dwelling on the position of women in the public meetings of the Church. For them to appear as teachers there would be an usurpation. ‘  Quietness ’ or ‘  tranquility’ rather than ‘silence.’
