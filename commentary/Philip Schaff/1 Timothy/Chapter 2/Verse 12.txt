<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:12">1 Timothy 2:12</span>. <strong> To teach.</strong> Obviously, as limited by the context, the’ reference is to public teaching. The question meets us whether the precept is of permanent obligation. And as far as the foregoing arguments go, it can hardly be said that they give a permanent ground. The appeal is to a standard of what is ‘becoming,’ and this may vary with the habits of society, and may therefore, if recognised and regulated, involve no ‘usurpation’ of authority. It was perhaps with a consciousness that something more was needed that St. Paul fell back upon the argument that follows.
