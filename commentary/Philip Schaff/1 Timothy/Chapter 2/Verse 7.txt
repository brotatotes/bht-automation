1 Timothy 2:7.  Am ordained a preacher. Better, ‘  was appointed a herald.’  It might have been thought that in writing to one like Timothy, loving and beloved, there would have been little need for this vindication of his authority, as if he were asserting his claims against the Judaizing teachers of Galatia or Corinth. What seems probable is that the necessity for so vindicating his position had formed a habit, and any mention of the Gospel led to his dwelling (as here and in 1 Timothy 1:11) on his own relation to it. Here the strong asseveration (‘I speak truth, I lie not,’ as in Romans 9:1) and the emphatic pronoun are perhaps intended to emphasize the marvel that such an one as he had been had been called to that high office.
	 Faith and verity. The Authorised Version suggests the idea that here again the writer was laying stress upon his personal truthfulness. Looking, however, to the objective sense of ‘truth’ in 1 Timothy 2:4, it would seem better to take the word in its higher sense here as defining the region in which he was a teacher, that region being the faith in man, answering to the truth revealed in Christ.
