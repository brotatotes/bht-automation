<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:9">1 Timothy 2:9</span>. <strong> In like manner also.</strong> The word shows the sequence of the writer’s thought. His mind is dwelling on the public worship of the Church. He has laid down rules for the men; he will now give rules for the women. General as those rules may seem, they have (as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:12">1 Timothy 2:12</span> is enough to prove) a special reference to the dress and demeanour of women as worshippers.

<p><strong> Not with broidered hair. . . .</strong> The words indicate, as those of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:3">1 Peter 3:3</span> (1) that many women of the wealthier class were found among the converts; (2) that a fashion was growing up of coming to the meetings of the disciples with all the outward tokens of wealth that belonged, as they thought, to their social <em> status </em> the ‘plaitings of the hair,’ which are so conspicuous in all the female busts of the time, the gold bands worn on the head, the ‘pearls’ which at that time were in more request than any gems (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:6">Matthew 7:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:46">Matthew 13:46</span>), the raiment of Byssine or Coan texture, filmy, gauzy, embroidered with gold, for which women of fashion were ready to pay fabulous prices.
