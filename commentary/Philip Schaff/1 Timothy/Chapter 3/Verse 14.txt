<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:14">1 Timothy 3:14</span>. <strong> Shortly.</strong> Literally, <em> ‘sooner’ </em> than was expected. It would seem as if St. Paul had left Ephesus for Macedonia, and wrote giving directions for a probably lengthened absence. Then something like a change of plan suggests itself. He could not tell whether it will be possible. We cannot tell whether it was carried into effect.
