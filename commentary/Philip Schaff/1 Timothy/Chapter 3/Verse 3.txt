<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:3">1 Timothy 3:3</span>. The words imply that in the haste of the early organization of the Church, mistakes had been made which invested even such characters as those described with the office of a bishop or elder.

<p><strong> Not given to wine.</strong> The Greek word is sometimes used, it is said, for the petulant, quarrelsome temper as of a man in his cups, without implying that it actually proceeds from intoxication. There is no reason, however, for not receiving it in its full or literal meaning.
	</p>
<p><strong> No striker.</strong> This condition seems from our modern point of view a strange one, but the history of not a few of the Councils of the Church <em> (e.g. </em> the ‘Robber’ Council of Ephesus, A.D. 449) shows that even in a more advanced stage of Christian culture, it was not altogether needles, and the passing allusion in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:20">2 Corinthians 11:20</span> (‘If a man smite you on the face’) indicates that some of St. Paul’s personal antagonists had had recourse to this form of argument, as well as to slander and self-assertion.
	</p>
<p><strong> Not greedy of filthy lucre.</strong> The Greek word thus rendered is not found in the better MSS., and seems to have been inserted from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</span>. Its precise meaning is rather that of one who seeks gain by base, disreputable means.
	</p>
<p><strong> Patient. </strong> Better ‘ <em> forbearing.</em> ’ The reasonable temper which does not insist even on actual rights, and still less on satisfaction for real or supposed injuries.
	</p>
<p><strong> Not a brawler.</strong> The English word, though somewhat obsolete, expresses the meaning of the Greek, ‘ <em> not quick in quarrel.</em> ’
	</p>
<p><strong> Not covetous.</strong> Somewhat too general, ‘ <em> Not a lover of money.’
