1 Timothy 3:3. The words imply that in the haste of the early organization of the Church, mistakes had been made which invested even such characters as those described with the office of a bishop or elder.
	 Not given to wine. The Greek word is sometimes used, it is said, for the petulant, quarrelsome temper as of a man in his cups, without implying that it actually proceeds from intoxication. There is no reason, however, for not receiving it in its full or literal meaning.
	 No striker. This condition seems from our modern point of view a strange one, but the history of not a few of the Councils of the Church  (e.g.  the ‘Robber’ Council of Ephesus, A.D. 449) shows that even in a more advanced stage of Christian culture, it was not altogether needles, and the passing allusion in 2 Corinthians 11:20 (‘If a man smite you on the face’) indicates that some of St. Paul’s personal antagonists had had recourse to this form of argument, as well as to slander and self-assertion.
	 Not greedy of filthy lucre. The Greek word thus rendered is not found in the better MSS., and seems to have been inserted from Titus 1:7. Its precise meaning is rather that of one who seeks gain by base, disreputable means.
	 Patient.  Better ‘  forbearing. ’ The reasonable temper which does not insist even on actual rights, and still less on satisfaction for real or supposed injuries.
	 Not a brawler. The English word, though somewhat obsolete, expresses the meaning of the Greek, ‘  not quick in quarrel. ’
	 Not covetous. Somewhat too general, ‘  Not a lover of money.’
