The ‘report’ μαρτυρία was <em> testimony </em> direct and formal, hose ‘without’ are, of course, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:12">1 Corinthians 5:12</span>, the non-Christian members of the community in which the candidate for the Episcopate resided.

<p><strong> Into reproach and the snare of the devil.</strong> Both words in the Greek are without the article, and both may accordingly be taken in connexion with ‘the devil.’ Practically it makes little difference in the sense. The ‘reproach,’ even if it were thought of as originating with the Tempter, must in the nature of the case have been uttered by human lips. Where the man who entered on a responsible office had no reputation established by direct testimony to fall back upon, he had but slender defence against calumnies and reproaches. If they came on him, he was liable to fall into the snare of passionate resentment, or reckless defiance, or yet more reckless despair. </p>
