1 Timothy 3:7. A good report from them that are without. As a matter of practice, the word points to more than general reputation. The ‘report’ μαρτυρία was  testimony  direct and formal, hose ‘without’ are, of course, as in 1 Corinthians 5:12, the non-Christian members of the community in which the candidate for the Episcopate resided. From them, as employers, friends, neighbours, he was to obtain letters testimonial as well as from the brethren.
	 Into reproach and the snare of the devil. Both words in the Greek are without the article, and both may accordingly be taken in connexion with ‘the devil.’ Practically it makes little difference in the sense. The ‘reproach,’ even if it were thought of as originating with the Tempter, must in the nature of the case have been uttered by human lips. Where the man who entered on a responsible office had no reputation established by direct testimony to fall back upon, he had but slender defence against calumnies and reproaches.
