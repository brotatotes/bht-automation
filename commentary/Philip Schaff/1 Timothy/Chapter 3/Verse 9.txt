1 Timothy 3:9.  The mystery of the faith. The truth hidden before, but now revealed to the initiated-Comp. ‘the mystery of godliness’ in 1 Timothy 3:16, and the use of the word in Ephesians 3:3-5. Guided by the analogy of that passage, and by 1 Timothy 5:8; Jude 1:3, it seems better to take faith here in its objective sense, but that and what is called its subjective meaning are so blended together in St. Paul’s thoughts that it is scarcely possible to draw a hard and fast line of demarcation between them.
