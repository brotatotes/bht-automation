<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:4">1 Timothy 4:4</span>. <strong> Good. The higher word</strong> (καλόν, <em> excellent, </em> not ἀ γαθόν) <em> </em> is used in the Greek, as in the LXX. of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:0">Genesis 1:0</span>, and with a manifest reference to that history. The repetition of the clause (‘with thanksgiving ‘) is striking, as showing how the apostle’s mind recognised that it was the spiritual state of the receiver, not the physical characteristics of the thing received, that determined the lawfulness of the reception.
