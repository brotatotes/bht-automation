1 Timothy 4:6.  If thou put the brethren in remembrance.  The Greek verb is hardly so definite, and is better expressed by ‘  suggesting’  or ‘  advising.’  The use of the word tends to limit ‘these things’ to the immediate context. A stronger word would naturally have been used had the writer been thinking of the great ‘mystery of godliness,’
	 Minister,  in its general rather than its technical sense, and yet, perhaps, not without a reference to the distinctive name. Whatever difference there might be between apostles, elders, deacons, all were alike ‘ministers’ of Christ.
	 Nourished up.  The word expresses rather the thought of being ‘reared’ or ‘educated in’ the words of faith, and suggests the half-medical reference to ‘bodily exercise’ that follows.
	 Of good doctrine where-unto . . . Better,’  of the good doctrine which thou hast followed oil along’   The Greek article and the relative pronoun in the singular give a special emphasis to the ‘doctrine.’ The verb is the same as that used by St. Luke in his Gospel (1 Timothy 1:3).
