<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:9">1 Timothy 4:9</span>. <strong> This is a faithful saying. </strong> At first it might seem as if the words referred to what had immediately preceded, and it is possible that they do so here; but the rule in all other cases is that they precede the truth to which they refer, and the verse that follows is sufficiently axiomatic in its substance to have the character of a ‘faithful saying.’
