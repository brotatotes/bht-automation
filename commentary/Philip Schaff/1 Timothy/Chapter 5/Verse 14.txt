<p><strong> The adversary.</strong> Standing by itself, the word might suggest the thought of a reference to the great spiritual adversary; but St. Paul’s use of the word elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:9">1 Corinthians 16:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+1:28">Philippians 1:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:4">2 Thessalonians 2:4</span>), turns the scale in favour of the more general meaning the Jewish or heathen enemy of the Gospel.

<p><strong> To speak reproachfully.</strong> Literally, <em> ‘for the sake of, with a view to reproach.’ </em> The general interpretation connects it with the ‘occasion,’ as one supplying materials for reproach.
