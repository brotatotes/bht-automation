<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:20">1 Timothy 5:20</span>. <strong> Them that sin rebuke before all. </strong> The precept, apparently general, is defined by the previous context. If the result of the trial of a presbyter shows that he is living in sin (the Greek implies continuance), the judge is not to hush up the matter in a private audience. Openly, in the presence not only of the other presbyters, but of the whole congregation, he is to be rebuked as one convicted of sin, so that his example may serve as a warning to them also as well as to those of his own order.
