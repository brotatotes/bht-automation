<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:25">1 Timothy 5:25</span>. <strong> They that are otherwise cannot be hid.</strong> The previous verse had been directed against hasty acceptance or acquittal. This is against hasty condemnation or rejection. In some cases a man’s good deeds are clear and patent, in others <em> meliora latent. </em> ‘Better than the seen lies hid,’ but that, too, cannot be hid for long. Enquiry will bring it to the light of day in spite even of the wish or humility of the doer. If we inquire carefully, and have the gift of insight, we shall find out before long what men are and what they have been doing.
