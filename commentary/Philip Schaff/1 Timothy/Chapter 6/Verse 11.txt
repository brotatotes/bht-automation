<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:11">1 Timothy 6:11</span>. <strong> O man of God.</strong> The choice of phrase may be referred to two links of associations. (1) There is that of its use in the Old Testament as applied to prophets, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1sa+9:6">1 Samuel 9:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1sa+9:8">1 Samuel 9:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ki+13:1">1 Kings 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ki+13:4">1 Kings 13:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ki+13:8">1 Kings 13:8</span>, and elsewhere, Timothy’s work as an evangelist having in St. Paul’s mind a character analogous to that of the older prophets. (2) With a latent reference to our Lord’s emphatic teaching that no man can serve two masters, or divide his allegiance between God and Mammon (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:13">Luke 16:13</span>), the teacher reminds his disciple that he for his part is called to own God and God only as his Master, and therefore to renounce the love of earthly riches which lured so many to their destruction.

<p><strong> Patience</strong>. Better here, as elsewhere, <em> endurance.

<p><strong> Meekness.</strong> The Greek word is not the simple form commonly used in the New Testament, but a compound answering to our ‘meek-spiritedness.’ It is found in Philo.
