1 Timothy 6:13.  I give thee charge. The apostle retains to the opening thought of the Epistle, that of the ‘charge or ‘injunction’ which he committed to his disciple, 1 Timothy 1:5; 1 Timothy 1:18; but now that he is drawing to a close, the injunction assumes a more solemn character and is given as in the presence of God and Christ.

	 Witnessed a good confession.  The word for ‘witness’ seems purposely chosen for the higher form of witness that was consummated by death. The Greek, as before, has the article before confession, as referring to something well known, and so the passage becomes important as evidence that the narrative of the Passion was sufficiently familiar to be thus appealed to.
