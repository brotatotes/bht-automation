1 Timothy 6:17.  Charge them that are rich in this world. It is quite after St. Paul’s manner to return in this way to the subject from which he had been led away by the train of thought that issued in a doxology. Before, he had spoken of those who set their hearts on becoming rich. Now, he deals with those whom he finds rich by inheritance or otherwise.
	 High-minded. The state of one who forms great and ambitious schemes in which be himself is the centre.
	 Nor trust in uncertain riches. Better, ‘  nor to fix their hope on the un-certainty of riches.’
	 In God who giveth us richly all things to enjoy. If we seek for riches, God gives richly; but that which He gives brings with it no cares and sorrows, like earthly wealth, but tends, whether it be outward or inward good, to direct and immediate enjoyment.
