<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:18">1 Timothy 6:18</span>. <strong> Do good, be rich in good works. </strong> The second ‘good’ is higher than the first, as <em> noble </em> deeds are above merely beneficent ones.
	</p>
<p><strong> Ready to distribute, willing to communicate. </strong> The two words are nearly synonymous. If there is any difference, it is that the former implies general benevolence, the latter a feeling more individual in its object. One distributes what it has to the poor, the other shares its possessions with a friend.
