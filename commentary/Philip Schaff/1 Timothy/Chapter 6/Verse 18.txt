1 Timothy 6:18.  Do good, be rich in good works.  The second ‘good’ is higher than the first, as  noble  deeds are above merely beneficent ones.
	 Ready to distribute, willing to communicate.  The two words are nearly synonymous. If there is any difference, it is that the former implies general benevolence, the latter a feeling more individual in its object. One distributes what it has to the poor, the other shares its possessions with a friend.
