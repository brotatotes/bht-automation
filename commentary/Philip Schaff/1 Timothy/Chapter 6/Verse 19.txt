1 Timothy 6:19.  Laying up in store. Better,  ‘as a treasure.’  We need not be startled at the apparent contradiction between this reference to good works as a foundation, and the language in which St. Paul elsewhere asserts that the one foundation is Christ (1 Corinthians 3:11). Men do not commonly check their figurative speech by the rules of a rigid consistency. On the assumption of some acquaintance on St. Paul’s part with our Lord’s teaching, the language of Luke 6:48 would suggest the aspect of the figure now brought before us. There we find first the rock, then the foundation, then the house; or, interpreting the parable, first faith in Christ, then good works, then the general order of the life.
