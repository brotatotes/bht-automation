<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:19">1 Timothy 6:19</span>. <strong> Laying up in store.</strong> Better, <em> ‘as a treasure.’ </em> We need not be startled at the apparent contradiction between this reference to good works as a foundation, and the language in which St. Paul elsewhere asserts that the one foundation is Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:11">1 Corinthians 3:11</span>). Men do not commonly check their figurative speech by the rules of a rigid consistency. On the assumption of some acquaintance on St. Paul’s part with our Lord’s teaching, the language of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:48">Luke 6:48</span> would suggest the aspect of the figure now brought before us. There we find first the rock, then the foundation, then the house; or, interpreting the parable, first faith in Christ, then good works, then the general order of the life.
