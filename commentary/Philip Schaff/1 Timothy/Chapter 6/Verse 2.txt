1 Timothy 6:2.  Because they are brethren.  The risk contemplated was, lest the new sense of fraternity should pass into a revolutionary claim to equality. Slaves were not to despise their masters because they (the masters) were brothers in Christ. That was a ground for a new loyalty and a more thorough obedience.
	 Because they are faithful and beloved, partaken of the benefit. It is difficult to say what was in the minds of the translators of the Authorised Version. As it stands, it suggests the idea that ‘the benefit’ is some preeminent good, like the gift of eternal life. The rendering is, however, altogether wrong, and we must read, ‘  because they who receive the benefit (i.e.  as on a footing of reciprocity)  are faithful and beloved.’  We note in this the delicate and generous tact with which St. Paul, following or coinciding with Seneca, [1] implies that in the increased activity of their service slaves may assume a new position as benefactors, and as it were confer a favour on their masters.
	 [1] Seneca discusses the question whether ‘a slave could rightly be said to confer a favour or benefit on his mister,’ and answers it in the affirmative.
