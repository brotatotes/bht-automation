<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:3">1 Timothy 6:3</span>. <strong> If any man teach otherwise. </strong> The same expressive compound verb as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>.

<p><strong> Consent.</strong> Literally, <em> ‘come over to, accede to,’ </em> as a proselyte accedes to a new faith.

<p><strong> The wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ. </strong> There is no reason why the words should not be taken in their literal or most natural meaning as ‘the words spoken by the Lord Jesus.’ St. Paul, we know, quoted such words in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:35">Acts 20:35</span>, and even in this Epistle we have an instance of his acquaintance with a written record of them (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:18">1 Timothy 5:18</span>). Such words seem to him to present the ideal of that healthiness of thought from which the revolutionary impulses that disorganize society were morbid departures.
