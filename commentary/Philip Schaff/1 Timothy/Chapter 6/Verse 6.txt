<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:6">1 Timothy 6:6</span>. <strong> Godliness with contentment.</strong> In contrast with the false view of religion as a source of wealth, St. Paul brings out its true character. In the highest sense, ‘religion’ with contentment is the best business, the best investment. The Greek word for ‘contentment’ is that by which ethical writers expressed the state of one who, being truly wise, was sufficient to himself, whatever might be the outward circumstances in which he found himself. It was a favourite word of the Stoic schools, and the cognate adjective had been already used by St. Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+4:11">Philippians 4:11</span>.
