<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:7">1 Timothy 6:7</span>. <strong> It is certain that we can carry nothing out.</strong> The word ‘certain’ is not in the best MSS., and seems to have been inserted to make the sense of the passage clearer. Without it we must read, ‘ <em> because neither can we carry anything out.’ </em> God has made us enter the world with nothing, to teach that we must leave it as we came.
