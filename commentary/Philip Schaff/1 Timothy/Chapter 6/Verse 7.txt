1 Timothy 6:7.  It is certain that we can carry nothing out. The word ‘certain’ is not in the best MSS., and seems to have been inserted to make the sense of the passage clearer. Without it we must read, ‘  because neither can we carry anything out.’  God has made us enter the world with nothing, to teach that we must leave it as we came.
