<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:8">1 Timothy 6:8</span>. <strong> Raiment. </strong> The Greek word, which is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, has the general sense of <em> covering, </em> and may therefore include ‘ <em> shelter’ </em> as well.
	</p>
<p><strong> Let us be therewith content.</strong> The better Greek text gives an authoritative future rather than an imperative. ‘ <em> We shall be content therewith.</em> ’
