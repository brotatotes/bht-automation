1 Timothy 6:8.  Raiment.  The Greek word, which is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, has the general sense of  covering,  and may therefore include ‘  shelter’  as well.
	 Let us be therewith content. The better Greek text gives an authoritative future rather than an imperative. ‘  We shall be content therewith. ’
