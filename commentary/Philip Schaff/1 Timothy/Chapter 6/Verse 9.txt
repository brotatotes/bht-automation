1 Timothy 6:9.  They that will be rich. The Greek ‘will’ is more than the simple future:  They that wish to be rich.  It is not the mere possession of riches, but the cupidity before gaining them, and the trust in them (Mark 10:24) when gained, that constitute their danger.
	 Foolish. Better ‘  senseless; ’ desires that have no root in the nature of things or in our actual wants, the love of display, the vulgar vanity of seeming as rich as others, or richer.
	 Drown. Literally ‘  sink, ’ used of ships as well as men.
	 Destruction and perdition. The Greek words are of kindred derivation, but are brought together to express the utterness of the ruin; perhaps also in the second word, to give prominence to the thought that it stretches beyond the present life.
