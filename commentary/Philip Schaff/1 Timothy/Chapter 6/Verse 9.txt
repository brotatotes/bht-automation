<p><strong> Foolish.</strong> Better ‘ <em> senseless;</em> ’ desires that have no root in the nature of things or in our actual wants, the love of display, the vulgar vanity of seeming as rich as others, or richer.
	</p>
<p><strong> Drown.</strong> Literally ‘ <em> sink,</em> ’ used of ships as well as men.
	</p>
<p><strong> Destruction and perdition.</strong> The Greek words are of kindred derivation, but are brought together to express the utterness of the ruin; perhaps also in the second word, to give prominence to the thought that it stretches beyond the present life.
