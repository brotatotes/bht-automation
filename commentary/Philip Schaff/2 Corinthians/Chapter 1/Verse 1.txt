2 Corinthians 1:1.  Paul. . . and Timothy our  (  Gr. ‘the’)  brother. See on 1 Corinthians 1:1. Timothy had been sent to Corinth along with the First Epistle (1 Corinthians 4:17), and along with him Erastus (Acts 19:22), and probably Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus (1 Corinthians 16:17). Timothy had now returned to him and is here associated with the apostle himself in the salutation of a church which he knew so well. And as our apostle employed an amanuensis in the writing of his letters to the churches (with the exception probably of that to the Galatians, Galatians 6:11), Timothy was in all likelihood the penman of this Epistle, unto the church ...  at Corinth, with all the saints ...  in the whole of Achaia  the name of the whole Roman province of Greece, northward to Macedonia. There appear to have been converts scattered up and down this whole province of which Corinth was the capital, in addition to the little “church at Cenchreæ,” the eastern port of Corinth (Romans 16:1). These would be affiliated with the mother church at the capital, meeting by themselves in little knots where numerous and near enough to each other, but looking to Corinth as their centre and the headauarters of Christianity in the province. All these the apostle embraces in his salutation to the church of Corinth.
