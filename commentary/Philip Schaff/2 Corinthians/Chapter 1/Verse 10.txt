2 Corinthians 1:10.  who  delivered us out of so great a death.  The word points to ‘such a  kind  of death,’ rather than to its greatness,  and will deliver: in whom our hope is that he will also still deliver us so that though already delivered from that oppressive, crushing sense of impending death just described, he was so far from thinking all danger past that it seemed still to dog his steps; but his former fears were gone, the past deliverance assuring him that he had work yet to do for that Master whom he loved to serve.
