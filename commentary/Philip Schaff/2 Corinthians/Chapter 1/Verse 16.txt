That plan, however, had been modified ere he wrote his First Epistle, as is plain from chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:5-7">1 Corinthians 16:5-7</span>, where all he proposes is to pay them one visit, on his way from Macedonia; for “his times were in God’s hands,” and he was not omniscient to foresee the hindrances that might occur.
