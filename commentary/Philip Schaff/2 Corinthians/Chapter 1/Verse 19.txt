2 Corinthians 1:19.  For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timothy.  It has been observed (by Paley), as an undesigned coincidence between the history in the Acts and this Epistle, that both there (Acts 18:5) and here we find both Silas (or Silvanus) and Timothy at Corinth with the apostle, all ministering there together, and it has been noted that in both Epistles to the Thessalonians (1 Thessalonians 1:1; 2 Thessalonians 1:1), these three are found associated at that time in the work of the Gospel,  was not yea and nay, but in him is  yea.  The argument is this: ‘When we were with you, was it vacillating, fickle preachers that preached to you the unchanging One, the Son of God, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today,   and for ever? Did we hold Him forth to you as stability itself, while we ourselves were the reverse? Were ye assured that He was the faithful and true Witness by men in whose own word no trust could be placed?’   It is an appeal to the incongruity of the thing, and to their whole bearing at Corinth as men, like their message, honest and true; and conscious of this himself, there is a certain hurt feeling in the appeal, as what ought not to have been extorted from him.
