2 Corinthians 1:22.  who also sealed us, and gave   us   the earnest of the s pirit (meaning the Spirit as the earnest of future glory)  in our hearts.  There is a noble climax here: ‘Our whole stability in the faith is of God; of God also it is that we “have an  anointing  from the Holy One” (1 John 2:20; 1 John 2:27); it is He too who “  sealed  us unto the day of redemption”(Ephesians 4:30); and put  the earnest of  that redemption into our hearts, in the indwelling of the Holy Ghost: so all is of God.’ Prolonging his argument against the charge of fickleness, it is as if he had said: ‘We and ye yourselves, if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious, are so bound up with God in Christ and with the Spirit, who is the living bond of this union, that the thought of any wilful instability of purpose in our dealings one with the other is abhorrent to me, and ought to be so felt by you.’ Still, they might wish to know the  cause  of the change, such as it was; and they shall now have it.
