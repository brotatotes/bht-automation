<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:24">2 Corinthians 1:24</span>. <strong> Not that we have lordship over your faith</strong> ‘not domineering over you in things spiritual.’ This explanation <strong> seems </strong> intended to qualify the words “to spare you,” lest it should be thought that the spirit in which he even yet wished to come to them was one of imperiousness; far from it, <strong> but </strong> (on the contrary) <strong> are helpers of your joy; for by faith ye stand. </strong> ‘Well may we disclaim any such undue interference <em> ; </em> for ye stand, not on us, but each <strong> </strong> to his own Master on the footing of his own faith; nor can any one, not even an apostle of Jesus Christ, come in between him and God, the Judge of all.’
