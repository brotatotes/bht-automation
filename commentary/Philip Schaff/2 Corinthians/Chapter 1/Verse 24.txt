2 Corinthians 1:24.  Not that we have lordship over your faith ‘not domineering over you in things spiritual.’ This explanation  seems  intended to qualify the words “to spare you,” lest it should be thought that the spirit in which he even yet wished to come to them was one of imperiousness; far from it,  but  (on the contrary)  are helpers of your joy; for by faith ye stand.  ‘Well may we disclaim any such undue interference  ;  for ye stand, not on us, but each   to his own Master on the footing of his own faith; nor can any one, not even an apostle of Jesus Christ, come in between him and God, the Judge of all.’
