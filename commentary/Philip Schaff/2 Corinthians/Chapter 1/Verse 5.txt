<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:5">2 Corinthians 1:5</span>. <strong> For as the sufferings of Christ abound unto us.</strong> In what sense? Those touching words of the glorified One to Saul, on his way to Damascus, seem to furnish the answer: “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou <em> Me</em> I am Jesus, <em> Whom </em> thou persecutest” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:4-5">Acts 9:4-5</span>): as if to say, ‘Whatsoever is done to my cause, and to my people for my sake, is done to Me.’ He Himself, as His Father’s witness on earth, could say, “The reproaches of them that reproached Thee fell on Me” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:3">Romans 14:3</span>, from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:7-9">Psalms 69:7-9</span>). In this sense Christians “fill up that which is lacking in the sufferings of Christ” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>), and have “the fellowship of His sufferings, becoming conformable unto His death” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+3:10">Philippians 3:10</span>), <strong> even to our comfort also aboundeth through Christ</strong> according to His own promise, “In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:31">John 16:31</span>): “Be of good cheer, Paul; for as thou hast borne witness of me at Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:11">Acts 23:11</span>).
