2 Corinthians 1:6.  But whether we be afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or whether we be comforted, it is for your comfort, which worketh in you the patient endurance of the same sufferings. What that suffering of his own was, to which he here refers and his consolation under which he hopes they shared in is now explained.
