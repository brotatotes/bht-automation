2 Corinthians 10:10.  For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.  That the weakness here ascribed to his “bodily presence” refers to his physical weakness, which Plumptre thinks obvious, is far from clear to critics quite as acute and   impartial, who think that the context shews the contrast between his tone and manner when present with the Corinthians, and that when merely writing to them; and we cannot but agree with them. Indeed, but for such statements as that in chap. 2 Corinthians 12:7 (on which see the comment), and Galatians 4:13-14, it is very doubtful if bodily infirmity would have been thought of here.
