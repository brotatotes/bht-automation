Indeed, but for such statements as that in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span> (on which see the comment), and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:13-14">Galatians 4:13-14</span>, it is very doubtful if bodily infirmity would have been thought of here.
