2 Corinthians 10:12.  For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves: but  t  hey themselves measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not wise.  The sense of this somewhat obscure verse which contains a kind of play upon two words which cannot be expressed in English seems to be this: ‘Were we as bold as to class ourselves with those self-satisfied, supercilious teachers, who set themselves up as the one standard by which the pretension and character of all Christian teachers are to be tried, then our empty words and weak deeds might be justly held up in contrast; but such shew a want of all understanding.’
