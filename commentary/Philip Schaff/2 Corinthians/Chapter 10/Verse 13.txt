2 Corinthians 10:13.  But  (unlike all these)  we will not glory beyond   our    measure, but  (only)  according to the measure of the rule which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even to you: ‘We go simply by   the line of action divinely assigned to us, and not beyond it.’ As the apostleship of the circumcision was specially committed to Peter, while Paul was sent to the Gentiles (Galatians 2:7-9), so Corinth being probably up to this time the utmost limit westward which his commission had “reached” (see Paley’s  Horae Paulinae,  chap. 4, No. 12), he says he was only fulfilling it in his ministry there. The next verse expresses this more nakedly.
