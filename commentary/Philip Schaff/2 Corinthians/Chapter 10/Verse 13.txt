<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:13">2 Corinthians 10:13</span>. <strong> But </strong> (unlike all these) <strong> we will not glory beyond </strong> <strong><em> our</em></strong> <em> </em> <strong> measure, but </strong> (only) <strong> according to the measure of the rule which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even to you</strong>: ‘We go simply by <strong> </strong> the line of action divinely assigned to us, and not beyond it.’ As the apostleship of the circumcision was specially committed to Peter, while Paul was sent to the Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:7-9">Galatians 2:7-9</span>), so Corinth being probably up to this time the utmost limit westward which his commission had “reached” (see Paley’s <em> Horae Paulinae, </em> chap. 4, No. 12), he says he was only fulfilling it in his ministry there. The next verse expresses this more nakedly.
