2 Corinthians 10:15.  not glorying ... in other men’s labours, but having hope that, as your faith groweth, we shall be magnified in you . . . unto further abundance ‘be encouraged by our success with you to extend our labours,’  so as to preach the gospel even unto the parts beyond you, and not to glory in another’s line of things made ready to our hand.  The principle here laid down was a fixed one with our apostle. See his remarkable statement of it in Romans 15:18-23
