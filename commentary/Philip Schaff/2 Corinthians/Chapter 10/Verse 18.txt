<p>No wonder that this chapter begins with an apology for indulging in self-commendation, since the former one ended with a condemnation of those who dealt with it. Feeling it to be in the last degree distasteful, the apostle proceeds to state why it had been forced upon him, and in doing so he is led into such details of his personal history as are of extreme interest, and nowhere else even alluded to such as to make us glad of the unwelcome necessity of self-praise.
