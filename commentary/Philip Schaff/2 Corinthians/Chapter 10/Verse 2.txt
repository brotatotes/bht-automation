2 Corinthians 10:2.  yes, I beseech you, that I may not when present shew courage with the confidence wherewith I reckon to be bold against some, which reckon of us as if we walked according to the flesh.  The sense, here touchingly and delicately expressed, is this: ‘By that meekness and gentleness of Christ which I strove to exercise among you, I intreat you not to force me to change my tone, so as to show on my return that stern attitude which fidelity to the truth demands against some who look upon us as weaklings, afraid to face them.’
