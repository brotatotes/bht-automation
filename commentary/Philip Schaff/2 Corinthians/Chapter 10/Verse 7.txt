<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:7">2 Corinthians 10:7</span>. <strong> Do ye look at things after the outward appearance?</strong> (The <em> interrogative </em> form of this clause is, we think, with Meyer, Alford, etc., more natural and lively than the <em> indicative, </em> as Calvin, Stanley, Plumptre, and others take it.)
	</p>
<p><strong> If any man trusteth in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again with himself,</strong> take this other thought along with him,
	</p>
<p><strong> that as he is Christ’s, go also are we.</strong> [1] <strong> </strong> ‘Let those who set themselves up among you as the special servants of Christ, and supporters of His cause, say what claims they have to this character that are wanting in me; rather, let them evidence their claims by recognising mine.’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] The repetition of the word “Christ’s” in the received text is <strong> </strong> clearly wrong.
