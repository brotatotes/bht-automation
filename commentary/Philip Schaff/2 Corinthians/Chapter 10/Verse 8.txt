2 Corinthians 10:8.  For though I should glory somewhat more abundantly of our authority, which the Lord  (the Lord Christ, Ephesians 3:7-11)  gave for building you up, and not for casting you down, I shall not be put to shame.  Two reasons are given for this: it was an authority gifted by the Lord of the Church, and it was given for rearing   up the Church.
