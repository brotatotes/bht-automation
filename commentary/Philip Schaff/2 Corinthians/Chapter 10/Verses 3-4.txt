<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:3-4">2 Corinthians 10:3-4</span> <strong> . For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh (for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God </strong> (in God’s estimation) <strong> to the casting down of strongholds):</strong> [1] ‘Because our weapons are not carnal, they are despised by carnal men; but just on that account are they mighty to overthrow what carnal weapons cannot reach;’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] The phrase is essentially a military one, and is used in the LXX. for the capture and destruction of fortresses (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="la+2:2">Lamentations 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="pr+21:22">Proverbs 21:22</span>; 1Ma 5:65 ; 1Ma 8:10 ). The apostle speaks as if leading an attack upon the strong defences of the workers of evil, perhaps having his eye on the great systems of idolatry and impurity enthroned at Corinth and throughout the Empire; possibly, too, of the pride and obstinate rebellion of his individual opponents (Plumptre).
