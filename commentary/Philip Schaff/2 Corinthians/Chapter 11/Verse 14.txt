2 Corinthians 11:14.  And no marvel; for  Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light. His own element is darkness (2 Peter 2:4; Jude 1:6), and all his power over men lies in his power to keep them in the dark (a Cor. 2 Corinthians 4:4; Ephesians 6:12; Colossians 1:13). But knowing that men love the light, and hate darkness, he veils his lies in the dress of truth, and hides his poison in the bait of wholesome truth.
