<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span>. <strong> For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy: for I betrothed you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ. </strong> The apostle here speaks, like the Baptist, as “the friend of the Bridegroom,” who having betrothed them to Christ at their conversion, hoped to be able to “present them” to Him, uncorrupted by the alienation of their affections, and to witness the consummation of the nuptials at His Second Appearing.
