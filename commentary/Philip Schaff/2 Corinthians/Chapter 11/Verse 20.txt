2 Corinthians 11:20.  For ye bear with a man if,  etc. The five things here said to be borne with are clearly just the things which the Corinthians had suffered those deceitful workers to do against himself,  if he bringeth you into bondage tyrannizing over them,  if    he devoureth you alluding to their mercenary ministrations,  if he taketh you   captive making slaves of you to do their bidding,  if he exalteth himself in his pride,
	 if he smiteth you on the face a figurative way of saying ‘treats you insolently.’ All this rude and injurious treatment of one to whom they owed their conversion to Christ they were quietly putting up with.
