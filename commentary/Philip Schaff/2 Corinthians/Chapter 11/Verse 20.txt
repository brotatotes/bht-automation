<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:20">2 Corinthians 11:20</span>. <strong> For ye bear with a man if, </strong> etc. The five things here said to be borne with are clearly just the things which the Corinthians had suffered those deceitful workers to do against himself, <strong> if he bringeth you into bondage</strong> tyrannizing over them, <strong> if</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> <strong> he devoureth you</strong> alluding to their mercenary ministrations, <strong> if he taketh you </strong> <em> captive</em> making slaves of you to do their bidding, <strong> if he exalteth himself</strong> in his pride,
	</p>
<p><strong> if he smiteth you on the face</strong> a figurative way of saying ‘treats you insolently.’ All this rude and injurious treatment of one to whom they owed their conversion to Christ they were quietly putting up with.
