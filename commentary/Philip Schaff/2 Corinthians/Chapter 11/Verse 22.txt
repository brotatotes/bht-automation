2 Corinthians 11:22.  Are they Hebrews? of pure Hebrew descent (compare Acts 6:1; Philippians 3:5),  so am I. Are they Israelites? children of the covenant,  so am I.  Are they the seed of Abraham and heirs of the great Abrahamic promise? (Genesis 12:3; Genesis 17:7-8; Genesis 22:17-18; Galatians 3:8),  so am I.
