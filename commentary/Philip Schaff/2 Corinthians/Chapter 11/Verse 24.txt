2 Corinthians 11:24.  Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.  Not one of these cases is recorded in the Acts. The rule, not to exceed forty, was very strict, and for a merciful reason, ‘lest their brother should seem vile unto them’ (Deuteronomy 25:3). And to prevent the letter of the law   from being exceeded, Josephus says (  Antt.  iv. 8, 21) it was the practice latterly to inflict one stripe less; hence the phrase ‘to get forty, less one.’ (Wetstein quotes a number of authorities for this.) The mode of infliction with thongs, partly on the naked breast, and partly on the two naked shoulders was very severe, and not infrequently was followed by death.
