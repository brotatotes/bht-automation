2 Corinthians 11:26.  in journeyings often, in perils of rivers having perhaps to swim across swollen rivers at the risk of life,  in perils of robbers for some of the mountainous regions which he traversed are known to have been infested with robbers, and indeed are so still,  in perils from mine own countrymen   (Gr.  ‘race’),  in perils from  the Gentiles sometimes goaded on by fanatical Jews, as at Philippi (Acts 16:0) and Thessalonica (Acts 17:0); but sometimes by interested idolaters, as at Ephesus (Acts 19:0), as at Damascus, Jerusalem, Pisidia, Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Corinth itself,  in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness . . . the sea . . . amongst false brethren Judaizers, such as described in Galatians 2:4.
