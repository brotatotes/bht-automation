2 Corinthians 11:29.  Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is made to stumble, and I burn not?  Who is there who, ‘weak in the faith,’ is troubled with scruples of conscience, does not draw out my sympathy and find me ‘burning’ with indignation against abusers of their Christian liberty, and thereby endangering the souls of those for whom Christ died? (see 1 Corinthians 8:7-13).
