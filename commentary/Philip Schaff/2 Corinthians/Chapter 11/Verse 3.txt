2 Corinthians 11:3.  But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity  (the single-mindedness)  that is toward Christ.  The Revised Version adds “and purity,” on good, but not preponderating evidence, and (with Meyer) we think this addition has every appearance of having crept in as a gloss, explanatory of “simplicity.” (Tischendorf rejects it.) There is here taken for granted, as a historical fact, both the narrative of the fall and the agency of Satan, in serpent form, in that transaction; while his continued agency in the seduction of men from the paths of truth and safety, through the instrumentality of his ministers, is certainly implied, especially in the light of 2 Corinthians 11:13-15.
