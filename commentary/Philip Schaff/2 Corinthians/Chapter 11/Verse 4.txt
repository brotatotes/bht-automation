<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:4">2 Corinthians 11:4</span>. <strong> For</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> <strong> if he that cometh </strong> (any one so coming) <strong> preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or </strong> <strong><em> if </em></strong> <strong> ye receive a different spirit which ye did not receive, or a different gospel which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear with him. </strong> The import of this verse is not quite clear, and opinions about it are divided. But it seems clear enough that the reference is to intruding zealots, the same Judaizing party which threatened to carry away the Galatian Christians (see the terrible severity with which they are described in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6-9">Galatians 1:6-9</span>). In this case the import is, ‘I may well be jealous over you; for ye seem ready to drink in the teaching of men who come to you preaching another Jesus, and a different gospel, and claiming a “spirit” very different from that which we brought to you and ye received: right gladly do ye listen to such; may ye not well, then, listen to me?’ What follows seems to shew that this is what is intended, though the suppressed irony is very keen.
