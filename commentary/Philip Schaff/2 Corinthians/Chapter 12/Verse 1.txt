 Visions and    Revelations,  1  - 10.
	2 Corinthians 12:1.  I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; [1]    but I will come to visions and revelations:  ‘Distasteful it is to continue in a strain so unsuitable; but since I am forced to it, I proceed to relate what I experienced many years ago at the hand of the Lord Jesus’ for that He is “the Lord” here referred to will be evident as we proceed.
	 [1] There is some difficulty in the reading here, and critics are divided: but the above is best attested and makes the only quite clear sense.
