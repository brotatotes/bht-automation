2 Corinthians 12:10.  Wherefore I take pleasure  (‘I am well contented’)  in  weaknesses, in injuries ... for Christ’s sake.  The sense is, not ‘injuries endured for Christ’s sake,’ but ‘I take pleasure in them for Christ’s sake;’
	 for when I am weak, then am I strong.  Of course, this was true only when he recognised the hand of Christ in causing the weakness to remain which He could easily remove, in order that by His own strength resting upon him he might achieve a success which the removal of his weakness would not accomplish.
