2 Corinthians 12:14.  Behold, this is the third time I am ready to  come to you not ‘I   am a   third time ready to do this’ (as a number of critics understand it), but ‘I am ready to come the third time.’ The former sense is forced on those who think the apostle paid but two visits to Corinth; but besides that this puts an unnatural sense upon the words, the apostle’s argument would thus have little point. Paley contends for this sense, building mainly on the silence of the Acts as to a third visit  (Hor. Paul. iv. 11); but it is impossible to understand chap. 2 Corinthians 13:1 in any natural sense, if a real third visit was not meant, [1]  and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours,  but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. ‘As your spiritual parent allow me a   parent’s privilege, not to be provided for by you, but to make provision for you, my children.’ The delicacy and tenderness of this touch are surpassing.
