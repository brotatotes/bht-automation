2 Corinthians 12:19.  Ye think all  this time [1]  that we are excusing ourselves unto you.  In this ye much mistake me.
	 [1] πάλαι, not πάλιν,   as in the received text.
	 In  the sight of God speak we in Christ: ‘We look higher; having respect before the great Searcher of hearts, in every word we write, only to the Master whom we represent’ (the same words occur in chap. 2 Corinthians 2:17).
	 But all things, beloved,   are    for your edifying.  ‘Your good throughout has   been our object;’ and there was need.
