2 Corinthians 12:20.  For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not lest my visit should be pleasant to neither party, lest    there should be [1]    strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, tumults.  That such a state of things should be apprehended reveals a condition in the Church of Corinth which might well justify the severest language which he employs in dealing with it. The list of things here specified seems to shew that the old cancer which festered in the Greek republics had found its way into the Christian community of this Greek city.
	 [1] μήπως  , by any means,  seems here unemphatic, as often, and so need not be represented in English.
