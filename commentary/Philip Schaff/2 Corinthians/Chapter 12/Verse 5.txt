<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:5">2 Corinthians 12:5</span>. <strong> On behalf of such a one will I glory; but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in my weaknesses. </strong> So entirely does he wish himself to be regarded as <em> passive </em> in this whole exalted scene, and his Master’s hand as exclusively in it, that he separates his personal self from the abstract “man in Christ” who had this experience, as if they had been two different persons. In this view, he feels that he <em> can </em> and will glory “on behalf of such a one;” but if he is to glory on his own account, it shall be of “his infirmities,” of which he is to speak more fully in the succeeding verses.
