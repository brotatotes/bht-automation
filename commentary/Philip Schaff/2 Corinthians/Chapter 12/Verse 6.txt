2 Corinthians 12:6.  For if I should desire to glory, I should not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me   to be,   or heareth from me: ‘I might, indeed, glory, and in doing so, I should not have to go beyond what is strictly true; but I will not, for I would have none to think of me otherwise than I was found and known to be when at Corinth, b  y  personal observation both of my walk and of my speech.’ The apostle has a positive dread of being thought of above what every one who came in contact with him might see and know him to be. ‘O how little of this fear is there (exclaims Bengel) in most people, even divines!’
