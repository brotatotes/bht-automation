And it is so couched as to meet every similar case. Cast in a gnomic form, it expresses a great general principle. The “my” of the received text, is an addition to the original text, which runs thus: “Strength is made perfect in weakness.” O how many myriads of burdened souls have had cause to exclaim, Blessed “thorn in the flesh” be it what it might which drew forth such a promise and such an assurance for all time!

<p><strong> Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the strength of Christ may rest upon me: </strong> ‘If this weakness of mine is only to add to my strength, bringing the strength of Christ as a <strong> </strong> glory down upon me (for such is the import of the choice word here employed [1] ), then, instead of wishing it away, I will glory in it, and not in this only, but in all the “weaknesses” that may be meted out to me.’
