2 Corinthians 12:17.  Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you?
	2 Corinthians 12:18.  I exhorted  (or charged)  Titus, and I sent the brother with him  (probably one of the two referred to in chap. 2 Corinthians 8:18; 2 Corinthians 8:22).  Did Titus take any advantage of you?  ‘I appeal to facts: Did Titus and the companion I sent with him seek or get any compensation at your hands?’
	 walked we not by the same Spirit? that Spirit by whose guidance all   the servants of Christ act? w  alked we  not in the same steps? I and those sent to you by me.
