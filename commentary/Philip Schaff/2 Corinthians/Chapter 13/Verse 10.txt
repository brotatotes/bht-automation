2 Corinthians 13:10.  For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not when present deal sharply, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for casting down.  He will not close without reaffirming his divinely-bestowed apostolic authority; but is careful to point out its beneficent end: ‘It was given me to build up, not to pull down; the less of it, therefore, that is needed, the better pleased shall I be; in fact, my whole object in writing in absence so severely as I have done, has been to make such severity unnecessary when I come amongst you.’
