2 Corinthians 13:11.  Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect  (‘perfected’). The word ‘adjusted’ (as a net put in order for casting), ‘thoroughly furnished,’  be  of good comfort  (‘comforted’);  be of one mind, the want of which was the first thing he complained of in his First Epistle (2 Corinthians 1:10);  live in peace;  and the God of love and peace shall be with  you, compare Matthew 5:9, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.”
