2 Corinthians 13:12.  Salute one another with a holy kiss.  Such a form of salutation is the common Eastern practice, but the word holy is designed to mark its Christian meaning, as the expression of that holy unity which their common oneness with Christ imparted. It long continued in the Eastern Church, and up to a pretty late period even in the Western, but gradually and properly died away as manners changed, and the significance of it ceased. 2 Corinthians 13:13.  All the saints salute you.
