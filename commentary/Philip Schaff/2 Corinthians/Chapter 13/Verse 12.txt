It long continued in the Eastern Church, and up to a pretty late period even in the Western, but gradually and properly died away as manners changed, and the significance of it ceased. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:13">2 Corinthians 13:13</span>. <strong> All the saints salute you.
