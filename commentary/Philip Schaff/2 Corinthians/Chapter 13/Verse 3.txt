2 Corinthians 13:3.  Seeing that ye seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me ‘since there are   those among you who question my apostolic authority, and demand proof of it, they shall have it,’
	 who to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you ‘Ye are yourselves witnesses of what the Christ that is in me can effect. Was He “weak” in the marvellous transformation of so many of you? Was He not “mighty in you” then?’
