2 Corinthians 13:4.  for [1]  he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth  through the power of God.  There was a great principle involved in the death of Christ, over and above its more immediate object. All that preceded and led to His death was a manifestation of voluntary weakness, culminating in His final ‘exinanition.’ He “emptied Himself becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross” (Philippians 2:7-8). That “emptied” condition was a necessary step to His state of fulness the “weakness” to the “power” by and in which He rose. And this twofold condition, says the apostle here, is reproduced and realized in us,  for we are also weak in him, but we shall live with him through the power of God toward you ‘and ye shall know this when I come.’
	 [1] The word “though” is not genuine here, and diminishes the force of the statement that follows.
