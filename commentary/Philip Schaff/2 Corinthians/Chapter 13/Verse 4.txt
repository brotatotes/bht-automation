All that preceded and led to His death was a manifestation of voluntary weakness, culminating in His final ‘exinanition.’ He “emptied Himself becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7-8">Philippians 2:7-8</span>). That “emptied” condition was a necessary step to His state of fulness the “weakness” to the “power” by and in which He rose. And this twofold condition, says the apostle here, is reproduced and realized in us, <strong> for we are also weak in him, but we shall live with him through the power of God toward you</strong> ‘and ye shall know this when I come.’
