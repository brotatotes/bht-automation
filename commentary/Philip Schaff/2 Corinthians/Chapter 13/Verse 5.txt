2 Corinthians 13:5.  Try your own selves: ‘Ye talk of trying me, but ye do well to try your own selves,’  whether ye be in the faith or are Christians in name only;  prove your own selves. What? [1]  know ye not your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you? dwelling in you to very different results than I hear to be snowing themselves,  unless, indeed, ye be reprobate. The  word  means ‘disapproved’ on trial, ‘rejected,’ and so, Christians only in name, of whom Christ will say, “I never knew you,”
	 [1] ῆ as in 1 Corinthians 14:36.
