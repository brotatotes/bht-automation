2 Corinthians 13:7.  Now we pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do that which is honourable, though we be as reprobate: ‘My prayer is, that when I come I may find no occasion for the exercise of discipline at all,   but may find you walking consistently and honourably as befits those who are called by the name of Christ; and this not to justify our Procedure towards you, but for the credit of that holy Name, whatever may be thought of us’ (comp. Romans 9:3).
