2 Corinthians 13:8.  For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth: ‘For our one object is to promote and establish the truth; and that end attained, if with the exercise of discipline, all the better; for not to display our apostolic authority do we live, but to see the truth triumphant everywhere.’
