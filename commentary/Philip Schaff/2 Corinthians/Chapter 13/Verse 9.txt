2 Corinthians 13:9.  For we rejoice when we are weak, and ye are strong when-in consequence of your strength in grace and well-doing as a church we have no occasion to put forth our strength among you, but in all our own weakness look on, “joying and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ” (Colossians 2:5),  this also we pray for, even your perfection.  See 2 Corinthians 13:11.
