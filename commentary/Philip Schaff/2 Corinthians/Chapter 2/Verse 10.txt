2 Corinthians 2:10.  But to whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: ‘As your excommunication, in my absence, yet by my instructions, was mine, so will your restoration be,’  for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven any thing, for your sakes   have I forgiven it   in the person (  Gr. ‘the presence’)  of Christ  as though it were the act of Christ Himself, present in the midst of vou. No stronger claim to apostolic authority in the highest sense could be advanced.
