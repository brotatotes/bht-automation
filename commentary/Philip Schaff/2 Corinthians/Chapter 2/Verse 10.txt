<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:10">2 Corinthians 2:10</span>. <strong> But to whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also:</strong> ‘As your excommunication, in my absence, yet by my instructions, was mine, so will your restoration be,’ <strong> for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven any thing, for your sakes </strong> <strong><em> have I forgiven it </em></strong> <strong> in the person</strong> ( <em> Gr</em>. ‘the presence’) <strong> of Christ</strong> <strong> as</strong> though it were the act of Christ Himself, present in the midst of vou. No stronger claim to apostolic authority in the highest sense could be advanced.
