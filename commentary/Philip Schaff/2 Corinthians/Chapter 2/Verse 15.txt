In the former verse it was the knowledge of Himself, diffused by preachers, which went up as a sweet-smelling savour unto God: here it is the preachers themselves that go up, yet not in themselves considered, but as it were “Christ” Himself held forth by them. And this in the case of both classes of their auditors those alike who receive and who reject their message, <strong> in them that are being saved, and in them that are perishing</strong> each class being here described not by their reception or rejection of the message, but by the <em> direction </em> which, as such, they are each taking, an upward or downward, a saving or perishing direction (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18">1 Corinthians 1:18</span>).
