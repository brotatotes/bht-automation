<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:16">2 Corinthians 2:16</span>. <strong> to the one a savour from death unto death; to the other a savour from life unto life:</strong> the one class, already “dead in trespasses and sins,” sinking deeper, and approaching nearer, by every successive resistance of the truth, to “the second death;” the other, already “alive unto God through Jesus Christ,” and through faith in His name, having that “life” invigorated and developed by every successive welcome given to the word of life ministered by us, towards that goal where, as “life eternal,” it shall need no more of our help.’ The idea here expressed, though indicated in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:10">2 Corinthians 7:10</span> (“Godly sorrow <em> worketh </em> repentance <em> unto salvation”</em>) <em> </em> and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18">1 Corinthians 1:18</span> and other places, is nowhere so explicitly and solemnly expressed as here. In neither case, says the apostle, is the final issue as yet seen: the saved are but partially saved here, though on the way to it; the lost are neither wholly nor finally lost, but are on the way to it. No wonder that, in view of such transcendent issues, he adds, <strong> And who is sufficient for these things?
