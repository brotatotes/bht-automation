2 Corinthians 2:17.  For we are not as many, corrupting (  Gr. ‘ adulterating’)  the word of God those characterised in chap. 10-11 in the strongest terms of reprobation. These have easy work of it they are “sufficient” for anything;  but (as for us)  as of sincerity, as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ: ‘Not ourselves, but Christ in us it is our one object to hold forth, and doing this as in the sight of God Himself whose spokesmen we are, and in view of the awful issues, who can but feel his own insufficiency?’
