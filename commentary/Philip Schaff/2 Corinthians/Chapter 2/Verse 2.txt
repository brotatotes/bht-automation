2 Corinthians 2:2.  For if I make you sorry ‘as I knew my First Letter would,’  who is he that maketh me glad ‘by the happy effect which I hoped the sharpness of that Letter would produce, and now I find has produced,’  but he that is made sorry by me?  The use of the singular number “he,” in place of “they” here, is an evident allusion to the incestuous person, whom he had required the church at Corinth solemnly to excommunicate (1 Corinthians 5:1, etc.), but now it would appear thoroughly penitent.
