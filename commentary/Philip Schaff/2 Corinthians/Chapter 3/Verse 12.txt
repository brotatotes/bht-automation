<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:12">2 Corinthians 3:12</span>. <strong> Having therefore such a hope</strong> in the exercise of such a ministry, <strong> we use great boldness</strong> (or ‘openness’) of speech. It is the same word as is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:32">Mark 8:32</span>, where the reference is to our Lord’s naked announcement of His death, which up to that time he had only darkly hinted. In like manner, the great truths now openly proclaimed in the Gospel lay concealed under the figures of the legal economy. But now that the <em> substance </em> has come, the wonders of grace in Christ Jesus may with all openness and boldness of speech be proclaimed.
