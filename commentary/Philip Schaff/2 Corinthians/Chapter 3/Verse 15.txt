2 Corinthians 3:15.  But though “the darkness is past and the true light now shineth,” what avails this for those who will not see? for  until this day, whensoever Moses is read, a veil (of voluntary obscurity)  lieth upon their heart. Such is their spiritual obtuseness, that even after that which is perfect, permanent, and universal is come, they shut them-selves up in their fragmentary, provisional, temporary economy, and doat upon it, unable to see its inherent imperfection, not feeling the utter inadequacy of its provisions for meeting the deep wants of their own nature. Moses with them is everything, and Christ is nothing. When the Sun of righteousness arose with healing in His wings to them who feared God’s name, they, unprepared to welcome it, retreated into their own darkness, which they loved better.
