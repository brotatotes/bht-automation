2 Corinthians 3:17.  Now the Lord the glorified Lord of the Church  is the Spirit that quickening Spirit, who “by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven” makes the Gospel “spirit and life” to “as many as receive Him” (John 1:12-13; and see 2 Corinthians 3:6 above). ‘Where Christ is (says Bengel) there is the Spirit of Christ; where the Spirit of Christ is, there is Christ’ (Romans 8:9-11).
	 and where the Spirit of the lord is, there is liberty  (Romans 8:15) the reverse of that “bondage” which is our apostle’s invariable characteristic of the legal economy.
