<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:2">2 Corinthians 3:2</span>. <strong> Ye are our epistle. </strong> ‘Your conversion is our <strong> </strong> letter recommendatory’ <em> </em> not needing to be carried about and produced with the hand, but <strong> written in our</strong> <strong> hearts. </strong> Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:2">1 Corinthians 9:2</span>, “The seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.” No true servant of Christ will feel himself above the need of such seals of his ministry. In the early Church of Scotland, the most gifted ministers never deemed their Divine “call” to be decisively “sealed” until they could see some saving fruit of it. But our apostle’s letter of recommendation, in the conversion of the Corinthians, was not only written in his own heart, but <strong> known and read of all men </strong> in the marvellous and manifest change which the Gospel had wrought on one of the most unlikely of all communities.

<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] There is in the original Greek words here a play upon the words “ <em> known </em> and <em> read”</em>, <em> </em> which cannot be represented in our language <strong> </strong> the same which is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:30">Acts 8:30</span>, “ <em> Understandest </em> thou what thou <em> readest?</em> ” </p>
