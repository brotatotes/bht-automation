2 Corinthians 3:2.  Ye are our epistle.  ‘Your conversion is our   letter recommendatory’   not needing to be carried about and produced with the hand, but  written in our  hearts.  Cf. 1 Corinthians 9:2, “The seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.” No true servant of Christ will feel himself above the need of such seals of his ministry. In the early Church of Scotland, the most gifted ministers never deemed their Divine “call” to be decisively “sealed” until they could see some saving fruit of it. But our apostle’s letter of recommendation, in the conversion of the Corinthians, was not only written in his own heart, but  known and read of all men  in the marvellous and manifest change which the Gospel had wrought on one of the most unlikely of all communities.
