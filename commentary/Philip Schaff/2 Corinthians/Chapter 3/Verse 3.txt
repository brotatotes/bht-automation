<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:3">2 Corinthians 3:3</span>. <strong> being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ. </strong> Nearly all modern interpreters take this to mean, ‘an epistle of which Christ is the <em> author.’ </em> But with Chrysostom we cannot but think the meaning is, ‘an epistle of which Christ is the <em> subject-matter</em>,’ <em> </em> as if he had said, ‘all who see you may read Christ in you.’ The other view of the clause seems like a repetition of the preceding one, while this presents the change on the Corinthians in a new and striking light. Besides, if the phrase “ye are our epistle” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:2">2 Corinthians 3:2</span>), means ‘an epistle commendatory of us,’ the phrase “ye are an epistle of Christ,” may well mean ‘an epistle commendatory of Christ.’ Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>, “Christ liveth in me,” and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+1:21">Philippians 1:21</span>, “To me to live is Christ,” <strong> ministered by us </strong> as if he had said, by the change wrought through us, ‘We wrote Christ on your character,’ written ... <strong> by the Spirit of the living God </strong> accompanying our message, <strong> not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</strong> [1] <strong> </strong> There is here an evident allusion to the Mosaic law as written on tables of stone. The contrast between this and the same laws as written on the heart is precisely that which both Jeremiah and Ezekiel had predicted as the grand point of contrast between the old and the new economy. “Behold the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers . . . I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:31-33">Jeremiah 31:31-33</span>). In Ezekiel, it is the heart itself, which is of <em> stone, </em> but this is to be taken away and in place of it a heart of <em> flesh </em> is to be given (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:26">Ezekiel 36:26</span>).

<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] If MS. authority is to decide the true reading here, there can be no doubt that it is this: “in fleshy tables, <em> even </em> hearts,” or “in tables <em> that are </em> hearts of flesh,” for the evidence of MSS. is overwhelming. But this is so unnatural, that though we would not (with Dr. Scrivener, in the second edition of his <em> Biblical Criticism of the New Testament, </em> p. 442) call it “a perfectly absurd reading,” we cannot but regard it, with Meyer, as a slip of the pen: “kardias sarkinais” passing easily into “kardiais <em> sarkinais</em>,” as Scrivener says, ‘by dint of the rhyming termination.’ Certainly Irenæus (2d century) read as in the received text, if we may trust the Latin rendering, and Origen (3d century); and with them nearly all the versions.
