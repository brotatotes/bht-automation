2 Corinthians 3:6.  who also made us sufficient as ministers of the new covenant. The same word is in the original thrice repeated in different forms, and it might be rendered ‘not we are fit of our-selves. . . but our fitness is from God, who also fitted us to be ministers,’ etc. The expression “able ministers” in the Authorised Version is now unsuitable from its ambiguity,  not of the letter  meaning, not the letter of the law, as opposed to the spirit of the same law; but not of the law itself, considered as a code of duty, to be obeyed on pain of death,  but of the spirit that word of the Gospel which, instinct with quickening power, “is spirit and life,”  for the letter killeth  cf. Romans 4:14, “the law worketh wrath,” and 2 Corinthians 7:9-10, “When the commandment came, gin revived, and I died; and the commandment which was unto life (in its primary intention) I found to be unto death” (through my breach of it).
	From this the apostle is led into a lengthened contrast, extending to the end of the chapter, between the two dispensations, both in their essential character as  killing  and as  quickening and, as a consequence from this, in that  freedom  and  openness  which are distinctive of the Gospel and its ministry, and the reverse of the law.
