2 Corinthians 3:7.  But if the ministration of death that of the law, which by reason of our inability to keep it, becomes to us a ministration of death, written (  Gr. ‘ in letters’)  and engraven on stones, came with glory with a glory expressive of the righteous claims of Jehovah on His reasonable creatures,  so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of Moses for the glory of his face. The allusion is to Exodus 34:30, all so awe-struck with the appearance of Moses when he came down from the Mount, that they were afraid to come nigh him,  which glory was passing away was expressive only of what was transitory.
