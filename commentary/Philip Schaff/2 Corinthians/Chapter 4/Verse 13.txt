2 Corinthians 4:13.  But having the same spirit of faith (as the Psalmist),  according to that which is written (Psalms 116:10),  I believed, and therefore did I speak; we also believe, and therefore also we speak out of the fulness of our heart’s conviction and experience, “all the words of this life.”
