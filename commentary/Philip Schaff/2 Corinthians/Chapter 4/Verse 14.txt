2 Corinthians 4:14.  knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus [1]  shall raise up us also with Jesus, [2]  and shall present us with you the parent in the faith with his spiritual children (see Ephesians 5:27; 1 Thessalonians 2:9; 1 Thessalonians 2:20; Jude 1:24).
	 [1] Here the received reading is dearly right; that of Lachmann and Tregelles, followed by Stanley and Green, being supported only by one ancient MS.
	 [2] Not “by Jesus,” as in the received text and Authorised Version on next to no evidence
