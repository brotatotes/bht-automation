2 Corinthians 4:15.  For all things are for your sakes: ‘Yes; for as I have said, “we are your servants for Jesus’ sake,” and that “He that raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also with Him, and shall present us and you” together, so now I say that the whole economy of redemption and the entire ministry of reconciliation are for the ingathering and perfecting of the redeemed,
	 that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound unto the glory of God. This clause, thus correctly rendered, is somewhat obscure; but of the three or four ways in which it has been understood, the following alone seems to suit the scope of the passage and the emphasis of the words ‘that the rich fruits of the Christian ministry, raising songs of thanksgiving for the grace which produces them, may yield a like rich revenue of glory to God.’
