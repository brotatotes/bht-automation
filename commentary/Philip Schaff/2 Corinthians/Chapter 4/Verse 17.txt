2 Corinthians 4:17.  For our light affliction, which is but for the moment only temporary and but momentary,  worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory; while we look that is, not ‘so long as we look,’ or ‘provided we look,’ but ‘looking as we do,’ or ‘inasmuch as we look’  not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.  ‘Did we look upon our troubles in the light of “things seen and temporal,” they would seem not “light,” but heavy indeed; looked at in this light, far from “momentary,” they would seem distressingly protracted; and looked at in this light, instead of working for us any good, they would seem to work us only evil and that continually; but looking on them, as we do, in the light of “the things that are unseen and eternal,” their character is entirely changed, and instead of heavy, they seem to be “light;” far from tedious and protracted, they seem but “for the moment,” and in place of doing us any real harm, we find them “working for us more and exceedingly an eternal weight of glory.” O what a change does  the point of view  make here! But is not this the experience of every one who has been “renewed in the spirit of his mind,” in whom “old things have passed away, and all things have become new”?
