2 Corinthians 4:4.  in whom the God of this world so called from the mysterious power over men, permitted him since the fall (see Luke 4:6; Hebrews 2:14; Revelation 2:13, “where Satan’s throne is;” Ephesians 2:2)
	 hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God. This He was even in His “emptied” state here below; but it is as “glorified,” now in our own nature, “with the glory which He had with the Father before the world was,” and so held forth in the preaching of the Gospel that He is here spoken of; as having a brightness before which the god of this world cannot stand, knowing that if one ray of it do but enter any soul, his hold over it is gone; and therefore he dreads and strives (in many, too successfully) to hide it from view (see Luke 8:12).
