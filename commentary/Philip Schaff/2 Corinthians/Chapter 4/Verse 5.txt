2 Corinthians 4:5.  For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake. Did we preach ourselves, the god of this world would have no cause to fear for his victims: it is in the sinking of ourselves, in our one desire to exalt our Master and save the souls of men, that he knows our strength lies.
	 Seeing it is God [He] that said, Light shall shine [1]  out of darkness, who hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. Even we ourselves had never taken in the light of Christ’s glory, had it not burst upon us by the same power that made the light to arise at the beginning on this dark world.  [1] The three oldest MSS. so read. Meyer argues for the received text, on the strength of Versions and Fathers; but being the smoother reading of the two (and differing from the other in only one letter), the less smooth reading is more likely to be the true one.
