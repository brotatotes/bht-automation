<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>. <strong> For we know that if</strong> [1] <strong> the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved </strong> or ‘our earthly tent-house be taken down,’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] Several modern critics think the “if” is here used to leave it an open question whether he and his generation might not see the coming of the Lord, and so not die at all. To us such an allusion does not seem probable.
	</p>
<p><strong> we have a building from God</strong> meaning the resurrection-body, called “a building” in contrast with the tent-house of our present frame,
	</p>
<p><strong> a house not made with hands</strong> (like the buildings we erect), <strong> eternal in the heavens.
