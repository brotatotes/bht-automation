2 Corinthians 5:11.  Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord the Lord Christ who is to be our Judge,  we (in the exercise of our ministry) persuade men;  but we are made manifest unto God (who knoweth our hearts),  and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences to which we willingly leave all charges against ourselves and our work (see on 2 Corinthians 4:2).
