2 Corinthians 5:12.  We are not again commending ourselves unto you (see chap. 2 Corinthians 3:1),  but   speak   as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf enabling you to meet all unworthy attacks upon us, by pointing to what the Gospel which we brought you has made yourselves,  that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart the parties referred to in chap. 10, and described in chap. 11.
