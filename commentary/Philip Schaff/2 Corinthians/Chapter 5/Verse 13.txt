<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:13">2 Corinthians 5:13</span>. <strong> For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you:</strong> ‘If tarried away by the glory of the message with which we are burdened, we at times seem beside ourselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:24">Acts 26:24</span>), it is our zeal for God that urges us on; but if at other times we change our course, and our speech and action seem suspiciously calm, it is to avoid prejudice to our message, and win you to receive it.’
