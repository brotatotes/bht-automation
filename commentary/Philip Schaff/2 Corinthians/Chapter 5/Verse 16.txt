<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:16">2 Corinthians 5:16</span>. <strong> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh:</strong> ‘Our old principles of judgment are at an end; we now look on persons and things alike in a quite new light;’ <strong> even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more. </strong> There is no reference here to any view of Christ which the apostle himself took before his conversion (as Plumptre and others): the reference is to what Christ during His public ministry on earth appeared <em> even to His own disciples </em> to be, and the light in which they afterwards saw Him. Men may boast that they saw, <strong> </strong> and heard, and talked with Him in the days of His flesh; but so far from that being any recommendation, so mean and unworthy were the views which the best of us (says the apostle) then entertained of Him, that they are a trouble to us even to remember them; henceforth we wish to know every person and everything in a new light, yea, to know even Christ Himself only as we have now learned to regard Him.
