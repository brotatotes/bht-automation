2 Corinthians 5:16.  Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: ‘Our old principles of judgment are at an end; we now look on persons and things alike in a quite new light;’  even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.  There is no reference here to any view of Christ which the apostle himself took before his conversion (as Plumptre and others): the reference is to what Christ during His public ministry on earth appeared  even to His own disciples  to be, and the light in which they afterwards saw Him. Men may boast that they saw,   and heard, and talked with Him in the days of His flesh; but so far from that being any recommendation, so mean and unworthy were the views which the best of us (says the apostle) then entertained of Him, that they are a trouble to us even to remember them; henceforth we wish to know every person and everything in a new light, yea, to know even Christ Himself only as we have now learned to regard Him.
