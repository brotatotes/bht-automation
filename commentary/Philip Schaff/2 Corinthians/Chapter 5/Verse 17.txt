2 Corinthians 5:17.  Wherefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they [1]  are become new.  This verse simply generalizes the preceding statements, stripping them of all reference to himself and those written to, and extending them to all who are “in Christ.”
	 [1] The words “all things,” in the received text, are wanting in all the principal authorities; and though it is true (as Meyer says), that owing to the next verse beginning with the same words, they might very easily have dropped out (and this would decide us in their favour, if the want of them involved anything unnatural), yet, since they are not required for anything in the sense, the authorities seem to demand their exclusion.
