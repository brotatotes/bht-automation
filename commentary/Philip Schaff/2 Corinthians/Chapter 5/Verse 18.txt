 Comprehensive View of the Christian Ministry,  18-21.
	2 Corinthians 5:18.  And to express in brief the whole Divine plan  all things  (in this matter)  are of God,  who reconciled us to himself through Christ [1]   Those who take this to mean ‘induced us to give up our enmity to Him,’ go entirely against what the very next verse shews to be meant that, by putting away the cause of His enmity to us, which lay in sin, He has brought about peace between Himself and us sinners.

Epist.  I. pp. 276 280).
