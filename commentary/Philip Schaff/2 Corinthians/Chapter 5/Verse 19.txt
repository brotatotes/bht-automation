<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19">2 Corinthians 5:19</span>. <strong> to wit</strong> (to be more particular) <strong> that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses. </strong> This shews conclusively, as already said, that the reconciliation of the preceding verse means the removal on God’s part of His just ground <strong> </strong> of offence against us
	</p>
<p>His not “reckoning” to men their “trespasses.” This is here said to take place “in Christ;” though in what sense, is reserved for the last verse, But a noteworthy change is made in the form of expression. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:18">2 Corinthians 5:18</span> it was that “God <em> reconciled </em> us,” meaning, once for all by that propitiatory death of His Son, in which He received righteous satisfaction for our “trespasses” (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:10">Romans 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:26">Hebrews 9:26</span>): here, it is “ <em> God is in Christ reconciling </em> the world unto Himself,” expressing the <em> continued reconciliation of individual souls </em> to Himself, as each successively welcomes this reconciliation, made once for all on the cross, as the appointed way of his personal reconciliation to God,
	</p>
<p><strong> and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation</strong> the glad tidings to proclaim to men. </p>
