2 Corinthians 5:20.  We ace ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were intreating by us  (as His mouth),  we beseech  you    on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.  Calvin would extend this reconciliation to the daily forgiveness which believers themselves stand in need of, because the Epistle is addressed to believers. But besides that the opening verse of the next chapter is a word to them, the call is evidently to all unreconciled ones whom his words might reach, no longer to withhold their seal to that great act of God in the death of His Son in which lay their only hope of reconciliation to Him.
