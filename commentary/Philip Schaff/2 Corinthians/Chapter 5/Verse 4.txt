<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:4">2 Corinthians 5:4</span>. <strong> For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that mortality</strong> ( <em> Gr. </em> ‘that which is mortal’) <strong> may be swallowed up of life:</strong> ‘It is not that we are weary of a body, as if it were a mere cage from which it were bliss simply to make our escape; but we long that the mortality with which it is smitten, with all the ills which that carries with it, may pass away, and we may find ourselves wearing a form instinct with a life that cannot die.’ The sublime expression “swallowed up” was doubtless suggested by <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+25:8">Isaiah 25:8</span>, quoted in the former Epistle (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:54">1 Corinthians 15:54</span>), where the same word is used (taken from the LXX., which gives the exact sense of the original).
