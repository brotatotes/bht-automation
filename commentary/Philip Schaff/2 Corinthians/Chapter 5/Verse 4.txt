2 Corinthians 5:4.  For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that mortality (  Gr.  ‘that which is mortal’)  may be swallowed up of life: ‘It is not that we are weary of a body, as if it were a mere cage from which it were bliss simply to make our escape; but we long that the mortality with which it is smitten, with all the ills which that carries with it, may pass away, and we may find ourselves wearing a form instinct with a life that cannot die.’ The sublime expression “swallowed up” was doubtless suggested by Isaiah 25:8, quoted in the former Epistle (1 Corinthians 15:54), where the same word is used (taken from the LXX., which gives the exact sense of the original).
