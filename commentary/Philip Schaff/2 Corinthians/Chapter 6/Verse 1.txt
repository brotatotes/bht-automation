2 Corinthians 6:1.  And working together   with him,   we entreat also that ye receive not the grace of God compare Acts 24:24, “the gospel of the grace of God,” and  Acts 13:42, “persuaded them to continue in the grace of God,” in vain: ‘Having pleaded with the  unreconciled,   as though God were pleading by us, no longer to resist the yearning desire and the gracious provision of God in Christ for their reconciliation, we now turn to you,  already reconciled,   and, in the same capacity of “workers together with Him,” entreat you to turn that grace to practical account, by “walking worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called.”’
