2 Corinthians 6:10. as  sorrowful, yet always rejoicing “sowing in tears, yet reaping in joy;” a paradox to which no true servant of Christ, who “watches for souls as one that shall give account,” is quite a stranger;  as poor in this world’s goods,  yet making many rich putting them in possession of “the true riches” (Luke 16:1), “a treasure in the heavens that faileth not” (Luke 12:33). See chap. 2 Corinthians 8:9; James 2:5; Hebrews 11:26; Hebrews 11:26;  as  having nothing (earthly),  and   yet   possessing all things for “all things are ours” (1 Corinthians 3:21). Perhaps, however, all needful temporal supplies may also be in view; for, writing to the Philippians, when depending from day to day on what his converts might thoughtfully send him, he expatiates with a touching gratitude on their considerate attention to his wants, and ends with these words, “But I have all, and abound” (Philippians 4:10-19).
	Thus ends this noble strain! But it is only to pass into an equally impassioned strain of entreaty, to those who were the fruits of so self-consuming a ministry of reconciliation, to manifest the grand design of it the calling out of an unbelieving and unholy world a people who should shine, by their Christian example, “as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life.”
