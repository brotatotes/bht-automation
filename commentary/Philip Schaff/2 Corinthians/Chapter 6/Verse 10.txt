Perhaps, however, all needful temporal supplies may also be in view; for, writing to the Philippians, when depending from day to day on what his converts might thoughtfully send him, he expatiates with a touching gratitude on their considerate attention to his wants, and ends with these words, “But I have all, and abound” (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+4:10-19">Philippians 4:10-19</span>).

<p>Thus ends this noble strain! But it is only to pass into an equally impassioned strain of entreaty, to those who were the fruits of so self-consuming a ministry of reconciliation, to manifest the grand design of it the calling out of an unbelieving and unholy world a people who should shine, by their Christian example, “as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life.”
