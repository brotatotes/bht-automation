2 Corinthians 6:14.  Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers.  The figure is drawn from the heterogeneous yoking of animals in a team (compare Deuteronomy 22:10, “Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together;” and see Leviticus 19:19); and though the more immediate reference probably is to too intimate association with their unconverted fellow-citizens at feasts, and especially to intermarriage with heathens, it is doubtless meant to embrace all entangling association with those whose close fellowship would have a deadening effect on their religious life,
	 for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? On the meaning of “righteousness” here, see on 2 Corinthians 6:7,
	 or what communion hath light with dark-ness?  Compare Luke 16:8; 1 Thessalonians 5:5; Amos 3:5; Ephesians 5:7-8; 1 John 1:6-7.
