2 Corinthians 6:15.  And what concord hath Christ with Belial? From the use of this proper name, and the antithesis with Christ, it evidently is meant (like Beelzebub in Matthew 12:24) as a synonym for Satan (Stanley),
	 or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever? It is not their having different speculative opinions about religion that makes intimate fellowship between them impracticable; it is that a “believer” is supposed to breathe a different atmosphere, to live for fundamentally different ends, and to have entirely different interests and tastes and modes of action, from an “unbeliever.” (See on chap. 2 Corinthians 5:16-17.)
