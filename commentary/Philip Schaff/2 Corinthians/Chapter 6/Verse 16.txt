2 Corinthians 6:16.  And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for we [1]  are the temple of the living God- not only in contrast with the dead idols in the heathen temples, but to express the living character of the temple itself (1 Peter 2:5);
	 [1] The first person plural, not the second, is the true reading here.
	 even as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. The quotation is from Leviticus 26:12 (as in LXX.), save the first words, ‘I will dwell in them,’ which seem to be a combination of Psalms 68:18 (LXX.) and of the import of several other passages. No language, surely, could more emphatically express the radical contrast between “believers” and “unbelievers” than this.
