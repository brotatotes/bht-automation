<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:16">2 Corinthians 6:16</span>. <strong> And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for we</strong> [1] <strong> are the temple of the living God-</strong> not only in contrast with the dead idols in the heathen temples, but to express the living character of the temple itself (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>);

<p><strong> even as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</strong> The quotation is from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+26:12">Leviticus 26:12</span> (as in LXX.), save the first words, ‘I will dwell in them,’ which seem to be a combination of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:18">Psalms 68:18</span> (LXX.) and of the import of several other passages. No language, surely, could more emphatically express the radical contrast between “believers” and “unbelievers” than this.
