Well, says our apostle here, <strong> behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation)</strong>: ‘Do ye, Gentile converts, therefore, make this good in your own case, shewing, by what the Gospel has made you to be, that this is no name but a glorious reality.’

<p>Ver. 2. <strong> giving, </strong> etc. The connexion is with the opening words of the chapter, As “working together with God,” and . . . <strong> giving no occasion </strong> of <strong> stumbling in any thing, that our ministration be not blamed. </strong> How far the opposite of this was the uniform procedure of the apostle, he protests in the remarkable and glowing verses that follow.
