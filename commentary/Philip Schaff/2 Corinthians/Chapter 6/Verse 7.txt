2 Corinthians 6:7.  in the word of truth ... by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by our conscious rectitude, which, amid all attacks both from open and concealed enemies, is our defence wherever we turn. So we take these words (with Calvin). To understand it of the “righteousness which is of faith” (as Meyer does, and Alford after him), seems here out of place.
