Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections</strong> ‘If there is any want of openness between us, it is not on our part, but all on your own; injurious thoughts of us, bred of unworthy suspicion of our motives, have haply chilled your feelings, cooled your love; as for our feelings towards you, they are the same as ever.’
