2 Corinthians 6:11-12.  Our month is open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged. Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections ‘If there is any want of openness between us, it is not on our part, but all on your own; injurious thoughts of us, bred of unworthy suspicion of our motives, have haply chilled your feelings, cooled your love; as for our feelings towards you, they are the same as ever.’
