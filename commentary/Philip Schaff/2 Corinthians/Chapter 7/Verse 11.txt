<p><strong> yea, what longing</strong> for another visit, even though in severity, if necessary,
	</p>
<p><strong> yea, what zeal</strong> in the cause of church purity, too long neglected,
	</p>
<p><strong> yea, what avenging</strong> of the offence committed.
	</p>
<p><strong> In every thing ye approved yourselves to be pure in the matter</strong> not free of blame, but thoroughly in earnest, straightforward, and thoroughgoing in the case.
