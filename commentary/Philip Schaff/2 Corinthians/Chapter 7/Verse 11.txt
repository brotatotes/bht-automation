2 Corinthians 7:11.  For    . . . what earnest care in contrast with former indifference,  yea, what clearing of yourselves from all real connivance at the deed,  yea, what indignation against the deed, at length seen in its true light, and against yourselves for so long and so tamely enduring it,  yea, what fear of his having to “come to them with a rod” (1 Corinthians 4:21),
	 yea, what longing for another visit, even though in severity, if necessary,
	 yea, what zeal in the cause of church purity, too long neglected,
	 yea, what avenging of the offence committed.
	 In every thing ye approved yourselves to be pure in the matter not free of blame, but thoroughly in earnest, straightforward, and thoroughgoing in the case.
