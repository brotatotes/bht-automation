2 Corinthians 7:8.  For though I made you sorry with my former epistle, I do not regret it, though I did regret it a strong expression of the pain it gave him to write as he had done, insomuch that he was haunted â€˜with the impression that he had expressed himself too strongly, which he was now glad to find was not the case:  for I see that that epistle made you sorry, though but for a season.
