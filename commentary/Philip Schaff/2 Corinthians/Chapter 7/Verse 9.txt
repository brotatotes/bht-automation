2 Corinthians 7:9.  Now I rejoice . . . that ye were made sorry unto repentance unto a complete change of mind about this case; the sorrow, though sharp, was short and it was salutary,  for ye were made sorry after a godly sort, that ye might suffer loss by us in nothing our treatment of you proved to be of God for your good.
