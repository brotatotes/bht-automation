2 Corinthians 7:6.  Nevertheless he that comforteth the bowed down,   even   God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
	2 Corinthians 7:7.  and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort wherewith he was comforted in you bringing back such gladdening intelligence of your spiritual state,  when he told us your longing to see me again,  your mourning, your zeal for me in spite of malicious insinuation against me,  so that I rejoiced yet more than at his mere return.
