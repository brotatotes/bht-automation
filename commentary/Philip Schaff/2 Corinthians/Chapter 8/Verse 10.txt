2 Corinthians 8:10.  And herein I give   my   judgment or “opinion;” for in 2 Corinthians 8:8 he had just disclaimed giving them a “command” on the subject (see 1 Corinthians 7:6; 1 Corinthians 7:25),
	 for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago or as we should say, ‘last year,’ for a whole year had not intervened;
	 not only to do, but to will a strange expression; but the meaning clearly is, ‘Since ye not only began to  make  this collection last year, before ever the Macedonian churches were addressed upon the subject, but set yourselves to it  with a will  (as we should say), it would only be becoming in you not to fall behind the Macedonians in the completion of it.’ That this is the meaning, seems plain from the next verse.
