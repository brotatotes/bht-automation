2 Corinthians 8:21.  for we take thought for things honourable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men so as to be above suspicion, and give no shadow of ground for such unworthy thoughts as those hinted at in chap. 2 Corinthians 12:17-18. Who this “brother” was, it is quite vain to conjecture. For to all who have been supposed to be meant Barnabas, Silas, Apollos, Trophimus, Mark, Luke there are different objections, all having their own weight, while the arguments in favour of any one of them are too slender to build upon. Enough it must be for us to know that those written to did not need him to be named, and that he was held in such esteem that to send him with Titus would be deemed a boon.
