2 Corinthians 8:22.  And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which   he hath   in you  on the double ground of his known Christian earnestness, and his confidence in the Corinthians. But neither can we tell who this “brother” was, more than the other.
