<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23">2 Corinthians 8:23</span>. Whether <em> any inquire </em> about Titus. ‘Need I say anything in commendation of him?’ <em> he is </em> my partner, and <em> my </em> fellow-worker to you-ward therefore, in relation to the apostle and his work, above the other two; or our brethren, they are the messengers of the churches, <em> they are </em> the glory of Christ (as we should say) ‘They are an honour to Christ;’ their walk and work bring glory to Him. Noble testimony this!
