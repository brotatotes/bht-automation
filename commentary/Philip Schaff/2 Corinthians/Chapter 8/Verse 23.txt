2 Corinthians 8:23. Whether  any inquire  about Titus. ‘Need I say anything in commendation of him?’  he is  my partner, and  my  fellow-worker to you-ward therefore, in relation to the apostle and his work, above the other two; or our brethren, they are the messengers of the churches,  they are  the glory of Christ (as we should say) ‘They are an honour to Christ;’ their walk and work bring glory to Him. Noble testimony this!
