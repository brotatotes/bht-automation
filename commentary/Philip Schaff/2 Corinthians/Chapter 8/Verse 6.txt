2 Corinthians 8:6.  Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had made a beginning before  that is, when he went with others to Corinth as the bearer of his First Epistle to that Church, and availed himself of that opportunity to bring the proposal for this collection before them, and made a beginning in preparing for it,  so he would complete in you this grace also.
