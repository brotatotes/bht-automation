2 Corinthians 8:14.  but by equality; your abundance  being a supply   at this present time for their want, that their abundance also (in your time of need)  may become   a supply   for your want; that there may be equality:
	2 Corinthians 8:15.  as it is written (in Exodus 16:18, mostly as in LXX.),  He that gathered much had nothing over; and he that   gathered   little had no lack. The apostle seizes on the principle of equality in the gathering of the manna, not only from the principle itself, but because there is a beautiful epigrammatic, gnomic force in the very manner in which it is expressed, making it handy and serviceable in every such case.
