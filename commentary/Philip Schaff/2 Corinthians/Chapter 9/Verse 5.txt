2 Corinthians 9:5.  I thought it necessary, therefore, to entreat the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up before -  hand your afore-promised bounty (  Gr.  ‘blessing’) your collection before promised by me,  that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not of extortion. There is a beautiful sensitiveness here for the character of the Corinthian church, as taking the lead among the Gentile churches, in praising of this collection. Perhaps he had some reason to think that their first zeal in the matter had slackened, and that any Macedonians who might accompany him would think less of them than he had given them to expect, if, when they and he reached Corinth, the proceeds had even then to be got out of them by a pressure that might look like “extortion.” To prevent this, he thought it advisable to send messengers to make all ready against his coming visit.
