2 Corinthians 9:6.  But this I say ‘Let this as a general principle be borne in mind,’  He that soweth sparingly parsimoniously, grudgingly,  shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully (  Gr. ‘with blessings’ his heart going along with his hand in wishing “blessings” on the objects of his charity),
	 shall also reap bountifully. On the great principle here expressed, see Exodus 25:2; Exodus 35:5; 1Ch 29:14 ; 1 Chronicles 29:17; Psalms 112:9; Proverbs 11:24-25; Proverbs 19:17; Proverbs 22:9; Luke 6:38; Acts 20:35. The figure of sowing and reaping, natural in an agricultural country, and, as such, used by our Lord (Matthew 13:3, etc.; John 4:35-38), is a favourite one with our apostle (1 Corinthians 9:11; 1 Corinthians 15:36-37; 1 Corinthians 15:42-44; Galatians 6:7-8).
