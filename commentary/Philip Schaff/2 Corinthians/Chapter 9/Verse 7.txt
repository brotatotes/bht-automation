2 Corinthians 9:7.  Let   each man   do   according as he hath purposed in his heart; not grudgingly (Gr. ‘of grief’ or ‘sorrow’ as being wrung from him, and pained to think of the sacrifice he has to make):
	 for God loveth a cheerful giver. See on chap. 2 Corinthians 8:12. On the bearing of this on the  tithe  principle supposed by some to be obligatory on Christians see on 1 Corinthians 16:0, notes (2) and (3).
