<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:8">2 Corinthians 9:8</span>. <strong> And God is able to make all grace abound unto you.</strong> The words “all grace” here are used in the same limited sense as in chap. 8, that is, ‘every temporal blessing,’ though “grace” in its higher sense is not excluded,
	</p>
<p><strong> that ye, having always all sufficiency in every thing, may abound unto every good work</strong> ‘God is able, not only to make up to you what ye part with to those who need it, but to give you the means of so continuing in this generous consideration of the wants of others, as to abound in every work of Christian beneficence’:
