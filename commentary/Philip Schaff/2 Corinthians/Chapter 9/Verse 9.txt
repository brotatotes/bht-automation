2 Corinthians 9:9.  as it is written (Psalms 112:9),  He hath scattered abroad ‘a generous word’ (says Bengel), ‘with a full hand, not anxiously thinking about the single grains;’
	 he hath given to the poor: his righteousness (in dispersing abroad of his means)  abideth for ever enabling him always to manifest by his gifts what he is. That this is the sense of ‘righteousness abiding’ here, is evident from 2 Corinthians 9:10.
