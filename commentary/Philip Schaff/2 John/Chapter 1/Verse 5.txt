2 John 1:5.  And now  this is the purport of the letter.
	 I beseech thee, Syria: the request has in it a tone of dignity as well as of courtesy; the mother is addressed, though some of her children who walked not in love are aimed at: the apostle urges his request, which is sheltered behind the evangelical law,  not as though writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, in the first person,  that we love one another.  ‘Let us all walk in love:’ this, as well as the whole strain, shows the same exquisite courtesy which pervades St. Paul’s letters to individuals.
