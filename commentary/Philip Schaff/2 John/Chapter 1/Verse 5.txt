	</p>
<p><strong> I beseech thee, Syria</strong>: the request has in it a tone of dignity as well as of courtesy; the mother is addressed, though some of her children who walked not in love are aimed at: the apostle urges his request, which is sheltered behind the evangelical law, <strong> not as though writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning</strong>, in the first person, <strong> that we love one another. </strong> ‘Let us all walk in love:’ this, as well as the whole strain, shows the same exquisite courtesy which pervades St. Paul’s letters to individuals.
