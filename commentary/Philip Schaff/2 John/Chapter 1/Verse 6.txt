2 John 1:6. Here we have once more St. John’s familiar tribute to the ethical supremacy of love, the new revelation of which by Christ ‘in the beginning’ sways his thoughts with a peculiar power. The verse is remarkable for its circular argument: love is the walking in all the commandments, the strength to keep them all being in love, and love being their compendium; again, the one commandment heard from the beginning is ‘that ye should walk in it,’ that is, in love.
