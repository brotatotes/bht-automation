<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:7">2 John 1:7</span>. There is no love which is not based on truth: the love which keeps the commandments keeps the doctrinal as well as the ethical commandments. And, as love is the strength of obedience, so it is the guardian of the truth. Hence the ‘for’ that follows: <strong> for many deceivers are gone forth into the world </strong> from the spiritual world, the sphere of the lie <strong> they that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the flesh. </strong> The supreme truth as truth is in Jesus is the incarnation. <strong> This is the deceiver and the antichrist</strong>, of whom the former Epistle spoke: the deceiver as it regards you, the antichrist as it respects Jesus. ‘Cometh in the flesh’ refers in the most general way to the incarnation itself: not as a past fact, ‘came in the flesh’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:6">1 John 5:6</span>); nor as the fact with its results, ‘hath come’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:2">1 John 4:2</span>); but in its widest universality, though without reference to the second coming.
