<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:11">2 Peter 2:11</span>. <strong> Where angels, greater as they are in strength and power, bring not against them before the Lord a railing judgment.</strong> The phrase ‘before the Lord’ is omitted by some good authorities, and is bracketed by the most recent editors of the text. The ‘railing’ is expressed by an adjective connected with the verb, which is translated ‘speak evil of’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:2">2 Peter 2:2</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:11">Acts 6:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:13">1 Timothy 1:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:2">2 Timothy 3:2</span>, it is given as ‘blasphemous’ or ‘blasphemer.’ The word rendered ‘accusation’ by the A. V. means ‘judgment,’ and is so given in all the earlier English Versions. The opening relative, which the A. V. translates ‘whereas,’ means simply ‘where,’ and may be rendered ‘in cases where,’ or ‘in matters in which.’ The verse has received very different interpretations. The good angels, <em> e.g., </em> are supposed to be contrasted as a class with the evil angels in point of strength, and with the false teachers in respect of reverence. Or those angels who, like Michael, are supreme among all angels are understood to be referred to, and to be contrasted either with the ‘darers’ or with the ‘dignities.’ The most reasonable explanation, however, seems to be that even angels, who so far excel men, do not presume themselves to speak in terms of railing judgment against even offenders like these ‘darers.’ The reckless, impious audacity of the latter is thus presented in the darkest possible colours by being set over against the reverent regard for authority which in all circumstances characterizes the former. The statement which is given here broadly and generally, is connected with the eminent instance of Michael in Jude. Peter’s words here may take their form from the description of the scene between Joshua, Satan, and the angel of Jehovah in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:2">Zechariah 3:2</span>. It is not improbable, however, that for their present purpose both Peter and Jude make use of some tradition or current belief on the subject of the angels, which was familiar enough to his readers to need no explanation at the time. From the Rabbinical writings and the Apocryphal books we can gather how large a mass of popular and traditional lore grew up from an early period around many points of Old Testament doctrine.
