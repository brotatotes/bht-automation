<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:2">2 Peter 2:2</span>. <strong> And many shall follow their wantonnesses</strong>. The A. V. gives ‘pernicious ways,’ following a reading which is now given up. On the noun see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:3">1 Peter 4:3</span>. The same strong term is used for <em> following, </em> as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16">2 Peter 1:16</span>. It denotes completeness or closeness of pursuit. Here again the immoral life is represented as the natural result of the false belief. So too, and still more positively, in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:4">Jude 1:4</span>.

<p><strong> by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken </strong> of. As to the verb see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:4">1 Peter 4:4</span>. Christianity is designated ‘the way of the truth’ as being a mode of life which results from, or bears the qualities of, the truth. The term ‘way’ in this particular application occurs with marked frequency in the Book of Acts (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:2">Acts 9:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:17">Acts 16:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:25-26">Acts 18:25-26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:9">Acts 19:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:23">Acts 19:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:4">Acts 22:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:14">Acts 24:14</span>). The connection leaves it ambiguous whether the persons referred to here are the false teachers themselves, or their followers, or both together. The most natural reference on the whole would be to those who have been immediately spoken of as certain to follow these teachers. In this case the point may be, as it is understood, <em> e.g., </em> by Alford, that greatest injury is done to the cause of Christ among those outside by men who, while ‘seeming to be in the way of truth, yet favour and follow false teachers.’
