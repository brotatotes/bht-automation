2 Peter 2:6.  and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them with an overthrow, haying made them a type of those that should live ungodly. The term used for the ‘overthrow’ (=catastrophe) which constituted the punishment in this third historical instance is the one which is employed in the narrative of the event itself in Genesis 19:29. In the N. T. it occurs only once again, and there in a figurative sense, viz. in 2 Timothy 2:14. The brief description here is remarkable for its force and vividness. The word ‘turning into ashes,’ or, ‘burning to ashes’ (which occurs only here), is itself a strong and graphic expression. The retribution, too, is exhibited in all its righteous severity as a condemnation to an absolute overthrow. The destruction of the cities of the plain is regarded by the prophets (cf. Isaiah 1:9-10; Ezekiel 16:48-56), as well as by Peter, as an illustration or typical instance of the judicial principles on which God acts. The scriptural references to these cities and their fate are uncommonly numerous.
