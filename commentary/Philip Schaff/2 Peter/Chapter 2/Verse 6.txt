<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:6">2 Peter 2:6</span>. <strong> and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them with an overthrow, haying made them a type of those that should live ungodly</strong>. The term used for the ‘overthrow’ (=catastrophe) which constituted the punishment in this third historical instance is the one which is employed in the narrative of the event itself in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:29">Genesis 19:29</span>. In the N. T. it occurs only once again, and there in a figurative sense, viz. in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:14">2 Timothy 2:14</span>. The brief description here is remarkable for its force and vividness. The word ‘turning into ashes,’ or, ‘burning to ashes’ (which occurs only here), is itself a strong and graphic expression. The retribution, too, is exhibited in all its righteous severity as a condemnation to an absolute overthrow. The destruction of the cities of the plain is regarded by the prophets (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:9-10">Isaiah 1:9-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:48-56">Ezekiel 16:48-56</span>), as well as by Peter, as an illustration or typical instance of the judicial principles on which God acts. The scriptural references to these cities and their fate are uncommonly numerous.
