2 Peter 2:7.  and delivered righteous Lot, Bore distressed by the behaviour of the lawless in wantonness. Here again we have some unusual words. The verb which is rendered ‘vexed’ by the A. V., but which has the stronger sense of ‘sore distressed’ (as the R. V. puts it), or ‘worn down,’ occurs only once again, viz. in Acts 7:24, where it is translated ‘oppressed.’ The adjective which the A. V. translates ‘wicked,’ but which has the more definite sense of ‘lawless,’ occurs only once again, namely in chap. 2 Peter 3:17. As to the word ‘conversation’ or ‘behaviour,’ see on 1 Peter 1:15; and as to the term ‘wantonness,’ see above on 2 Peter 2:2. Jude omits this notice of the deliverance of Lot, which in Peter serves to throw into still stronger relief the unerring penal judgment of God, but also to prepare the way for the assertion of God’s knowledge of how to ‘deliver the godly out of temptation.’
