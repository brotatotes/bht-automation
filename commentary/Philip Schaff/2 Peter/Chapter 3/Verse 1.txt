<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:1">2 Peter 3:1</span>. <strong> This is now, beloved, a second epistle that I write unto you. </strong> The sentence might be rendered literally thus: ‘This already second epistle, beloved, I write unto you.’ The expression seems to imply that a <strong> </strong> comparatively short time had elapsed since he wrote them before. This is referred to as an ‘evidence of his affectionate solicitude, as well as of the importance and urgency of the subject-matter’ (Lillie). The First Epistle is thus incidentally claimed to be by the same hand. The author prefaces what he has now to say about the scoffers of the last days by a personal statement, as was the case also with the solemn affirmation made in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:12-15">2 Peter 1:12-15</span>. The Epistle also deepens notably in the loving urgency of its tone, as it now approaches its conclusion. Hence the repeated appeals to the readers as ‘beloved’ which distinguish this chapter ( 2Pe 3:1 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:8">2 Peter 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:14">2 Peter 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:17">2 Peter 3:17</span>).

<p><strong> in which;</strong> that is to say, ‘in which Epistles,’ or ‘in both which.’ The plural relative is used, as if the First Epistle as well as the Second had been specified.

<p><strong> I stir up your sincere mind in reminding</strong> (or, <em> in the way of) reminder). </em> On the formula see Note on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:13">2 Peter 1:13</span>. The adjective rendered ‘pure’ by the A. V. occurs only once again in the N. T., viz. in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+1:10">Philippians 1:10</span>, where the A. V. translates it ‘sincere,’ as the R. V. does here. It is derived by some from a root expressive of the <em> clear splendour </em> of sunlight; by others from a root denoting that which is <em> parcelled off </em> by itself; by others still from one signifying that which is purified by <em> rolling </em> or <em> shaking. </em> It seems to mean primarily <em> unmixed, distinct. </em> The cognate noun is found three times in the N. T. ( 1Co 5:8 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span>). The term has a definite ethical sense in the N. T., which goes beyond anything it has in Classical Greek. With a near approach to a complete account Archbishop Trench defines it as a grace which ‘will exclude all double-mindedness, the divided heart (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:8">James 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:8">James 4:8</span>), the eye not single (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:22">Matthew 6:22</span>), all hypocrisies (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:1">1 Peter 2:1</span>).’ While the A. V. gives the plural ‘minds,’ the original has the singular ‘mind.’ On the word itself see Note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:13">1 Peter 1:13</span>.
