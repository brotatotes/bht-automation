2 Peter 3:11.  Seeing that these things are thus all dissolving. The rendering which is sustained by the best authorities differs from the Received Text in omitting the ‘these’ of the A. V. and inserting ‘thus.’ The verb is given in the present tense, not ‘shall be dissolved’ as the A. V. puts it, or even ‘are to be dissolved’ as the R. V. renders it, but ‘are dissolving’ or, ‘are being dissolved.’ The certainty of the end is made doubly vivid by the process of dissolution being represented as having already set in and as now working towards its final revelation.
	 what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conduct and godliness.  The ‘be’ is expressed, as in chap. 2 Peter 1:8 and chap. 2 Peter 2:19, by the verb which conveys the idea of subsistence rather than mere existence. Here it points to established character, or permanent possession of qualities. The qualities themselves are denoted by plural nouns meaning literally ‘holy modes of living’ and ‘godlinesses,’ in reference to all the various forms in which the holy walk and godliness exhibit themselves. They are therefore very well rendered by the A. V.  ‘all  holy conversation and godliness.’ Some take this verse to put a question, and the next verse to give the reply. It is more consistent, however, with N. T. usage (which deals with the word rendered ‘what manner of persons’ as an exclamation; cf. especially Mark 13:1; Luke 1:29; 1 John 3:1), to take the two verses as forming together a single solemn exclamation. To give still sharper point to the expression, some of the best interpreters connect the clause ‘in all holy living,’ etc., not with what precedes, but with what follows it, making the whole run thus: ‘What manner of persons ought ye to be, looking, in all holy living and godliness, for . . . the day of God !’
