<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:13">2 Peter 3:13</span>. <strong> But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth.</strong> The rendering of the R. V. is decidedly superior here to that of the A. V. The latter throws an emphasis upon the ‘we,’ where the original throws it upon the ‘new.’ The ‘look for’ is expressed by the same term as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:12">2 Peter 3:12</span>. The ‘promise’ referred to (the word is the same as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span>) is the promise of God in the O. T. The passages particularly in the writer’s mind may be those in Isaiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+30:26">Isaiah 30:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:17">Isaiah 65:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:22">Isaiah 66:22</span>). The same hope, couched in the form of vision, meets us in John (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:1">Revelation 21:1</span>). The <em> newness </em> of the future heavens and earth is expressed by a term which denotes what is <em> fresh </em> as contrasted with what is <em> exhausted, </em> and deals with the <em> condition </em> rather than with the <em> age </em> of an object.

<p><strong> wherein dwelleth righteousness.</strong> The ‘righteousness’ is to be understood in the broad, ethical sense of conformity with the Divine will; and this is to ‘dwell’ (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:17">Ephesians 3:17</span>), to have its home there, and not to be as on earth ‘a wanderer and changeful guest’ (Mason). Compare again the prophetic visions in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:17-25">Isaiah 65:17-25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:3-27">Revelation 21:3-27</span>, and also the Pauline doctrine of the participation of nature in the restoration of man as well as in his fall (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:20-22">Romans 8:20-22</span>).
