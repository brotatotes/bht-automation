2 Peter 3:13.  But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth. The rendering of the R. V. is decidedly superior here to that of the A. V. The latter throws an emphasis upon the ‘we,’ where the original throws it upon the ‘new.’ The ‘look for’ is expressed by the same term as in 2 Peter 3:12. The ‘promise’ referred to (the word is the same as in chap. 2 Peter 1:4) is the promise of God in the O. T. The passages particularly in the writer’s mind may be those in Isaiah (Isaiah 30:26; Isaiah 65:17; Isaiah 66:22). The same hope, couched in the form of vision, meets us in John (Revelation 21:1). The  newness  of the future heavens and earth is expressed by a term which denotes what is  fresh  as contrasted with what is  exhausted,  and deals with the  condition  rather than with the  age  of an object.
	 wherein dwelleth righteousness. The ‘righteousness’ is to be understood in the broad, ethical sense of conformity with the Divine will; and this is to ‘dwell’ (cf. Ephesians 3:17), to have its home there, and not to be as on earth ‘a wanderer and changeful guest’ (Mason). Compare again the prophetic visions in Isaiah 65:17-25, Revelation 21:3-27, and also the Pauline doctrine of the participation of nature in the restoration of man as well as in his fall (Romans 8:20-22).
