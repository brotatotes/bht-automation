<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:14">2 Peter 3:14</span>. <strong> Wherefore, beloved, looking for these things, give diligence to be found in peace, spotless and unblameable in his sight. </strong> The ‘looking for’ (again the same term as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:12-13">2 Peter 3:12-13</span>) may give the reason for the duty which is enjoined, as it is understood by both the A. V. and the R. V. ‘seeing that ye look,’ etc.,; or (less probably), it may form a part of the duty, ‘look for these things and give diligence’ (Huther, etc.). As to the ‘give diligence’ see on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:10">2 Peter 1:10</span>. The ‘spotless is expressed by the adjective which is applied to Christ as the Lamb in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:19">1 Peter 1:19</span>, and the ‘unblameable’ by another form (which occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:15">Philippians 2:15</span>, where it is rendered ‘without rebuke’) of the adjective translated ‘without blemish’ in the same passage. Here the epithets represent the qualities which should distinguish the faithful as directly opposed to those which mark the false teachers, who have been described as ‘spots and blemishes’ (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:13">2 Peter 2:13</span>). It is supposed by some ( <em> e.g. </em> Alford) that the parable of the wedding garment was floating before the Apostle’s mind,’ especially as the statement in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:13">2 Peter 2:13</span> refers to <em> the feasts of </em> the early Christians. Some good expositors ( <em> e.g. </em> Huther) suppose that the writer deals here with what the readers were to be during their lifetime of expectation. But the use of the phrase ‘found’ (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>) points clearly to the time of Christ’s judicial return. They were to labour so to live that, when He appeared, they might be <em> discovered </em> or <em> adjudged </em> (such is the sense of the ‘found’) spotless and unblameable ‘in His sight,’ or ‘according to His judgment’ (so we should render what is incorrectly given as ‘found <em> of Him’ </em> in the A. V.); and this discovery or adjudgment should be ‘in peace.’ Where spotlessness and unblameableness form the verdict, the Lord’s controversy with His people will cease and the voice of judgment will be the voice of peace.
