<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:7">2 Peter 3:7</span>. <strong> but the heavens which now are and the earth by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved unto the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly men. </strong> The ‘which now are’ is in direct antithesis to ‘the then world.’ The form of the phrase also indicates that the world <em> </em> of which the writer has been speaking consists in his view of both heavens and earth. Instead of ‘by the <em> same </em> word’ there is another reading, ‘by <em> His </em> word,’ which is also weightily attested. But the sense is practically the same, namely, that the same creative Word of God which first made the old heavens and earth, and afterwards overwhelmed the order of things which it had constructed, is still the sovereign agency that maintains the present heavens and earth and prepares for them their future destiny. The ‘stored up’ gives the same idea as in the ‘ <em> treasurest up </em> unto thyself wrath,’ etc., in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:5">Romans 2:5</span>. The ‘for fire’ admits of being connected either with the ‘stored up’ or with the ‘reserved,’ but on the whole more naturally with the former as in the R. V., than with the latter as in the A. V. As to the ‘reserved’ see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:4">1 Peter 1:4</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:4">2 Peter 2:4</span>. The idea of ‘perdition,’ as the A. V. puts it, or ‘destruction,’ as the R. V. gives it, is expressed by the noun connected with the verb ‘perished’ in the previous verse, and has the same sense. The subjects of this ‘judgment and perdition’ are described definitely as ‘ <em> the </em> ungodly men’ the article pointing either to the mockers who are in the writer’s mind all through, or serving simply to mark off from men generally one particular class, namely, that of the <em> ungodly </em> or <em> impious. </em> As to the epithet see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:18">1 Peter 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span>. This statement on the destiny of the present system of things is the fullest and most precise of its kind in the N. T. It has parallels so far in the N. T. doctrine, in such passages as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:18">Matthew 5:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:24">Matthew 5:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29">Matthew 5:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:13">1 Corinthians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:8">2 Thessalonians 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:27">Hebrews 12:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:1">Revelation 21:1</span>. In speaking of fire as the agent in the second judicial destruction of the world, as water was in the first, it founds on the history of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah as typical of the final judgment of the impious, and on the O. T. conception of God as accompanied by fire when He comes forth to judge (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+1:3">Psalms 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+97:3">Psalms 97:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:15-16">Isaiah 66:15-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:24">Isaiah 66:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="da+7:9-10">Daniel 7:9-10</span>). Other O. T. passages ( <em> e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+102:26-27">Psalms 102:26-27</span></em>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="job+14:12">Job 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+34:4">Isaiah 34:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:6">Isaiah 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:22">Isaiah 66:22</span>) speak more generally of the passing away of the present system. And as the O. T. for the most part connects that event with the judgments of Jehovah and the day of His ‘recompense,’ Peter connects it with the day of Christ’s Coming. ‘The present form of the world is protected by God’s word of promise (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:11">Genesis 9:11</span>) against any recurring flood. Yet if it, too, is to perish, there remains now only fire as the element to bring about this destruction; and as, on the ground of Old Testament representations, the wrathful judgment of God is regarded as a consuming fire, it is easy to think that the destruction of the world resulting from the day of judgment will be brought about by fire in a special sense, for which this present form of the world is, so to speak, reserved’ (Weiss, <em> Bib. Theol. </em> ii. pp. 246, 247, Clark’s Trans.).
