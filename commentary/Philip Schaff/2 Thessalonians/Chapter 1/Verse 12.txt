2 Thessalonians 1:12.  That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you. This declares the purpose to be served by the fulfilment of his prayer for them. The meaning of the words has been explained above.  New  Christ may be glorified in us by obedience and patience,  then  by the results of these, perfected righteousness, ‘glory, honour, and immortality.’ He is glorified now in all who manifest how firmly they believe His word, how highly they esteem the holiness He exemplified, how profoundly they love Him. And they do so when they suffer without repining, and obey with alacrity and self-sacrifice.
