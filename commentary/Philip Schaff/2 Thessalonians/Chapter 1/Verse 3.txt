2 Thessalonians 1:3. Paul mentioned in his First Epistle (1 Thessalonians 3:9-13) that he ceaselessly prayed for the Thessalonians; he now acknowledges that his prayers were answered. We are as much bound to thank God for answering our prayers, as we are   to make known to Him our requests. Here we have an instance of the value and efficacy of intercessory prayer; of the aid we may render our friends when we are by circumstances, or by their condition, precluded from rendering any more direct assistance.
	 That your faith groweth exceedingly. This was cause of thankfulness in the case of the Thessalonians, because their circumstances were such as severely to try their faith, and it might have been expected to show symptoms of giving way. It is in every case subject of thankfulness, because as faith grows or decays, so grows or decays the whole spiritual life. It is to the inner life what the digestive organs are to the body. And it has laws of growth to which if we attend, it infallibly increases. If it be not increasing, it is decaying. For where there is immature life there must be growth. But ‘every being in nature, even every man and every people, reaches on the natural side a highest point, and then declines and goes towards death, whereas by Christ and His Holy Spirit is implanted in the individual and in humanity a germ of imperishable life, that does not decay.’
	 Toward each other. Their love was not an unpractical sentiment, a vague desire for the welfare of persons they had never seen, but it was a genuine and generous affection, a hearty and kindly and helpful goodwill towards the people of their own church, society, and households. The church to which an apostle can bear such testimony is to be congratulated.
