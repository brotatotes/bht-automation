 Salutation Thanksgiving for the Faith of the Thessalonian Church under Persecution, Assurance of Compensation, and Prayer for the perfecting of their Faith.
	Paul informs the Thessalonians of the emotions of gratitude and righteous pride which the increase of their faith and love had stirred in him. He promises, and shows that their faithful sufferings themselves promise, a glorious recompense at Christâ€™s coming; and prays that their faith and character generally may be perfected and made fit for this glorious destiny.
	2 Thessalonians 1:1-2, see notes on the First Epistle.
