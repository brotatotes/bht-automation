2 Thessalonians 2:15.  Therefore, brethren, stand fast. ‘It might seem as if, when election is spoken of, God had already done all, and nothing was left for man to do. The opposite inference is that of the apostle’ (Jowett). But the inference expressed in the word ‘therefore’ is not from the immediately preceding assurance, but from the whole account he has been giving of the future; and his meaning is: ‘Since these other events must precede the coming of Christ, be not shaken and troubled (2 Thessalonians 2:2) as if this coming were imminent, but  stand fast;  and that you may do so, do not listen to what every one says, but keep clearly in mind what I have communicated to you, and maintain your faith in that.’
