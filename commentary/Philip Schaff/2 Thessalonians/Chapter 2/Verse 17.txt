2 Thessalonians 2:17.  Everlasting consolation. Everlasting, in contrast to all other comforts which are liable to come to an end, to be confronted with emergencies for which they are insufficient. The word ‘consolation’ here indicates not so much the act of consoling as the ground of comfort.
	 Good hope.  ‘Good,   because of the pre-eminent excellence of the object of it, the impregnable basis on which it rests, and the purifying influence which it exerts in the heart and life’ (Lillie).
	 Through grace. Added to denote the manner of God’s giving: equivalent to ‘who graciously gave us,’ etc.
	2 Thessalonians 2:17.  Comfort. It is very worthy of remark, that both here and in the parallel instance (1 Thessalonians 3:11) the two persons, ‘the Lord Jesus and God the Father,’ are followed by a verb in the singular number. No reason can apparently be given for this except the unity of the Father and Son.
	 Stablish you. Comfort should result not only in the feeling of personal security, but in an unanxious and unselfish diligence in every good word and work. The energies which were frittered away in vain speculations and gloomy forebodings should now, when our future is provided for, be concentrated on the duty of the hour.
