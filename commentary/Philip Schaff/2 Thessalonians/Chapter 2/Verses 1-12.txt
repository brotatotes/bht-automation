 Instruction regarding the Coming of the Man of Sin, his Power, Falsneness, and Destruction.
	In order to remove the misunderstanding and allay the anxieties regarding our Lordâ€™s coming which had arisen from the First Epistle, Paul proceeds now to explain that previous to that great event certain others must occur. Especially he reminds the Thessalonians that the apostasy must first be developed, and that time must be allowed for the mystery of lawlessness to mature until it should finally culminate in the appearance of the Lawless One. The manner of his appearance is described and the destruction that awaits him foretold.
