<p><em> Exhortation suitable to those whom God has saved from Unbelief and Unrighteousness
	</em></p>
<p>Paul contrasts the condition and prospects of the believing Thessalonians with those persons of whom he has been speaking, who being habituated to untruth should fall victims to the deceit of the Man of Sin. He thanks God for them, exhorts them to stedfastness, and commends them to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
