2 Thessalonians 3:1.  Pray for us. Paul knew how to magnify his office, when occasion required: but in the apostle he never ceased to be a humble, natural, Christian man. He not only prays for his ‘children’ in Christ, but begs them to pray for him. But in another sense the man is absorbed in the apostle; if he seeks blessing for himself; it is to the end that the word of the  Lord may have free course. ‘It is after the manner of the apostle to put that as a wish for himself, which was a wish for the furtherance of the Gospel’ (Jowett). Paul felt his need of courage to race those who opposed the preaching of the Gospel, of constancy to avail himself of every opportunity to introduce it into new audiences, and again and again (see references) appealed to the churches to pray for him in connection with this matter. His joy in imprisonment was that the word of God was ‘not bound’ (2 Timothy 2:9); his desire, while he himself is threatened and opposed, is that the word may have free circulation (lit may run), may not be checked in its onward race, may extend everywhere
	 And be glorified, even as it is with you.  The word was glorified among the Thessalonians by their receiving it as the word of God and trusting it, as described in the beginning of the First Epistle. It was glorified by the manifest influence it had on their conduct, by the work of their faith and by their patience. Paul desires that it may elsewhere be similarly glorified, attaining its rightful position in men’s minds.
