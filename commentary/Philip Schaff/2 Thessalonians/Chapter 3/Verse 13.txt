<p><strong> Be not weary in well-doing.</strong> Do not be tempted to imitate the fanatical idleness of those around you do not weary of ‘the trivial round, the common task,’
	</p>
<p>do not crave for some great thing to do, be content that it is a good thing. In thus addressing them, Paul tacitly approves what they were already doing, and their diligence in it. For an admonition ‘not to weary can only be addressed to those who are working. And thus in so far as this injunction applies to all Christians, it takes for granted that they are so engaged in active Christian well-doing as to be in some danger of fatigue. The temptation to weary is the same now as it was in the early Thessalonian church; those who are actively engaged are tempted to say, Why should we do all, while so many do nothing; why must we compensate for their neglect? In the parallel passage in Galatians, Paul has in view the other great cause of weariness, viz. that the results of labour are often not immediately seen. And therefore he adds, ‘In due time ye shall reap, if ye faint not.’
