<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:3">2 Thessalonians 3:3</span>. <strong> But</strong> <strong> faithful is the Lord.</strong> The contrast between the mischievous opposition of wicked men and the protecting care of Christ, is sharpened by the slight and easy play on the word: men are faithless, but faithful is the Lord. Their faithlessness prompts them to hostility; but His faithfulness will alike prevent your faith from failing, and their efforts from being destructive.

<p><strong> Who shall stablish you and keep you from evil.</strong> Paul’s thoughts do not long dwell on his own dangers, but quickly pass to those which threatened his friends in Thessalonica. These dangers were twofold, as in all persecution. There was the inward danger of their faith failing under persecution, and there was the outward danger of injury to life and property. Against the first of these the Lord would protect them by ‘stablishing’ them; against the second, by ‘keeping them from the evil.’
