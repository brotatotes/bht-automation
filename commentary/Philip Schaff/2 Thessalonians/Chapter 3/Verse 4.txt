<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:4">2 Thessalonians 3:4</span>. This verse farther expresses the confidence which Paul felt that, by the faithfulness of the Lord, the Thessalonians would not be moved by persecution, but would boldly continue in the life to which he had introduced them, not fearing to carry out any of the commands he had laid upon them.

<p><strong> We have confidence in the Lord. </strong> ‘Here, as elsewhere, the apostle speaks of believing, hoping, doing all things <em> in Christ. </em> We lead an ordinary life, as well as a religious one; but with the apostle his ordinary life is his religious one, and hence he uses religious expressions in reference to all he says and does’ (Jowett).

<p><strong> That ye both do and will do.</strong> Under this expression of confidence, an injunction to further diligence is insinuated. It has been noted as characteristic of Paul, that he admonishes under the form of praise.
