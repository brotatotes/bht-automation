 Paul requests their Prayers, and exhorts them to Stedfastness
	In view of the opposition of spiteful and unbelieving men, Paul requests the Thessalonians to pray for him that he may be enabled to continue his work, and that nothing may avail to prevent the Gospel being preached and accepted. He reassures himself also by the consideration that though he cannot count all men his allies, the Lord is on His side; and on Him be relies for the furtherance of the Gospel, and for the edification of those in Thessalonica who already believe.
