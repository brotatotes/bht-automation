<p><em> Exhortations to Industry, and Directions regarding the Treatment of Idle and Disorderly Persons.
	</em></p>
<p>In this concluding paragraph of his Epistle, Paul warns the Thessalonians against neglecting their worldly occupations, and by idleness becoming dependent on others for a livelihood. He bids them also not only practise industry themselves, but enforce it upon all the members of the Church. He had heard that some of their number, probably through a misconception as to the nearness of Christâ€™s coming, had abandoned their ordinary work, and were disturbing the peace and hindering the welfare of the community. He authoritatively commands that such persons be first exhorted to quietness and industry, and if they should neglect such counsel, be suspended from church fellowship. Jowett observes that the paragraph is important, as bearing on the degree and manner of the authority which the apostle exercised over the churches.
