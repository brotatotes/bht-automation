<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:10">2 Timothy 1:10</span>. <strong> By the appearing.</strong> Remarkable as the only passage in the New Testament in which the word ἐπιφανεία <em> </em> (= manifestation) is applied to the Incarnation of our Lord. Elsewhere, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span>, 1Ti 6:14 , <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:1">2 Timothy 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span>, it is always used of the ‘appearing’ of the second Advent.

<p><strong> Hath abolished death. </strong> The verb is one of St. Paul’s favourite words, as <em> e.g. </em> in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:8">1 Corinthians 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:26">1 Corinthians 15:26</span>, and implies depriving of activity, annulling, bringing to nought. The selection of this special attribute of the work of Christ is determined, as was ‘the promise of life’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:1">2 Timothy 1:1</span>, by the wish to make Timothy see life and death in their true colours, so that he might not fear the one or cleave ignobly to the other. Christ has deprived death of its power (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:26">1 Corinthians 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:55">1 Corinthians 15:55</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>). It is no longer an enemy to be dreaded, but a friend to be welcomed.
	</p>
<p><strong> Brought to light.</strong> Better, ‘ <em> thrown light upon.’ </em> The idea is not that of dragging forth what had been hidden in darkness, but, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:5">1 Corinthians 4:5</span>, that of pouring in light He has illumined the true, higher life of man, which was previously clouded by the lower.
	</p>
<p><strong> Immortality. </strong> Better, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:42">1 Corinthians 15:42</span>, ‘ <em> incorruption’ </em> He is speaking, not of mere exemption from physical death, but of the permanent glorified state which is exempted from decay.
	</p>
<p><strong> Through the Gospel. </strong> Grammatically, the words may refer to both the preceding clauses, but it is better to connect them only with the second. Death was deprived of its sting by the single act of Christ. The Gospel of that death pours light upon the mystery of life.
