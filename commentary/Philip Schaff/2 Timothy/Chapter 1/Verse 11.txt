2 Timothy 1:11.  A preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. There is something characteristic in the way in which Paul the aged, here and in 1 Timothy 2:7, where we find the same combination, accumulates one word upon another to express the greatness of his vocation. He is at once the herald, the envoy, the instructor. In this way only does he allow himself to magnify his office.
