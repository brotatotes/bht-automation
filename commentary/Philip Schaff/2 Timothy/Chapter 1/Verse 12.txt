2 Timothy 1:12.  I also suffer these things. He assumes that the things of which he speaks are known to Timothy. They are at least sufficiently implied in the word ‘prisoner.’

	 To keep that which I have committed to him. The Greek (τὴν παραθήκην μου); literally, ‘  my deposit ’) is ambiguous, and may be rendered either as in the English Version, or as a possessive genitive, ‘that which has been committed to me.’ In the latter construction, it would have approximately the same meaning as in 2 Timothy 1:14 the life, natural or spiritual; the truth; the doctrine; the work, with which the apostle had been entrusted. God would guard His own work. The analogy of the word ‘keep,’ however, as applied to God, is in favour of the former construction; and then the ‘deposit’ may be thought of as including all that was most precious in the apostle’s eyes, his work, his own salvation, or, as an echo of the words spoken on the cross (Luke 23:46), the spirit which ne commended to his Father.
	 Against that day.  As in 2 Timothy 1:18, 2 Timothy 4:8, 2 Thessalonians 1:10, the great day of the Lord, the final Advent of the Christ.
