2 Timothy 1:14.  That good thing which was committed unto thee. Taken in connexion with the foregoing reference to the healthy or health-giving words, the phrase includes what has been technically called the ‘  depositum fidei;’  but it has, as in 2 Timothy 1:12, a wider range
	not the doctrine or the truth only, but all of which Timothy had been made, if one may so speak, the trustee,
	all spiritual gifts that he had himself received, and the Church committed to his charge.
	 Through the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.  The plural of the pronoun is generic, not personal of Paul and Timothy only. The apostle   assumes that the Holy Spirit is actually dwelling in all believers, enabling them to do that which by nature they cannot do.
