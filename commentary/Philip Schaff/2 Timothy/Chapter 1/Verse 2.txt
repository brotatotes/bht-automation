<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:2">2 Timothy 1:2</span>. <strong> My dearly beloved son.</strong> The change of epithet from the ‘ <em> true </em> son’ of the First Epistle may be only a casual variation without any conscious purpose. To the extent, however, in which we may trace in modern correspondence a variation of feeling in ‘yours faithfully’ and ‘yours affectionately, we may recognise a shade of difference here. There is the same warmhearted love. There is not, perhaps, the same entire confidence. He has seen signs of timidity and weakness which lead him throughout the Epistle to earnest and almost vehement exhortation. The rest of the salutation is as before.
