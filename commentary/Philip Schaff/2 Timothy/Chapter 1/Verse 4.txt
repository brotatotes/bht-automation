2 Timothy 1:4.  Remembering thy tears. The words clearly refer to their last parting, probably that referred to in 1 Timothy 1:3. There, with his mind dwelling on the duties to which Timothy had been called, it was natural not to refer to the personal emotions of that parting. Now that absence had increased the yearning desire to see him once again, and so ‘be filled with joy,’ it was as natural to dwell on it. It is characteristic of Timothy’s sensitive, emotional nature that the tears were shed by  him.
