<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:7">2 Timothy 1:7</span>. <strong> God hath not given. </strong> Better, ‘ <em> did not give.’
	</em></p>
<p><strong> The spirit of fear.</strong> Better, <em> ‘cowardice. </em> Here, again, in the use of so strong a word, we trace the desire of the apostle to rouse Timothy from what seemed to him an undue timidity.
	</p>
<p><strong> A sound mind.</strong> The Greek implies more than this (better, ‘ <em> discipline</em> ’), the gift of bringing others to the state so described; and it was in this that Timothy, with all his personal excellence, was defective.
