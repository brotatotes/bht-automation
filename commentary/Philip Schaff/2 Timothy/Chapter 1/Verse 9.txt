2 Timothy 1:9. The tram of thought obviously is: God has done so much for us. Shall we not at least do something for Him, if only by exercising the gifts He has bestowed on us? After his manner, once entering on the great theme, the writer is carried on by the fulness of his thoughts.
	 A holy calling,  i.e.  a calling, a summons, which implies holiness. This was not ‘according to our works,’ for they were by hypothesis, and in fact, unholy, but is referred to the purpose and the favour of God. And as no commencement in time could be ascribed to the Divine purpose, for that would imply change in the Unchangeable, this purpose, yes, and even the gift, must be thought of as belonging to periods beyond man’s power to measure; literally, ‘  before the times of ages  or  ages’  before the years of eternity.
