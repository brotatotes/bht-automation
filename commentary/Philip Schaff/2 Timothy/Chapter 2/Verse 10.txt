2 Timothy 2:10.  Therefore.  Better, ‘  for this reason,  so as to leave the English, like the Greek, to point either to what precedes or follows. Here the latter seems to give the preferable meaning, as in the like construction in 1 Timothy 1:16; Philemon 1:15. He is content to endure all things that God’s chosen ones may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus. The thought of the apostle is, that God has throughout the world those whom He has chosen to eternal life; that this election depends for its results on human instrumentality, and may be frustrated by human negligence. For their sake, whether already converted or waiting to be called, he is content to suffer whatever God appoints for him. Those sufferings are part of the agencies by which God is working out for them salvation now and eternal glory hereafter.
