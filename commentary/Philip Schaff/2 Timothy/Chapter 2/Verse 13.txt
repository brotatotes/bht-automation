2 Timothy 2:13.  If  we believe not.  The antithesis in the Greek is better expressed  by, ‘If we lose our faith. He still remains faithful.’  The special reference is of course to the words of Christ just cited. We may turn a deaf ear to them, refuse to believe them, but they will be found true at last. The faithfulness of Christ is pledged to the words of judgment as well as those of promise. The perfection of His nature excludes the thought of inconsistency or self-contradiction.
