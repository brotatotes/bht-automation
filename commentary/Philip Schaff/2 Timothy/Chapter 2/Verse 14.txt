2 Timothy 2:14.  Put them in remembrance.  No persons have been mentioned, but St. Paul clearly has in his mind the teachers who tend to strivings about words. A various reading of some authority gives, ‘Put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord; strive not about words,’ but the text is preferable.
	 But to the subverting.  The English ‘but,’ which has nothing answering to it in the Greek, introduces a touch of sarcasm. St. Paul says simply ‘  useful for nothing,’  working for the ruin of them that hear.
