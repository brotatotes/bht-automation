A various reading of some authority gives, ‘Put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord; strive not about words,’ but the text is preferable.

<p><strong> But to the subverting. </strong> The English ‘but,’ which has nothing answering to it in the Greek, introduces a touch of sarcasm. St. Paul says simply ‘ <em> useful for nothing,’ </em> working for the ruin of them that hear.
