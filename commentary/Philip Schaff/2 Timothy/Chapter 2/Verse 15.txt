<p><strong> Rightly dividing</strong>. The literal meaning, ‘ <em> cutting straight,</em> ’ admits obviously of many figurative applications, and the word has been referred accordingly to the work of the sculptor, the road-maker, the carpenter, the ploughman, the carver at table, the sacrificing priest. Of these, that of the ploughman seems to give the best meaning; but I am disposed to think that we may perhaps class this among the medical words with which these Epistles abound, and see in it a reference to the work of the surgeon, in which any deflection from the true line of incision might be perilous or even fatal. The reference in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:17">2 Timothy 2:17</span> to the gangrene or cancer seems to carry on the train of thought.
