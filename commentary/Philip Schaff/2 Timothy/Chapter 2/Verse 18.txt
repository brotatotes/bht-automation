<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:18">2 Timothy 2:18</span>. <strong> Saying that the resurrection is past already. </strong> In the absence of clearer evidence, we cannot speak with certainty of the nature of the error, but the words apparently point to a Gnostic idealizing, and therefore anti-Jewish, school of speculation. Probably caricaturing St. Paul’s own teaching (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span>), they taught that baptism or conversion was the true resurrection, and so came by a roundabout way to the same conclusion as the Sadducee. In so doing, St. Paul, as he had felt in arguing against a like error at Corinth, felt that they were overthrowing men’s faith and robbing them of their hope.
