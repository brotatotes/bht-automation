2 Timothy 2:19.  The foundation of God  standeth sure.  The Greek requires, ‘  The strong  (or  firm)  foundation of God stands fast.’  What is this ‘strong foundation’?

Every one who names the name of the Lord, who speaks of Christ as His Lord, and therefore calls himself a Christian, is bound by so doing to depart from iniquity. Though not a quotation, we may perhaps recognise an echo of the ‘Depart ye, depart ye’ of Isaiah 52:11.
