<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:25">2 Timothy 2:25</span>. <strong> Instructing. </strong> Better, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:6">Hebrews 12:6</span> and elsewhere, ‘ <em> chastising’ </em> or ‘ <em> correcting.’ </em> The word never means simple instruction, but always education and discipline, and is obviously used here in contrast to the ‘undisciplined’ questioning of the preceding verse.

<p><strong> If God peradventure. </strong> The Greek includes the idea of time, ‘ <em> If at some time or other God should give repentance</em>.’ Even in the work of opposing or correcting, the servant of Christ is to keep that possibility in view.

<p><strong> To the acknowledging of the truth. </strong> The verb is used in its older English sense of ‘knowing fully,’ rather than ‘confessing.’ As the error contemplated was one of false doctrine springing from corrupt life, so the remedial process was to begin at the beginning, first amendment of life, and then intellectual perception of the truth.
