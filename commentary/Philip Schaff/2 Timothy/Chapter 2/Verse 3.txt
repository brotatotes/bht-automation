<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:3">2 Timothy 2:3</span>. <strong> Endure hardness. </strong> The word is the same as that rendered in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:8">2 Timothy 1:8</span>, ‘be thou partaker of the afflictions.’ ‘ <em> Take thy share in hardships’ </em> would express its meaning. We lose the emphasis of repetition by the change of the English words.
