<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:6">2 Timothy 2:6</span>. <strong> The husbandman that laboureth. </strong> The Greek, which expresses the qualifying clause by <em> </em> a present participle, implies labour during the (harvest or vintage rather than in the earlier stages of growth. Thus taken, the precept is parallel to that of not muzzling the ox as he treads out the corn, and urges to persevering labour when the harvest is ready, <em> i.e. </em> when the ministerial work seems crowned with success, as well as during the preliminary work of planting or watering. The words probably refer to the actual practice of Jewish or Greek agriculture.
