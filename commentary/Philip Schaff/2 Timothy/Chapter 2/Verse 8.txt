2 Timothy 2:8.  Remember Jesus Christ.  The exhortation, seemingly so abrupt and unconnected, looks both before and after. Quoting words which were probably part of some formulated confession of faith, St. Paul calls on Timothy to remember the two great truths of the Resurrection and the Incarnation. If that remembrance were clear and strong, he could not fail to be ready to take his share of hardships; he would be ready also to take a firm stand against the false teachers who, by saying that the resurrection was past already, reduced both truths to the level of fantastic myths. Special stress is laid on ‘the seed of David’ as indicating that Jesus was a historical, not an ideal Messiah (comp. Romans 1:3).
