So we have ‘it is the last time’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span>, and St. Paul’s words implying that the end might come in the lifetime of the generation then living (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:51">1 Corinthians 15:51</span>). History has baffled that expectation, but the permanent truth remains that, as elsewhere, ‘prophecy hath springing and germinant accomplishments.’ So here, phenomena of evil, like those described by St. Paul, bring on one of those days of the Lord that are preludes of the final judgment.
