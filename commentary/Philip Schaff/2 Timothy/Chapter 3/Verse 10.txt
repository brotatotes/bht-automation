<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:10">2 Timothy 3:10</span>. <strong> Thou hast followed.</strong> Better, ‘ <em> thou didst follow</em>.’ <em> </em> The pronoun is emphatic, and the tense points to a definite time, probably that of Timothy’s early discipleship, which St. Paul had in his memory. It half suggests, too, what the English perfect almost excludes, that the apostle was looking on what he speaks of as belonging to a vanished past. It had been. Was the present like it?

<p><strong> Doctrine.</strong> ‘ <em> Teaching</em> ’ <em> </em> in its widest sense.
