2 Timothy 3:11. There is something at once natural and touching in the way in which the aged apostle goes back to the memories of the first missionary journey in which Timothy had known him. It is true that he did not then accompany him, but he must have known every incident of the persecutions recorded in Acts 13:14. The Antioch is, of course, that in Pisidia, and the fact that it is not mentioned as such is, so far as it goes, a proof of the naturalness and therefore of the genuineness of the letter. Persecution and then deliverance, that had been the course of his life then. He is confident that it will be so to the end.
