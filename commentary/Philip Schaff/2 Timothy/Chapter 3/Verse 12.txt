2 Timothy 3:12.  All that will live godly. The Greek is emphatic, ‘  all who purpose,’  ‘all whose will is ’ to live godly. The general axiom is clearly intended to remind Timothy that there is no test by which a man can satisfy himself whether he lives piously, so sure as the question whether he is or is not, in some way or other, persecuted.
