<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:12">2 Timothy 3:12</span>. <strong> All that will live godly.</strong> The Greek is emphatic, ‘ <em> all who purpose</em>,’ <em> ‘all whose will is</em> ’ to live godly. The general axiom is clearly intended to remind Timothy that there is no test by which a man can satisfy himself whether he lives piously, so sure as the question whether he is or is not, in some way or other, persecuted.
