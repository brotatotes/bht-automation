2 Timothy 3:3.  Truce-breakers. Better, ‘  implacable,’ not the persons who break a truce, but those with whom no truce can be made.
	 False accusers.  Better, ‘  slanderers,’   as in 1 Timothy 3:11.
	 Fierce.  More definitely, ‘  untameable ’ or ‘  inhuman.’
	 Despisers of them that are good. Better, ‘  having no love of good.’
