2 Timothy 3:8.  Jannes and Jambres. The names do not appear in the Pentateuch or elsewhere in the Old Testament. They are found in the Targum or Paraphrase of Exodus 7:11; Exodus 22:11, ascribed to Jonathan, and may represent either a fragment of decorative fiction or an unwritten tradition. According to one legend they were the sons of Balaam, who prophesied the birth of Moses, suggested the murder of the Hebrew infants, and were Pharaoh’s counsellors in all evil. As in the reference to Enoch in Jude 1:14, we see a free use of what we call uncanonical materials by way, not of proof, but illustration.
	 Of corrupt minds. As in 1 Timothy 6:5, though the Greek word is not quite the same, ‘  corrupted in their mind.’
	 Reprobate. In its strict sense, as ‘tried, found wanting, and  rejected.’
