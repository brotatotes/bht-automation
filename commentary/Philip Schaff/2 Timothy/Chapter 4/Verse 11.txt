2 Timothy 4:11.  Luke only is with me. Aristarchus, who is joined with Demas, Luke, and Mark in Colossians 4:10-14, Philemon 1:24, remains unaccounted for. Mark, it would seem, had been left with Timothy at Ephesus, having probably travelled thither in company with St. Paul. It is pleasant to note in this last mention of him the fullest recantation of the adverse opinion recorded in Acts 15:38. He is now ‘profitable’ (better, ‘  useful ’)   for the ministry.
