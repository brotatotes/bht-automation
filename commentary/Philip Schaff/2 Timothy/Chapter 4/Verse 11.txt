<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:11">2 Timothy 4:11</span>. <strong> Luke only is with me.</strong> Aristarchus, who is joined with Demas, Luke, and Mark in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10-14">Colossians 4:10-14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:24">Philemon 1:24</span>, remains unaccounted for. Mark, it would seem, had been left with Timothy at Ephesus, having probably travelled thither in company with St. Paul. It is pleasant to note in this last mention of him the fullest recantation of the adverse opinion recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:38">Acts 15:38</span>. He is now ‘profitable’ (better, ‘ <em> useful</em> ’) <em> </em> for the ministry.
