<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:12">2 Timothy 4:12</span>. <strong> Tychicus have I sent.</strong> Better <strong> ,</strong> ‘ <em> I sent</em>.’ <em> </em> In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:21">Ephesians 6:21</span>, we find Tychicus mentioned as the bearer of the Epistle to that Church. What St. Paul says may refer to that journey, but it is also probable that Tychicus had returned to him in Rome, and then been sent once more to Ephesus. The life of these evangelist messengers was one apparently of incessant movement.
