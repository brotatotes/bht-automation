2 Timothy 4:18.  Shall deliver me from every evil work.  That thought, deliverance from evil, whether within or without, is more precious to the apostle than any deliverance from danger. The words in the Greek remind one so strongly of the clause ‘Deliver us from evil’ in the Lord’s Prayer, that we may well think of this as an echo from the familiar form. So far as it is so, it is in favour of the general, rather than the personal, application of that petition. The doxology also, no less than the prayer, may come from the form as it was used liturgically. In any case, it is noticeable that here we have, beyond the shadow of a   doubt,   a doxology addressed to Christ as the Lord,  i.e.  the fullest recognition of his Divine nature.
