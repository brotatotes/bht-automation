<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:20">2 Timothy 4:20</span>. <strong> Erastus. </strong> Probably the same as the steward or chamberlain of Corinth mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span>, or possibly also, as the messenger sent into Macedonia from Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>).

<p><strong> Trophismus</strong>, One of St. Paul’s companions on the last journey to Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>), and described as an Ephesian.
	</p>
<p><strong> Miletum </strong> ought, of course, to be Miletus. This again indicates St. Paul’s route, from Ephesus to Miletus, from Miletus to Troas, thence to Macedonia.
