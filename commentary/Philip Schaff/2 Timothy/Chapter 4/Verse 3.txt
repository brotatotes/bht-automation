2 Timothy 4:3.  The time shall come. Better, ‘  there shall be a season.’ The Greek is the same word as ‘in season, out of season,’ and gives the reason for that command. Make the most of any season, whether good or bad, now, for before long you will find none willing to listen.
	 Sound doctrine.  Better, as in previous passages,  ‘healthy teaching’
	 Heap to themselves. The word is the same as the ‘laden’ of 2 Timothy 3:6, and was probably suggested by it.
