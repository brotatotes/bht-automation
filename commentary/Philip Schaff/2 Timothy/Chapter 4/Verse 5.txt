2 Timothy 4:5.  Watch thou. There is a special emphasis on the pronoun. ‘  Thou,   whatever others may do, shouldst watch.’
	 Endure afflictions.  The same word as in 2 Timothy 2:9.
	 Do the work of an evangelist. It is probable that the word was the formal designation of Timothy’s usual work, as it was of that of Philip (Acts 21:8). His present work at Ephesus was that of a Vicar-Apostolic on a special mission, but that was not to make him forgetful of his more normal duties.
	 Make full proof of. The English is expressive, but not more so than the literal  ‘fill up the measure  of thy ministry.’
