<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>. <strong> A crown of righteousness.</strong> Better, ‘ <em> the </em> crown.’ The force of the genitive may be either that perfect righteousness constitutes the crown, as ‘glory’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span>, and ‘life’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12">James 1:12</span>; or else, and perhaps preferably, that it is the crown belonging to righteousness. In any case it may be noted that, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:25">1 Corinthians 9:25</span>, it is the wreath of the victor in the games, not the crown or diadem of the king.

<p><strong> The Lord is,</strong> of course, the Lord Jesus.
	</p>
<p><strong> That day.</strong> The day of His appearing, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:12-13">2 Timothy 4:12-13</span>.

<p><strong> Not to me only.</strong> Confident as he now feels, his great joy is not that there is a special reward for himself, but that it will be given to all like-minded with him.

<p><strong> That love.</strong> Better, ‘ <em> that have loved</em>.’
