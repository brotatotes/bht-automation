2 Timothy 4:8.  A crown of righteousness. Better, ‘  the  crown.’ The force of the genitive may be either that perfect righteousness constitutes the crown, as ‘glory’ in 1 Peter 5:4, and ‘life’ in James 1:12; or else, and perhaps preferably, that it is the crown belonging to righteousness. In any case it may be noted that, as in 1 Corinthians 9:25, it is the wreath of the victor in the games, not the crown or diadem of the king.
	 The Lord is, of course, the Lord Jesus.
	 That day. The day of His appearing, as in 2 Timothy 4:12-13.
	 Not to me only. Confident as he now feels, his great joy is not that there is a special reward for himself, but that it will be given to all like-minded with him.
	 That love. Better, ‘  that have loved.’
