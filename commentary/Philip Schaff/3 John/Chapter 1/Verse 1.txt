I.  Address and Expression of Goodwill.
	3 John 1:1-2. Three men called Gaius, the Latin Caius, are mentioned by St. Paul, and one of them with the same acknowledgment of his large hospitality; but these lived in an earlier generation. Nothing is said as to his holding any office; he is beloved only, the ordinary term of Christian fellowship, though evidently used here in its strongest meaning,  whom I love in truth, and emphatically repeated in several verses. Instead of the ordinary greeting we have an expression of goodwill,  I wish, which however is really, as every Christian good wish must be, prayer to God (James 5:15).  Concerning all things must be connected with the prosper, or make good advancement; and one particular is singled out possibly because Gaius had been sick,  and be in health. The prosperity of the soul is the standard of all prosperity:  even as thy soul prospereth, or makes good advancement.
