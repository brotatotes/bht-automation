<p>I. <em> Address and Expression of Goodwill.
	</em></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:1-2">3 John 1:1-2</span>. Three men called Gaius, the Latin Caius, are mentioned by St. Paul, and one of them with the same acknowledgment of his large hospitality; but these lived in an earlier generation. Nothing is said as to his holding any office; he is beloved only, the ordinary term of Christian fellowship, though evidently used here in its strongest meaning, <strong> whom I love in truth</strong>, and emphatically repeated in several verses. Instead of the ordinary greeting we have an expression of goodwill, <strong> I wish</strong>, which however is really, as every Christian good wish must be, prayer to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:15">James 5:15</span>). </p>
<p><strong> Concerning all things</strong> must be connected with the prosper, or make good advancement; and one particular is singled out possibly because Gaius had been sick, <strong> and be in health</strong>. The prosperity of the soul is the standard of all prosperity: <strong> even as thy soul prospereth</strong>, or makes good advancement.
