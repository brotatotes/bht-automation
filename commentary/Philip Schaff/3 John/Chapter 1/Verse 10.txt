<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:10">3 John 1:10</span>. We mark here the same tone of faithful sternness which pervades the two other Epistles: in these, however, as against those who assailed the truth, in this against one who invades the order of the church. It is more than probable that Diotrephes was of the Judaizing faction which strove to thwart the publication of the Gospel to the Gentiles; and this would account for the apostleâ€™s severity. <strong> I will bring to remembrance</strong> before the church, <strong> his works which he doeth</strong>: not merely his <strong> prating against us with malicious words</strong>, as reported by the evangelists, but his actions, of more importance to the apostle than any words spoken against himself merely. <strong> He casteth them out</strong> who would receive the brethren: by using his influence to have them cut off from the Christian society, whether by formal excommunication or otherwise.
