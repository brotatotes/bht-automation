<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:9">3 John 1:9</span>. <strong> I wrote somewhat to the church</strong>: not meaning either important or unimportant, but touching the maintenance of the evangelists; this communication, probably intercepted by Diotrephes, is lost or superseded by the present Epistle. </p>
<p><strong> But Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them</strong>, the members of the church, <strong> receiveth us not</strong>: we know nothing about this man but what is contained in this graphic sketch of him. The evangelists had reported to St. John that neither his authority nor his letter was honoured by Diotrephes; that he rejected both, and spoke against the apostle publicly in a church which was almost entirely under his influence, being opposed by Demetrius and his selecter company, and Gaius keeping aloof probably through sickness.
