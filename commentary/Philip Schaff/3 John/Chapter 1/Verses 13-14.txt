<p>III. <em> Conclusion.
	</em></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:13-14">3 John 1:13-14</span>. We know not the issue of this Epistle. It was evidently written amidst circumstances which allowed no delay. Though the apostle would shortly visit the church of Gaius, Diotrephes, and Demetrius, he sends this message for the present emergency.

<p>3 John 1:15. <strong> Peace be to thee</strong>: the only instance of this personal formula in the New Testament. The <strong> friends salute thee</strong>: again the only instance of the brethren being called friends. <strong> Salute the friends by name</strong>: as if their names were mentioned. The familiar character of the letter may explain these peculiarities; but it must not be forgotten that these several terms carry us back to the Lord’s first use and sanctification of them. There can be no higher salutation than the PEACE which came up out of the Old Testament to receive its deeper meaning in the New. And the Epistles of the New Testament worthily end with Peace to the individual saint, and the Salutation of the Brethren who are also ‘the Friends’ of Jesus individually and by name.
