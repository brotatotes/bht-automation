3 John 1:3-4. The commendation of Gaius is first general: the apostle rejoices greatly to hear from brethren testimony to his interior religion,  unto thy truth, as it was openly shown,  even as thou walkest in truth. The apostle has no greater joy than  to hear that my children  the members of the Christian family specially committed to his care  are walking in the truth. Truth and love are in both these Epistles the twofold and yet one sphere of all religion. The love with its fruits follows in the next verse.
