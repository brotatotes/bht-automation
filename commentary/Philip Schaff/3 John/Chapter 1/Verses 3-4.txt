<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:3-4">3 John 1:3-4</span>. The commendation of Gaius is first general: the apostle rejoices greatly to hear from brethren testimony to his interior religion, <strong> unto thy truth</strong>, as it was openly shown, <strong> even as thou walkest in truth</strong>. The apostle has no greater joy than <strong> to hear that my children </strong> the members of the Christian family specially committed to his care <strong> are walking in the truth</strong>. Truth and love are in both these Epistles the twofold and yet one sphere of all religion. The love with its fruits follows in the next verse.
