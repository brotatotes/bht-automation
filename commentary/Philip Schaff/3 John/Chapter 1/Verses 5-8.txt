<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:5-8">3 John 1:5-8</span>. <strong> Thou doest a faithful work</strong>: the labour of Gaius’ love is said to be faithful, as corresponding with the commandment of love and true to it. </p>
<p><strong> Towards the brethren, and moreover strangers</strong>: not both brethren and strangers, but, as the sequel shows, brethren who came from abroad. ‘Thou doest’ marks that the conduct of Gaius is supposed to be habitual, though a special instance had been brought before the apostle. </p>
<p><strong> Who bare witness to thy love before the church</strong>: being evangelists, they gave an account of their travels in the presence of the church where the apostle dwelt; and returning to Gaius for further travels, they are commended to him for further support; to be <strong> set forward worthily of God</strong>, their Master and the Head of their cause. Then follows a tribute to the dignity of their work, and the high claim it gave them. <strong> For the sake of the Name</strong>, the name of Christ who is God, <strong> they went forth</strong>, from the church into the world, though in a very different sense from the going out of the antichrists (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:19">1 John 2:19</span>), <strong> taking nothing of the Gentiles</strong>: this is stated as their fixed principle, to receive nothing from the
	</p>
<p>Gentiles as such, <strong> before they were formed into</strong> churches; but it contains no maxim for the missionary work generally. It is introduced here for the sake of what follows. <strong> We therefore ought to support such, that we may be fellow-workers with them for the truth</strong>: an important sentence, as showing that they who provide of their substance for the maintenance of the labourer are partakers of his work.
