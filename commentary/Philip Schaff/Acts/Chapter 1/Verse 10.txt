Acts 1:10.  Two men stood by them in white apparel.  Ewald suggests these two were Moses and Elias, as in the transfiguration; but had this been the case, St. Luke would surely have referred to it: they were two angels, who probably had an especial charge connected with Messiahâ€™s work on earth. St. John tells us of two angels in white who were keeping watch in the sepulchre where the body of Jesus had lain (John 20:12). St. Luke also (Acts 24:4) writes of two angels in the form of men in shining garments in the empty sepulchre.
