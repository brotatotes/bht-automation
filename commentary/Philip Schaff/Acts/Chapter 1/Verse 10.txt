St. John tells us of two angels in white who were keeping watch in the sepulchre where the body of Jesus had lain (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:12">John 20:12</span>). St. Luke also (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:4">Acts 24:4</span>) writes of two angels in the form of men in shining garments in the empty sepulchre. </p>
