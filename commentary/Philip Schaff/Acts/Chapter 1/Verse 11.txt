Acts 1:11.  Why stand ye gazing up into heaven?  The angels, while comforting them with the solemn assurance He  would  return to earth again, still gently reprove these loving followers of Jesus, who remained gazing upwards, not without a hope He might reappear. Their duty now was not quiet contemplation and still waiting, but real earnest work; it is a reproof which belongs to all ages of the Christian Church.
