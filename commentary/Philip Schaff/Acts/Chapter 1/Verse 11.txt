<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:11">Acts 1:11</span>. <strong> Why stand ye gazing up into heaven? </strong> The angels, while comforting them with the solemn assurance He <em> would </em> return to earth again, still gently reprove these loving followers of Jesus, who remained gazing upwards, not without a hope He might reappear. Their duty now was not quiet contemplation and still waiting, but real earnest work; it is a reproof which belongs to all ages of the Christian Church.
