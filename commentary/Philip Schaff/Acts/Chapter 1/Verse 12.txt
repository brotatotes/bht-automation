<p><em> Return of the Disciples to Jerusalem, </em> 12-14.
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:12">Acts 1:12</span>. <strong> From the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath day’s journey. </strong> Our Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:50">Luke 24:50</span>) had led out His disciples from the city as far as Bethany, had blessed them and ascended into heaven; but Bethany was about twice a Sabbath day’s journey from Jerusalem. This discrepancy is, however, only apparent; for the suburb of Jerusalem called Bethphage, which lay between the city and Bethany, was legally counted as part of Jerusalem. So the distance for the Sabbath day’s journey would be reckoned from the point where the suburb Bethphage ended, to the spot on the Mount of Olives in the Bethany district where the ascension took place (see a long and exhaustive note of Wordsworth on ‘The Place of the Ascension’).
