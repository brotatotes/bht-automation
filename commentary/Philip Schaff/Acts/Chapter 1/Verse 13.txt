Acts 1:13.  Into an upper room.  Some have supposed this was an apartment in the temple, arguing from the words of the last verse of St. Luke’s Gospel, ‘And were continually in the temple praising and blessing God.’ It is hardly likely that the priests, bitterly hostile as they were to Jesus, would have allowed His followers the use of any room in the temple. It was very probably the same chamber in which the last Supper had been eaten.  Where abode,  etc. This is the fourth catalogue of the apostles given in the New Testament. In this one the place occupied by Judas is vacant (see Matthew 10:2; Mark 3:11; Luke 6:14). Each of the four lists varies slightly in the order in which the names are given, and several of the apostles are mentioned under different names in the several lists. The reason for this last enumeration is evidently to introduce the subject of the election of Matthias to fill the place Judas vacated.
