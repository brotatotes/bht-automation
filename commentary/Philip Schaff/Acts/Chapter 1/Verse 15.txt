Various reasons have been suggested for this priority which St. Peter certainly possessed among his brother apostles. ‘He was the first called’ ‘(Cyprian).’ He was the eldest (Jerome).  ‘ He earned this priority by his ready confession of faith in Christ’ (Hilary). But that it was only a  priority  he possessed, not an  authority,  over the rest of the apostles, the testimony of the early Fathers, Greek as well as Latin, most amply shows. Peter in the early Church, from this age, from the personal friendship he had enjoyed with his Master, no doubt occupied one of the chief positions; but he shared his rank with Stephen, the first great Christian orator, during that martyr’s short but brilliant career; with James, the Lord’s brother, who was undoubtedly the head of the Jewish Christians; and later, with St. Paul, to whom the great missionary work outside of the Holy Land was entrusted.
