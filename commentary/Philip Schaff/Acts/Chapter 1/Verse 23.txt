<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:23">Acts 1:23</span>. <strong> Joseph, called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</strong> Eusebius, quoting from Papias (second century), relates of this Joseph that he drank a deadly poison, but through the grace of God experienced nothing injurious ( <em> H. E. </em> iii. 39). He and also Matthias probably belonged to the number of the seventy disciples. Nicephorus writes of Matthias that he afterwards preached the gospel and suffered martyrdom in Ethiopia. Some apocryphal writings of little credit in the early Church bore his name.
