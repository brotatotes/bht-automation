<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:24">Acts 1:24</span>. <strong> And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two men thou hast chosen.</strong> There is no doubt that this prayer was addressed to the glorified and risen Lord, for (1) in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:21">Acts 1:21</span> Jesus is termed <em> Lord </em> ( ὁ ϰύριος ), to which αύτοῡ <em> , His </em> (resurrection), in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span> refers; whence it appears that ϰύριε , <em> Lord, </em> in this 24th verse is naturally to be referred to Jesus also. (2) The selection of the twelve apostles is always ascribed to Jesus Christ. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:2">Acts 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13">Luke 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:70">John 6:70</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:18">John 13:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:16">John 15:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:19">John 15:19</span>.

<p>Against this view it has been urged (see Meyer and De Wette’s <em> Commentaries on Acts) </em> that the epithet ϰαρδιογνῶετα <em> , which knowest the heart, </em> is not one which properly belongs to Jesus Christ; but surely this can hardly be advanced in the face of such statements as are con-tamed in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:50">John 1:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:25">John 2:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:64">John 6:64</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:17">John 21:17</span>, in which passages Jesus especially comes before us <em> as one before whom all hearts are open, all desires known.
