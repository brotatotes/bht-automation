Acts 1:24.  And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two men thou hast chosen. There is no doubt that this prayer was addressed to the glorified and risen Lord, for (1) in Acts 1:21 Jesus is termed  Lord  ( ὁ ϰύριος ), to which αύτοῡ  , His  (resurrection), in Acts 1:22 refers; whence it appears that ϰύριε ,  Lord,  in this 24th verse is naturally to be referred to Jesus also. (2) The selection of the twelve apostles is always ascribed to Jesus Christ. Compare Acts 1:2; Luke 6:13; John 6:70; John 13:18; John 15:16; John 15:19. See also Liddon,  Bampton Lectures,  vii. ‘Homoousion.’
	Against this view it has been urged (see Meyer and De Wette’s  Commentaries on Acts)  that the epithet ϰαρδιογνῶετα  , which knowest the heart,  is not one which properly belongs to Jesus Christ; but surely this can hardly be advanced in the face of such statements as are con-tamed in John 1:50; John 2:25; John 6:64; John 21:17, in which passages Jesus especially comes before us  as one before whom all hearts are open, all desires known.
