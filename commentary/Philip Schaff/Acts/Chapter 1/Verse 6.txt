<p><em> The Last Interview with the Disciples, 6-8.
	</em></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:6">Acts 1:6</span> <em> .</em> <strong> When they therefore were come together. </strong> This is a different meeting from that related above (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:4-5">Acts 1:4-5</span>). That <em> </em> was in the house where they partook of a meal together. This <em> </em> is the last interview with the Risen One on the Mount of Olives, which was closed by the ascension.

<p><strong> Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? </strong> Whether or no they knew that the end of their earthly intercourse with their Master was come, is uncertain. They felt, however, that <em> this </em> was in some way a peculiarly solemn meeting together; hence their question ‘at this time,’ signifies ‘at once,’ ‘now,’ or perhaps it looks forward a little and takes in the lifetime ‘will it be restored in our lives?’ What they understood by restoration of the kingdom is not quite clear; perhaps they hardly knew themselves. Their old views respecting a return of the golden age of David and Solomon had received a terrible shock by the crucifixion of their Master; but the resurrection and His promise of the Spirit had inspired them with new and even grander hopes.
