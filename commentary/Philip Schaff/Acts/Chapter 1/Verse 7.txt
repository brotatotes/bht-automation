<p><strong> It is not for you to know the times and the seasons which the Father hath put in his own power. </strong> In <strong> </strong> spite of this warning, many of the Church’s noblest servants in different ages, from the age of the apostles to our own days, have tried to fix these times; surely these ever recurring mistakes should call men back to consider the last words of the Lord whenever these vain attempts are made to fix times and seasons for the great restoration of all things. That day and that hour is known to the Father only.
