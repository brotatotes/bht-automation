Acts 1:8.  But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you  .  The Lord again referred to that new power which should descend upon them which He had before promised them, and told them how, armed with this new strength, they should be His witnesses not only in the city and Holy Land, but to the isles of the Gentiles to the uttermost parts of the earth.
