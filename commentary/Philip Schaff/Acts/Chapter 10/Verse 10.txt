<p>In St. Peter’s apologetic statement at Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:5">Acts 11:5</span>) he says nothing of the hour of the day, of the house-top, or of the preparation for his meal. These were circumstantial details, which were of no special moment then. His business then was to state the manner of these Divine revelations to him, which he did minutely. These circumstantial details, however, are of high importance in the direct narrative. They add to its life and reality, and they constitute part of the process through which Peter was brought to his new state of mind. It is to be observed, on the other hand, that St. Peter did very expressly state at Jerusalem that he was engaged in <em> prayer </em> when he fell into the trance. To the ‘apostles and elders’ this would be an argument of the utmost force. For, with all their prejudices, they knew that prayer was the appointed path towards Divine enlightenment, and the appointed help for the discharge of duty.

<p><strong> He fell into a trance.</strong> Literally, ‘an ecstasy ( ἔκστασις ) <em> </em> came upon him.’ The true reading is ἐγένετο , <em> </em> not ἐπίπεσεν . His own words at Jerusalem are, ‘In an ecstasy I saw a vision.’ This preternatural state of mind in which Peter saw the allegorical vision is to be contrasted with the full retention of his natural faculties with which Cornelius saw the angel (see note above on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:3">Acts 10:3</span>). Chrysostom says of Peter’s trance or rapture that ‘the soul, so to speak, was withdrawn from the body’ (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:1-3">2 Corinthians 12:1-3</span>).
