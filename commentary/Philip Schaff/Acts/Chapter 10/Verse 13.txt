The voice addresses him by name, as in the cases of Moses (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:4">Exodus 3:4</span>), Samuel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1sa+3:10">1 Samuel 3:10</span>), Cornelius (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:3">Acts 10:3</span>), and St. Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:4">Acts 9:4</span>).

<p><strong> Kill and eat.</strong> In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:7">Acts 11:7</span>, in the Authorised Version, we have ‘slay and eat,’ but in the Greek original the words are the same.
