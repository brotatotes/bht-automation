<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:19">Acts 10:19</span>. <strong> While Peter thought on the vision. </strong> This gives renewed emphasis to what is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:17">Acts 10:17</span>. This phrase is stronger. He was silently pondering on the vision and revolving it in his mind. In the former case the historian had simply named the fact of the arrival of the messengers coincidently with the waking of Peter from the vision and the beginning of his perplexity. Of their arrival, or indeed of their existence, he himself knew nothing at present. But he is now to be informed by a special revelation of their coming. How great an impression the coincidence actually made on his mind, when he did know of their coming at this moment, we see from what he said at Jerusalem afterwards (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:11">Acts 11:11</span>). It is enough simply to quote the words: ‘And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Cæsarea unto me.

<p>As to Peter’s state of mind at this moment, he could not doubt that what he had seen was intended for some Divine instruction. That the distinction of animals was now on the highest authority abolished, may have been made clear to him. The remembrance of his Lord’s words in connection with <em> men </em> may dimly have suggested something further. It should be observed that, whereas the first voice from heaven directed him to eat, the second spoke generally of a great principle. The vision had been linked on at the beginning to his own sense of hunger. Now at its close it is to be linked on to new outward circumstances. This connection is to be established in the most emphatic and commanding way. But he is to be assured and led on step by step. Only gradually is he brought from doubt to certainty. He does not know all till he reaches the house of Cornelius.

<p><strong> The Spirit said unto him.</strong> Thus it is that he is first informed of the arrival of the three men. This is a cardinal point in the narrative. We should note here, with the utmost care, that direct agency of the Holy Spirit which is made so prominent in the Acts of the Apostles. So truly is this a characteristic of the book, that it has been termed ‘the Gospel of the Holy Ghost.’ And what is conspicuous throughout, is pre-eminently a feature of this part of the sacred history, with which we are now occupied. See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:45">Acts 10:45</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:15">Acts 11:15</span>. It is incumbent on us to mark what stress St. Peter himself lays on the direct interposition of the Holy Spirit at this point, and how emphatically he records it at Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:12">Acts 11:12</span>), though in other respects he condenses the story. For instance, the κατάβηθι of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:20">Acts 10:20</span> does not appear in his own narrative. His having been on the housetop was an accident as to the religious meaning of the event. But the admonition of the Holy Spirit was vital.

<p><strong> Behold, three men seek thee. </strong> Here is his first intimation of the outward circumstances which are to be connected with his vision. This is the next step in his instruction; and it is given in the simplest and most rudimentary form. Who the men were, and whence they came, and on what errand, he is to learn afterwards.
