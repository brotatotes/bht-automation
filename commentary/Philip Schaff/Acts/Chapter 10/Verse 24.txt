Acts 10:24.  The morrow after.  The Greek word is the same as in Acts 10:9; Acts 10:23. The same remark may be made on the distance and time as on Acts 10:9. All is naturally consistent. The journey was by land. When two voyages by sea between Troas and Neapolis are named (Acts 16:11-12; Acts 20:6), the time occupied in one case was two days, and in the other five. This too is quite natural.
	 Cornelius waited for them.  More literally, ‘was waiting for them.’ He knew the time which would probably be occupied by the two journeys, and when he might expect to see his messengers, if their errand had been successful, along with that ‘Simon whose surname was Peter,’ who had been so mysteriously yet so definitely pointed out in the vision. The phrase seems to imply, if not impatience, yet serious anxiety, mingled with confidence.
	 His kinsmen and near  friends. From the 27th verse we learn that there were ‘many’ that were thus ‘come together;’ and their large number seems to have surprised Peter. Taking this into account, we see here very distinctly a new indication of the character of Cornelius. His good influence was widely diffused around him, and he was desirous that all whom he knew should share the blessing granted to himself. Alexander says here, ‘As this would hardly have been done without some preparation or predisposition upon the part of these friends, it would seem to imply a previous work of grace among these Gentiles, leading them to Christ, even before they came in contact with His Gospel or His messenger.’ Stier says: ‘This kindly, simple-hearted, and loving believer, is shown to us more and more as the centre and head of a considerable circle of pious Gentiles in Caesarea, which city was now to be favoured by being the seat of the first Gentile church.’ The ‘kinsmen’ were probably few; but the mention of them appears to prove that Cornelius had an established domestic life in Cæsarea.
