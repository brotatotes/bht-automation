Acts 10:26.  Stand up: I myself also am a man.  We are at once reminded of the horror expressed by Paul and Barnabas, when the attempt was   made at Lystra to give them Divine homage (Acts 14:14), and of the repudiation of this kind of homage by the angel in St. John’s vision (Revelation 22:8-9); and we necessarily contrast with all this our Lord’s calm acceptance of such worship, as is recorded more than once in the Gospel History.
