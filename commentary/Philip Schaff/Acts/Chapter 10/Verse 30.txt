<p><em> Statement by Cornelius in his own house, </em> 30-33.
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:30">Acts 10:30</span>. <strong> Four days ago. </strong> Questions have been raised as to the meaning of this phrase. But the simplest meaning is the best. It was exactly four days since Cornelius had seen the vision.
	</p>
<p><strong> I was fasting. </strong> It is from this place only that we learn that Cornelius was fasting as well as praying on this occasion. It is a circumstance of the history, attention to which ought by no means to be neglected. We find in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2-3">Acts 13:2-3</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</span>, a similar combination of fasting with prayer on occasions of great solemnity and responsibility. It may be added that Cornelius, in this state of abstinence, was the less likely to be deceived. The fasting had reference only to the day of the vision, not to the three previous days also.
	</p>
<p><strong> Until this hour. </strong> Probably this was the sixth hour, when the mid-day meal would naturally be taken (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:9">Acts 5:9</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> At the ninth hour. </strong> See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:3">Acts 10:3</span>.
	</p>
<p><strong> I prayed, </strong> literally, ‘I was praying.’ It is not expressly said before (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:3">Acts 10:3</span>) that he was occupied in this way at the moment.
	</p>
<p><strong> In my house. </strong> This is part of the vividness of the personal narrative given by Cornelius himself. In the account given by St. Luke above, it is said that the centurion saw the angel ‘coming in to him.’ Another remark may be added, that though Cornelius never heard the sermon on the Mount, he is seen here practising what is there enjoined as to private prayer.
	</p>
<p><strong> Behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing. </strong> Here, again, are three particulars, all of which may be classed together under the general head of the vividness with which Cornelius describes what had happened to himself. The exclamation ‘Behold’ is not found in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:3">Acts 10:3</span>, nor is it there said that the angel ‘stood.’ The description given .by Cornelius himself of that which he saw was, that it was ‘a man in bright clothing.’
