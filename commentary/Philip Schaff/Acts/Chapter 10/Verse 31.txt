<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:31">Acts 10:31</span>. <strong> Thy prayer is heard. </strong> In the actual words of the angel ‘prayer’ is mentioned before ‘alms;’ whereas in the direct narrative (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:2">Acts 10:2</span>), ‘alms’ are mentioned before the ‘prayers.’ Moreover, two separate verbs are used in this place. It is to be observed further that ‘prayer’ here is in the singular. It seems fair to infer that he was praying here for Divine illumination. This ‘prayer’ was perhaps the crisis and consummation of many previous ‘prayers.’
