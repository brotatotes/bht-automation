<p><strong> We are all here present before God. </strong> Both in this phrase and in that which follows, ‘all things that are commanded thee <strong> </strong> of God,’ we have evidence of the deeply reverential and attentive attitude of the mind of Cornelius. We must remember that he does not at all know what Peter will have to say to him. Of this only he is sure, that he is on the eve of learning what he had lone been anxious to know, and had earnestly prayed to be taught.
