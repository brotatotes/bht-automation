Acts 10:4.  Looking on him and becoming afraid.  The first of the phrases used here is exactly that which Peter uses (Acts 11:6) to describe his own earnest attention to what appeared to him at Joppa. There is no part of the description of Peter’s trance corresponding with what we read here of the ‘fear’ of Cornelius.
	 For a memorial before God.  In what sense are we to understand that the prayers and alms of Cornelius became a μνημο ́ συνον in the presence of God? Some answer to this question is given by Acts 10:31, where the equivalent expression is ‘are remembered ( ε ̓ μνη ́ σθησαν ) in the presence of God.’ He was now manifestly to be ‘remembered.’ It was no longer to appear as if he was forgotten. Perhaps he had prayed long. He had shown his faith by his prayers; and further proof had been given by his charity. And now all this was to be openly recollected and rewarded: a record had been entered in heaven, so that an answer should come in due season. The language is similar to that which is used by the LXX. in reference to the burnt-offering in Leviticus 2:2. The ‘prayers and alms’ of Cornelius expressed what a Hebrew sacrifice expressed; and they were registered in heaven accordingly (see Hebrews 13:16). They were proofs that grace was really working in the heart of Cornelius; and they were in due time acknowledged.
