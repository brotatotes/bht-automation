Acts 10:41.  Not to all the people. Alexander’s remark here is just, that to commit the testimony to select eye-witnesses was ‘more in keeping with the dignity and glory of the risen Saviour, which would now have been degraded by the same promiscuous and unreserved association with men, that was necessary to His previous ministry;’ and he adds: ‘The very fact that no such public recognition of His person is recorded, though at first it might have seemed to detract from the evidence of His resurrection, but serves to enhance it, by showing how free the witnesses of this event were from a disposition to exaggerate or make their case stronger than it was in fact.’
	 Witnesses chosen before of God. ‘Witnesses, namely those who had been previously appointed by God.’ Again there is reference to the Divine regulation of everything that related to the first proclamation of the gospel.
	 Who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead. It is a fancy of Bengel that the eating and drinking with Christ, here referred to, took place before the Crucifixion. But we must follow the natural order of the words. The facts here stated belong to the period of the Great Forty Days. Both St. Luke and St. John give instances.
