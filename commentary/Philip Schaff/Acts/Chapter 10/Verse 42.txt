<p><strong> Ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.</strong> Again the Lord Jesus, and in a more awful manner, is set forth in the position of supreme dignity. His judicial work is made prominent here, as in St. Paul’s address to heathen listeners at Athens (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:31">Acts 17:31</span>). It is an appeal to the natural conscience. The absolutely universal expression ‘the quick and dead,’ including both Jews and Gentiles, is in harmony with the whole occasion.
