<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:43">Acts 10:43</span>. <strong> To him give all the prophets witness. </strong> It would be quite perverse to object here that no explicit reference of this kind is found in each several prophet of the Old Testament. St. Peter alludes to the general class of the prophets, and to the general drift of their writings. Some knowledge of the prophetic scriptures was, doubtless, possessed by Cornelius and his friends. It is observable, at the same time, that more stress is laid in this speech on the evidence from miracles than on the evidence from prophecy.

<p><strong> Whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.</strong> These concluding words of St. Peter’s speech, here arrested by a Divine interruption, deserve the utmost attention. The language is absolutely universal, including Jews and Gentiles alike. It is, of course, implied that all men equally need this forgiveness. The doctrine of justification by faith could not be more clearly set forth. Compare St. Peter’s own words, on a later occasion, with what now occurred at Cæsarea (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:9">Acts 15:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:11">Acts 15:11</span>). We must add that there is great beauty and tenderness in St. Peter’s passing from the contemplation of Christ as a Judge, to the contemplation of Him as a Redeemer.
