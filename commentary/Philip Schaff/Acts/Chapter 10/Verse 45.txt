Acts 10:45.  They of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter. The expression in the original is very strong. They were almost out of their mind with wonder. As to the persons whose wonder here forms so prominent a part of the scene, see Acts 10:23 and Acts 11:12.
