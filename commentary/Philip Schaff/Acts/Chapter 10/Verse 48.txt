<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:48">Acts 10:48</span>. <strong> He commanded them to be baptized. </strong> St. Peter did not administer the baptism himself. This was in harmony with the practice of St. Paul, who seems to have been very anxious lest baptism or any outward ordinance should be unduly elevated in comparison with the preaching of the Word. See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:17">1 Corinthians 1:17</span>. On such an occasion as that which is recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:41">Acts 2:41</span>, there must have been a large amount of subsidiary ministration. How many persons were baptized on this occasion at Cæsarea we do not know.

During this short residence at Cæsarea, he must have learnt much that he never knew before concerning the Gentile mind, especially in its aspirations after religious light and peace.
