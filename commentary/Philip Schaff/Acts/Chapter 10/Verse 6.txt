<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:6">Acts 10:6</span>. <strong> With one Simon a tanner. </strong> This, again, is part of the minute exactitude conspicuous throughout the narrative. Even this is repeated by Cornelius (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:32">Acts 10:32</span>) when he relates his experience to St. Peter (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:43">Acts 9:43</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:17">Acts 10:17</span>).

<p><strong> Whose house is by the</strong> <strong> sea-side. </strong> Here is the first intimation of the position of Simon’s house. This circumstance is not stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:43">Acts 9:43</span>. Its reiteration by Cornelius (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:32">Acts 10:32</span>), when he makes his own statement, is another proof of the definite nature of his vision. Thus the phrase is seen to have a true importance in the narrative. As to the position of Simon’s house, this might have some reference to the convenience of the trade exercised by Simon. Moreover, he may have been forced to live there, because of some ceremonial uncleanness connected in the Jewish mind with the exercise of that trade. It is a direction of the Mischna that dead bodies, sepulchres, and tanyards are ‘to be at least fifty cubits from the city.’ Thus the very position of Peter’s lodging may have had something to do with the preparation of his mind for the startling duty that lay before him. At all events, his temporary home at Joppa was not a place of any distinction and honour; and this, too, is significant.

<p><strong> He shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do. </strong> These words ought to be absent. The authority of the MSS. is decisive on this point. Probably they crept into the text from a reminiscence of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:6">Acts 9:6</span>, under the feeling that there are strong resemblances, in some respects, between the records of the conversions of Cornelius and St. Paul. It is clear, however, from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:14">Acts 11:14</span>, that some words to this effect were spoken by the angel to Cornelius (see the notes on these verses).
