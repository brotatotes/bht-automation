This would include ‘the vision, the Divine command, and the expected revelation.’ It might be asked why Cornelius did not send a letter to Peter, as Claudius Lysias did to Felix (Acts 23:25). It has been suggested that Cornelius probably could not write, but it is more to the purpose to remember that he had not been in any official or personal relations with Peter, that, in fact, he knew only his name and his temporary residence. His best course was to tell the whole story to messengers thoroughly trustworthy and like-minded with himself, and to leave them to discharge their errand according to their judgment. How they actually did perform this duty we see below (Acts 10:22). The manner of communication of Cornelius with the messengers exemplifies the confidence which subsisted between him and those who surrounded him in daily life, and thus affords a further illustration of his character.
