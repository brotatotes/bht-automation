 Journey from Joppa and Reception by Cornelius, 23-29.
	 On the morrow,   i.e.  after the arrival of the messengers. No time was lost. On the other hand, there was no undignified haste. This was not a case for excitement, but for deliberate action. Moreover, some preparation for the journey was requisite, as well as some arrangements with those who were to accompany Peter.
	 Certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.  From Acts 10:45 we learn that these companions of the apostle were ‘of the circumcision:’ and   from Acts 11:12 we learn that they were ‘six’ in number. How far Peter intentionally took them, in order that they might be witnesses of all the circumstances of this transaction, we cannot tell. At all events it was part of God’s plan that their testimony should be in readiness, and that it should be used. We find that they afterwards went to Jerusalem, and there confirmed the statement made by St. Peter. As Stier remarks: ‘How rightly, and in what harmony with God’s guidance, he acted, the sequel soon shows’ (Reden  der Apostel,  i. 13).
	The imagination dwells on the incidents of this journey from Joppa to Cæsarea, and speculates on the conversation which took place among the ten travellers. With the apostle were three Gentiles, one of them a Roman soldier, and six Jewish converts to Christianity. The mere thought of this company and this journey communicates to the line of coast between these two towns an extraordinary interest.
