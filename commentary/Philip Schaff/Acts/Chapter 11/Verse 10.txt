Acts 11:10.  All were drawn up again into heaven.  The Greek is ἅπαντα . There is more life in the phrase than in what we find in Acts 10:16. The whole of what was seen in the vision disappeared by being carried up into heaven. Here, too, the word is α ̓ νεσπα ́ σθη , there it is α ̓ νελη ́ μφθη  .  St. Peter’s phrase is more animated, and it is likewise more suitable to the action of the ‘ropes’ seen in the trance.
