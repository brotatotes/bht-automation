<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:10">Acts 11:10</span>. <strong> All were drawn up again into heaven. </strong> The Greek is ἅπαντα . There is more life in the phrase than in what we find in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:16">Acts 10:16</span>. The whole of what was seen in the vision disappeared by being carried up into heaven. Here, too, the word is α ̓ νεσπα ́ σθη , there it is α ̓ νελη ́ μφθη <em> . </em> St. Peter’s phrase is more animated, and it is likewise more suitable to the action of the ‘ropes’ seen in the trance.
