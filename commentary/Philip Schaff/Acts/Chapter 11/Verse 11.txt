Acts 11:11.  Behold, there were three men already come.  He notes, and calls his hearers to note, the startling coincidence of this arrival. The exclamation ‘Behold!’ has its significance. Once more it is instructive to compare his mode of presenting the history at Jerusalem with the narrative as given by St. Luke. The apostle says nothing of the trouble taken by the messengers in inquiring for the house of Simon the Tanner, and of their manner of presenting themselves before the gate. These were facts external to the experience of St. Peter himself. Nor does he say anything of the intense mental consideration in which he was engaged when the messengers suddenly arrived.
