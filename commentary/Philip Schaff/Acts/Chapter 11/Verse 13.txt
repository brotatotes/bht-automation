Probably the mention of this angel was a conspicuous part of the story as it reached the ears of the apostles at Jerusalem; and to their minds it must have appeared a very grave part of the whole subject. This mode of making a revelation was in accordance with many parts of Hebrew history, and with their own experience after the Resurrection and at the Ascension.

It seems as if these words rang in Peter’s ears.
