St. Luke uses this phrase in two other places (see his Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:66">Luke 1:66</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:30">Luke 4:30</span>). Some manuscripts add here the words ‘so as to heal them.’ Their authority, however, does not justify our seeing in this addition more than a gloss; and the suggestion probably came from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:17">Luke 5:17</span>.

<p><strong> A</strong> <strong> great number believed.</strong> All such terms are relative. At all events a considerable Christian community was formed rapidly at Antioch, as had been the case at Cæsarea. Though Cæsarea was probably first in order of time, Antioch speedily became greater in importance. See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:24">Acts 11:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span> for the progressive growth of the Church in this latter city under the ministrations of Barnabas and Saul.
