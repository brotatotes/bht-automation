On the other hand, it is remarkable that no mention is made of the Apostles here, such as we find in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:14">Acts 8:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1">Acts 11:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:2">Acts 15:2</span>.

<p><strong> They sent forth Barnabas. </strong> See notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:36">Acts 4:36</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:27">Acts 9:27</span>. There is great beauty in the description of his character which follows. This mission was alike creditable to him and to them. If it was the free communication of the Gospel to Gentiles at Antioch, and their full reception of it, of which they had heard, they may have sent Barnabas simply to inquire into the facts and to seek explanations. But at all events they sent the man who was best known among them for large-heartedness and generosity of character.

<p><strong> That he should go as far as Antioch. </strong> If we <strong> </strong> follow the received text, the Greek seems to imply that Barnabas was to exercise his mission on the way, along the Phoenician coast-road, where the Gospel had been preached as well as at Antioch.
