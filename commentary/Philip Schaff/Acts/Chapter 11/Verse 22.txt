 Mission of Barnabas to Antioch  His Character Co-operation of Saul with him there  The Name ‘Christian’  22-26.
	Acts 11:22.  Tidings  of these things  came into the ears of  the Church which  was in Jerusalem.  The Church in Jerusalem is here spoken of collectively, as a local ἰκκλησία : and the oriental phrase ‘came into the ears of the Church’ tends almost to personify it.

But at all events they sent the man who was best known among them for large-heartedness and generosity of character.
