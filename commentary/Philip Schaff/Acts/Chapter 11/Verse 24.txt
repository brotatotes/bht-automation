The word ‘good’ does not mean merely that Barnabas was a man of earnest religious character. This is expressed by the words which follow. Rather it denotes that he was a man of a genial, generous, charitable, and candid disposition. This helps us to the meaning of the connecting particle ‘for.’ The reason is given why he unfeignedly <em> rejoiced </em> in what he saw at Antioch. There may have been misgivings and suspicions at Jerusalem. But in his heart there were none. He may have been much astonished as much astonished as those who went with Peter from Joppa to Cæsarea (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:45">Acts 10:45</span>); but he frankly acknowledged the work of the Divine Spirit, and was glad because Pagans had received the fall grace of God.
