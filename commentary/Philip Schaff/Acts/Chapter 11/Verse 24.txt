Acts 11:24.  For he was a good  man.  We ask here for the precise meaning of the word ‘good,’ and also why the particle ‘for’ is prefixed to the statement. The word ‘good’ does not mean merely that Barnabas was a man of earnest religious character. This is expressed by the words which follow. Rather it denotes that he was a man of a genial, generous, charitable, and candid disposition. This helps us to the meaning of the connecting particle ‘for.’ The reason is given why he unfeignedly  rejoiced  in what he saw at Antioch. There may have been misgivings and suspicions at Jerusalem. But in his heart there were none. He may have been much astonished as much astonished as those who went with Peter from Joppa to Cæsarea (Acts 10:45); but he frankly acknowledged the work of the Divine Spirit, and was glad because Pagans had received the fall grace of God.
	 Much people  was added unto  the Lord.  See what precedes (Acts 11:21) and what follows (Acts 11:26) as to the progressive but rapid growth of the Church in Antioch.
