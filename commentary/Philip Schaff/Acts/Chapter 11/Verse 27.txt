<p><em> Charitable Mission of Barnabas and Saul from Antioch to Jerusalem, </em> 27-30.

<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:27">Acts 11:27</span>. <strong> In these days</strong>. This indication of date is general and vague; but, no doubt, the occurrence here related took place within the ‘year’ of active ministration at Antioch mentioned just above.

<p>Prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch. It would seem that they came of their own accord, not on a formal mission of an official kind. For the ‘prophets’ of the New Testament, see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>. They were inspired teachers, not necessarily with reference to the prediction of future events. This, however, was an instance which had regard to the future. Sometimes these prophets were women (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:9">Acts 21:9</span>, comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17-18">Acts 2:17-18</span>).
