A simple and careful statement of the facts from the outset was more likely to be persuasive than anything else. He did not argue. The mere telling of the story was a proof of the Divine teaching in this case, which was far beyond any argument. Another thought, too, forces itself here upon the mind. The course which St. Peter followed was utterly different from that which he would have adopted if the privileges of infallibility and   supremacy belonged to him. If ever there was a case which belonged essentially to the sphere of ‘faith and morals,’ it was the case of Cornelius.
