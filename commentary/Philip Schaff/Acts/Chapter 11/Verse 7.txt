<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:7">Acts 11:7</span>. <strong> I heard a voice saying unto me. </strong> In <strong> </strong> St. Luke’s narrative the phrase is, ‘there came a voice to him.’ The external fact that a voice was uttered is that which he relates. St. Peter tells of his own inward experience. He ‘heard’ the voice. A communication was effectually made <strong> </strong> to his own intelligence and consciousness.

<p><strong> Slay, and eat. </strong> The Authorised Version in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:13">Acts 10:13</span> has <em> ‘kill, </em> and eat.’ But the word in the original is the same. This is an example of the love of our translators for variety in rendering, merely for the sake of variety (see Bishop Lightfoot <em> On a Fresh Revision of the New Testament, </em> p. 33).
