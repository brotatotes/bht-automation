Acts 12:11.  And when Peter was come to himself.  Up to this time, all that had happened had seemed to Peter as a dream; but now, when he stood alone in the midst of the city, and he called to mind distinctly all the varied circumstances of his deliverance, and the angelâ€™s calm, deliberate directions, he at once with deep gratitude recognised  whence  came his deliverance, he perceived that the radiant Messenger was from his   Master.
