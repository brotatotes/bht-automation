<p><strong> Go show these things unto James. </strong> James the brother of the Lord is here specially mentioned, as he held a peculiar position of authority among the Jerusalem Christians (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:13">Acts 15:13</span>).

<p><strong> And he departed and went into another place. </strong> It <strong> </strong> is most probable that he left the city for a time, as after his miraculous deliverance he would not needlessly expose himself to fresh danger. We find Peter again at Jerusalem a few years after this: the bitter persecution was doubtless stopped after the death of King Herod Agrippa, which took place in the summer of this same year, 44. Very many Romish writers believe that Peter after leaving Jerusalem proceeded to Rome, and there laid the foundations of the Church in that city. The total absence, however, of any reference to Peter and his work in the Epistle to the Roman Church, written by Paul about the year 58, seems fatal to any such theory. Peter must have visited Rome at a much later period.
