From very early times the neighbouring fertile regions were in the habit of furnishing supplies for the markets of Tyre; Solomon, for instance, sent gifts of wheat and oil to Hiram of Tyre (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ki+5:11">1 Kings 5:11</span>). Ezekiel (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:17">Acts 27:17</span>) tells how ‘Israel and Judah were the merchants of Tyre, and traded with her in wheat and honey, oil and balm.’ Herod no doubt in his anger forbade all intercommunication and traffic <strong> </strong> between Israel and the Phoenician cities.

The famine in question began in the year 44, and lasted three or four years, occasioning terrible sufferings.
