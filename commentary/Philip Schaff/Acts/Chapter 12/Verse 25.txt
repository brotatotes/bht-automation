Acts 12:25.  Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their ministry.  The thread of the history is here taken up again from chap. Acts 11:30. Barnabas and Saul, after the prediction of Agabus, had been sent from Antioch to Judea with alms for the poor saints of Jerusalem and the churches of Palestine. It seems most probable that they had sojourned during the Passover at Jerusalem, and had been eye-witnesses of the events related in this chapter. They now returned to Antioch, taking with them John Mark, the nephew of Barnabas and the son of that Mary at whose house the solemn assembly was held on the night of Peter’s escape. Chrysostom remarks that the writer of the ‘Acts’ still mentions Barnabas first, for Paul was not yet famous; he had not as yet wrought any sign.
