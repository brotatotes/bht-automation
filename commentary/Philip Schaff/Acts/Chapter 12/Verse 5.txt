Acts 12:5.  Peter therefore was kept in prison; but prayer was made without ceasing of the church to  God for him.  This verse is introduced between the account of the arrest and the miraculous deliverance. It suggests the thought that the angelâ€™s interference was without doubt the result of the prayer.
