<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:8">Acts 12:8</span>. <strong> Gird thyself, and bind</strong> <strong> on thy sandals. </strong> The angel gives these various directions 1st, to indicate the reality of the appearance; 2d, to show there was no need for haste. The prisoner was <strong> </strong> to arise at once; he would find the iron fetters which bound him to the two sleeping soldiers already snapped by the Divine touch. He was to tighten the girdle which confined his tunic, to strap on the light sandals he had laid aside before he slept. ‘Tarry not to bind on your sandals’ was a usual saying among the Greeks when they urged one to hasten. He was to throw round him his heavy cloak as a protection against the sharp air of the early spring morning.
