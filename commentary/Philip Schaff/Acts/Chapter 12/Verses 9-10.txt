When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city. </strong> Silently, without a word, the radiant Messenger from heaven and the <strong> amazed </strong> apostle passed through the galleries of the fortress (the prison in which Peter was confined was <strong> </strong> most probably the tower of Antonia), past the first sleeping guard, then past the second, then through the great gates of iron which communicated with the city beyond, down a flight of seven steps, as one most ancient MS. (Codex D) tells us, into the street; and there the angel passed back into the unseen, leaving Peter alone, but free.
