Acts 13:12.  Believed.  That Sergius Paulus was baptized is the natural inference. ‘Believed’ is the ordinary expression used in the early Christian records for turning to the Lord and joining the Church (so Acts 4:4; Acts 11:21; Acts 19:18). The proconsul of Cyprus is another instance of men of high rank joining the Christian brotherhood in very early times (see note on Acts 13:1 of this chapter).
