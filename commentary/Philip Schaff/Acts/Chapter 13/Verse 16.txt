Acts 13:16.  Men of Israel, and ye that fear God.  ‘Men of Israel,’ that is, the Jews and proselytes worshipping in the congregation. ‘Those that fear God’ included those Gentile natives of Pisidia and strangers who had given up idol- worship, and who worshipped the God of Israel, without, however, being circumcised. They are usually termed ‘proselytes of the gate.’
