<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:16">Acts 13:16</span>. <strong> Men of Israel, and ye that fear God. </strong> ‘Men of Israel,’ that is, the Jews and proselytes worshipping in the congregation. ‘Those that fear God’ included those Gentile natives of Pisidia and strangers who had given up idol- worship, and who worshipped the God of Israel, without, however, being circumcised. They are usually termed ‘proselytes of the gate.’
