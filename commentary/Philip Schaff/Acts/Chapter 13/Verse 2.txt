Acts 13:2.  As they ministered to the Lord,  and fasted.  That is, while the solemn service of the Church was going on, came the word of the Lord to one, doubtless, of the prophets then present. The word translated ‘as they ministered’ was the general word used in the Old Testament for ‘priestly service.’ The writer of the ‘Acts’ here uses it to express generally the Christian divine service, including prayer, the singing of hymns and psalms, the office of preaching, the whole crowned by the solemn partaking of the Lord’s Supper. It is not certain if this was the ordinary service of the Antioch church which the Christians were in the habit of attending the first day of the week, or if it was a special solemn gathering, called together in consequence of some intimation of the Holy Ghost to one of the inspired prophets, that a voice would come from God to the congregation. The latter is probably the case, as we read ‘they fasted,’ no doubt in preparation for the hour when they looked for the revelation.  The Holy Ghost said, Separate me  Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. Chrysostom writes on these words: ‘Here we may see a proof of the divinity of the Holy Ghost. The prophets were ministering to the Lord. He does not say, Separate Barnabas and Saul to the Lord, but to  Me  for the ministry to which ‘have called them, showing that He is coequal with God.’
