Acts 13:25.  And as John fulfilled his course.  Better rendered, ‘And as John was fulfilling his   course.’ This was an expression peculiar to Paul; see 2 Timothy 4:7: ‘I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course.’ Compare also Paul’s words in Acts 20:24, Galatians 2:2. The words signify,
	 ‘ When the work and ministry of John the Baptist was near its close.’ It was just before that imprisonment which was terminated in the cruel death inflicted by Herod, that John said, not once, but, as Alford remarks, habitually  Whom think ye that I am?  The reading of three of the oldest MSS. would require, instead of ‘  Whom think ye? ’ ‘  What think ye that I am?’  This slight change, if made, would in no wise alter the sense, but would impress more forcibly John’s fear of being mistaken for that glorious One whose way he was preparing.
	There cometh one after me. The very words and thoughts used by Luke (and Paul) in the Third Gospel in the account of the mission of the Baptist. Respecting the expression itself (‘whose shoes,’ etc.), it was looked upon as the office of the lowest slaves to unfasten their master’s sandals.
