Acts 13:26.  Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.  Before speaking at length of the Crucified as Messiah, Paul excites the attention of the congregation by pointing out that  to them who were then listening to his words was this salvation offered. In the word ‘brethren,’ he appeals lovingly to them as belonging to one race with himself; while, in the expression, ‘children of the stock of Abraham,’ he again reminds them of the glorious hopes of Israel. The Gentile listeners who were present, under the term, ‘whosoever among you feareth God,’ he associates with all true Jews. ‘To you all in this distant Pisidian Antioch, comes now the word of the Lord.’
