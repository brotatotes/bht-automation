Acts 13:33.  God hath fulfilled.  The Greek word here may be rendered ‘hath completely fulfilled,’  completely, because in the resurrection which is here about to be mentioned, the ascension and exaltation of Messiah are both involved.
	 In the  second psalm.  Some of the fathers and one ancient MS. read here, ‘in the first psalm.’ This singular variation is accounted for by the first psalm being frequently not numbered, but simply looked at as a psalm of introduction. It is not the Custom of Paul or the New Testament writers to quote so exactly as in this instance, never giving the number of the chapter or the psalm whence the reference was drawn; the exception in this case was probably owing to the high importance attached by the early Christian teachers to this great Messianic prophecy appearing as it does on the first page, so to speak, of the sacred psalter.
	 Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.  The Eternal speaks in this psalm to Messiah, ‘Thou art my Son, today the day of Thy resurrection I have declared Thee have exhibited Thee as begotten.’ He had been the Son of God from all eternity; but by His triumphant resurrection after His humiliation He was openly declared or shown to be so. Paul later expands the same great thought: ‘He (Jesus Christ) was declared to be the Son of God with power, by the resurrection from the dead’ (Romans 1:4).
