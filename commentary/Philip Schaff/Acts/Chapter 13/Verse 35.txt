Acts 13:35.  Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  He, that is, God; as in the preceding verse, ‘He  ( God  )  said on this wise, I   will give you the sure mercies of David.’ Although in the psalm quoted (Psalms 16:0) David is speaking, he is only speaking evidently the words put into his mouth by God. David is the interpreter, so   to speak, of the Holy Spirit. Although the body of Jesus was laid in the tomb,  it underwent no corruption, and until the day of resurrection lay as though on a couch (see Calvin’s note here).
