<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:38">Acts 13:38</span>. <strong> Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins. </strong> Paul having now shown that in Jesus the Crucified and Risen One all the great prophecies concerning Messiah were fully accomplished, solemnly declares to his listeners that the Messianic blessings of forgiveness and justification can alone proceed from Him, and will only be shared by those who receive Him as their Lord. Thus at the close of the Antioch sermon the Gentile apostle gives us the first rough outline of that great doctrine of Justification by Faith the doctrine which in after years, guided by the Holy Spirit, Paul laid open in all its marvellous fulness when he wrote to the Church of Rome his great epistle which tells of the mysteries of the Cross of Christ.</p>
