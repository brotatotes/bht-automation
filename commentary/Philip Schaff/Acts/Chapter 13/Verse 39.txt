<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:39">Acts 13:39</span>. <strong> By him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. </strong> In other words, Paul said to them, ‘Jesus Christ, if ye believe on Him as Messiah, will do for you what the Law could not do. In <strong> </strong> Him shall you be justified from all your sins that is, you shall be freed from <strong> </strong> the galling chains and fetters of guilt.’

<p>In these words at the close of the Antioch sermon Paul proclaims that in Jesus Christ the Messiah all men may find peace, and may obtain forgiveness of every sin. He gently puts aside the Law in which the Jews had trusted as incapable of procuring in any way for those who submitted to it, forgiveness and reconciliation with God. He shows to them a new and better way of approaching the Eternal a way, too, which he points out may be trodden by all alike, by Gentiles as well as by Jews.</p>
