Acts 13:41.  Behold, you despisers, and wonder and perish.  The quotation is from the LXX. Version of Habakkuk 1:5. The prophet in the first instance refers to an invasion of the land by the Chaldeans. But the words of Habakkuk reached far beyond the temporary punishment inflicted by the Chaldean invasion; they reproached another and greater sin than even that which dishonoured the unhappy land in the prophet’s days. The sin which he now warned Israel against committing was the deliberate rejection of the long-promised Messiah; and the punishment in which the despisers of Jesus would perish was carried out to its bitter end only a few years after Paul’s words were spoken in the Antioch synagogue, in the destruction of the Holy City and the utter and complete ruin of the whole Jewish nation.
