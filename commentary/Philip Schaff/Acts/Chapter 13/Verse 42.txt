<p><em> Further Preaching of Paul and Barnabas in Antioch</em>, 42 - 49 .
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:42">Acts 13:42</span>. <strong> And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath. </strong> The reading of the more ancient MSS. here is as follows, ‘And as they were going out they besought,’ the interpolated words being introduced either from a desire to make the sense clearer, or perhaps because an ancient Church lesson began at this place, some words were judged needful to explain the context. Neander says the procedure may have been this: As Paul and Barnabas were going out before the general dispersion of the assembly, the rulers of the synagogue may have requested that they would repeat their discourse on the next Sabbath. The people having then withdrawn, many of the Jews and proselytes followed the speakers for the purpose of declaring their assent to what they had heard, or of seeking further instruction.</p>
