Acts 13:44.  And the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together.  During the week which had passed since the first preaching of Paul, the apostles had doubtless been earnestly engaged in teaching and spreading their doctrines in private assemblies and meetings; and the result was a very great concourse of people on the following Sabbath day in and round the Jewish synagogue. The doctrine of Messiah as preached by Paul seems to have been welcomed with   readiness by these peoples of Asia Minor.
