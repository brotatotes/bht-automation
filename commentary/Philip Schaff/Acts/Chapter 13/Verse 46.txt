This was, however, merely a command in reference to priority. Gentiles would have been admitted into the kingdom of God even if the Jews had not rejected the Lord Jesus. The apostles do not seem to have attempted either to meet the Jews’ argument or to have tried to refute their blasphemies. From their haughty refusal to share with Gentiles the glories of Messiah’s kingdom, the missionaries recognised at once that these self-willed, stubborn men had condemned themselves as unworthy to partake of the blessed promises of Messiah; and so they simply pronounced the words, ‘Lo, we turn to the Gentiles.’</p>
