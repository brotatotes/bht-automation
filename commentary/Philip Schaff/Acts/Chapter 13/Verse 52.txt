Acts 13:52.  And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.  The members of the Antioch Church, instead of being depressed and disheartened by the enforced departure of their teachers, Paul and Barnabas, conscious of the intense happiness which had now become their inheritance as Christians, were ‘filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost.’
	Chrysostom tells us how the sufferings of a Master, far from discouraging the disciple, gives fresh ardour to his purpose.
