 Residence of the Missionary Apostles in the City of Iconium,  1  - 6  .
	Acts 14:1.  And it came to pass in Iconium  (see note on the History of the City, chap. 13 Acts 13:51). The success of Paul’s preaching appears to have been unusually great in this place; and it was no doubt owing to the rapid spread of the doctrines preached by the apostles in Iconium and its neighbourhood that the jealousy of the Jewish leading men was excited, and the calumnies which resulted in the banishment of Paul and Barnabas were devised.
	 And  also of  the Greeks.  There seems no reason to restrict the Greeks here mentioned to those believers known as ‘proselytes of the gate.’ The reputation of Paul very likely attracted many of the dwellers in Iconium who had no connection with Judaism.
