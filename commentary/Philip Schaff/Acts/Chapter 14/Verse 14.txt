Acts 14:14.  Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of.  In this place, and also in Acts 14:4   of this chapter, Paul and Barnabas are styled apostles. These two distinguished and devoted men, after a long period of trial, were formally (Acts 13:2) set apart by the solemn act of the Church of Antioch, acting under the express direction of the Holy Ghost, to this high and singular position in the community of Christians.
