Acts 14:17.  And gave us rain from  heaven.  This mention of ‘rain from heaven’ was an especial instance of Divine benevolence to the people of Lystra, as in the Lycaonian country water was so extremely scarce. In many Eastern countries this ‘rain from heaven’ was a most precious boon (see  Psalms 104:13).
