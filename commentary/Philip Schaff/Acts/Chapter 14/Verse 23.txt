Acts 14:23.  And when they had ordained them elders in every church.  This is rendered more accurately, ‘And when they had appointed for them elders,’ etc. There is some doubt here as to whether the Greek word translated ‘ordained,’ or, more accurately, ‘appointed’ signified that Paul and Barnabas simply conducted and guided the elections of the churches, or whether the two apostles themselves appointed these elders (or presbyters). The latter is the more probable, as in these new-formed communities, presbyters or elders chosen by Paul and Barnabas acting under the light of the Divine Spirit, would be more likely to command respect when the apostles were far away, than any elders chosen by popular voice.
