 The Citizens of Lystra and Derbe, in Lycaonia,  mistake the Missionary Apostles for Gods.  Paulâ€™s Lystrian Sermon, 7 - 19 .
	Acts 14:7.  And there they preached the gospel.  There appears to have been but few Jews in these parts. We hear of no synagogue at either Lystra or Derbe. The apostles would preach generally in the market-place, or in some public thoroughfare; but the great centre, doubtless, of their work was that house, in later days known in the churches as the home of Timothy, the greatest and most famous of the disciples of Paul. This was a family in which a Jewish woman was married to a Greek citizen. The deep piety of Lois and Eunice, the grandmother and mother of Timothy, their love for the traditions of the ancient covenant people on the one side, their Gentile connections on the other, supplied a link between the Jewish apostles and the people of Lycaonia. The church of Lystra was the first Christian church composed almost entirely of Gentiles.
