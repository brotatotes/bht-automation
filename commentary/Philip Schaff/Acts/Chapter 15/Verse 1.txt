The ‘certain men’ are alluded to by St. Paul in the Galatian Epistle, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</span>, in the following terms: ‘False brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage.’ They were probably, for the most part, Pharisees of an extreme sect who had embraced the gospel.

But the hearts of the Antioch teachers were deeply penetrated by the great truth that ‘we are saved not by the law but by grace.’</p>
