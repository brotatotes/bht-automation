Acts 15:11.  But we believe that, through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved, even as they.  The believing Jew, who has tried to keep the law and failed, will be saved like the Gentile through the power of the blood of Jesus.  ‘Their ground of trust is the same as  ours, ours   as    theirs’ (Alford; and see Galatians 2:15 and following verses, where this train of thought is more fully carried out by St. Paul).
