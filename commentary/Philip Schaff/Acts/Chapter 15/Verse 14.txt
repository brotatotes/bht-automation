Acts 15:14.  Simeon hath declared.  James at the commencement of his speech uses this Jewish form of the name Simon, the original name of Peter. Simon seems to have been familiar to the Church of   Jerusalem (see St. Luke 24:34)  .  In this use of   the Jewish term by which Peter was known, James identifies himself with the customs of the Hebrews those many thousands of the Jews who believed and were zealous of the law (Acts 21:20). This is the last mention of Simon Peter in the Acts of the Apostles.
