<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:16">Acts 15:16</span>. <strong> I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down. </strong> This Amos prophecy speaks first of the fall of the Jewish Church, and the abolition of its temple service; it next <strong> </strong> conveys the promise that God will build a new church on the ruins of the old, and gather together in it all the Gentiles. It lastly sets forth that this church shall receive salvation only through the name of the Lord, which should be called upon by it, <em> i.e.</em> on which it would believe. Wordsworth remarks here that Amos declares in these words ‘that the true restoration of the tabernacle of David is to be found in the reception of the residue of the human family, and in the flowing in of all nations, whether Jew or Gentile, into the Church of Christ; and asks, “Is not this a Divine declaration on the true restoration of the Jews?”’</p>
