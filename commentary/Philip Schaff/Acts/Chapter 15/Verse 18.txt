Acts 15:18.  Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.  There are many variations of the Greek text here, but they all yield much the same meaning. On the whole, the translation of the best supported reading is Acts 15:17, ‘Saith the Lord, who doeth these things,’ Acts 15:18, ‘which were known from the beginning of the world;’ in other words, James says, ‘What we  now propose to sanction, namely, the extending the gospel summons to the heathen world without imposing upon them the hard yoke and burden of the Mosaic rites and ceremonial law,’ God has  from the very beginning known. It is no unexpected event; it is simply carrying into effect an eternal decree of the ever blessed Trinity.
