On the whole, the translation of the best supported reading is <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:17">Acts 15:17</span>, ‘Saith the Lord, who doeth these things,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:18">Acts 15:18</span>, ‘which were known from the beginning of the world;’ in other words, James says, ‘What we <em> now</em> propose to sanction, namely, the extending the gospel summons to the heathen world without imposing upon them the hard yoke and burden of the Mosaic rites and ceremonial law,’ God has <em> from the very beginning</em> known. It is no unexpected event; it is simply carrying into effect an eternal decree of the ever blessed Trinity.</p>
