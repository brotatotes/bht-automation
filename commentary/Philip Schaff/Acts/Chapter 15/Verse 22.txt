Acts 15:22.  Then pleased it the apostles and olden, with the whole church.  Or better translated, ‘Then it seemed good to the apostles,’ etc. The Greek word ἔδοξε , rendered ‘it seemed good,’ is frequently used in classic Greek in the formal resolutions of any popular assembly, and hence the decrees of any such assembly are termed δόγματα whence our word ‘dogma.’ The decrees of this primitive Council were agreed to by the united voice of the whole Church. The decree, however, ran in the name of the apostle and elder brethren only; see the note on the reading of the older Greek MSS.   in the next verse ( 23 ).
	 To send chosen men.  There is a slight irregularity in the cases of the participles here in the original Greek (see amended translation).
	 Judas surnamed Barnabas.  Some have supposed this envoy of the Jerusalem Church was a brother of that Joseph-Barsabas who, with Matthias, had been proposed as a candidate for the apostleship (Acts 1:23), both being presumably sons of one Sabas (  bar being the Hebrew for son). Nothing, however, is definitely known concerning him, except that in the early Church he held the rank of ‘a prophet’ (see note on Acts 15:32); not necessarily merely a foreteller of future events, but one especially gifted with the power of preaching. Judas was esteemed one of the chief men among the brethren.
	 Silas. Well known in after years as the fellow-missionary and friend of St. Paul (1 Thessalonians 1:1; 2 Corinthians 1:19). It is not improbable that he was identical with that Silvanus by whom the First Epistle of St. Peter was carried to the churches of Asia. Tradition speaks of him as subsequently Bishop of Corinth.
	 Chief men among the brethren.  They were   certainly among the chief men of the Jerusalem community, and their selection indicates an especial wish on the part of the Christian governing body at Jerusalem to show honour to the Antioch Church and the increasing Gentile communions.
