Acts 15:25.  To send chosen men unto you.  The Greek words should be translated here as in Acts 15:22. In some of the older authorities here, the irregularity   in the cases of the participles above noticed does not appear.
	 Our beloved Barnabas and Paul.  Commentators remark here on the unusual order of the names of the two apostles, Barnabas standing first. It is an indirect testimony to the scrupulous accuracy of the writer of the Acts; Barnabas in this official letter standing before Paul, because Paul had spent but little time in Jerusalem, whilst Barnabas among the Christians there had long been a known and honoured leader.
