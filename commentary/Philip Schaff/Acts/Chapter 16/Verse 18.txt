Acts 16:18.  I command  thee in the name of Jesus Christ  to come  out of  her.  ‘In My Name,’ said the Lord (Mark 16:17), ‘shall they cast out devils.’ It is noticeable how differently such acts as these were performed by the Master and His servants. Christ worked His miracles in His own sovereign power; the apostles worked theirs only in the name of Jesus.
