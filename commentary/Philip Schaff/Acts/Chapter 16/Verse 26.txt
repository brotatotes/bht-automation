Acts 16:26.  And suddenly there was a great earthquake.  Vain attempts have been made (for instance, by Baur and Zeller) to explain away the miraculous aspect of this event. But the simple words of the narrator can only be understood as an account of a miraculous interference on the part of the King ruling in heaven in behalf of His persecuted servants. The earthquake never loosed the prisonersâ€™ chains or opened those close-barred and chain-protected doors the Divine power which commanded the earthquake loosed the chains and opened the barred-up doors.
