This ‘tank’ received the rain-water which flowed from a slightly inclined roof. Other expositors <strong> </strong> suggest that allusion is made to a swimming bath which was then no uncommon appurtenance to the public buildings. It is possible that such a bath existed in the prison of Philippi, which was a noted military centre. It is more likely, however, to have been an impluvium. Chrysostom comments thus: ‘The jailor washed them, and he was washed himself. He washed them from their stripes, and he in his turn was washed from his sins.’ This same Greek father conjectures that ‘Stephanas’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:16">1 Corinthians 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:15-17">1 Corinthians 16:15-17</span>) was identical with this Philippian jailor.
