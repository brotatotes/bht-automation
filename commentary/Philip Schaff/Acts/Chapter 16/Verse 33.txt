Acts 16:33.  And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.  Most likely in that rectangular reservoir or basin called the ‘impluvium,’ which was usually enclosed in the houses of that period. This ‘tank’ received the rain-water which flowed from a slightly inclined roof. Other expositors   suggest that allusion is made to a swimming bath which was then no uncommon appurtenance to the public buildings. It is possible that such a bath existed in the prison of Philippi, which was a noted military centre. It is more likely, however, to have been an impluvium. Chrysostom comments thus: ‘The jailor washed them, and he was washed himself. He washed them from their stripes, and he in his turn was washed from his sins.’ This same Greek father conjectures that ‘Stephanas’ (1 Corinthians 1:16; 1 Corinthians 16:15-17) was identical with this Philippian jailor.
