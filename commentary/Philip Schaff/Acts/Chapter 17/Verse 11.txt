<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:11">Acts 17:11</span>. <strong> These were more noble than those in Thessalonica. </strong> Certain expositors of great name, as, for instance, Calvin and Luther, apply these words to the Jews of Thessalonica, translating thus: ‘These were the more noble of the Thessalonians who received the word,’ intimating that the chief men of Thessalonica had joined the Christian brotherhood; but the more probable explanation is that the Berean Jews were of a nobler spirit, less narrowed by national prejudices than their brethren of the larger city. It is worthy of remark that, even in the brief summary of Paul’s work these ‘Acts’ contain, we can see that the great teacher neither expected nor desired that men should be converted to his Master’s creed without first carefully examining it, and the proofs upon which it was based. The genuine, honest spirit of inquiry is ever allied to true gospel teaching. The ‘nobility of soul’ which Paul’s chronicler so highly praised in the men of Berea consisted not merely in their readiness of mind to receive the word, but also in that patient loving spirit of inquiry which led them daily to read the Scriptures to see whether those things Paul told them of were so.
