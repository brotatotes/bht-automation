<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:24">Acts 17:24</span>. <strong> Dwelleth not in temples made with hands. </strong> Commentators call attention to the remarkable reminiscence of the dying speech of Stephen before the Sanhedrim, which the Pharisee Saul must have listened to, and which so powerfully influenced his future life. ‘Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:48-49">Acts 7:48-49</span>). These words, uttered in full view of the magnificent fanes of the gods of which Athens was so proud, must have rung with a strange emphasis on the ears of the listening Areopagites.
