<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:3">Acts 17:3</span>. <strong> Opening and alleging. </strong> Better, ‘opening and setting forth.’ Opening that is, expounding, unfolding their sense. Bengel well expands these words: ‘Ut si quis nucleum, fracto cortice, et recludat et exemptum ponat in medio.’

<p>Paul <em> opened </em> their Scriptures, and then showed them how they contained two great truths the first, that these Scriptures declare the promised Messiah must suffer death and then rise again; and the second, that these Scriptures point unmistakeably to Jesus of Nazareth, who, by His life, death, actions, words, works, sufferings, sorrows, even by His very rejection at the hands of the rulers, was unmistakeably the One alluded to in a hundred passages in the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms.

<p><strong> Is Christ. </strong> Better, ‘is the Christ,’ or the Messiah.
