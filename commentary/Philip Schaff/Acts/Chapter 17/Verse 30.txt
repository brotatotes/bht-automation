<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:30">Acts 17:30</span>. <strong> And the times of this ignorance God winked at. </strong> The English translation of the Greek word υ ̔ περιδω ̀ ν , <em> winked at, </em> utterly fails to give the sense of the original, which should be rendered ‘having overlooked.’ God now commandeth, etc. God had allowed those ages of ignorance to pass by without any special revelation or stern rebuke. He had sent no express messenger to declare His will to them. He had left them alone to the teachings of nature and the promptings of their own consciences; but <em> now </em> the time of forbearance was over, now He called men to repentance, to a change of mind and heart. Alford remarks that in the word υ ̔ περιδω ̀ ν , <em> having overlooked, ‘</em> lie treasures of mercy for those who lived in the times of ignorance.’ For the expansion of these thoughts, see Epistle to the Romans, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>, etc., <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:12">Romans 2:12</span>, etc.
