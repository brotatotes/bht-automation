His stay does not appear to have been a prolonged one. While we possess five of Paul’s letters addressed to Greek cities, two to Thessalonica, two to Corinth, one to Philippi, we have <strong> </strong> none written to the famous capital.

Considering the seclusion in which Greek women lived, the mention of her name as if she had been present at the meeting on the Hill of Mars is singular. Chrysostom supposes that she was the wife of Dionysius. Stier suggests she was an Hetaira, one of that <strong> </strong> unhappily famous Athenian sisterhood who like <strong> </strong> Mary Magdalene was called to repentance.
