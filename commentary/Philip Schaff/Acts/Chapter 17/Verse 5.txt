<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</span>. <strong> But</strong> <strong> the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort. </strong> The words ‘which believed not’ do not occur in the older Greek MSS. They were no doubt inserted as an explanation after the statement of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:4">Acts 17:4</span>. It was only the unbelieving Jews who tried to compass the destruction of Paul. ‘Certain lewd fellows,’ etc., is better rendered, ‘Some bad men of the rabble.’

<p>The question has been asked why the Jews <strong> </strong> sought such coadjutors out of Judaea. They were strangers; and to effect such a purpose as that related here, they needed the help of some of <strong> </strong> the native inhabitants. The word rendered here ‘of the rabble’ ( α ̓ γοραι ́ ων ) is a word not un-frequent in classical Greek. In old Rome they were termed ‘subrostrani.’ Plautus would term them ‘subbasilicani.’ The modern word equivalent would be ‘canaille.’ The loungers who have no definite business, who crowd the market-place and other busy resorts, ready for any piece of business however rough and cruel, are the class here spoken of.

<p><strong> The house of Jason. </strong> It has been suggested with some probability that this Jason was an Hellenistic Jew, whose name Jesus or Joshua had been changed into the Greek form ‘Jason’ (see 1Ma 8:17 ; 2Ma 11:23 ). He was possibly a relative of Paul’s (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:21">Romans 16:21</span>). The apostle and Silas very likely lodged in the house of Jason during their stay at Thessalonica.
