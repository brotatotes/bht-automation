<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:6">Acts 17:6</span>. <strong> Unto the rulers of the city. </strong> Literally, ‘unto the politarchs.’ Thessalonica was a ‘free city’ <em> (urbs libera). </em> This privilege of ‘freedom’ was only bestowed by Rome upon certain favoured cities. In this case it was a reward for the side the city had taken when Augustus and Antony had warred with Brutus and Cassius. Athens also possessed this ‘freedom’ in memory of her ancient greatness.
	</p>
<p>A ‘free city’ was self-governed. The provincial governor possessed within its walls and circuit no authority. The power of life and death, for instance, so jealously withheld from the Jerusalem Jews, belonged to the local magistrates of a ‘free city.’ No Roman garrison, no Roman ensigns, were seen in the streets. At Thessalonica we find an assembly of the people, and magistrates named politarchs. An inscription still exists over an ancient arch at Thessalonica of a date considerably older than the first century of our era. This inscription contains the names of seven of the Thessalonian magistrates, whom it calls ‘politarchs,’ thus confirming in a strange and striking manner the accuracy of the writer of the ‘Acts’ in using this most rare word in describing the rulers of this city.

<p><strong> These that have turned the world upside down. </strong> These strange words, Alford remarks, presuppose some rumour of Christianity and its spread having before reached the inhabitants of Thessalonica.
