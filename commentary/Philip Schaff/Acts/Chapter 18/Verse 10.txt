Acts 18:10.  I have much people in this city.  ‘How great is the mercy of God! Nineveh, Sodom, Corinth, no city is so corrupt that He does not send preachers of righteousness to the people. . . . Paul accomplished a greater work in the wicked city of Corinth than in the learned city of Athens; Paul had the pleasure of changing these impure and sinful souls into pure brides, whom he conducted to Christ, and to whom he could afterwards say, Ye were thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, extortioners; but ye are washed, sanctified, justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God. . . . All this teaches us not to grow weary, even when we are dealing with the worst of men’ (Starke and others, quoted by Lange on this passage).
