Acts 18:14.  And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews.  There is little doubt but that Gallio knew something about the Christian sect then becoming numerous in several of the cities of the Empire. One so high in favour as the proconsul of Achaia, who had been necessarily thrown in contact with so many of the chief personages of the Empire, was, of course, well acquainted with the outlines of the history of these Christians; and Gallio, in common with other noble Romans, regarded them simply as an offshoot of the great Jewish race, as dissenters, perhaps, from some of the ancestral superstitions, but fairly entitled, in common with their co-religionists, to the contemptuous toleration and even protection of Rome.
	 If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you. The Roman judge’s answer to the Jewish accusation against the Christian Paul was: If what you allege this stranger to have done partook of the nature either of ‘wrong’ ( α ̓ δι ́ κημα ́,  an act of injustice, fraud, dishonesty)  or of ‘wicked lewdness’ ( ρ ̔ α ͅ διου ́ ργημα πονηρο ́ ν  , a wicked crime),  then I would have gravely considered the charge; but, by your own showing, nothing of the nature of crime is involved in your accusation.
