Acts 18:15.  But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.  If the question turned merely upon a word [the Greek equivalent here is in the singular] and upon certain names, Gallio had most likely in Rome or elsewhere heard the   name of Jesus, and how the Christians termed Him Christ, the Anointed One, their expected king Messiah; but as the Roman state records related how this Person had been put to death by the Procurator of Judea, Pilate, the Proconsul looked upon the whole matter as a harmless superstition on the part of Paul and his fellow-Christians. Certainly the majesty of the Empire was not called to interfere in these disputes about a dream or a phantom. Gallio saw that the grievance had nothing to do with Rome and her laws.
