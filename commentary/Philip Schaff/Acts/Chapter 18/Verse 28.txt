Acts 18:28.  For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly,  showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ.  His special training in the Alexandrian school of Philo, coupled with his great knowledge of the Old Testament Scriptures, eminently fitted the eloquent convert for the peculiar controversy which the Jewish frequenters of the synagogue delighted in. Apollos, we read, was singularly successful in convincing the Jews of Corinth, the very men perhaps who dragged Paul to the judgment seat of Gallio, that Jesus was the Christ. It was perhaps the knowledge of that bitter hostile spirit to Jesus of Nazareth on the part of his countrymen at Corinth which led Apollos, conscious of his powers in such controversies, to desire this Corinthian mission. The expression ‘publicly’ points especially to his work in public disputations in the synagogue and elsewhere.
