In the desert wanderings, when they came out from Egypt; in their own land, in the golden days of David and Solomon; in the captivity of Babylon; in the wide dispersion which immediately preceded and succeeded the fall of the city and temple; during the eighteen hundred years which have elapsed since that awful catastrophe; <em> now, </em> in our days, in almost every great city of the world, have this strange, unchanging race kept this solemn Sabbath rest, in accordance with the charge which the God of Israel <strong> </strong> delivered to His great servant, whom the Jews, in loving memory, still call ‘Moses our Rabbi.’
