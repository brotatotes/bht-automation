<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:7">Acts 18:7</span>. <strong> And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man’s house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. </strong> As long as it was possible, Paul seems always to have made the synagogue, or the meeting-place of prayer for the Jews, his centre of work; but this usually, after a time, was closed to him. So at Rome we read of ‘his own hired house;’ at Ephesus, ‘the <em> </em> school of Tyrannus;’ at Corinth, it was the house of a proselyte close by the Jews’ synagogue, where Paul was in the habit of assembling the little Church of Christ, to instruct them in the gospel of his Master. The better MSS. here, instead of ‘Justus,’ read ‘Titus, or Titius Justus.’ It is possible this was the ‘Titus’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1">Galatians 2:1</span>) who subsequently became the celebrated companion of Paul, and in the end one of his successors in the rule of the churches. In this very uncertain reference we possess the only possible allusion in the ‘Acts’ to St. Paul’s famous companion.
