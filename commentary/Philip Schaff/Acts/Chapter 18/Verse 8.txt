Acts 18:8.  And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house.  On the solemn separation of Paul from the Jews, this ruler of the synagogue, evidently a man of high consideration, joined the Church of Jesus. He was one of the few persons in Corinth whom Paul baptized with his own hand (1 Corinthians 1:14). We have here another instance in which a   whole family became Christians. A very old tradition speaks of this Crispus as subsequently Bishop of Egina.
	 And many of the Corinthians hearing believed.  That is, many of the idolatrous inhabitants of Corinth, in distinction to the Jews and proselytes before alluded to.
