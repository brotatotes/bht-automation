Acts 19:11.  And God  wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul  ‘Special,’ uncommon, extraordinary, because they were performed without the personal agency and not in the presence of the apostle. A similar expression is used by Longinus when alluding to Moses as ‘no ordinary man’ ( οὐχ ὁ τυχοὶν ἀνήρ )  .  We have had no record of any miracle worked by Paul since he healed the possessed slave first at Philippi some five years before (see Acts 16:18). What these uncommon miracles were is detailed in the next verse.
