<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:11">Acts 19:11</span>. <strong> And God</strong> <strong> wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul </strong> ‘Special,’ uncommon, extraordinary, because they were performed without the personal agency and not in the presence of the apostle. A similar expression is used by Longinus when alluding to Moses as ‘no ordinary man’ ( οὐχ ὁ τυχοὶν ἀνήρ ) <em> . </em> We have had no record of any miracle worked by Paul since he healed the possessed slave first at Philippi some five years before (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:18">Acts 16:18</span>). What these uncommon miracles were is detailed in the next verse.
