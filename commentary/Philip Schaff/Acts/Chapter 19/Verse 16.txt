<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:16">Acts 19:16</span>. <strong> And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them. </strong> Strong, like the poor man at Gadara (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:3-4">Mark 5:3-4</span>), whom no man could bind, because the chains and fetters had been often plucked asunder by him, so now, this one, before whom the impostor exorcists were standing, threw himself in a wild fury on the wretched imitators of Paul. The reading of the older authorities, ‘leaped on them, having overcome <em> both,’ </em> seems to imply that only two of the seven sons of Sceva were attempting to cast out the evil spirit. Ewald suggests another way of rendering the Greek, and preserving the old idea of the ‘seven sons’ standing before the demoniac, ‘leaped on them and mastered them <em> on both sides,’ </em> that is, when they stood before him, and afterwards from behind when they fled from him.
