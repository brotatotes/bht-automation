<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:28">Acts 19:28</span>. <strong> Great is</strong> <strong> Diana of the Ephesians </strong> ‘Great’ ( μεγα ́ λη ) was a special title belonging to the Ephesian Artemis. The ‘idol’ itself shrined in the magnificent temple, to which all this strange homage was paid during so many centuries, was very different to the fair form of the huntress Diana with which we are so familiar in Grecian art a rude, fourfold, many-breasted female figure ending below the breasts in a square pillar curiously carved with ancient symbols of bees, and corn, and flowers. Black with age, the venerated image was more like a Hindoo than a Greek idol. In common with other prized images, it was reputed to have fallen from heaven. The history of the idol is lost in remote antiquity. It evidently had survived the burning of the temple by Herostratus. Probably the early Greek colonists in Ionia found it, a relic of a bygone worship, and adopted by them as their national idol.
