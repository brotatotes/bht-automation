Three other persons called ‘Gaius’ are mentioned in the New Testament: Gaius of Derbe, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>; Gaius of <strong> </strong> Corinth, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span>; Gaius of Ephesus, to whom the Third Epistle of St. John was addressed. Aristarchus accompanied Paul on his journey to Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>) which ended in his arrest by the Romans. He was with Paul in the memorable voyage which terminated in the shipwreck off Melita (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:2">Acts 27:2</span>). He seems to have been the apostle’s companion during his first imprisonment at Rome, as he is mentioned in the Epistle to the Colossians, chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:10">Acts 4:10</span>, and in the little letter to Philemon, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:24">Acts 19:24</span>. Subsequent history speaks of him as suffering martyrdom with Paul, and by a similar death. There is another tradition which alludes to him as Bishop of Apamæa.

<p><strong> They rushed with one accord into the theatre. </strong> The theatre of Ephesus was of vast size, and capable of accommodating, according to the usual computation, at least 20,000 persons. These mighty buildings were used not only for dramatic representations, but also for great shows of gladiators, who fought sometimes one with the other, sometimes with wild beasts. They were also favourite meeting-places for the citizens when on any momentous occasion they were called together. This was the custom in Greek, not in Roman cities.
