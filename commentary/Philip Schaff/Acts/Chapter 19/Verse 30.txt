Acts 19:30.  The disciples suffered him not.  Paul with his customary chivalrous courtesy would not suffer his ‘companions in travel’ to be exposed to danger without his being at their side to defend them. He wished, too, to plead the Christian cause, so unwarrantably attacked, before the people of Ephesus. ‘But the disciples’ no doubt men of Ephesus converted by Paul, who knew well their countrymen’s feelings on the subject of their goddess would not suffer the brave-hearted man to expose himself so uselessly to a deadly peril.
