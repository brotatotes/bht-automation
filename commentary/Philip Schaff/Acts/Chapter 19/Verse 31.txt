They were selected from the cities of Proconsular Asia, generally, according to Strabo, from Tralles, as the citizens of that place were reckoned among the most wealthy in Asia. Upon these men fell the expense of providing these costly games the hiring gladiators, the importing of wild beasts, and many other smaller expenses. The games of Ephesus were termed the Artemision, and were held in the month of May in honour of Diana (Artemis) of the Ephesians. It is generally supposed that one of these ten was selected as president, but that the total expenses incurred were shared among the ten. We read, not many years after this uproar in the Ephesian theatre, of another <em> Asiarch</em>, <em> ‘</em> Philip,’ being asked at Smyrna to let loose a lion on Polycarp, and declining to do so.

<p><strong> Which</strong> <strong> were</strong> <strong> his friends. </strong> It has been often observed in the course of St. Paul’s anxious, toilsome life, how singularly courteous, even friendly to him were so many of those in high official position with whom he was brought into contact; for instance, the great Roman officials in Cyprus and in Achaia, Sergius Paulus and Gallio, Felix and Festus in Cæsarea, these chiefs of Asia; the centurion who had charge of Paul in the voyage of the 27th chapter. It is, however, probable that among these ‘Asiarchs’ were some secret members of the brotherhood of Christ, and that these influenced their colleagues. Paul’s influence, we know, must have been very great, and his Master’s religion had already struck deep root in Ephesus and the neighbouring Asian cities; Christian converts were by no means confined to the <strong> </strong> lower stratum of society.
