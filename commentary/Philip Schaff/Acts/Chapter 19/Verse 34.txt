<p><strong> All with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. </strong> This strange repetition was no mere tumultuous cry; nor was it only an expression of fervid loyalty to the goddess, whose shrine they thought made Ephesus rich and prosperous; but it was no doubt an act of worship. Compare a similar procedure on the part of the worshippers of Baal in the days of Ahab and Jezebel, who ‘from morn even until noon cried, saying, O Baal, hear us!’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:26">1 Kings 18:26</span>), and see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:7">Matthew 6:7</span>. The custom of the Mohammedans and the worshippers of Brahma in India to this day is well known, and they often for entire days practise these vain senseless repetitions.
