<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:37">Acts 19:37</span>. <strong> Neither robbers of churches.</strong> This rendering is liable to mislead the modern reader. In the time when the English Version was made, it was by no means unusual to style a heathen temple a ‘church’ or a ‘chapel.’

<p><strong> Nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</strong> Deeds of violence belonged to an age long subsequent to the apostles. To undermine the Pagan religions, they adopted other means than pillage or destruction. St. Paul’s address to the Athenians on the Hill of Ares (Mars) was an instance of <em> his </em> treatment of the ancient superstition. He hurt no ancient prejudices, no time-honoured customs, by rude invective. He was no blasphemer of the ancient gods of Greece and Rome, but led men to the knowledge of the truth by gentle but far more effective means. We can imagine the painful surprise with which St. Paul would read the coarse language and the bitter, angry eloquence of one like Tertullian. St. Paul and his immediate followers no doubt owed not a little of their wonderful influence over men’s hearts to their winning and graceful courtesy, to their chivalrous consideration for the feelings of others. Paul’s Master, on whom the great disciple modelled his ways of life, was ever gentle to those utterly ignorant of the truth. His fiery wrath was especially reserved for those who knew their Lord’s will and only <em> pretended</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> to <strong> </strong> do <strong> </strong> it.
