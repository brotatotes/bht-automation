Acts 19:39.  It shall be determined in a lawful assembly. The crowd of citizens he was then addressing was simply a popular gathering; their decisions could have no weight. Such a meeting would only tend to damage the city in the eyes of the Roman government. The ‘lawful assembly’ ( ε ̓ κκλησι ́ α ͅ)   was one formally summoned. A free city like Ephesus had the right to call such a meeting together for the purpose of deliberation.
