Acts 19:40.  For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar.  Men of the rank of the ‘town-clerk’ of Ephesus well knew how probable it was that a tumultuous meeting which endangered the public peace would be inquired into by the Roman officials. The prized liberties of their city might in consequence have been forfeited. There was a Roman law which made it a capital offence to raise a riot. ‘Qui cœtum et concursum fecerit capitate sit’ (Seneca,  Controv.  iii. 8). ‘Qui cœtum et concursum fecerit capite puniatur Sulpicius Victor’  (Instit. orat.,  quoted by Gloag).
