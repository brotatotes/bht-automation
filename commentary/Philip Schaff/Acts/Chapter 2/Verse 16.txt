Acts 2:16.  This is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel.   This,  namely, the wonderful utterances of praise, the crowds from so many nations had been just listening to. The quotation, with a few unimportant variations (which will be noticed in their places), is from the LXX., Joel 3:1-5, Hebrew, Acts 2:28-30. The passage from Joel is describing the signs which were to herald the beginning of the Messianic period, ‘the last days of the world’s history.’
