Acts 2:21.  And it shall come to pass, that who-so ever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  St. Peter here winds up the first division of his discourse, turning from theology to life, telling men and women of all races and ages the name of Him who could save them in all and through all, if they would only call upon Him.
