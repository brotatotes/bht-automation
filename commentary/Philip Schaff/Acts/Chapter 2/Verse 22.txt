<p><em> Second Division of St. Peter’s Discourse, </em> 22-28.

<p>St. Peter declares the name of that Lord who will save all the children of men who choose to call <strong> </strong> upon Him.

<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22">Acts 2:22</span>. <strong> Jesus of Nazareth. </strong> The words ‘of Nazareth’ are added as His usual designation among the Jews, the name ‘Jesus’ not being an uncommon one. It was the title affixed to the cross.
	</p>
<p><strong> A man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs. </strong> That is, a man divinely accredited as Messiah by His wonderful works. Gloag well quotes Nicodemus’ argument from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:2">John 3:2</span>: ‘We know that Thou art a Teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that Thou doest, except God be with him.’
