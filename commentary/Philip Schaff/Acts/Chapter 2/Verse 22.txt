 Second Division of St. Peter’s Discourse,  22-28.
	St. Peter declares the name of that Lord who will save all the children of men who choose to call   upon Him.
	Acts 2:22.  Jesus of Nazareth.  The words ‘of Nazareth’ are added as His usual designation among the Jews, the name ‘Jesus’ not being an uncommon one. It was the title affixed to the cross.
	 A man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs.  That is, a man divinely accredited as Messiah by His wonderful works. Gloag well quotes Nicodemus’ argument from John 3:2: ‘We know that Thou art a Teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that Thou doest, except God be with him.’
