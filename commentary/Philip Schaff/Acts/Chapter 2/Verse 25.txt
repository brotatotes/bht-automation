<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:25">Acts 2:25</span>. <strong> For David speaketh concerning </strong> him. To show it was no new idea of his, that death could not hold the ‘Holy One of God,’ St. Peter quotes the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:0">Psalms 16:0</span>, where David writes of the sure hope of a joyous future life with God. This sure hope of immortality is the spirit of the Psalm; but as St. Peter shows (and also St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:36">Acts 13:36</span>), the first and primary instance of one entering into eternal life must be sought in the person of one so raised from the dead before corruption could seize upon the dead one’s body. This is what happened to Peter’s crucified Master: therefore it was of Him that the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David wrote. <strong> I foresaw the Lord always before my face. </strong> ‘I foresaw’ signifies simply, ‘I saw the Lord always before me.’
