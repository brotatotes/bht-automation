<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:26">Acts 2:26</span>. <strong> Therefore did my heart rejoice. </strong> These words describe Messiah’s glad consciousness on earth of His oneness with the Father; for an expression of this, compare the words of Jesus on the occasion of the raising of Lazarus (St. John, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:42">John 11:42</span>), ‘I know that Thou hearest me always.’

<p><strong> And my tongue was glad, </strong> η ̔ γλω ͂ σσα ́ μου <em> , </em> LXX. The Hebrew has בּ ְב וֹ רִי <em> glory </em> (that is, <em> my</em> <em> soul), </em> whose pre-eminent dignity in man the Hebrews recognised by this paraphrase. Wordsworth remarks that this paraphrase of the LXX. of ‘my glory’ by ‘my tongue,’ was very appropriate on that day of Pentecost, when, in a special manner, the tongues of the apostles were made instruments for declaring God’s glory in the world.

<p><strong> Moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope. </strong> Christ expresses His confidence that His very flesh would rest <em> in the grave in </em> sure and confident hope. The ground of this hope appears in the next verse.
