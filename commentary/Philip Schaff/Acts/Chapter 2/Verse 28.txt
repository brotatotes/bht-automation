<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:28">Acts 2:28</span>. <strong> Thou hast made known</strong> <strong> to me the ways of life. </strong> The thoughts of the Redeemer on earth are still being expressed. To Him in His deep humiliation were made known by the Father <strong> </strong> those mysterious ways which lead through death to life. He knew when He had endured the pain and agony of the cross, when He had tasted the bitterness of death in all its fulness, death would be powerless to hold Him. The ways of life to Him meant the resurrection and the ascension.

<p><strong> Thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance</strong>. The heart of man cannot realise that joy in all its depth and fulness, when to the glory which the Only-begotten had with the Father before the world was, was added the glory of the world’s redemption. It was for that ‘joy which was set before Him, that He endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God <em> ’ </em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span>).
