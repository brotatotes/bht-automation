We have a mention of the sepulchre of David on the return of Judah from Babylon (Nehemiah 3:16). His resting-place was violated by the high priest, John Hyrcanus, and also by Herod the Great. The first found a treasure of money, the second some gold furniture in it. Jerome (end of 4th century) tells us that the tomb was visited in his day.
