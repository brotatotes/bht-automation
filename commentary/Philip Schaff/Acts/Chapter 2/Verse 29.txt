<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:29">Acts 2:29</span>. <strong> Let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David. </strong> Freely (‘frei und offen,’ Meyer and Ewald), without fear of being thought unjust to the great memory of the royal patriarch, the founder of the kingly house of Judah.

<p><strong> That he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us. </strong> This was a notorious fact. No one ever pretended that King David had risen; his tomb all knew. We have a mention of the sepulchre of David on the return of Judah from Babylon (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ne+3:16">Nehemiah 3:16</span>). His resting-place was violated by the high priest, John Hyrcanus, and also by Herod the Great. The first found a treasure of money, the second some gold furniture in it. Jerome (end of 4th century) tells us that the tomb was visited in his day.
