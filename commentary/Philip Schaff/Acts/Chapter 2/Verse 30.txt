<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:30">Acts 2:30</span>. <strong> Therefore being a prophet. </strong> ‘In the stricter sense, a foreteller of future events by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit’ (Alford). Jesus Himself expressly speaks of David writing ‘in the Spirit’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:43">Matthew 22:43</span>).

<p><strong> And knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne. </strong> The words of the prophet Nathan to King David are here referred to (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:12-13">2 Samuel 7:12-13</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+132:11-12">Psalms 132:11-12</span>, this solemn promise of the Most High is expressly referred to. It is, of course, impossible to say what was David’s exact idea of this great One who was to descend from him. From the words of Nathan’s prophecy, he must have gathered that no <em> mere man </em> among his descendants could ever establish the throne of his kingdom <em> for ever </em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:13">2 Samuel 7:13</span>), or sit upon his throne for <em> evermore </em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+132:12">Psalms 132:12</span>). We may conclude with certainty that the psalmist king did connect that descendant of his, of whom he spoke ‘in the Spirit’ in such strange grand terms, with the idea of the Messiah.
