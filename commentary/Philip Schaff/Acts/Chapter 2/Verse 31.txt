Acts 2:31.  He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left  in  hell, neither did his flesh see corruption.  David as a seer looking ( παίδων ) into the far future, wrote of this great Descendant of his of whom the prophet Nathan had spoken as establishing the throne of his kingdom  for ever as One who should die and yet should not see corruption, for He should be raised from the dead.
