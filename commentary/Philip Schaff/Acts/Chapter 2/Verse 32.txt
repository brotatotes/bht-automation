<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:32">Acts 2:32</span>. <strong> This Jesus hath God raised up. </strong> Looking back to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:24">Acts 2:24</span>, this Jesus whom you all knew about so well as David’s descendant has fulfilled all the varied details of this marvellous prophecy; for as <em> you </em> know He was dead, He is risen again. </p>
<p><strong> Whereof we are all witnesses. </strong> No doubt here pointing to the ‘hundred and twenty’ on whom the gift of the Spirit had fallen, who, to the astonishment of the crowds, had been speaking in the many tongues, and who all <em> had seen the Lord </em> after the resurrection.
