St. Peter now having spoken of his Master’s resurrection and of the literal fulfilment of the prophecy respecting death being powerless to hold Him, takes up as it were the interrupted thread in the Psalm, and proceeds to speak of the exaltation of Messiah at the right hand of God where the Psalm leaves the ‘Holy One’ enthroned. </p>
<p><strong> And having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. </strong> From His mediatorial throne at the right hand of God, Christ poured out the Spirit, said St. Peter, on these, as ye now see, just as He promised His own when He was with them on earth (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16-17">John 14:16-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:4">Acts 1:4</span>).

<p>On the question of the translation ‘to the right hand,’ this construction of a verb of motion with the dative τῇ δεξιῇ . . . . ύψωθςίς is found in classical writers only among the poets, though such a usage occurs in later writers. The undoubted connection with the concluding words of the great prophecy of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:0">Psalms 16:0</span> (see Ewald’s masterly paraphrase of the whole passage), leads us without hesitation to adopt this rendering in preference to the usual translation ‘by the right hand,’ with many of the best of the modern commentators, Neander, Olshausen, De Wette, Hackett, Wordsworth, etc.
