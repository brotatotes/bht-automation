<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:36">Acts 2:36</span>. <strong> Let all the house of Israel know assuredly. </strong> Conclusion of the discourse. The whole of this first apostolic sermon was addressed to f <em> etus. </em> St. Peter in his argument lays little stress on the miracles of the Lord. He only alludes to them in passing, and argues alone from fulfilled prophecy, with which a Jew would be familiar. He showed from a passage in Joel, well known to his listeners, that the outpouring of the Spirit and its results, which they had just witnessed, was exactly what was foretold for the days of the Messiah. He then proceeded to point out that his Master, who had died and risen again, had fulfilled in every particular the strange prophecies contained in two famous Messianic Psalms. God hath made that same Jesus . . . Lord and Christ God hath made Him ‘Lord of all’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:36">Acts 10:36</span>) by exalting Him to His right hand, and ‘Christ’ (the Greek equivalent for the Hebrew ‘Messiah,’ the ‘Anointed’) the One whom Israel looked forward to as their Deliverer and Redeemer for time and eternity. Meyer and also Gloag well remark here, that whilst on earth Jesus was equally ‘Lord and Christ,’ but that then He was in the form of a servant, having emptied Himself of His power and glory, but by the resurrection and ascension was He openly declared to be so. </p>
<p><strong> Whom ye have crucified.</strong> These words in the original Greek close the discourse. This glorious One, now reigning with all power from His throne at the right hand of God, Messiah and King, is no other than that Jesus <em> whom ye crucified.
