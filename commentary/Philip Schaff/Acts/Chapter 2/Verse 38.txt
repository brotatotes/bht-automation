<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span>. <strong> Be baptized.</strong> The rite of baptism was well known to the Jews: they used to baptize proselytes and their children. </p>
<p><strong> In the name of Jesus Christ.</strong> Their belief in Jesus was the ground on which they were to be baptized (Meyer). Here only do we find the expression ‘to be baptized <em> in </em> the name’ ( ε ̓ πι ̀); in all other places it is ‘ <em> into </em> the name’ ( ει ̓ ς ), chap, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:16">Acts 8:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>, etc.; and ‘ <em> in </em> the name’ ( ε ̓ ν ), chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:48">Acts 10:48</span>. It has been suggested (by De Wette and also Hackett) that the usual formula <em> into </em> ( ει ̓ ς ) has been avoided here for the sake of euphony, as ει ̓ ς ; occurs in the next clause ( ει ̓ ς ἄφεσιν ), ‘for the remission.’
