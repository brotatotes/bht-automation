Acts 2:38.  Be baptized. The rite of baptism was well known to the Jews: they used to baptize proselytes and their children.  In the name of Jesus Christ. Their belief in Jesus was the ground on which they were to be baptized (Meyer). Here only do we find the expression ‘to be baptized  in  the name’ ( ε ̓ πι ̀); in all other places it is ‘  into  the name’ ( ει ̓ ς ), chap, Acts 8:16; Matthew 28:19, etc.; and ‘  in  the name’ ( ε ̓ ν ), chap. Acts 10:48. It has been suggested (by De Wette and also Hackett) that the usual formula  into  ( ει ̓ ς ) has been avoided here for the sake of euphony, as ει ̓ ς ; occurs in the next clause ( ει ̓ ς ἄφεσιν ), ‘for the remission.’
