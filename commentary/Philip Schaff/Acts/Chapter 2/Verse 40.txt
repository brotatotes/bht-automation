<p><strong> From this untoward generation that is,</strong> from that wicked Jewish people who had filled up the cup of their iniquity by the murder of the Holy One and Just, and who were doomed to destruction. The siege and utter ruin of Jerusalem, and the destruction of the whole Jewish polity, took place about thirty-seven years after the day on which these words were spoken. Compare our Lord’s words, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:41">Luke 9:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:29-32">Luke 2:29-32</span>.
