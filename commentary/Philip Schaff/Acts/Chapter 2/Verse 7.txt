Acts 2:7.  Behold, are not all these which speak, Galileans?  The frequenters of that house, where the ‘hundred and twenty’ were gathered together, were no doubt well known to the ‘devout men,’ who had made the Holy City their home, to be at least for the most part from Galilee. Provincials, notoriously rough and usually of little culture, were men most unlikely to be acquainted with foreign idioms. The name ‘Galilean’ is used here strictly in a geographical sense. It was not until a later period that the followers of Jesus of Nazareth were styled reproachfully,  Galileans.
