Acts 2:34-35.  For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool.  The preacher, here fearful lest any should still suspect that King David was the One spoken of throughout the great passage he had been quoting, as a climax to his argument quotes King David’s own words from the 110th Psalm, where the psalmist king speaks more clearly and fully (than in Psalms 16:0) about the throne at God’s right hand, and by his plain unmistakeable words for ever sets aside all idea that in the famous passage of the 16th Psalm he was writing of himself, for he identifies the One who should sit at the right hand of the Eternal  as his Lord  (Acts 2:1),  as the looked for Messiah  (Acts 2:1-7).
	The 110th Psalm is quoted by the Lord Jesus (Matthew 22:43; Mark 12:36). ‘The Saviour recognizes David as the author of the Psalm, and attributes to him a divine inspiration in speaking thus of the Messiah’ (Hackett). On the question of Christ sitting at the right hand of God, Dr. Hackett quotes from Prof. Stuart, who remarks: In the New Testament where Christ is represented as sitting on the right hand of Divine Majesty (Hebrews 1:3), or at the right hand of God (Acts 2:23, and Hebrews 10:12), or at the right hand of the throne of God (Hebrews 12:2), participation in supreme dominion is most clearly meant (comp. 1 Peter 3:22; Romans 8:34; Mark 16:19; Philippians 2:6-11; Ephesians 1:20-23).
