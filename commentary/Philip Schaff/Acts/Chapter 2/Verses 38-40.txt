<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38-40">Acts 2:38-40</span>. The exquisite tact and courtesy so marked in all the early Christian writings, and especially in the apostolic letters and sermons we possess, is very remarkable in this little <em> resume </em> of the first great Christian address. St. Peter forbears all reproach, for they were fully conscious now of what they had done. He only now invited them to join the company of believers, for the glorious promises he had been telling them of were expressly made to them and their children. Repent. The Greek word μετανοη ́ σατε does not signify mere sorrow for sin, but it imports change of mind. Alford well puts it: ‘Here the change (was to be) from thinking Jesus an impostor and scorning Him as one crucified, to being baptized in His name and looking to Him for remission of sins and the gift of the Spirit.’
