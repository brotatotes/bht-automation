<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:44-45">Acts 2:44-45</span>. The question of ‘community of goods in the early Church’ is discussed in Excursus (B) at the end of this chapter. </p>
<p><strong> And all that believed were together. </strong> This means that they assembled together. There were probably, even at this early period, several places of assembly for the followers of Jesus at Jerusalem. </p>
<p><strong> And had all things common, </strong> etc. There is no doubt but that this was an attempt to live as nearly as possible the life lived by Jesus and His disciples during the days of His ministry on earth, when literally they had all things common. In the Excursus (B) the limitations of this community of goods are fully considered. We must, however, bear in mind that this communism among the early Christians only existed at Jerusalem, and then was certainly not compulsory or universal even in the first days.
