<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:10">Acts 20:10</span>. <strong> And Paul went down, and fell on him, and, embracing him, said, Trouble</strong> <strong> not yourselves</strong>; <strong> for</strong> <strong> his</strong> <strong> life</strong> <strong> is in him. </strong> The example here of Elijah when he restored to life the dead son of the widow of Zarephath (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:21">1 Kings 17:21</span>), and of Elisha when he raised from the dead the only child of his kind Shunammite hostess (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ki+4:34">2 Kings 4:34</span>), is here closely imitated by this other favoured servant of the Eternal God. The accurate and vivid picture given us here by the compiler of the ‘Acts,’ tells us how lasting an impression the whole scene made upon the companion of Paul. Professor Plumptre strikingly calls attention to the unruffled composure of the apostle, sure of his prayer for power to restore life in this instance being granted, contrasted with the hurry and terrified confusion of the dismayed bystanders: ‘The whole scene is painted vividly by an eyewitness. We have to think of the cries of alarm, the rush of men down the staircase from the third floor with lamps and torches in their hands, the wail of sorrow ... the undisturbed calmness of the apostle, sure that his prayer was answered.’
