Acts 20:12.  And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.  As in the case of the little daughter of Jairus, when the Lord commanded that something should be given to her to eat at once, so here evidently some special care and attention was given to the young man that nature might be recruited, and that the awful shock which the system had suffered might be recovered from. Stress should be laid on the word ‘alive,’ as standing with the word ‘dead’ in Acts 20:9. His friends and fellow-worshippers ‘were not a little comforted’ by the restoration to life again of one whom they were already mourning for as dead; but their joy was doubtless greatly increased by the powerful witness to the truth of their belief which such a notable miracle afforded. They felt, then, these Christians of Troas, in a way possibly they had never felt before, that, when two or three were gathered together, there the Lord was indeed in the midst.
