 St. Paul pursues his Journey to Jerusalem  From Assos he sails along the Coasts of Asia  On his Arrival at Miletus he sends for the Elders of the Church of Ephesus,  13-17.
	Acts 20:13.  And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so he had appointed, minding himself to go afoot.  Luke, the compiler of the ‘Acts,’ and the other companions of the apostle, on the day succeeding the memorable night spent in the upper chamber with the Christians of Troas, went on board and sailed for the south, Paul determining to join the ship at Assos, only some twenty miles distant by road from Troas, but the voyage round Cape Lectum was nearly twice as far. He wished, perhaps, to secure a few more hours with his disciples at Troas, and also a quiet, solitary time of meditation as he went alone by the road to the point where he had fixed to join the ship and his friends. He doubtless, in these solitary hours, pondered over the subjects of that famous farewell address he was about to deliver to his friends, the elders of the Ephesian congregation he loved so dearly. Assos is called by Pliny Apollonia; it was a seaport of Mysia, and thus was reckoned in Proconsular Asia. Its modern name is Beahrahm. Vast ruins still mark the site of the ancient city, and speak with silent eloquence of its bygone importance.
