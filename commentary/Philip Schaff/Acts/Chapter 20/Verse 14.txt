Acts 20:14.  And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in,  and  came to Mitylene.  Mitylene is about thirty miles from Assos, and is the capital of the island of Lesbos. Horace styles it ‘fair Mitylene’  (Epist. i. (1-17). It is famed for its beautiful situation and the magnificence of its buildings. It was the birthplace of Sappho and the poet Alcæus. The modern city on the same site is called Castro.
