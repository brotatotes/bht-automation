<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:15">Acts 20:15</span>. <strong> And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios. </strong> Chios was an island off the coast of Ionia, celebrated for its wine. It was the scene of the massacre of the Greeks by the Turks in 1822. Chios was famous, even among these <strong> </strong> fairest regions of the <strong> </strong> earth, for its marvellous beauty. There was a <strong> </strong> modern Greek proverb which spoke of the modern Sciots in language akin to that used by Paul, when writing to Titus of the Cretes (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:12">Titus 1:12</span>): ‘It were easier to find a green horse than a sober-minded Sciot.’

<p><strong> And the next day we arrived at Samos. </strong> This island was only separated from Lydia by a narrow channel.

<p><strong> And tarried at Trogyllium. </strong> This was the name of a city and a promontory between Ephesus and the mouth of the Meander, at the foot of Mount Mycale.

<p><strong> And the next day we came to Miletus. </strong> Miletus was one of the most famous names in remote history; it was more ancient than its modern rival Ephesus, which had, however, in Paul’s day, far outstripped it in wealth and grandeur. Homer writes of ‘Carian Miletus.’ It had sent out as many as eighty colonies. But for a long period before St. Paul visited it, it had been gradually sinking in importance, and then ranked only among the second-rate cities of that populous seaboard of Asia, It is now a swamp, with but few ruins to mark the site of the once-famed city. Miletus lay some thirty miles to the south of Ephesus.
