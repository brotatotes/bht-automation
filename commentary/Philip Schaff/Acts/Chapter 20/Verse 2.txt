Acts 20:2.  And when he had gone  over those parts, and had given  them  much  exhortation, he came into Greece.  That is, when St. Paul had visited the cities Philippi, Berea, Thessalonica, etc., on the eastern or  Ægean  side of Northern Greece or Macedonia, and had preached his Master’s   gospel on the eastern or Adriatic coast, roughly termed Illyricum, he came into the southern province, here termed ‘Hellas’ (Greece), that   is to say, into the Roman province of Achaia; and   here he at once sought out its principal city, his old home and scene of former labours, the great western centre of the Christianity of the first days, Corinth.
