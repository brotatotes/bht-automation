Acts 20:21.  Repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. These two make up the sum of all Christian doctrine a change of heart, and then a return to God and faith in the Lord Jesus.
	The one cannot be separated from the other. True faith cannot exist without the sorrowful heart. Again, repentance without faith in Christ is without comfort or hope, and ends too surely in faint-heartedness and despair. All efforts at self-redemption have been found again and again utterly useless.
