Acts 20:22.  And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things which shall befall me there. Some commentators have understood these words as though Paul was constrained by the ‘Holy Spirit’ to journey to Jerusalem, in other words, ‘was going to Jerusalem on the impulse of the Holy Spirit.’ It is better, however, to refer the words ‘in the Spirit’ to Paul’s own spirit; for in the following verse we have the word πνεῡμα ,  spirit,  apparently distinguished from ‘spirit’ in this verse by the epithet τὸ ἅγιον ,  the holy,  in the English Version rendered ‘Holy Ghost.’ The meaning here without doubt is, ‘Urged by an intense sense of duty, Paul was going up to the Holy City.’ He was so persuaded that this was right, that no prospect of danger deterred him, no urgent affectionate entreaties moved him from his purpose.
	He was ignorant what the dangers were which too surely would meet him. He only knew that some terrible trial certainly awaited him in that city. The Holy Ghost in some mysterious way had forewarned him of this.
