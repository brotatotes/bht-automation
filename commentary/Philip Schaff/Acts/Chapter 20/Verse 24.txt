Acts 20:24.  But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself. ‘We note the parallelism with Luther’s famous declaration when warned by his friends not to go to Worms, “  I will go thither, though there should be devils on every house-top ”’   (Professor Plumptre).
	 So that I might finish my course with joy.  The same words and the same thought re-occur in the Second Epistle to Timothy, only there the goal was in sight, and Paul wrote, ‘I have finished my course’ (2 Timothy 4:7).
	An interesting thought has been suggested by Acts 20:22-24. It must be remembered, however, that it is  only  a supposition. Paul has been speaking with a sad presentiment of the things which shall befall him in Jerusalem; prophets enlightened by the Holy Ghost tell him that bonds and afflictions await him; he himself attaches no value to his life, and knows that the congregation which he has founded shall see him no more. It seems as though it had been determined in the counsels of God that Paul should be allowed to die in Jerusalem as a martyr, but that God had graciously looked at the tears and intercessions in behalf of the apostle on the part of all the Gentile congregations, and in compliance with their many earnest prayers had allowed him to be rescued by the Romans with a view to several years more of life and ministry.
