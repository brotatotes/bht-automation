Acts 20:26.  Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.  The thought and language here was one familiar to Paul. He derived it from the well-known words of the prophet Ezekiel, ‘When I say unto the wicked, They shall surely die;  and thou givest him not warnings  nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but  his blood will I require at thine hand’ (Ezekiel 3:18). He, Paul, as they well knew, was innocent of all neglect. His ceaseless, self-denying labours among the people at Ephesus would at least free him from that blood-guiltiness. If any man perishes, I am not myself guilty.
