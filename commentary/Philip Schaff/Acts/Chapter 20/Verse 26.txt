<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:26">Acts 20:26</span>. <strong> Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. </strong> The thought and language here was one familiar to Paul. He derived it from the well-known words of the prophet Ezekiel, ‘When I say unto the wicked, They shall surely die; <em> and thou givest him not warnings </em> nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but <em> his blood will I require at thine hand’</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eze+3:18">Ezekiel 3:18</span>). He, Paul, as they well knew, was innocent of all neglect. His ceaseless, self-denying labours among the people at Ephesus would at least free him from that blood-guiltiness. If any man perishes, I am not myself guilty.
