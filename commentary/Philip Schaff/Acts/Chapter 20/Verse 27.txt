Acts 20:27.  For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. The counsel of God is His counsel of redemption and grace, and the universality of His redeeming work; and all this he had not only declared in his teaching, but also by his example and life. It has been suggested with considerable probability that the words ‘all the counsel of God’ point to a greater degree of receptivity for Divine truth than had been found elsewhere; so he points out in the Epistle to the Ephesians. He speaks to them as able to understand his knowledge in the mystery of Christ, and the brotherhood of mankind in the common Fatherhood of God.
