Even in the New Testament writings, no fewer than six <strong> </strong> of the pioneers of these fatal teachers of error are mentioned as belonging to Ephesus. In the First Epistle to Timothy we hear of Hymenæus and Alexander (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:20">Acts 1:20</span>). In the Second Epistle to the same chief presbyter of Ephesus, mention is made of Phygellus and Hermogenes <strong> </strong> (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15">Acts 1:15</span>), and of Philetus (chap, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span>). These Epistles were written in A.D. 65-66. In the Third Epistle of John, who lived at Ephesus, written about A.D. 90, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:9">Acts 20:9</span>, we read of another of these false teachers, Diotrephes.

<p>In the Apocalypse, written A.D. 80-90, in the Epistle addressed to the angel of the Church in this same city of Ephesus, it is said that there were <strong> </strong> among them those who held the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:6">Acts 2:6</span>), ‘which I also hate.’ Church history (Eusebius, <em> H</em>. <em> E. </em> iv. 14) recounts, too, how the Apostle John met with the heresiarch Cerinthus during his residence at Ephesus. ‘Ephesus,’ observes Creuzer (quoted by Gloag), ‘was above all others the place where oriental views were in various ways combined with the mythology and philosophy of Greece; in truth, this city was a complete storehouse of magical arts and deceptions’ (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:19">Acts 19:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:35">Acts 19:35</span>).
