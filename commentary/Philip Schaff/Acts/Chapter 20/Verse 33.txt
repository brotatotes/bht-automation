Acts 20:33.  I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.  In other words, ‘I seek not yours, but you.’ Even in those early days of the Faith, covetousness, the love of gold and wealth, and the things gold and wealth can purchase, was after all the greatest temptation in a minister’s life. Then as now, now as then! How earnestly Paul strove against even the very shadow of appearance of evil in this matter, we have constant and ample testimony. Rather than even receive gifts which would supply him with the necessaries of life, this scholar, teacher, and missionary would work for himself in the workshop of an Aquila at the rough haircloths used for tents. See, for instance, the statement in the next verse, and such references as 2Th 3:10-12 ; 1 Corinthians 4:11-12; Acts 18:3. The same grave warning was given some years later to his loved disciple Timothy, himself subsequently the chief presbyter in this same Church of Ephesus, when, after having in strong, vigorous language told his friend of the temptations of the rich, and the lusts, foolish and hurtful, these fell into, ‘for the love of money was the root of all evil,’ he turns to Timothy with the noble, simple appeal: ‘But thou, O man of God, flee these things.’ Be thou above coveting these dangerous, soul-destroying riches. ‘Apparel’ is here added to gold and silver, because in all times rich and costly apparel has formed a conspicuous part of the wealth and possessions of an opulent oriental household. Eastern people were in the habit of trafficking in and also of keeping in store these costly garments; hence the allusion in Matthew 6:19 to the power not only of rust, but of the  moth  (see, too, James 5:2). The Ephesians, we read, were celebrated for their luxurious apparel (  Athenaeus,  quoted by Gloag).
