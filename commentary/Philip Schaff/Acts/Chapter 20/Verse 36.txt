 The Last Prayer and the Farewell  Paul leaves Miletus,  36-38.
	Acts 20:36.  And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down.  We are acquainted with the attitude which prevailed among Christians in very early times. They were in the habit of  kneeling  in prayer on ordinary occasions, but they considered  standing  in prayer the posture most fitting for praise and thanksgiving; so usually on the first day of the week the Lord’s day they prayed ‘standing.’ This posture in prayer was also adopted during the seven weeks which intervened between Passover and Pentecost, roughly speaking, the ‘forty days,’ as they considered this a period of joy and thanksgiving.
