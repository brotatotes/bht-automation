Acts 20:37.  And fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him.  These demonstrative expressions of affection are in accordance with eastern customs (see Genesis 45:14; Genesis 46:29). The word is a strong one, and might be rendered, ‘kept tenderly kissing him.’ The Greek word here used we find in the description of the traitor Judas kissing the Lord in Gethsemane, where it describes the affected earnestness of the fatal kiss.
