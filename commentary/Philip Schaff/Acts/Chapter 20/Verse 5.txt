<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:5">Acts 20:5</span>. <strong> These, going before, tarried for us at Troas. </strong> Here the language of the narrative (see remarks on the preceding verse) suddenly changes from the third person to the first. Briefly to recapitulate, the close personal connection of Luke and Paul appears to have dated from the years 51-52. They were together evidently from the time of the arrival of Paul at Troas (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:8">Acts 16:8</span>); they crossed over together into Europe, but when Paul left Philippi (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:40">Acts 16:40</span>), the physician-friend of the great apostle was left behind in that city, and it has been supposed that the Evangelist made Philippi the centre of his work for several years. Here again at Philippi, after the lapse of some six or seven years, the beloved physician again joins his friend and master. The rest of the narrative of the ‘Acts’ is told us by an eye-witness of the various events recorded. We may therefore conclude with certainty that from this time, that is, from the arrival at Philippi (A.D. 57), till Paul was entrusted to the charge of the soldier at Rome (A.D. 62), Luke was never separated from his beloved master (see also note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:10">Acts 16:10</span>).

<p>Two reasons have been, with much probability, suggested for Paul remaining at Philippi, while his companions went on before him to Troas. The first, that they should make all possible arrangements for the gathering of the disciples of Troas and the neighbourhood to meet the apostle; and the second, that Paul might keep the Passover feast with all quiet solemnity. We know he was ever anxious to conciliate his countrymen, and whenever he could do so without sacrifice of principle. The presence of his Gentile companions who went on before him into Asia (Troas), would have been an hindrance and a stumbling-block to him on this occasion, when he, no doubt, hoped to win some of his dearly-loved brother Jews to the side of his Master Christ. ‘For us,’ that is, for Luke and Paul.
