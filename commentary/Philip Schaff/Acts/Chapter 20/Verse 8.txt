<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:8">Acts 20:8</span>. <strong> And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together. </strong> All the little details of this memorable scene are carefully recorded; the very appearance of the brilliantly-lighted upper chamber; the lateness of the hour; the length of Paul’s sermon. The writer, Luke, had just joined his loved master again, and naturally all the circumstances which accompanied the first remarkable event which took place after their reunion, stamped themselves on the ‘beloved physician’s mind. The many lamps mentioned had no special significance; the Jews were accustomed, on their festal days, brilliantly to light their rooms for any great solemnity. The fact is probably mentioned to account for the sleep of Eutychus, which, no doubt after the fatigue of a long working day, was induced by the heat of the crowded, lit-up room.
