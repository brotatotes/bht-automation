He was now only two days’ easy journey from Jerusalem, which he intended to reach by Pentecost.

<p>The following table, compiled by Dr. Gloag, derived from the diary of the writer of the ‘Acts,’ will show how St. Paul had been enabled to accomplish his purpose of reaching Jerusalem before the Pentecostal feast (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:16">Acts 20:16</span>): </p>
<p>Paul leaves Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:6">Acts 20:6</span>), that is, after Passover 6 days And came to Troas in 5 days Where he abode 7 days Voyage from Troas to Miletus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:13-15">Acts 20:13-15</span>) 4 days At Miletus 2 days Miletus to Patara (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:1">Acts 21:1</span>) 4 days Patara to Tyre, (about) 4 days He remained in Tyre 7 days Tyre to Ptolemais 1 day Ptolemais to Caesarea 2 days He remained in Caesarea 5 or 6 days Caesarea to Jerusalem 2 days On the fiftieth day after Passover, the feast of Pentecost occurred.

<p><strong> There came down from Judæa a certain prophet, named Agabus. </strong> This is the same Agabus whom we read of in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>; we are sure of his identity with the foreteller of the famine in the days of Claudius Cæsar the name, the office, and the residence being the same in both instances. Fifteen or sixteen years had elapsed since Agabus of Jerusalem had prophesied before the Church of Antioch; he had doubtless now come down from the Holy City to meet Paul at Cæsarea.
