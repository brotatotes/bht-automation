Acts 21:10.  And as we tarried there many days.  ‘Many;’ the Greek word thus rendered is in the comparative degree, and apparently signifies that Paul and his companions tarried in Cæsarea ‘more days’ than at first they had intended. He was now only two days’ easy journey from Jerusalem, which he intended to reach by Pentecost.
	The following table, compiled by Dr. Gloag, derived from the diary of the writer of the ‘Acts,’ will show how St. Paul had been enabled to accomplish his purpose of reaching Jerusalem before the Pentecostal feast (Acts 20:16): Paul leaves Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread (Acts 20:6), that is, after Passover 6 days And came to Troas in 5 days Where he abode 7 days Voyage from Troas to Miletus (Acts 20:13-15) 4 days At Miletus 2 days Miletus to Patara (Acts 21:1) 4 days Patara to Tyre, (about) 4 days He remained in Tyre 7 days Tyre to Ptolemais 1 day Ptolemais to Caesarea 2 days He remained in Caesarea 5 or 6 days Caesarea to Jerusalem 2 days On the fiftieth day after Passover, the feast of Pentecost occurred.
	 There came down from Judæa a certain prophet, named Agabus.  This is the same Agabus whom we read of in chap. Acts 11:28; we are sure of his identity with the foreteller of the famine in the days of Claudius Cæsar the name, the office, and the residence being the same in both instances. Fifteen or sixteen years had elapsed since Agabus of Jerusalem had prophesied before the Church of Antioch; he had doubtless now come down from the Holy City to meet Paul at Cæsarea.
