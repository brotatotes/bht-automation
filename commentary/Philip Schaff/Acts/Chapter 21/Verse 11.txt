Acts 21:11.  And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle and bound his own hands and feet, and said.  The loose flowing robes worn in eastern countries are bound about the waist with a sash or girdle. Taking this from the apostle, the Christian prophet, in the dramatic way with which the old seers of Israel were wont to deliver their prophecies, revealed to Paul the peculiar form of danger which surely awaited him in the ancient capital of the people. Hitherto the prophetic voices had simply spoken of perils awaiting his arrival; Agabus now signifies the exact nature of the danger. He would be delivered by his own countrymen under some grave, probably capital charge into the hands of the Roman government. We have many instances in the Old Testament of similar symbolical prophecies; for instance, the horns of iron of Zedekiah when he prophesied before the kings of Judah and Israel (1 Kings 22:11); the walking naked and barefoot of Isaiah (Isaiah 20:2-3); the marred linen girdle of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 13:4-9); the tile with the city of Jerusalem portrayed upon it (Ezekiel 4:1-2); the iron pan of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 4:3), etc.
	There were even darker plots in store threatening the life of the brave apostle, plots known no doubt to the inspired prophet (see Acts 23:12). He would warn the well-known Christian leader, and if possible prevent his coming up to the Pentecostal feast.
	 Thus saith the Holy Ghost.  A solemn formula, corresponding to the well-known Old Testament נְאֻם יְה וֹ ָה ,  Thus saith the Lord.
