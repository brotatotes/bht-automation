<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:14">Acts 21:14</span>. <strong> We ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</strong> It seems very probable that this expression of resignation to the Divine will, to which the brethren so reverently bowed, was a quotation from the Lord’s Prayer, and such a use of one of its petitions suggests to us that the Christians of the Apostolic Age were in the habit of frequently using this model of prayer designed for them by their Master. On these words St. Bernard very beautifully writes: ‘We say daily in the Lord’s Prayer, “Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.” Oh, how pure and serene is our life when <em> that </em> will alone directs us, and when not a trace of our own will remains behind! With such a frame of mind, we become like unto God.’
