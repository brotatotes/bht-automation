<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:16">Acts 21:16</span>. <strong> There went with us also certain of the disciples of Cæsarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge. </strong> This rendering of the Greek words is a possible one. A simpler way, however, of translating the original, and one, too, that affords a better sense, is: ‘There went with us also certain of the disciples of Cæsarea, conducting us to Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.’ The chief object apparently of the Cæsarean brethren in accompanying Paul to Jerusalem, was to introduce them to this Mnason, who was prepared to receive them as his guests. Mnason was no doubt an important person in the Jerusalem Church; he is styled ‘an old or an early disciple,’ and was possibly converted during the life of our Lord Himself. Mnason is a Greek name, he was therefore most probably an Hellenist or Greek-speaking Jew. Professor Plumptre thinks ‘we may fairly infer that he was one of those who had been “from the beginning” among the eye-witnesses and ministers of the Word, to whom St. Luke refers as his informants (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:2">Luke 1:2</span>). If so, it is interesting as showing that our Lord’s disciples were not limited to the natives of Galilee and Judæa.’
