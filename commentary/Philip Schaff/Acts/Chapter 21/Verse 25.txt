<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:25">Acts 21:25</span>. <strong> As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing. </strong> James and the Jerusalem elders were careful after they had advised Paul to assist these poor Nazarites, and to associate himself as one zealous for the law of Moses with them in their vow of asceticism to repeat that they had no desire whatever to interfere with that perfect liberty of action, and freedom from all the restraints of the law of Moses, which had already, in a solemn apostolic conclave at Jerusalem, been conceded to Gentile Christians: none of these austere practices like the Nazariteâ€™s vow were to be expected from any except a born Jew and then James proceeded to enumerate the four points in a way connected with the Mosaic law, but which really belonged to a far broader and more solemn code. See notes on chap, 15, and Excursus following that chapter.
