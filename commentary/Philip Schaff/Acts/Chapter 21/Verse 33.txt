Acts 21:33.  Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains.  The ‘chief captain’ assumed that Paul was a criminal and guilty of some very grave crime against society. He himself evidently suspected he was a well-known Egyptian rebel who had hitherto eluded capture. He orders him to be chained by each hand to a soldier for security’s sake, and then he proceeds at once to interrogate him.
