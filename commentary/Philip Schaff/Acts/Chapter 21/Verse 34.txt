Acts 21:34.  And some cried one thing, and some another, among the multitude.  The same angry, confused murmur of voices and cries were heard among the crowd as at Ephesus in the amphitheater when the Jews accused Paul and his friends. The Greek words used to describe the confused cries of the populace are the same in both places (see chap. Acts 19:32). Two verses further on (Acts 21:36), we read how the same sounds fell on the ears of the Roman captain and his soldiery as twenty - five years before were listened to and  obeyed  by the Roman governor Pilate, when  Another  was accused and reviled by a Jewish mob of fanatics gathered together at a solemn feast in this same Jerusalem. Now as then, the people cried, ‘Away with him!’ Poor misguided ones, they knew not what they asked!
