The Greek words used to describe the confused cries of the populace are the same in both places (see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:32">Acts 19:32</span>). Two verses further on (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:36">Acts 21:36</span>), we read how the same sounds fell on the ears of the Roman captain and his soldiery as twenty - five years before were listened to and <em> obeyed </em> by the Roman governor Pilate, when <em> Another </em> was accused and reviled by a Jewish mob of fanatics gathered together at a solemn feast in this same Jerusalem. Now as then, the people cried, ‘Away with him!’ Poor misguided ones, they knew not what they asked!
