<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:38">Acts 21:38</span>. <strong> Art thou not that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers? </strong> The ‘Egyptian’ for whom the chief captain had mistaken Paul was a notorious character in those days. Josephus in his writings mentions him twice. He appears to have been a pretended sorcerer, who also gave himself out as a prophet. He was in reality a leader of one of those robber bands, which in the disturbed years which preceded the great Jewish rebellion, infested Judaea and the neighbouring countries. The name ‘Sicarii,’ assassins, was derived from ‘sica,’ a dagger or short sword these robbers wore beneath their clothing. This could be used in a crowd with fatal effect without being observed. The ‘assassins,’ in these fierce lawless times, were often hired by the leading men of the country for purposes of murder. This ‘Egyptian’ in the reign of Nero, we read <strong> , </strong> promised his followers that at his word the walls of Jerusalem would fall down, and that he and they should enter the city over the ruins. Felix, the Roman procurator, however, attacked and defeated this predatory band with signal success, killing 400 and taking 200 prisoners; the remainder and their leader were put to flight and escaped.

<p>A good deal has been written as to the discrepancy in the numbers which made up this robber band; St. Luke here in the ‘Acts,’ and Josephus in each of his two accounts of the rebellion, giving different estimates of the force.
	</p>
<p>It is, however, comparatively easy fairly to reconcile the three accounts. The Egyptian had gathered a band of Sicarii or armed assassins. With these, at one period of his career, a great multitude, some 30,000 in number, of people were associated, probably unarmed and undisciplined. The Procurator Felix, however, attacked and defeated the comparatively small <em> armed body of Sicarii; </em> of these he killed 400 and captured 200 prisoners. The remainder and their leader escaped. With these perhaps fled some of the deluded people who had joined the impostor prophet. It is also more than probable that the three accounts speak of different epochs of this outbreak, when the number of the followers of the Egyptian would be variously estimated.

<p>From the words of the chief captain to Paul, it was no doubt a notorious fact that the ‘Egyptian impostor’ in question was an illiterate person, and did not speak ‘Greek.’
