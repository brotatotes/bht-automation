<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:39">Acts 21:39</span>. <strong> But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew</strong> <strong> of Tarsus, a city</strong> <strong> of</strong> <strong> Cilicia</strong>, <strong> a citizen of</strong> <strong> no</strong> <strong> mean</strong> <strong> city</strong>. If he were indeed a citizen of Tarsus, he would have real claims upon the Roman authorities for protection. Tarsus as a city stood high in public estimation. It was not only famous as a university and seat of learning, but was the most important centre in that part of the Empire, and possessed many privileges. It bore on its coins the proud title of METROPOLIS AUTONOMOS, ‘the independent capital city.’
