<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:11">Acts 22:11</span>. <strong> And when I could not see for the glory of that light</strong>. We have here another <em> personal </em> memory of the strange eventful scene. In the narrative of chap. 9, we are simply told Saul was blinded; but as we should expect from one who had not only been present at the scene, but had been the chief actor in it, Paul gives us here the reason for that blindness. His eyes were dazzled by the blinding glory of that Light which was ‘above the brightness of the sun.’
