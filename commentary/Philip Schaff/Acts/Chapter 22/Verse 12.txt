Acts 22:12.  And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there. In the account of the conversion of chap. Acts 9:10, this Ananias is merely mentioned as ‘a disciple ， ’ a follower of Jesus of Nazareth; here, however, we have a detailed description of the man who was sent to the blinded Saul after the heavenly vision. It seems not improbable that, although a believer in the Crucified, he was a well-known and respected Jew of Damascus, one, in fact, blameless in all the ordinances of the law in the Syrian capital, as was James the Lord’s brother in Jerusalem. Such a one as Paul describes, even though he were not well known to the Jerusalem Jews (which at least seems probable), yet seeing he was a devout man according to the law, and well reported of in his own city, would surely not have visited and received into friendship a blasphemer and an enemy of the law would never, save on  very weighty  evidence, have accepted Saul the persecutor as a brother-disciple.
