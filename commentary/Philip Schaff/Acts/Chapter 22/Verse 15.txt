Acts 22:15.  Thou shalt be his witness unto all men. In Luke’s account of Acts 9:15, the ‘Gentiles’ are especially mentioned by name in the colloquy between Ananias and the Lord, who spoke to him in a vision: ‘He is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear My name before the Gentiles,’ etc. Here speaking to the angry and jealous Jewish crowd, the expression ‘the Gentiles’ is omitted altogether, and Paul’s broader mission is expressed by the words, ‘Thou shalt be His witness  to all men.’
