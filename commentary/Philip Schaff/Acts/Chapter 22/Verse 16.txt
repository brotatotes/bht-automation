<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:16">Acts 22:16</span>. <strong> And be baptized</strong>. The verb in the original Greek is of the <em> middle, </em> not of the passive voice, as the English translation would seem to imply. The more accurate rendering is, ‘have thyself baptized.’ The rite in the case of persons arrived at years of discretion was preceded by ‘repentance’ (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span>). In St. Paul’s mind it was no mere formal or ceremonial rite (comp. his words in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5">Titus 3:5</span>).

<p><strong> Calling on the name of the Lord</strong>. The reading of the older MSS. here, which we are now able to restore, is an important addition to our proofs, gathered from the inspired writings of the New Testament, of the belief in the early Church in the divinity of Christ. We should read, ‘calling on His name,’ that is, on that ‘Just One,’ of whom mention has been made before, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span>, and immediately after, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:18-21">Acts 22:18-21</span>, or, in other words, on Jesus Christ. We see, therefore, that the Church of the first days directly invoked our Lord and Redeemer.
