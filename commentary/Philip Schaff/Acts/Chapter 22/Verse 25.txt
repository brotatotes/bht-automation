<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:25">Acts 22:25</span>. <strong> And as they bound him with thongs. </strong> This <em> may </em> be the rendering of the Greek words, but it seems better to translate, ‘And as they stretched him out for the scourge;’ that is, the apostle was bound to a post or pillar in order to be exposed to the blows of the scourge, and in a suitable position to receive the torture.

<p><strong> Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned? </strong> Once before at Philippi had Paul saved himself from the dread infliction by the same plea (see notes on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:37-38">Acts 16:37-38</span>); now again the execution of the sentence was at once delayed, and the officer who was in charge of the prisoner at once reported to his commander the words of the sufferer. It was a grave crime, as Claudius Lysias well knew, to scourge a Roman citizen; so at once he stayed the proceedings pending further inquiries, which he conducted in person. The claim of Roman citizenship was instantly allowed. There was no fear of imposture in such a case: the assertion, it false, was punishable with death. ‘Claudius prohibited strangers from assuming Roman names, especially those which belonged to families. Those who falsely pretended to the freedom of Rome he beheaded on the Esquiline’ (Suetonius). There is no doubt Paul had papers and abundant references in the city by which he was ready to have made good his claim to the citizenship.
