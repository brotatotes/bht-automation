<p>He speaks of the Christian cause with the now familiar term familiar, apparently, to friends and enemies of the Nazarene brotherhood of ‘this way.’ It originated most likely from a loving memory of the Master’s words, in which he claimed to be himself ‘ <em> the way, </em> and the truth, and the life’ (see, too, the great prophecy of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:3">Isaiah 40:3</span>, where the word ‘way’ may be said to have formed the burden of the solemn song). The significant words, ‘unto the death,’ seem to tell us that in those first early persecutions of the Nazarenes, Stephen the deacon was by no means the only martyr for the cause of the Lord Jesus.
