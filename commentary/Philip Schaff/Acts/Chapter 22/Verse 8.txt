Acts 22:8.  I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutes.  More literally, ‘Jesus the Nazarene.’ This title of the Lord is peculiar to this account of the conversion. It seems probable that the followers of the Crucified, whom Paul was proceeding to Damascus to persecute, were called ‘Nazarenes,’ and the inquisitor was arrested in his work by One from heaven calling Himself ‘The Nazarene.’
