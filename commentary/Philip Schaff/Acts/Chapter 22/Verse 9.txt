<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:9">Acts 22:9</span>. <strong> And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me. </strong> Much has been said as to the seeming discrepancy between the statement here that Paul’s companions ‘heard <strong> </strong> not the voice of Him that spoke to me,’ and the words in the narrative, chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:7">Acts 9:7</span>, ‘hearing a voice.’ Dr. J. A. Alexander well explains this apparent difference: ‘There is a <strong> </strong> distinction between hearing a voice speak and hearing what it says, as nothing is more common in our public bodies than the complaint that the speaker is not heard, <em> i.e. </em> that his words are not distinguished, though his voice may be audible and even loud. It might be said with equal truth, that Paul’s companions heard the voice, <em> i.e. </em> knew that it was <strong> </strong> speaking, and that they did not hear it, <em> i.e. </em> did not know what it said. See St. John’s Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:29">John 12:29</span>, where a similar confusion seems to have occurred in the listeners’ minds. Here as there, the Divine Voice to the ordinary bystander was a voice, but not one uttering articulate words.
