<p><em> St. Paul brought before the Sanhedrim by the Roman Officials in Jerusalem</em> <em> He defends himself before the Great Council, 1-10</em>.

<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:1">Acts 23:1</span>. <strong> And Paul, earnestly beholding the council</strong>. The Greek word άτενι ́ σας , rendered ‘earnestly beholding,’ is used by the apostle on more than one solemn occasion, and describes the strained earnest gaze with which he endeavours to make up for that weakness of sight of which mention has already been made. It has also been suggested as more than probable that this dimness of vision, accompanied no doubt often with grievous pain, was occasioned by the glory of the Damascus vision, and most likely was the celebrated ‘thorn in the flesh’ alluded to in such touching language in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7-9">2 Corinthians 12:7-9</span>. Still, though the eyesight was dim, we do not, as will be seen, accept the theory that he could not discern whether the one speaking to him was the high priest. The very word here used seems to imply the contrary. Once more, after all those many years, Paul was present at a meeting of that august assembly of which he once was <em> most likely </em> a member, <em> certainly </em> was a confidential and trusted official. With strained fixed gaze he looked round on that once familiar scene, on <em> some </em> old and once-loved faces, all now looking on him with the deepest hate and aversion. He could not fail to distinguish the high priest, seeing he noticed the several party groups (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:6">Acts 23:6</span>) into which the Sanhedrim was divided.

<p><strong> Said, Men and brethren</strong>. Rendered simply, ‘said, Brethren.’ This time he omits the words ‘and fathers,’ with which he prefaced his address on the steps of ‘Antonia,’ to the multitude crowding in the temple area below him. <em> Then </em> it was a more impassioned address, and he appealed especially to the elders present; <em> now, </em> standing formally arraigned before the Sanhedrim, he remembers his ancient position among them, a position he is conscious he has surely, by his long devotion to his Master, never forfeited. So he begins as an equal speaking to equals; a former Sanhedrist to his ancient colleagues: ‘Brothers!’
	</p>
<p><strong> I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day</strong>. Well paraphrased by ‘I have lived as a true and loyal Jew, for the service and glory of God, from my youth up until now.’ Paul more than once refers in a similar way to ‘conscience.’ So in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:3">2 Timothy 1:3</span>, he says he had all his life served God with a pure conscience; and again, in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:5">1 Timothy 1:5</span>, he writes how a good conscience was the end of the commandment. See, too, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:15">Romans 2:15</span>. Paul teaches us that a man must never act against the dictates of his conscience, though, however, he plainly demonstrates from his own early experience that conscience is by no means an infallible guide; <em> it requires light from on high. </em> He shows us again, by his own example, from what ‘good conscience before God’ proceeds: 1. From true faith in Christ, by which the remission of sins is obtained. 2. From the assurance of Divine grace. 3. From the faithful performance of the duties of our calling.

<p>The words ‘until this day’ cover <em> all </em> his preceding life. He felt he had acted conscientiously <em> before </em> the Damascene vision, according to the dim light he then possessed; and <em> after </em> that solemn meeting with the Lord Jesus by the way, he had changed his life and conversation, according to the dictates of his conscience, illuminated by the ever presence of the Holy Spirit sent by his Master.
