Acts 23:29.  Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds. Death the highest, and bonds the lowest penalty of the law. Thus Claudius Lysias for his part, from a Roman’s point of view, expressed his belief in Paul’s innocency a similar testimony was borne him by all his Roman judges, and also by King Herod Agrippa. The questions of their law in the Roman commander’s view were that this stranger had been in some way or other violating the rules of the great temple of Jerusalem, and had been asserting that he had seen and conversed with a hated Teacher whose death by crucifixion many years previously had been brought about by the Sanhedrim. This dead Rabbi, Paul affirmed, was alive, having risen from the dead. But, thought Claudius Lysias, a Roman citizen surely did not deserve death, or even bonds, for such trivial offences.
