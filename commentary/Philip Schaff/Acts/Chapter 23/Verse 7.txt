Acts 23:7.  And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The effect of Paulâ€™s words was to suggest to one of the great parties, the Pharisees, that after all, the chief doctrines taught by this man and his fellow-believers were much more akin to their own school of teaching than were the doctrines of their rivals the Sadducees. It would surely never do, thought the Pharisee leaders, to unite with the Sadducees here, and do to death one who really is helping us and doing our work in opposition to those hateful unbelieving Sadducees.
