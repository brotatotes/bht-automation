<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:25-26">Acts 23:25-26</span>. <strong> He wrote a letter after this manner: Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting</strong>. This was in strict accordance with the Roman law, which directed a subordinate official, in sending a prisoner to the higher authority for trial, to send a written statement, termed an ‘elogium,’ of the whole case. On this occasion, the ‘elogium’ was rather a letter in favour of Paul than a formal accusation. ‘The most excellent’ ( τω ͂ͅ κρατι ́ στω ͅ) <em> </em> was the official title which was usually given to a governor holding the office of Felix. Tertullus the orator thus addresses the procurator in court (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:3">Acts 24:3</span>), and Paul, Festus (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:25">Acts 26:25</span>). In his dedication of the Gospel, Luke prefixes the same title to Theophilus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:3">Luke 1:3</span>).
