Acts 23:25-26.  He wrote a letter after this manner: Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting. This was in strict accordance with the Roman law, which directed a subordinate official, in sending a prisoner to the higher authority for trial, to send a written statement, termed an ‘elogium,’ of the whole case. On this occasion, the ‘elogium’ was rather a letter in favour of Paul than a formal accusation. ‘The most excellent’ ( τω ͂ͅ κρατι ́ στω ͅ)   was the official title which was usually given to a governor holding the office of Felix. Tertullus the orator thus addresses the procurator in court (chap. Acts 24:3), and Paul, Festus (chap. Acts 26:25). In his dedication of the Gospel, Luke prefixes the same title to Theophilus (Luke 1:3).
