He urges that this accusation of exciting sedition was simply incapable of proof. He takes carefully each of the places of public resort, and disposes of them one by one, challenging his adversaries to traverse, if they can, his statement. Nowhere had he publicly disputed with the hope of exciting a tumult not in the crowded temple courts, nor in the more retired and quiet synagogue meeting; nor had he gone preaching and speaking ‘up and down’ [for this is the literal translation of the Greek κατά <em> </em> here] the streets of the capital.
