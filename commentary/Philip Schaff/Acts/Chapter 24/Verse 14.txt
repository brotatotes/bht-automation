Acts 24:14.  But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers. More accurately rendered, ‘after the way which they call a sect.’ The word translated ‘heresy’ ( αἵρεσιν ) is represented by ‘sect’ in Acts 24:5. Paul here defends himself against the second accusation, ‘the being a ringleader of the Nazarene sect.’ He boldly and gladly at once proclaims, as a long line of glorious confessors have done since his day, that he is a Christian; but he adds, Christian or Nazarene though he be, he is a worshipper of no strange gods, but  his  God is the God of his Jewish fathers. For fidelity to this worship surely he deserves no punishment at the hands of the government, for the Jewish religion was countenanced and protected by Rome. Though a Nazarene, he was still a Jew.
	 Believing all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets. Yes, he asserted he was a true Jew, believing all the glorious promises written in the Law and Prophets. In this faith of his he followed out the words of the Master: ‘Think not that I am come to destroy the Law and the Prophets; I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil’ (Matthew 5:17). In other words, Paul denied that in becoming a Christian or a Nazarene he had in any way apostatized from the faith of his fathers. Christianity to him was but the fulfilment of Judaism.
