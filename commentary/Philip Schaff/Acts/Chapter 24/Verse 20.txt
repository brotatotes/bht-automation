The <em> second </em> charge, that he was an introducer of strange gods, the teacher of an unlawful religion, he had clearly disproved, having shown that to all intents and purposes he was an earnest and devout Jew. The <em> third </em> and gravest of the three charges the Sanhedrim had only cognisance of second hand. The alleged profanation of the temple, which Paul indignantly denied, was borne testimony to by witnesses <em> none of whom were present in Cæsarea. </em> No; there was only <em> one </em> true explanation of the wrath of the moving spirits in the great Jewish council. With that he proceeds to deal.
