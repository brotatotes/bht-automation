Wordsworth Well summarizes this masterly defence of Paul: ‘They have charged <em> me </em> with profaning the temple. But the fact is, I came from a distance to Jerusalem to <em> worship </em> in the temple; and to bring <em> alms </em> of charity, and also <em> offerings </em> of piety, as a Nazarite; and they themselves found me in the temple, engaged in a holy service, proving my respect for the temple; and they who accuse <em> me </em> of profaning it were guilty of profanation, in abetting those who seized me when there employed in a religious act, of which they prevented the completion.’
