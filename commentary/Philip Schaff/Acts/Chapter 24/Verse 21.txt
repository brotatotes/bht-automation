Acts 24:21.  Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.  Paul well knew that many in the Sanhedrim, and the majority in the nation, would sympathise with him  here.  These words of his, he was aware, had been the occasion of a violent dissension in the great council; but he knew, with reference to his views and teaching on this all-important doctrine, the heart of the people of Israel was on his side. Wordsworth Well summarizes this masterly defence of Paul: ‘They have charged  me  with profaning the temple. But the fact is, I came from a distance to Jerusalem to  worship  in the temple; and to bring  alms  of charity, and also  offerings  of piety, as a Nazarite; and they themselves found me in the temple, engaged in a holy service, proving my respect for the temple; and they who accuse  me  of profaning it were guilty of profanation, in abetting those who seized me when there employed in a religious act, of which they prevented the completion.’
