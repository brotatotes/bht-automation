<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:7">Acts 24:7</span>. <strong> But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands. </strong> Here again Tertullus misstates the facts. When the Roman soldiers came on the scene, the Jews evidently at once released Paul without further violence: ‘When they <em> saw </em> the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul’ (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:32">Acts 21:32</span>). The Sanhedrim council were extremely bitter against Claudius Lysias, and the intention evidently of their advocate’s words here (if we admit them as genuine), was to insinuate that all was going on in order and in strict conformity to the law, until the commander in the castle of Antonia violently and oppressively interfered.
