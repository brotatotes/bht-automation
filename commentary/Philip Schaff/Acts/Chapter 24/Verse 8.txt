Acts 24:8.  By examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.  If the disputed words are left in the text as in our English Version, then ‘of whom’ refers of course to Claudius Lysias. Some have supposed that Tertullus suggested questions by torture should be applied; but this is most doubtful, for both Claudius Lysias and Paul were Roman citizens. If, however, we omit the words in accordance with the ordinary rules of criticism, then ‘of whom’ must refer to St. Paul.
