 Festus succeeds Felix as Procurator of Judæa  The Jews in vain try to induce him to bring Paul to Jerusalem  Festus examines Paul in person, who appeals from his Tribunal to that of the Cæsar at Rome,  1-12.
	Acts 25:1.  Now when Festus was come into the province.  The Greek word translated ‘province’ is an unusual one in the case of a division of one of the greater provincial governments: ε ̓ παρχι ́ α ͅ  .  The term we find here was perhaps used in consequence of the importance of Judæa at that time, although it was only reckoned as a part of the imperial province of Syria. The proprætor or proconsul ruled over the greater province, the procurator over the smaller division.
