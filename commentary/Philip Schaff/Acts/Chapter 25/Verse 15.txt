<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:15">Acts 25:15</span>. <strong> About whom the chief priests </strong>. . . <strong> informed me, desiring to have judgment against him. </strong> The Greek word translated ‘judgment’ ( δι ́ κην ), in the most trustworthy MSS. is the stronger though unused καταδίκην , which must possess the sense of ‘condemnation’ or ‘punishment.’ It would thus seem as though the Sanhedrim authorities had so represented the matter to Festus as to leave the impression on his mind that the trial before his predecessor had resulted in the prisoner having been found guilty of at least some of the alleged crimes, but that condemnation had not been pronounced. This they now asked as a right at the hands of Festus.
