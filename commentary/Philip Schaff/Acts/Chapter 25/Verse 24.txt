Acts 25:24.  King Agrippa... ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have  dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.   The expression here, ‘all the multitude,’ is a strange one; but Festus believed, and with some reason, that the feeling against Paul among the Jews was a very general one. Certainly it existed to a great extent among the influential men who guided the destinies of the unhappy people in these last years of their existence as a nation. ‘And all here’ speaks for the unanimity of the Cæsarean Jews in this matter with their Jerusalem brethren. Of the words ‘have dealt with me’ perhaps ‘made petition to me,’ represent the meaning of the original Greek closer; another rendering suggested is, ‘held communication with me.’ It is a general and inclusive term, and comprehends the ‘information and request’ of Acts 25:2-3, and the judicial proceedings related in Acts 25:7.
