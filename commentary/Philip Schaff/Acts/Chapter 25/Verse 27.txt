<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:27">Acts 25:27</span>. <strong> For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him. </strong> Festus hoped, and not without reason, that the examination before so great a man as Agrippa one, too, who was so well versed in the difficult question of Jewish law and tradition would elicit fresh facts hitherto kept in the background. At all events, by listening to the proceedings, the Roman official felt he personally would become better acquainted with the secret history of the whole affair, and more competent to write a clear and definite report to the authorities at home. This report evidently weighed much on Festusâ€™ mind. He had newly come into office, and he was aware that a confused, contradictory statement might seriously injure him at Rome. There is also no doubt but that he was a fair and just man on the whole, wishful to do his duty and to make his office as acceptable as possible among the Jews, who he knew hated the dominion of Rome. This is the <strong> </strong> character of the man left us by Josephus.
