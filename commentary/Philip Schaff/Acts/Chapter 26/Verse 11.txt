<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:11">Acts 26:11</span>. <strong> And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme. </strong> This alludes, no doubt, not only to the many synagogues in Jerusalem (see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:9">Acts 6:9</span>, and note), but also to the synagogues situated in the many different places whither he was sent by the Sanhedrim in his work of persecution. It was on his way to visit the synagogues in one of these distant places (Damascus) that the Lord met him by the way, and changed His persecutor into His servant. On the words, ‘I punished them oft in every synagogue,’ Hackett quotes an instructive passage from Biscoe respecting punishment being inflicted in the synagogue: ‘The chief rulers of the synagogues, being also the judges of the people in many cases, especially those which regarded religion, chose to give sentence against offenders and see their sentence executed in the synagogue. Persons were always scourged in the presence of the judges. For, punishment being designed <em> in terrorem, </em> what more likely to strike the mind with awe, and deter men from falling into like errors, than to have it executed in their religious assemblies and in the face of the congregation? Our Lord foretold that His disciples should be scourged in the synagogues (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:17">Matthew 10:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:34">Matthew 23:34</span>); and we learn here that Paul was an instrument in fulfilling this prediction, having beaten them that believed in every synagogue. Another and even darker memory is here evoked by the great apostle as he tells the story of his past. The dead saints; these, though he knew it not then, he had helped in the morning of their battle to win their crown. But here was a thought of unspeakable sadness: there were some weaker brothers, some timid sisters; these his harsh words and cruel deeds had compelled to blaspheme that glorious name by which they were called. This is evidently the meaning of Paul’s words here. Some would try and explain away the sorrowful thoughts suggested by this “memory,” by supposing that all Saul did was to try to induce them to deny the faith they once said they loved; but it would be very hazardous to conclude that, among the many of different sexes, of varied ranks and ages, none swerved from their fidelity to Christ. The words of the Proconsul Pliny to his master the Emperor Trajan, in the first quarter of the next century, tell us that the same means which Saul the Pharisee had used to compel the followers of Christ to blaspheme, were soon used by Gentile persecutors: “There were some who denied that they were, or ever had been, Christians: these, before me, called upon the gods and thy image [he is writing to Trajan]; which image, along with those of the gods, I had ordered to be brought for this purpose. They offered to them incense and wine, besides which they reviled Christ none of which things, it is said, those who are indeed Christians can be compelled to do. These I thought might be allowed to go free.”’

<p><strong> Being exceedingly mad against them. </strong> No language seems too strong for the brave Christian advocate to use concerning himself and his former conduct towards those men and women, whose brother and fellow-believer he now professed himself to be. How he once detested these poor persecuted saints, how he loathed their cause! His whole life was devoted to the work of stamping out this strange devotion to One who had been crucified, and who these deluded men and women affirmed had risen again. What now had changed the life purpose of this young enthusiastic Pharisee? We can fancy a hush falling over the brilliant assembly, as Paul, after winding up this portion of his speech with the words telling of his journeying forth to strange cities to hunt down these believers on Jesus of Nazareth, being exceedingly mad against them, paused doubtless for an instant before telling King Agrippa, and Festus, and Bernice <em> what </em> had changed him.

<p><strong> Even unto strange cities. </strong> He had done the Sanhedrim’s work well and thoroughly in the ‘home’ district, and as far even as foreign cities, writes the compiler of the ‘Acts.’ Among these, Damascus is specially singled out for mention, for it was the last on the inquisitor’s list which was visited; and there the bitter persecution, as far as Saul was concerned, was only planned, but was never carried out.
