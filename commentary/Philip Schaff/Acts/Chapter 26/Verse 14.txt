<p><strong> It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. </strong> This proverb, well known in classical writers, is discussed at length in an Excursus which follows chapter 9. Although these words are omitted in the account of the appearance on the Damascus road <strong> </strong> by the writer of the ‘Acts’ in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:5">Acts 9:5</span>, and must therefore in that place be expunged from the text <strong> , </strong> here there is no shadow of doubt that the words <strong> </strong> formed part of Paul’s own account of the ‘appearance.’ Later scribes, as they copied MSS. of the ‘Acts,’ finding them here, no doubt inserted them <strong> </strong> in the passage of the ninth chapter, which relates the Lord’s words to Saul.
