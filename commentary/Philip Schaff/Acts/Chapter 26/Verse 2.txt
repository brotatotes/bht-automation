<p><em> First Division of Paul’s ‘Apologia’</em> <em> Introductory Address to King Agrippa, </em> 2, 3.
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:2">Acts 26:2</span>. <strong> I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews. </strong> This was no mere flattery. Paul says not one word in praise of the young sovereign: he simply with courtesy prefaces his earnest and impassioned words with expressing his satisfaction that he is permitted thus publicly to plead the cause of his Master’s holy religion before one so thoroughly conversant as was Agrippa in all the hopes and onlooks of the Jews. The accusations which were made against him (the prisoner Paul) all had reference to these hopes and onlooks, and no one but a learned Jew could possibly understand the charges made against him, or the defence he was about to make.
