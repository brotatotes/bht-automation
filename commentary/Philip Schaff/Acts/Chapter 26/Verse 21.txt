Acts 26:21.  For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me. That is first because he, Saul, once the determined relentless enemy of the ‘crucified Nazarene,’ now obeyed His voice, and went about everywhere delivering the message of the ‘Crucified’ with power; and secondly, because he delivered the message indifferently to the hated Gentiles as to the favoured Jews, thereby proclaiming that in Messiah’s kingdom there would be no difference between the children of Israel and the children born in the darkness of the isles of the Gentiles.
