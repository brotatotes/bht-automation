Acts 26:26.  For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely; for I am persuaded that none  of  these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner. ‘ The Jewish king sitting on that throne, before whom I am now telling out my wondrous story, he knows whether what I have been quoting from the Hebrews’ sacred books is to be found there or no. He can tell you if my words relate merely a wild dream of my own, for he knows what has been the people’s hope for many a long century yes, the king, if he will, may tell you too how this central figure of my narrative is no mere phantom I have raised. Well must our King Agrippa know the circumstances of the death of Jesus which took place at Jerusalem in the busy paschal week some thirty years ago,  for this thing was not done in a corner.  Well is the king aware that now for many years are there countless congregations of our countrymen in the Holy City, here in Cæsarea, scattered over Judæa and Syria, even as far as Italy, no small and obscure sect now, who live and die in the firm belief that this crucified Jesus has risen from the dead, just as I aver. No; I am  not  mad, most noble Festus.’
