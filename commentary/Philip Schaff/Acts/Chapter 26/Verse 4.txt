<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:4">Acts 26:4</span>. <strong> My manner of life from my youth, which was at first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews. </strong> He proceeds now to state <em> how long </em> the Jews had known him from his early youth; <em> when </em> they had learned to know him ‘at Jerusalem;’ and also <em> what </em> they knew of him that he was a Pharisee, living the strictest of lives. He appeals, thus, to all the Jews. This general term included specially the Jews dwelling in Jerusalem and Judæa, and the members of the Sanhedrim these, in fact were his accusers on the present occasion; but the position which Saul the Pharisee once occupied as the well-known inquisitor of the Sanhedrim, was no doubt well known to all the nation, even to those Jews dwelling in distant countries. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:3">Acts 22:3</span>, we read how he had been brought up in Jerusalem. Thus it would seem that Saul, when still a youth, went from Tarsus to complete his education in the Holy City, in the school of the famous Rabbi Gamaliel.
