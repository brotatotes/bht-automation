 Long-continued Severity of the Gale St. Paulâ€™s Address to the People on board, in the midst of the Storm,  18 - 26 .
	Acts 27:18.  The next day they lightened the ship.  This is said in general terms to have been done under the pressure of the storm; but there is little doubt that there was a more specific reason, that the danger which had been apprehended had occurred in fact, that, in spite of the undergirding, the ship had sprung a leak, and that already the water was gaining in the hold. What particular things were thrown overboard on this day we cannot tell; but, of course, they would be such heavy things as could most easily be spared. Compare Jonah 1:5.
