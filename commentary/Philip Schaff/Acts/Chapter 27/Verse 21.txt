<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:21">Acts 27:21</span>. <strong> After long abstinence. </strong> See below on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:33">Acts 27:33</span>. One great aggravation of the hardship and suffering of an emergency like this is the want of proper and regular food. The fires are put out, the provisions are soaked, and meanwhile all hands are required for every effort that can be suggested for the safety of the ship. One absurd comment made on this passage is, that a religious fast was observed by the crew during the storm. Nothing could be more unreal than such a supposition; and, in commenting on this narrative, it is incumbent upon us, above all things, to present it in its reality.

<p><strong> Paul stood forth in the midst of them</strong>. <strong> </strong> He chose some place on the deck, whence he could most easily address them; and the sailors, soldiers, and passengers now willingly crowded round him, however incredulous they may have been before regarding him. We feel this to be a most striking and impressive moment, when we remember that he had been praying while they had been struggling with the storm, and that he is now calm and confident while they have lost all hope.

<p><strong> Ye should have hearkened unto me. </strong> His purpose, as Chrysostom says, is not to taunt them, but to inspire them with confidence in him for the future. They have now good reason for believing in his prophetic insight.

<p><strong> To have gained this harm and loss. </strong> This literal translation is very emphatic. Mr. Humphry reminds us that in Greek and Latin to <em> gain </em> a loss is to <em> avoid </em> it. The Vulgate has the correct equivalent, ‘Lucri facere.’
