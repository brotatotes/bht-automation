Acts 27:22.  No loss of any man’s life among you, but of the ship.  See Acts 27:10. His comparatively dim prophetic insight is now become clearer.
	Acts 27:23.  The angel of God.  St. Luke says ‘an angel,’ not ‘the angel.’ As we read through the Acts of the Apostles, we have occasion to observe, more than once, that the ministry of angels is made conspicuous in this book. See Acts 1:10, Acts 10:3, Acts 12:7, Acts 16:9.
	 Whose I am, and whom I serve.   One of the noblest utterances that ever came from the lips of man, and made more remarkable by the circumstances under which the words were uttered. As addressed to the hearers, this short sentence is a whole sermon, full of meaning. As an expression of Paul’s habitual state of mind, it is invaluable. His speech would have been complete without it; but he cannot help showing by this outburst of feeling what is in his heart. Similar instances of this characteristic of St. Paul’s style are to be found in Romans 1:9, and at the end of Galatians 2:20.
