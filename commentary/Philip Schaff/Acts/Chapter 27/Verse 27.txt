<p><em> Anchoring in the Night, </em> 27 - 29 .
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:27">Acts 27:27</span>. <strong> When the fourteenth night was come. </strong> The reckoning, as above in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:12">Acts 27:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:19">Acts 27:19</span>, is from their leaving Fair Havens. About a day must be . allowed, more or less, for all that was done before the ship was made ready under the lee of Clauda for the gale which had suddenly come upon them.

<p><strong> As we were driven up and down in Adria. </strong> Two points must be carefully noted here. In the first place, the word διαφερομε ́ νων does not necessarily mean that they were driven to and fro; nor is there any reason to suppose that the wind was perpetually changing its course. The sinuosities which in old Bible-maps used to be assigned to this part of St. Paul’s imaginary course, were only an indication of ignorance as to the right way of solving this problem. The direction of the ship’s way, though of course it varied slightly as she ‘came up and fell off,’ during the changing moods of the gale, did not deviate far from a straight line. The other point relates to the meaning of ‘Adria.’ The popular language of our own day might easily lead us to suppose that the Gulf of Venice is intended. But this would not be in accordance with the use of geographical terms in classical times. This word ‘Adria’ denoted the central basin of the Mediterranean between Sicily on the west and Greece on the east, and extending as far southwards as the coast of Africa. To quote two well-known geographers, Ptolemy distinguishes clearly between the Adriatic Sea and the Adriatic Gulf; and Pausanias says that the Straits of Messina separate the Tyrrhene Sea from the Adriatic Sea.

<p><strong> About midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country. </strong> The phrase here used ( προσα ́ γειν τινα ̀ αυ ̓ τοι ͂ ς χω ́ ραν ) <em> </em> is characteristic of that animated language of sailors, according to which everything is spoken of from their own point of view, the ship being, as it were, personified. These sailors suspected that they were ‘fetching’ some land near to them. But now we must inquire into the reason why they suspected this. It was the middle of the night; hence the thought could not have been suggested by anything which they saw. There were no lighthouses then to warn them. Nor would the suggestion have come through any fragrance of gardens, as has been fancifully supposed, for the wind blew from the ship towards the land. The fact is, they heard the sound of breakers, which is a terrible sound to seamen, and which is often perceived by sailors, when the ears of others would not recognise it. Thus it is true to nature that St. Luke should observe that it was ‘the shipmen’ who became conscious of this danger. As to that part of the coast of Malta, if the conclusion to which we shall be led may be anticipated, there must have been infallibly breakers on Koura Point that night.
