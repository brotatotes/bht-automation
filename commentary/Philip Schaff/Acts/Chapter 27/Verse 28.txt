The fathom ( ο ̓ ργυια ̀ ) <em> </em> of the Greeks is practically the same measure of length as that which we designate by that term.

<p><strong> Sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms. </strong> There is nothing extraordinary in finding a depth of fifteen fathoms soon after a depth of twenty fathoms had been found. But we must remember that this shallower depth was found in succession to the greater depth <em> in the direction in which the ship was drifting, </em> and that there had been <em> time to ascertain this without the ship striking. </em> These two conditions must be satisfied before we can identify the exact place of the shipwreck (see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:41">Acts 27:41</span>). They were now shoaling the water, and in imminent danger of striking, and the only possible expedient for safety was to anchor. From what follows, also, it would appear that there was possibly another reason for this conviction that they were in the utmost risk.
