<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:33">Acts 27:33</span>. <strong> Paul besought them all</strong>. A better translation would be that he ‘exhorted’ them all. Once more we see the apostle in the position of supreme command, as the only person on board in whom confidence was placed. Whatever he did now might be expected to have a distinctly religious effect upon the minds of the crew and the passengers.

<p><strong> To take some meat</strong>. <strong> </strong> This was characteristic not only of his good sense and presence of mind, but of his sympathetic nature. See, for instance, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:17">Acts 14:17</span>; 1Ti 5:23 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:20">2 Timothy 4:20</span>. The word ‘meat’ is used in the general sense of ‘food.’

<p><strong> This is the fourteenth day</strong>. <strong> </strong> See note above on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:27">Acts 27:27</span>.

A fortnight had passed without any regular meal (see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:21">Acts 27:21</span>). Even from the very mention of this subject, it is evident that there was much suffering from hunger and weakness. Some hours at least, apparently even a longer time, had passed since that incident; and now they must have been utterly exhausted from the want of proper food.
