This is one of those passages in the Acts of the Apostles which tend, though it records many depressing and discouraging circumstances, to give a cheerful character to the book.

On the occasion before our notice, it is evident that the people on board were utterly exhausted, and had lost all heart, so that even the desire for food was gone.
