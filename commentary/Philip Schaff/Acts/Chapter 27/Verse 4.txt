<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:4">Acts 27:4</span>. <strong> Sailed under Cyprus. </strong> The reason is given presently afterwards. The meaning is, that they sailed ‘under the lee of Cyprus,’ or so as to place the island between themselves and the <strong> wind. </strong> To suppose that ‘under’ means ‘to the south of’ Cyprus, is a mere confusion of thought, arising probably from our habit of placing the north at the top of our maps and the south at the bottom. The natural course for this ship would have been on the south of Cyprus, towards the south-west corner of Asia Minor, the course followed inversely on St. Paul’s return from his Last Missionary Expedition, on which occasion the sighting of Cyprus to the north is mentioned (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:6">Acts 21:6</span>).

<p><strong> Because the winds were contrary. </strong> Hence the wind was blowing hard from the north-west (see note above). This was a sufficient reason for standing to the north, and then following the coast of the mainland westwards. And this reason was, of course, freely mentioned among those who were on board the ship. But some other reasons doubtless weighed with those who had charge of the sailing of the ship, to bring about this determination. The current which, as mentioned above, sets northward along the Syrian coast, to the east of Cyprus, sets westward between that island and the Cilician and Pamphylian coast. Admiral Beaufort says ( <em> Karamania, </em> p. 41 ), that ‘from Syria to the Archipelago, there is a constant current to the westward.’ This would be favourable to the progress of the vessel. Moreover, the wind would draw more from the north when coming down from the high land above this coast. This is stated in our English <em> Sailing Directory, </em> pp. 241 - 243 . Hence there would be comparatively smooth water here. This coast, too, had several good harbours. All these things were known to sailors accustomed to the navigation of the Levant.
