<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:44">Acts 27:44</span>. <strong> Some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship</strong>. There is nothing in the original to correspond with the word ‘broken.’ But no doubt the meaning is correctly given. The contrast is between loose planks, seats, barrels, and the like, on the one hand; and on the other hand, fragments of the ship itself, which the waves were now breaking up.

<p><strong> They escaped all safe to land</strong>. The same strong Greek word is used here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:43">Acts 27:43</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:1">Acts 28:1</span>. As to St. Paul’s part in this experience of imminent danger of drowning, we must remember that he had passed through it at least three times before (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:25">2 Corinthians 11:25</span>).
