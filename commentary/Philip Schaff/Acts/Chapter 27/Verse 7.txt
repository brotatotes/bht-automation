Acts 27:7.  Sailed slowly.   If, as is said in what immediately follows, ‘  many days ’   had passed after leaving Myra, while yet they ‘  scarce were come over against Cnidus, ’   they must have sailed ‘  slowly; ’   for the distance from Myra to Cnidus is only 137 miles. The question arises as to the cause of this slow sailing. It must have been either from lack of wind, or because the wind was contrary; and when we take into account all that has been said above, we can have no doubt that the latter reason is the true one. Moreover, the Greek word μόλις ,   translated ‘scarce,’ really expresses difficulty and struggle. It would be necessary, along the Lycian coast, as previously along the Cilician and Pamphylian, for the ship to beat up against the wind, with tacks, speaking roughly, north-east by north and south-west by west.
	 The wind not suffering us.  A question might be raised here as to whether this means that the wind would not allow them to enter the harbour of Cnidus, or would not allow them to make the southernmost point of the Morea, which was in their direct route to Italy. Mr. Humphry takes the former view, adding that in the harbour of Cnidus, which was a good one, they would probably have wintered, if they had been able to enter it. But it does not appear that at this time they had relinquished their intention of prosecuting their voyage. Reuss supposes that they were hindered from entering the port of Cnidus, because the wind was from the  north-east,  but this supposition is at variance with all the other circumstances of this part of the voyage. The other view is by far the more probable.
	 Sailed under Crete,   i.e.  under its lee. Here they would obtain the same advantages as before, under the shore of Asia Minor, as to comparative shelter and a favourable current.
	 Over against Salmone.  This promontory is the easternmost point of Crete.
