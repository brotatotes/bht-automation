St. Paul did not refuse elsewhere to accept the gifts which were freely offered to him. Chrysostom says here: ‘Did he receive pay? God forbid! No; but there was a fulfilment of that which is written, The labourer is worthy of his support,’ quoting the very passage which St. Paul quotes in writing to Timothy.

<p><strong> When we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary. </strong> When they were preparing to set sail, gifts for the wants of the voyage were lavishly pressed upon <strong> t</strong> hem. We must remember that on the previous voyage they had suffered many hardships and losses.
