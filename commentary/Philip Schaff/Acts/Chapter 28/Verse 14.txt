<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:14">Acts 28:14</span>. <strong> Where we found brethren. </strong> We know from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:0">Romans 16:0</span>, and indeed from the mere existence of the Epistle to the Romans, that the Christian ‘brethren’ were at this time numerous in the metropolis. Hence there must have been Christians at Puteoli, which was the place of communication by sea with Palestine. We must also remember that, since Puteoli was a mercantile harbour with very active business, the Jews were probably numerous there, with a synagogue or more than one.

<p><strong> Were desired to tarry with them seven days</strong>. We seem here to have a clear indication of the observance of the Lord’s day, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:6-7">Acts 20:6-7</span> at Troas, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:4">Acts 21:4</span> at Tyre. As to the permission given by Julius to spend a week at Puteoli, this need cause us no difficulty. He might himself be waiting for orders; it is probable that he had time at his command; and now, at the close of the voyage, after owing his life to St. Paul, it is not likely that he would be less considerate and kind than at the beginning (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:3">Acts 27:3</span>).

<p><strong> And so we went toward Rome. </strong> More correctly , ‘and so we came to Rome.’ From this bare statement of the fact of their arrival at the end of their journey, St. Luke turns aside in the next sentence to mention most interesting circumstances connected with their route from Puteoli. This route was first by a road called the ‘Consular Way,’ which led to Capua, and then along the celebrated ‘Appian Way’ to Rome. The stages are given in the <em> Itineraries </em> (see Wesseling). For the features of the country through which they travelled, see <em> Life and Epistles of St. Paul.
