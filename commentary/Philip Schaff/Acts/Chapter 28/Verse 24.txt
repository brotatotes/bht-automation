<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:24">Acts 28:24</span>. <strong> And some believed the things that were spoken, and some believed not.</strong> The number of those who rejected the salvation of the Messiah evidently far exceeded the number of those who were convinced by Paul’s pleading. The melancholy and indignant tone of the apostle’s words, with which he closed the memorable day of argument and exhortation, only too plainly tell us of a loving patience at last exhausted. They are the words of one giving up a hopeless struggle.
