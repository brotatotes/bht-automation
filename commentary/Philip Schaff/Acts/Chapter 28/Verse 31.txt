It commences with a short syllable followed by three long ones, happily adapted to express rest after labour (see Catullus, <em> Carm. </em> xxix. 6-10). Compare the word ε ̓ κοιμη ́ θη <em> , he fell asleep</em> a word of like quantity closing the history of St. Stephen’s martyrdom’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:60">Acts 7:60</span>). Thus far the imperial authorities were disposed to show all toleration to the disciples of the new faith. They probably looked upon the ‘Christians’ as a sect of Jews harmless in themselves, and even useful in occupying the attention of their more turbulent and fervid co-religionists. The Roman authorities no doubt at this time viewed the intense hatred which existed between the more rigid Jews and the rapidly-increasing Christians, with considerable favour; in addition to which, statesmen of the type of Burrhus, the praetorian præfect, and Seneca, at that time the friend of the Emperor Nero, would ever be ready to encourage and protect a sect like the Christians, which taught its disciples an unswerving loyalty to the existing government, which discouraged all meddling with politics and directed attention only to philanthropic interests. Its peculiar worship, its especial hopes and fears, were matters with which these philosophic Pagan statesmen declined to interfere.
