<p><strong> Yet vengeance suffereth not to live. </strong> The ancients personified retributive justice under the name <strong> </strong> of Nemesis. We need not imagine an absolute personification in this case. The instinctive moral sense of these untutored people would naturally lead them to this conclusion. Mr. Humphrey adduces here an interesting Greek epigram, the substance of which is this, that a man shipwrecked on the coast of Libya, and killed while asleep by a <strong> </strong> serpent, had struggled in vain against the waves, finding here on land the fate that was his due.
