<p><strong> The chief man of the island, whose name was Publics. </strong> The name is Latin, and doubtless he was a Roman or an Italian. The title given to him ( τω ͂ͅ πρω ́ τω ͅ τη ͂ ς νη ́ σου ) <em> </em> is peculiar, and it corresponds precisely with the title ( πρῶτος Μιλιταἰων <em> </em> and <em> Primus Melitensium) </em> which has been found on ancient Maltese inscriptions, as was noted long ago by Biscoe, who quotes Bochart and Grotius ( <em> The History of the Acts confirmed by other Authors, </em> p. 62). A question still remains as to the precise meaning of this title, though this does not affect the value of the historical coincidence. The meaning can hardly be that Publics was the wealthiest man on the island, for his father was still living. Clearly there is something official in the phrase. The natural view is that Publics was the Roman governor of the island; and this has been the common opinion. At this time Melita was a political dependency of Sicily, and the praetor of this larger island would have a <em> legatus </em> in the smaller. Hackett, however, in his second edition (p. 449), quotes an interesting note by President Woolsey of Yale College, in which it is shown from inscriptions that those who had ceased to be chief magistrates of the island might still retain the title of πρῶτος ; and similar honorary titles are found in ancient inscriptions belonging to towns in Italy. Hackett justly remarks that, if this is the correct view, it really enhances the narrator’s accuracy, ‘inasmuch as the range of the application of the term is narrower.’

<p><strong> Lodged us three days courteously. </strong> This, no doubt, refers to the centurion and his prisoners. It was natural that Publius should pay especial attention to Julius and his party; and we may be sure that the favorable feeling of the latter towards St. Paul would not be without its influence on the mind of the former. It is to be observed that the Greek word here translated ‘courteously’ is not the same that is so rendered in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:3">Acts 27:3</span>. This is not in itself a matter of much moment, but it would be an advantage to the English reader to be enabled to follow the use of such words precisely.
