Acts 3:18. In reference to God, the sin of Israel, consisting in the rejection and murder of Messiah, may be forgiven, in so far as it at the same time involved the fulfilment of the divine decree made mention of by all the prophets, ‘that Messiah should suffer.’
	 Which God showed by the mouth of all the prophets.  ‘Omnes prophetae in universum non prophetarunt nisi de diebus Messiae’ (  Sanhedr.  99, 1, quoted by Alford). These words of Peter’s are not to be understood as a hyperbole (Kuinoel), or in the sense given to them by Olshausen, who, looking upon the entire history of the Jews as typical, in that view maintains that all the ancient prophets prophesied of Christ. Very many of the prophets describe with more or less distinctness the sufferings and the death of Messiah all of them looked on with sure hope to the times of restoration and redemption. This longed-for restoration and redemption was only to be won by the sufferings and death of Messiah. Meyer’s view slightly differs from the above. He looks  back as on a thing accomplished to redemption, won only through the death and suffering of the Messiah Jesus. Of this redemption all the prophets spoke.
