Acts 3:24.  All the prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after. Of the prophets between Moses and the days of Samuel, we possess few recorded sayings. Samuel is mentioned as the founder of the so-called schools of the prophets. Gloag especially notes this verse as probably containing only an epitome of what St. Peter said on this subject; he perhaps proved by express quotation from the prophets, or at least from some of them, the assertions it contained. It is, however, an undisputed fact, that in all the prophetic writings preserved by the providence of God in the Old Testament, which are guarded now by the Jews with a jealous and devoted reverence, the grand theme is the coming of Messiah, and the sure hope of a joyful season of restoration and refreshing.
	 Have likewise foretold of these days. ‘These days’ may, as Alford and others maintain, refer to the days ‘now present,’ the Gospel times of restoration, as taking in the whole of the period known as ‘the last days;’ but the reference more clearly points to ‘the  days ’   immediately in the speaker’s mind, to which he had been directing his hearers attention, the Second Advent and the times of restitution of all things (with this view Meyer and De Wette agree).
