<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:4">Acts 3:4</span>. <strong> And Peter, fastening his eyes on him with John, said, Look on us</strong>. Calvin, commenting on this miracle about to be worked by Peter and John, asks whether they had the power of working such miracles when they pleased, and replies they were so exclusively ministers of the Divine power that they attempted nothing of their own will, and the Lord worked through them whenever it was expedient. Hence it happened they healed one sufferer not all sufferers promiscuously, for the Holy Spirit guided them here just as in other matters. So Peter, in answer to the poor crippleâ€™s prayer for alms, moved by the Holy Ghost, fixes his earnest gaze on him, to discover if he were worthy of the glorious gift of health he had to bestow.
