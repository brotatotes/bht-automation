 Healing of the Lame Man by Peter and John at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple,  1-11.
	The writer of the ‘Acts,’ after describing the inner life of the new society, takes up the thread of the story again. He had spoken (Acts 2:46) of the daily attendance of the followers of Jesus in the Temple, and had mentioned the many signs and wonders which were being worked by the apostles (Acts 2:43); and now he gives in detail an account of one of their daily visits to the Temple, in the course of which the apostles happened to do one of those wondrous works referred to (Acts 2:43).
