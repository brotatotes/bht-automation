<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:22-23">Acts 3:22-23</span>. The quotation is from the LXX. Version (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+18:18-19">Deuteronomy 18:18-19</span>). The words of the original are not exactly given, but the paraphrase of St. Peter faithfully reproduces the original sense. The Deuteronomy passage promises, at some future period, that God seeing that the children of Israel were unable to endure the terrors of His voice or the glory of His presence would send them another Mediator, through whom He would communicate to them His will, as He had done through Moses (see also <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:18-21">Hebrews 12:18-21</span>).

<p><strong> A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me. </strong> <em> Raise up, </em> not here ‘from the dead,’ but ‘will cause to appear’ ( ἀναστήσει , יָקִים , <em> wird aufstehen lassen </em> (De Wette).

<p><strong> Of your brethren. </strong> Another graceful and loving touch. This Messiah, who was to work such blessing to the world, was to be one of you, a Jew, <em> like unto me. ‘</em> The likeness of Christ to Moses is beautifully though silently traced by St. Stephen in his speech before the Sanhedrim,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:0">Acts 7:0</span> (Wordsworth). What prophet of all that long and honoured line, from the day of the death of Moses to the times of Malachi, answered in any way to the Deuteronomy promise, ‘like unto me’? Only to Jesus of Nazareth could the words apply. Like Moses was Jesus a Law giver, a Mediator between God and man, and the Founder of a new dispensation of religion.
