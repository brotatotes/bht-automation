Acts 4:11.  This is the stone,  etc. The accusation of awful mistake with which he charges the judges of Israel, of dishonouring what God had so highly honoured, St. Peter repeats by boldly applying to them the well-known words of Psalms 118:22. His meaning, which they quickly understood, was that the rulers of the Jews were the builders to whom the charge of the house of God was given. They should have been the first to acknowledge the long-looked-for Messiah, and to have worked for the glory of His kingdom, but  they  had rejected Him and cast Him aside; while  God,  by raising Him from the dead, had shown that He was the corner-stone on which the whole fabric of the spiritual temple of God on earth must rest.
