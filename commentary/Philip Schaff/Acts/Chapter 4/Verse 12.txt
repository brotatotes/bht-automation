<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:12">Acts 4:12</span>. <strong> None other name under heaven</strong>. The apostle has ceased altogether referring to the case of the lame man made whole, and is here proclaiming before the assembled Sanhedrim his Masterâ€™s name, not only as a name in the strength of which the diseases of the poor body might be healed, that was a small matter, but as the only name on which men might rest when they thought of eternity. This famous passage occupies a prominent position in the Smalcald Articles drawn up by Luther and adopted in A.D. 1537. It has been said, with some truth, that the adoption of these articles completed the Reformation, and was the definite declaration of the separation of the signataries from Rome.
