<p>It has been asked, How were these apparently private deliberations known to St. Luke? Several probable answers have been given. Some of the <strong> </strong> priests who afterwards joined the <strong> </strong> little church (see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:7">Acts 6:7</span>) were doubtless present at the council. St. Paul himself, who had much to do with the composition of these memoirs of the Church of the first days, not improbably was a Sanhedrist.
