Acts 4:25.  Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said. The quotation which follows is from Psalms 2:1-2. The words are taken verbatim from the Septuagint. There is no superscription either in the Hebrew or the Septuagint version; but the older interpreters, especially the Jewish, referred it to David.
