<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:25">Acts 4:25</span>. <strong> Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said</strong>. The quotation which follows is from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:1-2">Psalms 2:1-2</span>. The words are taken verbatim from the Septuagint. There is no superscription either in the Hebrew or the Septuagint version; but the older interpreters, especially the Jewish, referred it to David.
