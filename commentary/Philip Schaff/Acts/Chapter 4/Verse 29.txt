<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:29">Acts 4:29</span>. <strong> And now, Lord, grant that with all boldness they may speak thy word</strong>. <strong> </strong> It is well worthy of notice in this first great public prayer of the Church, how the Spirit of their Master had sunk into the disciples hearts. No fire from heaven is called down on the guilty heads of the enemies of Christ, who would stamp out His struggling Church; only for themselves they pray for bravery and constancy.
