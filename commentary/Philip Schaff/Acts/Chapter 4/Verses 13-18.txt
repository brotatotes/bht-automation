 Judgment of the Sanhedrim, 13-18.
	Astonishment of Sanhedrists at the ability of Peterâ€™s reply. They remember the two apostles were companions of Jesus, and then consult privately together. They see that any punishment they might inflict would be ill received by the people, so they determine to dismiss the accused, threatening them if they continued to preach the name of the Crucified.
