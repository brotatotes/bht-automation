<p><strong> And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost. </strong> As on the first Pentecost morning, the inward sign was given to these brave confessors too; <strong> and they spake the word of God with boldness, </strong> and once more the voice of apostles and believers rose from within those holy walls to the sanctuary of the Eternal, but no more in tones of anxious pleading, but exultant and joyous in their new-born hope and confidence, for the first great prayer of the Church of Christ was answered.
