And the solitary special sign of almighty power which they pray for, is to be able to relieve such suffering among men as they had often seen their Master remove, the power to be able to work such works as Peter and John had performed the afternoon before at the ‘Beautiful Gate’ of the Temple, when to the hopeless cripple they gave health and strength in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth; and with this name, the earnest pleading of the Church of the first days ceased, and as the murmur of these last words, ‘Thy holy child Jesus,’ was dying away,  the place was shaken where they were assembled together,   as though the wings of the descending Spirit had touched the walls and caused the house of prayer to rock, giving this outward sign of His blessed presence.  And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.  As on the first Pentecost morning, the inward sign was given to these brave confessors too;  and they spake the word of God with boldness,  and once more the voice of apostles and believers rose from within those holy walls to the sanctuary of the Eternal, but no more in tones of anxious pleading, but exultant and joyous in their new-born hope and confidence, for the first great prayer of the Church of Christ was answered.
