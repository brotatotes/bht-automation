Acts 4:34-35.  And brought the prices of the things that were sold, And laid them at the apostles’ feet.  We have here one of the few expressions in the New Testament where the personal dignity and rank which the apostles held in the community of the believers is directly mentioned (comp. Cicero,  Pro Flacco,  c. 28, where we read how a sum of money was laid at the Praetor’s feet in the Forum). The apostles, like the Roman magistrates, probably sat amongst their own people on a raised seat, on the steps of which, at their feet, the money thus devoted for the service of the Lord’s people was laid in token of respect. This seems to have been the customary way of the solemn dedication of property to the use of the Church, as it is mentioned again in the case of Barnabas (Acts 4:37).
