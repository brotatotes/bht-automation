 St. Peter’s Defence,  8-12.
	‘Compare Peter a few days since in the palace of the high priest, thrice denying his Master from fear of prison and death, and now brought forth from prison, and confessing Christ before the same high priest and Sanhedrim which had delivered Christ up to Pilate for crucifixion, and charging them with His murder’ (Wordsworth). What had brought about this change?  He had seen the risen Lord.
