Acts 4:9-10.  If we this day be examined, etc. Ironical surprise runs through St. Peter’s reply, which may be paraphrased thus: ‘If we  really  are arraigned, which seems hardly credible, on account of the good deed done to this poor man (pointing to the healed cripple), know all of you, the miracle you ask about was done in the name of that Jesus so terribly dishonoured by you, but by God so signally honoured.’
	 Jesus Christ of Nazareth,   quoting the title nailed on the cross. ‘Think not that we desire to conceal His country, Nazareth, or His death on the cross. Ye crucified Him, but He was raised by God, and now works miracles from heaven’ (Chrysostom, quoted by Wordsworth).
