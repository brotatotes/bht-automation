Acts 5:10.  And the young men came in, and found her dead.  The death of the wife was instantaneous, and took place exactly as the words of Peter had foretold. She lay dead in the midst of the assembly, and the young men who had just returned from the grave of Ananias laid her   in   that same sad evening by his side.
