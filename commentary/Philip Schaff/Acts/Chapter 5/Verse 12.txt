<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:12">Acts 5:12</span>. <strong> And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people</strong>. <strong> </strong> Notwithstanding the great fear which came over the Church after the terrible event just recorded, the apostles seem to have pressed on their work with greater enthusiasm than before, and with marked success. The miracles of healing performed among the people were the credentials these plain unlettered men had received from their Lord, then reigning from His glory throne in heaven, and were in striking contrast with the scenes of terror the Church had just witnessed. The terror men might see was something strange and unusual, while the mercy and love were the everyday characteristics of the Master of these new teachers. The signs and wonders here referred to are described at greater length in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:15-16">Acts 5:15-16</span>.
