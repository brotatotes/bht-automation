Acts 5:20.  Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people. The very words spoken by the angel of deliverance are here quoted. The imprisoned ones were to go at once (the new day was probably already dawning) into the public courts of the temple to proclaim to the people all the words of this life, no doubt laying stress upon the words  this life,  which the angel, a being from heaven, himself enjoyed.  The life,  the existence of which the Sadducees, the men who had imprisoned the apostles, denied.  The life,  which was the subject of the teaching and preaching of Peter and his devoted companions (see John vi 68).
