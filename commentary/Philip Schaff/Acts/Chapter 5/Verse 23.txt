<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:23">Acts 5:23</span>. <strong> The prison truly found we shut with all safety</strong>. We have here the report of the guard who were sent by the high priest to fetch the accused from their place of confinement. They found the prison locked and barred, and the keepers watching as usual, fully believing all was secure; but on entering the guard found the prisoners gone.
