<p><strong> Thou hast not lied onto men, but unto God</strong>. The doctrine of the early Church on the subject of the Holy Ghost is plainly declared in the words of this and the preceding verse. The <em> personality </em> of the blessed Spirit is assumed by the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:3">Acts 5:3</span>, and from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:4">Acts 5:4</span> we gather that, in the esteem of St. Peter, the Holy Ghost <em> was God. </em> In the first question Peter asks, ‘Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost?’ In reference to the same offence, in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:4">Acts 5:4</span> his words are, ‘Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.’ To lie to the Holy Ghost is not to lie unto men, because the Holy Ghost is not man, but to lie unto God, because the Holy Ghost is God (see Pearson, art. viii.).
