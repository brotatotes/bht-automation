Undismayed by any punishment in the past, undeterred by any fear for the future, they did their Master’s bidding daily without rest or repose, in public, in the courts of His ancient and beautiful temple.
	</p>

<p><strong> And preach Jesus Christ</strong>, better translated ‘the Christ.’ Here, in one word, the special purpose of their public and private teaching is told us.
