Acts 5:42.  And daily in the temple. Undismayed by any punishment in the past, undeterred by any fear for the future, they did their Master’s bidding daily without rest or repose, in public, in the courts of His ancient and beautiful temple.
	And in every house they ceased not to teach. In private assemblies, too, held in the  now  many homes of the faithful, they taught the doctrines of their Crucified and Risen Lord.
	 And preach Jesus Christ, better translated ‘the Christ.’ Here, in one word, the special purpose of their public and private teaching is told us. They proclaimed to all in the crowded Temple courts, as in the little earnest home gatherings of the believers, that Jesus the Crucified was no other than the Christ the Messiah.
