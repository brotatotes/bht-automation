<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:6">Acts 5:6</span>. <strong> And the young men arose</strong>. <strong> </strong> These young men probably occupied in the Church some authorized official position. As yet to look for a definite organization in the little community, would be of course premature; yet it is in the highest degree probable that the earliest Christian worship was modelled upon the synagogue, with such modifications as the position held by the apostles and perhaps the ‘seventy’ would require. The place the apostles evidently occupied at these meetings of the brethren (see note on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:35">Acts 4:35</span>), the strong probability that definite forms of prayer were already introduced as a part at least of their worship, the prompt and orderly acts which followed immediately upon the terrible event just discussed all point to a simple order and discipline reigning from the first among the new congregations.

<p><strong> wrapped him round</strong>. <strong> </strong> This seems the best and most accurate rendering. The officials whose duty it was to arrange the details of these meetings of the believers, reverently took up the poor body, and hastily, as is ever the custom in the East in the case of death, but reverentially, <em> wrapped round </em> each limb with the linen cloths used in the burying of the dead, sprinkling spices between each fold of the linen. Other translations have been proposed, the best of which renders ‘placed together,’ ‘laid out’ that is, that the stiffening limbs were composed (Meyer); the Vulgate reads <em> amoverunt, </em> which the older English Versions appear to have followed in their renderings, ‘moved away’ (Wickliffe); ‘put apart’ (Tyndale, Cranmer); ‘removed’ (Rheims).

<p><strong> And carried him out</strong>. <strong> </strong> The Jews did not bury, except in special cases, within the walls of their cities. This accounts for the long interval of time (three hours) which elapsed before the young men who had carried Ananias to his grave without the city, returned.

<p><strong> And buried him</strong>. <strong> </strong> In the East the usual custom is only to allow a few hours’ interval between death and burial. In the Jerusalem of our day we read it is the practice not to defer burial as a general rule more than three or four hours after decease.
