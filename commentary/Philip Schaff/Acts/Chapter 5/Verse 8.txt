Acts 5:8.  And Peter answered unto her.  Her entrance into the assembly of saints, where one sad thought was present in each one’s heart, was, as Bengel happily says, equivalent to her speaking. So Peter, looking at her, answers her mute look of inquiry, her voiceless question, with the words,  Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much?  pointing at the same time to the pile of gold Ananias had laid at his feet three hours before. ‘Was it for so much’ naming the sum   given him by her husband ‘that ye sold the land for?’ Now, even in this supreme moment, had she possessed the noble courage to confess the truth, she had been saved; but she held stedfastly to the same miserable deceit, and in the presence of the Church and of the apostles of that Lord she professed to love so well, repeated the lie, ‘Yea, for so much.’
