<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:9">Acts 5:9</span>. <strong> How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? </strong> This evidently in the apostle’s mind is a serious aggravation of their guilt. They had agreed together to do this thing. It was no sin committed hastily, but one thought over and planned a preconcerted scheme to deceive that loving Master whom they professed to serve as their God. It was as though they wished to test the omniscience of the Holy Spirit. Could, then, that God who ruled so visibly in His chosen servants be tricked?

<p><strong> Behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door</strong>. <strong> </strong> ‘Behold.’ The voice and gesture calling attention to the sound of the entering in at the door of the room or hall where they were sitting, of the young men who had just returned, having completed their sad office. The apostle’s words told the whole story to the unhappy woman. In a moment she saw the Spirit who ruled in that Church could not be mocked. It was all real and true.
