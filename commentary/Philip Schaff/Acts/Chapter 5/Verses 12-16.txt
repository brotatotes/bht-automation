Already we have seen how all public teaching in the name of Jesus was strictly forbidden, and in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:31">Acts 4:31</span> we are told how the brethren determined to disregard the prohibition. The present description gives us a picture of the manner in which Peter and his companions carried on their work; and for a time there was no interruption, the popular feeling being so strong in their favour.
