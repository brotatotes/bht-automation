<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:13">Acts 6:13</span>. <strong> And set up false witnesses. </strong> These words have created some difficulty. In what sense were these witnesses ‘false’? At first sight Stephen seems to have used in his arguments words not very dissimilar from those which he was charged with uttering. But these witnesses, even perhaps quoting before the Sanhedrim the very words used by the eloquent Nazarene teacher, took them out of their original context, distorted them, and evidently represented him as unceasingly ( ον παύεται ) assailing the Temple and the holy Jewish rites, held him up, first before the people, and then in more guarded language before the great council, as a <strong> </strong> fanatical enemy of all that the devout Israelite looked upon as holy and divine.

<p>The procedure of these jealous and angry Jews who suborned the false witnesses is curious, and deserves special notice. <em> Firstly, </em> When they wanted to excite the populace against Stephen, they did not scruple to charge him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:11">Acts 6:11</span>) with the most awful blasphemy against Moses and even against the God of Israel. <em> Secondly. </em> When they had so far gained their point, and they had the people with them, and the accused was about to be brought before the state Jewish tribunal, the witnesses they instructed had considerably modified the grave and terrible accusation they had spread abroad among the people. The word blasphemous (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:13">Acts 6:13</span>) disappears (according to the reading of the better MSS.). Nothing is said about Stephen railing against the revered lawgiver or the Awful Name. His offence was, he had spoken against the Temple and the law. <em> Thirdly. </em> When face to face with the accused, these charges are again watered down to a simple statement, how they remembered Stephen quoting certain well-known words of the Crucified, which they construed as a threat against the Temple and the law; but even this was enough in the eyes of the hostile Sanhedrim to warrant a solemn trial for life or death.
