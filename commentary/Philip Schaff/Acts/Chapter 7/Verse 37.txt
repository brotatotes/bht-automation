<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:37">Acts 7:37</span>. <strong> This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you,</strong> <strong> like unto me </strong> (see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:22">Acts 3:22</span>). While speaking generally of the singular favour which Moses enjoyed, Stephen instances, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:37-38">Acts 7:37-38</span>, two circumstances of that Divine favour, each peculiarly interesting to his countrymen even after the lapse of so many centuries. The one here mentioned was that the great Prophet, the Messiah, pondered over by the pious Jew for so many weary years, waited for by every patriot heart in Israel with such intense passionate longing, would be <em> like Moses, </em> ὡς ἐμέ , <em> as myself, </em> To the words of their lawgiver, Stephen adds nothing: no comment was needed here in that silent listening hall; it was well known that Stephen and those that thought with him among the people, believed the prophet like unto Moses had then arisen, and had given out His message of love and wrath. Who would dare to accuse Stephen of blaspheming Moses, of whom he spoke with such exceeding reverence? But, on the other hand, did not he charge his judges with treating their Lawgiver with scorn, seeing they had rejected and crucified the Prophet ‘ <em> like unto himself</em> ’?
