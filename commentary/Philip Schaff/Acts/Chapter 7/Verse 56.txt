Acts 7:56.  The Son of  man.  This Messianic name, which first appears in the vision of Daniel (Acts 7:13), was a title which Christ often gave to Himself when on earth, but which was never applied to Him after His resurrection by any of the apostles or evangelists, except by Stephen here (Revelation 1:13; Revelation 14:14, where the designation again occurs, are both merely the recital of visions in heaven); and in this place the martyr repeats the words which many of those present must have well remembered were uttered by His Master before the same council: ‘Jesus saith unto him’ (the high priest), ‘Hereafter shall ye see the  Son of man  sitting at the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven’ (Matthew 26:64).
	 Standing on the right hand of God.  Why standing? The Lord is always described as  sitting  in his own words (Matthew 26:0) just quoted; by evangelists (Mark 16:19), ‘He was received up into heaven, and  sat  on the right hand of God;’ by apostles, as St. Paul (Ephesians 1:20); by Old Testament writers, as David writing of King Messiah (Psalms 110:1), ‘The Lord said unto my Lord,  Sit  Thou on My right hand’ (see Pearson,  On the Glorious Session of Christ;  art. vi. of the Creed). Chrysostom’s beautiful thought best answers this question, why Stephen saw Jesus  standing  and  not sitting  at the right hand of God: ‘He had risen from the throne to succour His persecuted servant, and to receive him to Himself.’ Usually our Lord is described as the Judge of quick and dead, and then as a Judge  He sits  enthroned at the right hand of the Father; but here our Lord appears in glory, not now  sitting  as Judge, but  standing  ready to assist, ready to plead for, ready to receive His faithful martyr.
