<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:6">Acts 7:6</span>. <strong> And God spake on this wise. </strong> Stephen here quotes the passage to which he had been previously alluding, with a very slight variation, from the LXX. of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:14-15">Genesis 15:14-15</span>, the very words spoken by the Eternal to Abraham His friend, containing the promise, and also an intimation that its fulfilment must not be expected for a long period of years. It was a touching reminder to his hearers, how mistaken they were to set so superstitious a value on ground of which their great ancestors the friends and specially-protected ones of God had no tenure.
