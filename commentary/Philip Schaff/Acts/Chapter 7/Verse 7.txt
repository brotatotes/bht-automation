<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:7">Acts 7:7</span>. <strong> And serve me in this place. </strong> A quotation from the words of the Eternal spoken to Moses in the burning bush on Mount Horeb: ‘In this place’ that is, where I now speak to thee. In the passage of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:12">Exodus 3:12</span>, the words are: ‘Ye shall serve God upon the mountain,’ again reminding the elders of Israel from their own holy oracles that God was to be found in other countries besides the Holy Land, that He was to be worshipped in other places besides in that holy house on Zion. Did He not manifest Himself as visibly and resplendently in the burning thorn of the wilderness as ever He did on the golden mercy-seat of the sacred ark of the covenant?
