<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:8">Acts 7:8</span>. <strong> And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac. </strong> That is, God made with him the covenant, of which circumcision is the outward sign; and so ( οὕτως <em> thus), </em> in accordance with the terms of the covenant, God gave a son to Abraham, and Abraham, on his part, circumcised his son. Dean Goulburn, in his <em> Acts of the Deacons, </em> calls attention here to the fact that the whole of the Pauline theology finds its germs in this apology of Stephen. Paul’s assertion that faith was reckoned to Abraham when he was in uncircumcision, is merely the unfolding of Stephen’s historical statement that God, subsequently to the call and promise, gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision.
