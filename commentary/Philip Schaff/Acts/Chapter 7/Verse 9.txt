<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:9">Acts 7:9</span>. <strong> The patriarchs.</strong> The sons of Jacob received the title of ‘patriarchs’ as being the ancestors of the twelve tribes ( πατρεαί , <em> </em> LXX.). This is the first mention of that jealous, hardhearted spirit in Israel which, as Stephen proceeds with the story of the chosen people, becomes so sorrowfully prominent, and which, he shows, ended in the murder of the Righteous One.
