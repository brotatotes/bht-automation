Acts 8:18.  And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given.  The gifts of the Holy Ghost were in this case plainly visible. The laying on of the apostles’ hands conferred something more than the inward spiritual grace; outward miraculous gifts of some kind or other were plainly bestowed. The covetousness of Simon was excited by the sight of this strange power. He had watched Philip perform miracles, but never until he stood by John and Peter had he conceived it possible that this power was transferable.
	 He offered them money.  His heart was utterly unmoved. His sordid, grasping nature remained unchanged, though he had heard the burning words of the missionaries of Jesus. He simply looked on John and Peter as magicians far superior to himself, as men more deeply versed in the secrets of the craft even than Philip, whose works he had been admiring and wondering at. He supposed the secret of these men, like everything else Simon knew of in this world, was to be purchased with gold and silver.
