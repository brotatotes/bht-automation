Acts 8:20.  Thy money perish with thee.  This is no curse or imprecation on the part of Peter, for in Acts 8:22 we find the apostle exhorting the would-be magician to repentance. It is merely an expression of the strong abhorrence which an honest, righteous man would feel at such a miserable misconception of God’s ways of working. Taken in conjunction with the reminder to repentance in Acts 8:22, it is an awful prediction of what would be the fate of the covetous man if his heart remain unchanged. Gold and silver would perish in the end. Equally valueless and perishable would be the Life of an unrighteous man. The corruptible nature of that gold and silver which man prizes so dearly seems to have been ever in St. Peter’s mind, and to have entered continually into his arguments. See 1 Peter 1:7; 1 Peter 1:18; and on the fatal covetousness of false teachers, perhaps the followers of this same unhappy man, see 2 Peter 2:3, and Acts 3:6.
