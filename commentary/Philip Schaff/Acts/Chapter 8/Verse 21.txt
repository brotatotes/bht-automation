Acts 8:21.  Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter.  More accurately rendered ‘in this word’ that is to say, one whose heart is given up, as is yours, to covetousness and greed of gain, has no share in the word or doctrine which we teach, the doctrine which teaches the way and manner of the inward and outward gifts of the Holy Spirit.
	 Thy heart is not right.  Is not sincere, as God sees it.
