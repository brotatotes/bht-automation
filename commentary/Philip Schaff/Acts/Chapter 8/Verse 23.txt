<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:23">Acts 8:23</span>. <strong> For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. </strong> St. Peter here gives the reason why he doubts the possibility of forgiveness. It was not that he conceived it possible that God would ever refuse pardon to any really penitent sinner, no matter now deeply such a one might have sinned, but that he feared Simon’s heart was full of bitter hate for his Master’s blessed Gospel, and that his life was bound by the chain of sin.
