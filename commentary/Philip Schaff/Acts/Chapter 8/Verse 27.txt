<p><strong> Under Candace queen of the Ethiopians. </strong> Candace was the ordinary name of the female rulers of Meroe, the north part of Ethiopia. Eusebius, <em> H. E. </em> ii. 1, writing some three hundred years later, tells us that even in his days the custom still prevailed in Ethiopia of the supreme power being held by a <strong> </strong> female ruler. The title Candace was the customary title of the sovereign, as Pharaoh had been in Egypt, and CÃ¦sar continued to be in Rome.
