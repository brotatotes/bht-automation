Acts 8:28.  Read Esaias the prophet.  He was returning home, deeply impressed with the sanctuary, the wonders of which he had just been beholding, and whose strange, glorious history had so deeply interested him, and was reading the mystic words of one of the greatest of the Hebrew prophets. Probably the passage he was meditating on was one of those to which his attention had been just called in Jerusalem as referring to the sufferings of Messiah, concerning whom so many strange, mysterious sayings were then current in the holy city connected with that now famous persecuted sect which believed that the lately-crucified Jesus was the long-promised anointed Deliverer. The scriptures   he was reading were the Greek version of the LXX., well known throughout Egypt and the adjacent countries. It was a maxim of the Rabbis, that one who was on a journey and without a companion, should busy himself in the study of the law.
