And not only did men thus suffer at his hands, but women also, a fact three times repeated as great aggravation of his cruelty (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:2">Acts 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:4">Acts 22:4</span>). These persecuted people were scourged ‘often’ scourged in many synagogues (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span>). Nor was Stephen the only one who suffered death, as we may learn from the Apostle Paul’s own confession (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:4">Acts 22:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span>). Every possible effort he used to make them blaspheme that holy Name whereby they were called (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:11">Acts 26:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:23">Galatians 1:23</span>). His fame as an inquisitor was notorious far and wide; even in Damascus, Ananias had heard how much evil he had done to the saints of Christ at Jerusalem. He was known there ‘as he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:13-21">Acts 9:13-21</span>.
