Acts 8:32.  The place of the scripture which he read was this. He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth.  The whole passage (Acts 8:32-33) is taken almost verbatim from the LXX. version of Isaiah 53:7-8; the whole of the section is minutely descriptive of the circumstances of the Lordâ€™s Passion. This, the first part of it, found its fulfilment in the history of Jesus before Pilate and his other judges, and especially in His reply of gentle dignity to the man who struck Him for answering the high priest, and generally in the brave patience of His bearing throughout the whole course of His Passion.
