Acts 9:12.  Hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias.  The Lord, in relating to Ananias the purport of a vision which Saul had seen, especially mentioned, not  that Saul had seen thee,  but  a man named Ananias.  We may thus conclude positively that Saul and Ananias were previously unknown to each other.
