<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:12">Acts 9:12</span>. <strong> Hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias. </strong> The Lord, in relating to Ananias the purport of a vision which Saul had seen, especially mentioned, not <em> that Saul had seen thee, </em> but <em> a man named Ananias. </em> We may thus conclude positively that Saul and Ananias were previously unknown to each other.
