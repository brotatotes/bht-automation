<p><strong> Thy saints. </strong> This is the first time that we find this famous name applied to the followers of the Crucified. ‘We have hitherto found them styled “disciples,” “ believers,” “brethren.” Christians are called “saints” in the New Testament in three senses: ( <em> a</em>) <em> </em> Generally as members of a visible and local community devoted to God’s service, and as such united in a common outward profession of faith; ( <em> b</em>) <em> </em> more specifically as members of a spiritual community; and ( <em> c</em>) <em> </em> in many cases as having personal and individual sanctity. The term probably always hints at the idea of a higher moral life imparted by Christ’ (see Bishop Ellicott on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:1">Ephesians 1:1</span>, and on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>).
