 Saul at Damascus.  He goes to Jerusalem.  Barnabas brings him to Apostles there,  19-30.
	Acts 9:20.  He preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.  According to the best Greek MSS., this should be ‘  He preached Jesus,’  etc. As Paul tells us in chap. Acts 26:19, he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, but showed first to them at Damascus, and straightway preached in the synagogues. With the vision of the risen Jesus ever before him, his first work was to show his countrymen that  Jesus,  whom the high priest and Sanhedrim crucified in Jerusalem, was the Son of God. The orthodox Jewish schools, in which Saul the Pharisee had been brought up, all allowed that Christ, the Messiah, the Anointed One, when He should appear, would be the ‘Son of God.’ What they positively denied was, that the crucified Jesus was the ‘Son of God.’ Now Saul, the persecutor, in broad daylight had seen this   crucified Jesus glorified and transfigured; his first and chiefest work then was to tell out to his   countrymen this great truth.
	 The Son of God.  This was one of the Jewish titles of Messiah. So Nathanael (John 1:49) addresses Christ, ‘Rabbi, Thou art the  Son of    God;  Thou art the King of Israel;’ so Peter (Matthew 16:16), ‘Thou art Christ,  the Son of the living God.’
