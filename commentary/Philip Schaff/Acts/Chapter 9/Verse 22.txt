<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:22">Acts 9:22</span>. <strong> But Saul increased the more in strength. </strong> Dean Alford regards these as the only words under which can lie concealed the journey to Arabia, His note on this verse is a striking one: ‘Paul mentions this journey with no obscure hint that to it was to be assigned the reception by him of the Gospel which he preached, and such a reception would certainly give rise to the great accession of power here recorded. . . . The omission of any mention of this journey here can only arise from one or two causes: (1) Whether Paul himself were the source of the narration or some other narrator, <em> the intentional passing over it as belonging more to his personal history than to that of his ministry. </em> (2) On the supposition of Paul not having been the source of the narrative, <em> the narrator having not been aware of it. </em> In either case this expression (increased the more in strength) seems one very likely to have been used (1) if the omission was intentional, to record a remarkable accession of power to Saul’s ministry without particularising whence or how it came; (2) if it was unintentional, as a simple record of that which was observed in him, but of which the source was to the narrator unknown.’
