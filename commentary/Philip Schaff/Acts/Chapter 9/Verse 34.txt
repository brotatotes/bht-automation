Acts 9:34.  And Peter said onto him, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole.  The language of Peter to the palsied sufferer  is  very different from his Master’s in similar cases. The disciple performed his miracle of mercy in the name and power of Jesus Christ. The Redeemer, on the other hand, commanded with Kingly Majesty in such terms as, ‘I will, be thou clean;’ ‘Take up thy bed and walk;’ ‘Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise;’ ‘Lazarus, come forth.’
	 Arise, and make thy bed.  ‘That bed of thine, which hitherto others have made for thee, poor crippled one, from henceforth, restored by the power of my Master, Jesus, make for thyself.’
