Its singular beauty and fertility are frequently noticed in the poetical books of the Old Testament. So Isaiah, who (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:2">Isaiah 35:2</span>) writes of ‘the glory of Lebanon, and the excellency of Carmel and Sharon;’ and King Solomon in the Song of Songs (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:1">Acts 2:1</span>) tells us of ‘the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys.’ In the chronicles of the Crusades, ‘the forest of Saron’ was the scene of one of the most romantic adventures of Richard.
