Acts 9:4.  And heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul.  While the others were stunned, stupified, and confused, a clear Light broke in terribly on the soul of one of the little company. A voice spoke articulately to him, which to the rest was a sound mysterious and indistinct. He heard what they did not hear; he saw what they did not see: to them the awful sound was without a meaning. He heard the voice of the Son of God: to them it was a bright light which suddenly surrounded them. He saw Jesus, whom he was persecuting (Conybeare and Howson).

Chrysostom paraphrases the question thus: ‘What wrong great or small hast thou suffered from me, that thou doest these things?’  Me. ’ The Lord here seems to recall His own words: ‘He that heareth you heareth Me, and He that despiseth you despiseth Me’ (Luke 10:16), and also the king’s solemn words in St. Matt., Matthew 21:35-45.
