He himself tells us that he was blinded by the light which shone from heaven: ‘I could not see for the glory of that light’ (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:11">Acts 22:11</span>).

<p><strong> He</strong> <strong> saw no man. </strong> He could discern none of the familiar faces of his companions, because he was now blind. The reading of the older MSS. is even stronger: ‘He saw nothing.’

<p><strong> And they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. </strong> ‘Thus came Saul into Damascus, not as he had expected, to triumph in an enterprise on which his soul was set, to brave all difficulties and dangers, to enter into houses and carry off prisoners to Jerusalem; but he passed himself like a prisoner beneath the gateway, and through the colonnades of the street called “Straight,” where he saw not the crowd of those who gazed on him. He was led by the hands of others, trembling and helpless, to the house of Judas, his dark and solitary lodging’ (Conybeare and Howson).
