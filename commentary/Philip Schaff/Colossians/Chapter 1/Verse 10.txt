Colossians 1:10.  To walk. The best authorities omit the subject (answering to ‘ye’) of the Greek infinitive. Hence it is best to render by the English infinitive, especially as this verse does not depend on ‘asking,’ but explains the purpose of being thus filled.
	 Worthy of the torn,  i.e., Christ, since Paul seems always to use the term with this reference, except in citations from the Old Testament. Christians belong to Christ, and hence their conduct should correspond. The relation to Him furnishes a motive to imitate Him.
	 Unto all pleasing; to please Christ in all things is the true end (‘unto’) as well as the manner of the Christian walk.
	 Being  fruitful, etc. As the phrase ‘in every good work’ comes first, some have joined it with ‘unto all pleasing;’ others join it with both of the participles. But the view indicated by the E. V. is preferable, since it preserves the symmetry of the construction. The figure here is the same as in Colossians 1:6. The sphere of the fruitfulness is  every good work, by which ‘we all understand, works required by the will of God, growing out of faith, demanded, not merely by law, but by relations, circumstances, by the inward impulse of the conscience and the Holy Ghost’ (Braune).
	 And increasing by the knowledge  (‘full knowledge’)  of God. Some authorities read: ‘unto the knowledge of God,’ but the dative is much better supported. This may mean ‘by,’ or, ‘with respect to.’ The latter sense is that suggested by the E, V. (‘in’); but the instrumental sense is preferable. ‘It is the knowledge of God which is the real instrument of enlargement, in soul and in life, of the believer not a  knowledge  which puffeth up but an  accurate  knowledge which buildeth up’ (Alford). This view joins the phrase with ‘increasing,’ not with both participles. But the two thoughts are not disconnected: ‘the tree grows healthfully while its fertility is so great’ (Eadie).
