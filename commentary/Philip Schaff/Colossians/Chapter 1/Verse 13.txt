Colossians 1:13.  Who (  i.e., the Father)  delivered us. A strong expression, suggesting snatching from danger, as wretched captives (so Theophylact).
	 Out of the power of darkness. ‘Darkness’ is personified, as it were, and ‘power’ refers to the dominion, more literally ‘authority,’ which the darkness possesses. The ‘world’ is thus represented, as under the dominion of evil and sin, over against the kingdom of Christ, which is ‘in light.’
	 And translated  us. This is the positive side; the figure of transferring is a natural one.
	 Into the kingdom,  etc. ‘Kingdom’ in contrast with ‘power,’ referring not to the future Messianic kingdom, nor to the Church, nor to the inward workings of grace, but to the kingdom of Christ as a rule already begun on the earth, and to be completed hereafter. Matthew 13:0 plainly suggests this present reference.
	 Of  the Son of his love.  This expression, ‘which recalls Ephesians 1:6, both in phrase and connection, occurs only here, and sets forth the Son with the greatest emphasis as the Object of His love, upon whom His entire love flows, and through Him therefore upon us’ (Braune). So the best of recent commentators. Other explanations have been suggested; none of them more objectionable than that of the E. V. (‘His dear Son’).
