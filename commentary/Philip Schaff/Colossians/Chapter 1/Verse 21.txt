<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:21">Colossians 1:21</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:21-23">Colossians 1:21-23</span> the Apostle indicates how the Colossians share in this reconciliation.

<p><strong> And you</strong>. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>. A new sentence begins here, and the construction is regular, according to the better supported reading.
	</p>
<p><strong> Being once, </strong> <em> i.e., </em> formerly, <strong> alienated</strong>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12">Ephesians 2:12</span>, where the same term occurs. But here the reference is to alienation from God; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span>.
	</p>
<p><strong> And enemies; </strong> not only alienated but hostile to God. The word in itself might mean the objects of God’s wrath (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:10">Romans 5:10</span>; Eph. 2:23), but what follows favors the other sense.
	</p>
<p><strong> As to your</strong> <strong> mind. </strong> The word ‘mind’ (or, ‘understanding’) refers ‘to the higher intellectual nature, especially as shown in its practical relations’ (Ellicott), hence not to the exclusion of ethical and religious relations, which are here involved. Their ‘mind’ was the special seat of this alienation and hostility.
	</p>
<p><strong> In your evil works</strong>; this was the sphere in which the alienation and enmity were manifested. The word ‘evil’ is emphatic ‘The phrase includes all works which are done contrary to God’s command, or, if formally in accordance with the law, yet prompted by fleshly appetites and propensities’ (Braune).
	</p>
<p><strong> Yet now hath he reconciled</strong>; lit., ‘did He reconcile,’ by one act, namely, the atoning death of Christ. But English usage will not permit us to join ‘now’ with the simple past tense. (The Vatican manuscript reads: ‘ye were reconciled,’ a variation that can be readily accounted for; it deserves mention only as a curiosity.) Here, as throughout, God is the subject, reconciliation is His act, through Christ.
