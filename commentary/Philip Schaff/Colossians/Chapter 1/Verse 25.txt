<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:25">Colossians 1:25</span>. <strong> Whereof </strong> (of which Church) <strong> I became a minister. </strong> As minister of the gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span>) he became also minister of the Church which proclaims the gospel. In the Church there is no true ministry apart from the ministry of the gospel.

<p><strong> According to the dispensation, </strong> etc. The word ‘dispensation’ has here its more usual sense of ‘Stewardship.’ His Apostolic office is thus described as of <strong> God, </strong> belonging to God. In the Church, the house of God, he exercises the function of a steward.

<p><strong> Which was given to me. </strong> The emphasis rests on the fact that <em> God </em> had entrusted him with this office, rather than on <em> his </em> having received.

<p><strong> To you-ward. </strong> His office was that of Apostle to the Gentiles; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1-2">Ephesians 3:1-2</span>, etc.
	</p>
<p><strong> To fulfil the word of God. </strong> This presents the design of the giving, and further explains ‘to you-ward.’ The reference seems to be to carrying the word of God to the Gentiles as a whole, thus filling out the full measure of its universal destination. Thus the duties of Paul’s stewardship would be discharged. This sense accords with what follows (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:26-27">Colossians 1:26-27</span>) and with the emphasis which Paul everywhere places upon this idea; comp. Ephesians, chaps. 1-3 through out. Many other explanations (all objectionable) have been given: to give the full contents of the gospel; to complete it; to fulfil the promises of God; to realize the word of God; to bring you to full faith.
