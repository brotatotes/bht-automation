Colossians 1:25.  Whereof  (of which Church)  I became a minister.  As minister of the gospel (Colossians 1:23) he became also minister of the Church which proclaims the gospel. In the Church there is no true ministry apart from the ministry of the gospel.
	 According to the dispensation,  etc. The word ‘dispensation’ has here its more usual sense of ‘Stewardship.’ His Apostolic office is thus described as of  God,  belonging to God. In the Church, the house of God, he exercises the function of a steward.
	 Which was given to me.  The emphasis rests on the fact that  God  had entrusted him with this office, rather than on  his  having received.
	 To you-ward.  His office was that of Apostle to the Gentiles; comp. Ephesians 3:1-2, etc.
	 To fulfil the word of God.  This presents the design of the giving, and further explains ‘to you-ward.’ The reference seems to be to carrying the word of God to the Gentiles as a whole, thus filling out the full measure of its universal destination. Thus the duties of Paul’s stewardship would be discharged. This sense accords with what follows (Colossians 1:26-27) and with the emphasis which Paul everywhere places upon this idea; comp. Ephesians, chaps. 1-3 through out. Many other explanations (all objectionable) have been given: to give the full contents of the gospel; to complete it; to fulfil the promises of God; to realize the word of God; to bring you to full faith.
