<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:26">Colossians 1:26</span>. <strong> Even the mystery, </strong> etc. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:9">Ephesians 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:4-9">Ephesians 3:4-9</span>. Here as there the reference is not merely to the salvation of the Gentiles, but to Redemption in Christ as belonging to the eternal plan of God.

<p><strong> Hath been hid </strong> from <strong> the ages and from the </strong> generations. This particular phrase is peculiar (but comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5">Ephesians 3:5</span>). ‘Beside the ages of the world, the generations of men living in them are brought into special prominence, and thus the concealment from the beginning of human history is marked’ (Braune).

<p><strong> But now it hath been made manifest ‘</strong> Now,’ in this present dispensation, it was made manifest. The tense points to the single past act, but our English idiom requires ‘hath been.’ In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5">Ephesians 3:5</span> the contrast is one of degree; here it is absolute. Moreover the change of construction (not indicated in the E. V.) sharpens the contrast. Since ‘made manifest’ is more general than ‘revealed,’ or, ‘made known,’ it is properly referred to the entire historical manifestation, which took place in different ways, partly by revelation, partly by preaching and exposition, and partly by all combined (Meyer). This is favored by the mention of Paul’s preaching (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:28">Colossians 1:28</span>).

<p><strong> To</strong> <strong> his saints. </strong> To all Christians, since the specific terms found in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5">Ephesians 3:5</span> are wanting here. On the word ‘saints,’ see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:2">Colossians 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:1">Ephesians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span>.
