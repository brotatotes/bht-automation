Colossians 1:4.  Having heard. ‘ After hearing,’ rather than, ‘since we heard,’ or,  ‘ because we heard.’
	 Your faith in Christ Jesus.  He is the sphere and object of the faith; comp. Ephesians 1:15.
	 The love which ye have to  all the saints. The Italics of the E. V. are unnecessary, since the better supported reading   gives ‘which ye have,’ thus emphasizing the tact that they possess it.
