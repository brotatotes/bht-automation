<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>. <strong> On account of, </strong> etc. This verse is to be closely joined with what precedes. ‘Which ye have on account of,’ etc. It is improper to connect it with ‘give thanks.’

<p><strong> The hope, </strong> <em> i.e., </em> the thing hoped for, the hope as respects its contents, since only in this sense could it be defined by the clause: <strong> which is laid up for you in heaven. ‘</strong> Laid up’ suggests the thought of a treasure set aside for future use and securely placed. ‘In heaven’ is not strictly local here, but may point to the future kingdom of heaven.

<p><strong> Whereof ye heard before. </strong> The exact reference of ‘before’ has occasioned much discussion. It is perhaps safest to take it indefinitely: of this hope they previously heard (when the gospel came to them), since it was prominent in the gospel preaching. Other views: before the Epistle was written; before the hope was cherished; before the fulfilment of the hope. In any case the clause suggests that the ‘hope’ was not an unfounded fancy, but was based upon the proclamation of the truth.

<p><strong> In the word of the truth of the gospel. </strong> Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span>. ‘The word’ refers to the preaching, the substance of that preaching was ‘the truth,’ and this truth was specifically that contained in ‘the gospel’ (so Meyer, Ellicott, and others). ‘Gospel’ is not in apposition with ‘the word of the truth’ as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span>. The hope of which they heard before was ‘in’ (as an essential part of) this ‘word.’
