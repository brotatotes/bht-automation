<p><strong> Ye learned of Epaphras. </strong> A resident of Colossæ or its neighborhood (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:12">Colossians 4:12</span>), a ‘fellow-prisoner’ of Paul at Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:23">Philemon 1:23</span>). This verse indicates that be was the founder of the Church at Colossæ, or one of the first preachers in that city. ‘Also’ (E. V.), which is based upon a poorly supported reading, obscures this point. Some have held that this person was identical with Epaphroditus, the Macedonian, who is mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:25">Philippians 2:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+4:18">Philippians 4:18</span>. The identity of names is possible, though not established, but that of persons is improbable, since the fields of labor indicated were so far apart Lewin <em> (Life and Epistles of St. Paul, </em> ii. 246), in defending the identity, says: ‘The reason for calling him Epaphras to the Colossians and Philemon, and Epaphroditus to the Philippians, was that to the former he was known as a fellow-countryman by <strong> </strong> the abbreviated and familiar name, but to the Philippians, to whom he was a stranger, he was <strong> </strong> designated by the formal name at full length.’ But the mention of Epaphroditus in Philippians does not suggest any such formality. The view that there were two persons is preferable.

<p><strong> Our dear fellow servant, </strong> etc. This commendation of Epaphras is related to the purpose of the Apostle. What the Apostle would oppose was <strong> </strong> the error which had sprung up since the true gospel was preached to him by Epaphras. ‘Fellow servant,’ as related to Christ, their common Lord. </p>
<p><strong> Who is, </strong> not, ‘was.’ The continuance of his position as ‘faithful minister’ is thus emphasized. </p>
<p><strong> On our </strong> (or, ‘your’) <strong> behalf. </strong> The Sinaitic manuscript has given a decided preponderance of authority to the reading ‘our,’ although even in that codex a later corrector has altered the single letter which changes the sense to ‘your.’ ‘On our behalf.’ while not in itself equivalent to ‘in my place,’ suggests this thought. The original connects the phrase with ‘faithful,’ but it is difficult to reproduce this in English. ‘He was one acting faithfully <em> as the Apostle’s deputy, </em> and there-fore not lightly to be set aside in favor of the new and erroneous teachers’ (Alford).
	</p>
<p><strong> Faithful minister of Christ.</strong> Whether the faithful service was on the Apostle’s behalf or on behalf of the Colossians, it was service of Christ. Because he was a minister ‘of Christ’ he could properly minister in their behalf. Only the minister of Christ can be thus faithful, but he always should be faithful. </p>
