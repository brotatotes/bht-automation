<p><strong> Your love in the Spirit. </strong> This ‘love’ is that spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:4">Colossians 1:4</span>, but here described as to its source and sphere; it was in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:30">Romans 15:30</span>, ‘love of the Spirit,’ <em> i.e.</em>, wrought by the Spirit. The phrase is not to be limited to love to the Apostle, nor weakened into ‘spiritual, sincere love.’ Notice: the Apostle commends where he can, even when he must also rebuke. Comp. the words of praise in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:5">Colossians 2:5</span>, preceding the most earnest warning. The mystical (Gnostic) errorists in every age have frequently deserved similar praise, but this should not hide, or excuse (still less be turned into argument in favor of) their errors. Epaphras, from whose teachings some of the Colossian Christians had swerved, gladly declared what was commend-able in the congregation.
