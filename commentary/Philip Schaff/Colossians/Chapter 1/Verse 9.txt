<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:9">Colossians 1:9</span>. <strong> For this cause;</strong> referring to the entire preceding paragraph (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:3-8">Colossians 1:3-8</span>), because of what had been heard respecting the Colossians.
	</p>
<p><strong> We also</strong>; <strong> </strong> comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:3">Colossians 1:3</span>. ‘Also’ marks the change of subject: ‘we on our part’ as well as others, probably with special thought of Epaphras who has just been named (Meyer).
	</p>
<p><strong> Since the day we heard it</strong>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:4">Colossians 1:4</span>. ‘The receipt of the intelligence produced immediate results and led to prayer. The effect was instant and it was not spent with a single impulse’ <em> </em> (Eadie).
	</p>
<p><strong> Do not cease, </strong> etc. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:16">Ephesians 1:16</span>: ‘an exactly similar affectionate hyperbole’ (Ellicott).
	</p>
<p><strong> Praying for you and asking. </strong> The former participle points <strong> </strong> to prayer in general, the latter to direct petition; ‘for you’ belongs to both words, and the former points to constant habitual action.
	</p>
<p><strong> That, </strong> etc. On ‘that’ after verbs of asking, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span>. This clause is joined with ‘asking’ (as the punctuation of the E. V. suggests) and not with both participles. It gives the purport and purpose of the petition.
	</p>
<p><strong> Ye may be filled. </strong> The verb ‘filled’ occurs five times in this Epistle; it suggests the imperfect state of those prayed for.
	</p>
<p><strong> with the knowledge of his will </strong> ‘Knowledge’ here is ‘full knowledge,’ being a stronger form corresponding with the verb used in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:6">Colossians 1:6</span>. The reference is of course to God’s ‘will,’ and, as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:10">Colossians 1:10</span> indicates, His will respecting the walk of the Christian; but not this exclusively, since Christian life is based on a wider knowledge than this.
	</p>
<p><strong> In all spiritual wisdom and understanding.</strong> This phrase indicates the mode in which this being filled was to take place; not through human, fleshly wisdom, but wisdom and understanding wrought by the Holy Spirit. ‘Spiritual’ (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span>) qualifies both nouns, not ‘understanding’ alone (E. V.). ‘Wisdom’ is a more general term than ‘understanding,’ but both refer to practical wisdom.
