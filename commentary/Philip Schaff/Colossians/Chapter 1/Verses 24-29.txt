 3. The Apostle’s Joy in His Sufferings and Labor for Christ.
	The need of stedfastness (Colossians 1:23) had been enforced by a reference to the Apostle’s personal relation to the gospel. This thought is naturally enlarged upon by the ‘prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles’ (Ephesians 3:1). He describes his joy in suffering (Colossians 1:24), the joy and suffering alike having their occasion in his relation to the mystery of Christ (Colossians 1:25-27), namely, to make Christ known to the Gentiles; hence he speaks of his labors in the fulfilment of this ministry (Colossians 1:28-29), the labors having as their immediate aim the spiritual perfection of each and every Christian (Colossians 1:28), and the struggles being maintained through the inworking of Christ’s power (Colossians 1:29). Apart from Christ his life had no significance; here was another indirect blow at the Colossian errors.
