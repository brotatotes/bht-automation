<p><em> 3. The Apostle’s Joy in His Sufferings and Labor for Christ</em>.
	</p>
<p>The need of stedfastness (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span>) had been enforced by a reference to the Apostle’s personal relation to the gospel. This thought is naturally enlarged upon by the ‘prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span>). He describes his joy in suffering (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>), the joy and suffering alike having their occasion in his relation to the mystery of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:25-27">Colossians 1:25-27</span>), namely, to make Christ known to the Gentiles; hence he speaks of his labors in the fulfilment of this ministry (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:28-29">Colossians 1:28-29</span>), the labors having as their immediate aim the spiritual perfection of each and every Christian (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:28">Colossians 1:28</span>), and the struggles being maintained through the inworking of Christ’s power (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:29">Colossians 1:29</span>). Apart from Christ his life had no significance; here was another indirect blow at the Colossian errors.
