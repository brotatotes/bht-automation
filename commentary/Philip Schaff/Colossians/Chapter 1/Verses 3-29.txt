<p>I. DOCTRINAL PART: CHRIST THE HEAD OF ALL THINGS.
	</p>
<p>This division of the Epistle resembles the doctrinal part of Ephesians (chaps, 1-3.); but here the Person of Christ is more prominent; there Christ as the Head of the Body. The liturgical tone is less obvious here, and the style less involved. But in both thanksgiving and supplication occur: He teaches doctrine best who prays as he teaches. The following subdivisions will be found convenient: (1.) The Apostle’s thanksgiving for the faith and love of his readers (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:3-8">Colossians 1:3-8</span>). (2.) The Apostle’s supplication for their progress in the knowledge of Christ as Head of all things (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:9-23">Colossians 1:9-23</span>). (3.) The Apostle’s joy in his sufferings and labors for Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24-29">Colossians 1:24-29</span>). The entire division, in both the personal and doctrinal statements, well prepares for the second (polemical) part of the Epistle, to which chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1-3">Colossians 2:1-3</span> furnishes an appropriate transition. Many commentators therefore include these verses in the doctrinal part of the Epistle.
