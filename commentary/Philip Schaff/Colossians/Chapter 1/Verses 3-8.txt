<p>I. <em> The Apostle's Thanksgiving for the Faith and Love of his Readers.
	</em></p>
<p>This section might be termed ‘introductory,’ because of its personal character. Yet even here the doctrinal motive is apparent Paul usually begins with thanksgiving on behalf of his readers; but as he omits even such implied commendation in the Epistle to the Galatians, it may be inferred that the Colossian Christians, as a body, had not yet wandered from the truth.
	</p>
<p>But his thanksgiving to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:3">Colossians 1:3</span>) for their faith and love (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:4">Colossians 1:4</span>) and on account of the hope laid up for them (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>) has a deeper ground in the truth of the gospel, which had come to them (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:6">Colossians 1:6</span>) through Epaphras (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:7">Colossians 1:7</span>) who had brought tidings of them to the Apostle (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:8">Colossians 1:8</span>). He joins the objective truth of the gospel and the subjective appropriation of it; together they are the occasion of his thankfulness to God. Thus be prepares the way for fuller statement of that truth and for admonitions to hold it fast.
