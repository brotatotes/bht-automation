I.  The Apostle's Thanksgiving for the Faith and Love of his Readers.
	This section might be termed ‘introductory,’ because of its personal character. Yet even here the doctrinal motive is apparent Paul usually begins with thanksgiving on behalf of his readers; but as he omits even such implied commendation in the Epistle to the Galatians, it may be inferred that the Colossian Christians, as a body, had not yet wandered from the truth.
	But his thanksgiving to God (Colossians 1:3) for their faith and love (Colossians 1:4) and on account of the hope laid up for them (Colossians 1:5) has a deeper ground in the truth of the gospel, which had come to them (Colossians 1:6) through Epaphras (Colossians 1:7) who had brought tidings of them to the Apostle (Colossians 1:8). He joins the objective truth of the gospel and the subjective appropriation of it; together they are the occasion of his thankfulness to God. Thus be prepares the way for fuller statement of that truth and for admonitions to hold it fast.
