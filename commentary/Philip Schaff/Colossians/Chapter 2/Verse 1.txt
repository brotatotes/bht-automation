<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1">Colossians 2:1</span>. <strong> For I would have you know. </strong> ‘For’ introduces an illustration and proof of the ‘striving’ just spoken of (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:29">Colossians 1:29</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> How great </strong> (an unusual word, indicating quality as well as extent) <strong> a conflict. </strong> The term corresponds with ‘striving;’ comp. also chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:12">Colossians 4:12</span>. It refers to the Apostle’s anxiety, not to his external suffering St still less to any actual contest with false teachers.
	</p>
<p><strong> For you. </strong> The best authorities read here the same preposition as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>: ‘in behalf of you;’ the common text means simply: ‘about you.’
	</p>
<p><strong> And from them at Laodicea</strong>; a <strong> </strong> neighboring Church (see Introduction, Section 1); probably in the same danger; comp. also <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:16">Colossians 4:16</span>.
	</p>
<p><strong> And as many, </strong> etc. This adds the general class to which the readers (and the Laodicean Christians) belonged. The obvious inference is that he had not been in Colosse and the neighboring city. To take this phrase as referring to another class confuses the entire thought of the context (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:4">Colossians 2:4</span>: ‘their hearts,’ and ‘you’).
	</p>
<p><strong> In</strong> <strong> the flesh. </strong> This qualifies ‘face,’ = my bodily presence; ‘a concrete touch added to enhance the nature of his struggle; it was not for those whom he personally knew and who personally knew him, but for those for whom his interest was purely spiritual and ministerial’ (Ellicott).
