<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:10">Colossians 2:10</span>. <strong> And ye are made full in him. ‘</strong> Ye are in Him, and being in Him ye are made full and continue thus.’ This is closely connected with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9">Colossians 2:9</span>; because of the fulness which dwells in Christ, those in fellowship with Him are made full. The divine gifts thus obtained are ample, hence they ought not to seek to supplement this sufficient supply by looking to other sources.

<p><strong> Who is the head of all principality and power. </strong> The repetition of these terms indicates that the false teachers presented the angels as mediators, or in manner which detracted from the sufficiency of Christ. This affirmation of the absolute superiority of Christ to the angelic world meets this error. Nor is this superiority simply one of position, since the head is in vital connection with the members, which derive their life from it; see <strong> </strong> marginal references.
