This refers to the objective redeeming work, which must precede the appropriation of it by believers who are thus forgiven. If referred to the same time, the forgiveness must be regarded as taking place (ideally) at the death of Christ

<p><strong> The handwriting of ordinances, </strong> etc. The word ‘handwriting’ had the technical sense of a bond, obligating the signer against whom it was held. The bond in this case was the law <strong> , </strong> which was written in, took the form of ‘ordinances,’ <em> i.e., </em> specific commandments. These, expressed in the Mosaic law, constituted an obligation that <strong> was</strong> <strong> against us, </strong> all men, Gentiles as well as Jews. To apply it to an unwritten law is to destroy the force of the figure, and to limit it to the ceremonial law is to weaken the thought of the entire passage. God’s law, thus definitely expressed in ordinances, was the uncancelled moral obligation that bound all men. This God cancelled by the redeeming work of Christ.

<p><strong> By nailing it to the crocs. </strong> ‘By nailing’ indicates more plainly that this was the method by which the bond was forever removed. ‘It was the law rather than Christ, which was slain and done away with on the cross, because He bore the curse <em> of </em> the law, took away its condemnation. Men slew Christ, but the Lord slew the law on the cross; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:13">Galatians 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:0">Galatians 2:0</span> Pet. 2:24’ (Braune).
