Colossians 2:21.  Handle not, nor taste, nor touch.  ‘Nor’ is almost = nor even. The E. V. mistranslates the first and last words, and improperly includes the verse in parenthesis. The climax is reached in ‘do not even touch.’ The prohibitions are specific in form, and refer to certain kinds of food and drink, as appears not only from the word ‘taste,’ but from Colossians 2:16 and (especially) Colossians 2:22. Defilement by contact with impure objects may be included, but is not suggested by the context. This series of condemned prohibitions cannot be used in support of total abstinence from intoxicating liquors, except through culpable ignorance or dishonesty.
