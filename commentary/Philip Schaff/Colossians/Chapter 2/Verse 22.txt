<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:22">Colossians 2:22</span>. This verse is parenthetical, and describes the character of the objects prohibited: <strong> which all are to perish with the using:</strong> all of them appointed to destruction by being used up. This language cannot be fairly applied to the prohibitions, since it is inapplicable. Nor can it be regarded as part of the statement of the false teachers, still less can moral corruption be intended. The view here advocated is accepted by the best recent commentators, and agrees with our Lord’s own words in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:17">Matthew 15:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:18-19">Matthew 7:18-19</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:13">1 Corinthians 6:13</span>.

<p><strong> After the precepts and doctrines of men.</strong> This is to be joined with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:20">Colossians 2:20</span>, defining further the subjection to ordinances. ‘Doctrines’ is a term of wider signification than ‘precepts;’ but both are united here and described as ‘of men,’ in contrast ‘with God’s law and word in Christ, indeed with the law of Moses, beyond which they have gone’ (Braune).
