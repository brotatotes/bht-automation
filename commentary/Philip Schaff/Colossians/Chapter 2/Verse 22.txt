Colossians 2:22. This verse is parenthetical, and describes the character of the objects prohibited:  which all are to perish with the using: all of them appointed to destruction by being used up. This language cannot be fairly applied to the prohibitions, since it is inapplicable. Nor can it be regarded as part of the statement of the false teachers, still less can moral corruption be intended.

This is to be joined with Colossians 2:20, defining further the subjection to ordinances. ‘Doctrines’ is a term of wider signification than ‘precepts;’ but both are united here and described as ‘of men,’ in contrast ‘with God’s law and word in Christ, indeed with the law of Moses, beyond which they have gone’ (Braune).
