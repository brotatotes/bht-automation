Colossians 2:5.  Absent in the flesh,  etc. External bodily presence is contrasted with spiritual presence;  with you in the spirit. ‘Spirit’ is here used in the psychological sense = the human spirit, in contrast with flesh (= body). This contrast is usually expressed by Paul in other terms (see mare, references), since ‘flesh’ and ‘spirit’ are used by him especially in a technical theological sense.
	 Joying and beholding.  This describes how he was present in the Spirit. The connection of the two words is variously explained; but it seems best to take them together, the second being a mere special and explanatory addition to the first, and both governing the following words as objects. ‘This must not be regarded as a logical inversion. The contemplation of their orderly array, although it might have been first the cause, was afterwards the consequence of the Apostle’s rejoicing. He looked, because it gave him satisfaction to look’ (Lightfoot). ‘His joy on this account enchains him, so that he stands there as a spectator’ (Braune).
	 Your order.  A military figure, readily suggested to a Roman prisoner, and referring to the external department of the Church.
	 And the stedfastness; also a military term, meaning the firm, solid basis, rather than the quality of firmness. It points to the internal condition of the Church.
	 Of your faith in Christ.  Belonging to your faith, or, presented by your faith. ‘After these words we have no reason for doubting that the Church of Colossae, though tried by heretical teaching, was   substantially sound in the faith’ (Ellicott).
