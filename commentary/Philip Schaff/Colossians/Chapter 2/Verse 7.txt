Colossians 2:7.  Rooted and built up.  This is to be closely joined with Colossians 2:6  ,  as defining the command, ‘walk in Him.’ The first participle points to taking root once for all and continuing rooted; the second to the progressive building up. The figures occur elsewhere.
	 In  him.  Christ is here set forth first as the soil, and then as the cornerstone; not strictly as the foundation, since ‘upon Him’ would be used to express that thought; comp Ephesians 2:20.
	 And stablished by your faith  (lit., ‘the faith’), or,   ‘as to your faith.’ ‘In your faith’ is the reading of good authorities; but the simple dative is to be preferred, which may be instrumental, or may point to what is strengthened. The former gives the more appropriate sense; ‘faith’ being subjective, as the English possessive pronoun serves to indicate. ‘Faith is, as it were, the cement of the building’ (Lightfoot).
	 As ye were taught; in accordance with the teaching of Epaphras (chap. Colossians 1:7).
	 Abounding in thanksgiving.  Many authorities read ‘in it’ (i.e.  ,  your faith), but the evidence of the Sinaitic manuscript has turned the scale against the acceptance of it ‘In’ is more literal than ‘with,’ and points to ‘the field of operation in which that abundance is manifested’ (Alford). Here, as everywhere, the Apostle emphasizes the privilege of thanksgiving (comp. in this Epistle, chaps. Colossians 1:12; Colossians 3:15; Colossians 3:17; Colossians 4:2).
