<p><strong> In</strong> <strong> him. </strong> Christ is here set forth first as the soil, and then as the cornerstone; not strictly as the foundation, since ‘upon Him’ would be used to express that thought; comp <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>.

<p><strong> And stablished by your faith </strong> (lit., ‘the faith’), or, <em> </em> ‘as to your faith.’ ‘In your faith’ is the reading of good authorities; but the simple dative is to be preferred, which may be instrumental, or may point to what is strengthened.

Here, as everywhere, the Apostle emphasizes the privilege of thanksgiving (comp. in this Epistle, chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:12">Colossians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:15">Colossians 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:17">Colossians 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:2">Colossians 4:2</span>).
