Colossians 2:9.  Because in him (in the Personal Christ, and in none other)  dwelleth  (now and permanently)  all the fulness of the Godhead  (comp. chap. Colossians 1:19)  bodily.  The emphasis rests on the word ‘bodily,’ which does not mean ‘really,’ or ‘entirely,’ or ‘essentially,’ but ‘in bodily fashion,’ pointing to Christ’s human body, not to the Church or to the created world. The fulness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the Eternal Word (chap. Colossians 1:19), and because of this when the Word became flesh (John 1:14) the fulness dwelt in Him ‘bodily’ (not strictly ‘in His body’). The reference is therefore to the now glorified Christ, but could have no validity were He not the Eternal Word, since ‘all the fulness of the Godhead’ means all the perfections of Deity;  i.e., the Divine Essence. (In Romans 1:20, ‘Divinity’ points rather to the Divine quality.) The various attempts to weaken the sense scarcely deserve mention. Some peculiar form of error taught at Colossae is doubtless opposed by the language of the Apostle.
