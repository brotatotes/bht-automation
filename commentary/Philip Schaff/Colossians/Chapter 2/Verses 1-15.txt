1.  Warning Against being Led Away through the Philosophy of the False Teachers.
	This section, which is most directly in opposition to the errors at Colossae, is introduced by a paragraph, expressing the anxiety of the Apostle respecting the believers in and near Colossae (Colossians 2:1-3). He then exhorts them to continue in the truth they had been taught, praising them for their order and steadfastness (Colossians 2:4-7). Having already hinted at their danger (Colossians 2:4), the Apostle utters a distinct warning against the false teachers and their ‘philosophy and vain deceit’ (Colossians 2:8). He then sets forth the Person and Work of Christ (Colossians 2:9-15) over against these teachings which are ‘not after Christ.’ Christ the Head (Colossians 2:9-10) triumphs over angelic might (Colossians 2:15); the true circumcision is that of Christ whose redeeming work (Colossians 2:11-13) cancelled the law of ordinances. In these two directions the warning is continued in the remainder of the chapter.
