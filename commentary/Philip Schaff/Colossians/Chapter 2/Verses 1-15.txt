<p>1. <em> Warning Against being Led Away through the Philosophy of the False Teachers</em>.
	</p>
<p>This section, which is most directly in opposition to the errors at Colossae, is introduced by a paragraph, expressing the anxiety of the Apostle respecting the believers in and near Colossae (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1-3">Colossians 2:1-3</span>). He then exhorts them to continue in the truth they had been taught, praising them for their order and steadfastness (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:4-7">Colossians 2:4-7</span>). Having already hinted at their danger (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:4">Colossians 2:4</span>), the Apostle utters a distinct warning against the false teachers and their ‘philosophy and vain deceit’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:8">Colossians 2:8</span>). He then sets forth the Person and Work of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9-15">Colossians 2:9-15</span>) over against these teachings which are ‘not after Christ.’ Christ the Head (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9-10">Colossians 2:9-10</span>) triumphs over angelic might (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:15">Colossians 2:15</span>); the true circumcision is that of Christ whose redeeming work (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:11-13">Colossians 2:11-13</span>) cancelled the law of ordinances. In these two directions the warning is continued in the remainder of the chapter.
