<p>2. <em> Two Special Warnings Enforced.
	</em></p>
<p>This brief section is both an application of the obligations resulting from the truths stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9-15">Colossians 2:9-15</span>, and a warning against certain specific errors which threatened the practical Christian life of the Colossian believers, ( <em> a</em>.) The first warning, against ritual prohibitions (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:16-17">Colossians 2:16-17</span>), applies the truth of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:11-14">Colossians 2:11-14</span>; ( <em> b</em>.) the second, against angel worship (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18-19">Colossians 2:18-19</span>), applies that of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9-10">Colossians 2:9-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:15">Colossians 2:15</span>. <em> (c.</em>) Both are enforced by recalling the fact that they died with Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:20-23">Colossians 2:20-23</span>) and hence were freed from these earthly ordinances, which are utterly futile for ethical purposes (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:23">Colossians 2:23</span>). Chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:1-4">Colossians 3:1-4</span> is closely connected with the last paragraph.
