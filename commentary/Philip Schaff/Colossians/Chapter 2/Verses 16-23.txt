2.  Two Special Warnings Enforced.
	This brief section is both an application of the obligations resulting from the truths stated in Colossians 2:9-15, and a warning against certain specific errors which threatened the practical Christian life of the Colossian believers, (  a.) The first warning, against ritual prohibitions (Colossians 2:16-17), applies the truth of Colossians 2:11-14; (  b.) the second, against angel worship (Colossians 2:18-19), applies that of Colossians 2:9-10; Colossians 2:15.  (c.) Both are enforced by recalling the fact that they died with Christ (Colossians 2:20-23) and hence were freed from these earthly ordinances, which are utterly futile for ethical purposes (Colossians 2:23). Chap. Colossians 3:1-4 is closely connected with the last paragraph.
