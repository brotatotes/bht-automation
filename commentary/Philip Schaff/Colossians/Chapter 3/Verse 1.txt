If, as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:20">Colossians 2:20</span>, sets forth a fact, since then deduces an inference. The same fact has been presented in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span>.

<p><strong> Were raised together;</strong> the passive implies God’s agency, which is not suggested by the E. V. (‘be risen’). The past tense points to the time of their baptism comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span>), which in the case of these adult Christians followed their faith in Christ. The rite was the sign and seal of their participation in the resurrection of Christ. But baptism and this raising are not identical. The latter is the reality of which the former is the sign. This being raised together with Christ implies ethical renewal of the believer, and hence it forms an appropriate motive to the exhortations which follow. God thus raises us with Christ, our ethical transformation is the necessary result; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:5">Romans 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:6">Ephesians 2:6</span>.

<p><strong> Seek</strong> <strong> the things that are above</strong>. (The phrase occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:2">Colossians 3:2</span> also, and the rendering is made to correspond; ‘that’ being preferable to ‘which.’) The emphasis rests on ‘the things,’ etc. To seek these is the necessary consequence and requirement of the fact previously stated. For these heavenly things are where Christ is, and we have been raised together with Him.

<p><strong> Sitting on the right hand or God</strong>. At the place of power and honor, after His humiliation, but ‘sitting’ there in assured rest after conflict and victory. (The E. V. overlooks the double statement) The Ascension is presupposed (Meyer). The position of Christ, our personal Head and Lord, is the strongest motive to a life whose ends are heavenly. The contrast with earthly things is brought out in the following verse.
