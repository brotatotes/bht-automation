<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:10">Colossians 3:10</span>. <strong> And have put on the new man</strong>. This is coincident in time with the ‘putting off,’ but in the workings of grace ‘the initiative is with the new man and in virtue of the Divine power creating him’ (Braune). ‘New’ is here, young, fresh; in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span> the idea is that of newness. But there the former idea is suggested by the verb, here the latter by the following participle; so that no very marked distinction is implied.

<p><strong> Which</strong>, or, ‘who.’ The latter accords better with the personification.

<p><strong> Being renewed;</strong> continually, by the Holy Ghost. The new man which was put on is thus developed
	</p>
<p>Unto full knowledge; possibly in contrast with the ‘knowledge’ <em> (gnosis) </em> of the false teachers. This perfect knowledge is the aim of the renewal.

<p><strong> After the image of him that created him.</strong> Comp. ? <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:2">Ephesians 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span>. Here, as there, there is an unmistakable allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:26-27">Genesis 1:26-27</span>; hence to God (not Christ) as the creator. The entire phrase qualifies ‘renewed,’ not ‘full knowledge.’ That was the aim of the renewal, this is its <em> norm. </em> But the passage implies more than a restoration of the image lost by the fall. The first and the new creations are analogous: ‘the Christian is the genuine man; Christianity is true, God-willed humanity’(Braune).
