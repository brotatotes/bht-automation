<p><strong> But Christ is all and in all</strong> ‘But,’ strongly adversative, presents the contrast with the world of carnal men, where all these distinctions not only exist, but are emphasized and control the conduct. The first ‘all’ is neuter, the second probably masculine: ‘all things and in all persons.’ Ellicott: ‘Christ is the aggregation of all things, distinctions, prerogatives, blessings, and moreover is in all, dwelling in all, and so uniting all in the common element of Himself.’ The order of the Greek places the word ‘Christ’ last for emphasis, and the entire clause is in accord with the theme of the Epistle: Christ the Head of all things.
