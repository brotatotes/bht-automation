Colossians 3:11.  Where, in the region of the new creation, in contrast with that in which the old man dwelt, there is not (‘not only does the distinction not exist, but it  cannot  exist;’ Lightfoot)  Greek and Jew, no division as respects nationality,  circumcision and uncircumcision, as  respects religion, Barbarian, Scythian, as respects civilization (‘Scythians, more barbarous than the barbarians;’ Bengel),  bondman, freeman  (so Ellicott), as respects social condition. Comp. Galatians 3:28. ‘He perhaps does not say “  bond and free ”   because these relations actually subsisted: but the persons in them were not thus regarded in Christ no man is,  as a Christian, bond  nor  free’ (Alford).
	 But Christ is all and in all ‘But,’ strongly adversative, presents the contrast with the world of carnal men, where all these distinctions not only exist, but are emphasized and control the conduct. The first ‘all’ is neuter, the second probably masculine: ‘all things and in all persons.’ Ellicott: ‘Christ is the aggregation of all things, distinctions, prerogatives, blessings, and moreover is in all, dwelling in all, and so uniting all in the common element of Himself.’ The order of the Greek places the word ‘Christ’ last for emphasis, and the entire clause is in accord with the theme of the Epistle: Christ the Head of all things.
