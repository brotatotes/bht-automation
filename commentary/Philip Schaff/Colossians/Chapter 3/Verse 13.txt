Colossians 3:13.  Forbearing one another, and forgiving each other.  The pronouns are different, as in Ephesians 4:32; the latter marking more strongly the relation of Christians as members of Christ. On ‘forbearing,’ see Ephesians 4:2.
	If (as is probable) a  ny man have a complaint  (a cause of blame)  against any: even as the Lord forgave you. The authorities vary: many of the best read ‘the Lord;’ most have ‘Christ,’ and two of the best have ‘God.’ This state of things renders it most probable that ‘the Lord’ was the original form, especially since the parallel passage (Ephesians 4:23) has ‘God in Christ.’
	 so also do ye. In English we supply an imperative (‘do’), but the grammatical ellipsis is that of a participle (‘so also  doing  yourselves’). The mode of forgiveness is here spoken of (‘even as,’ ‘so’); the ground of Christ’s forgiveness is left out of view.
