<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:13">Colossians 3:13</span>. <strong> Forbearing one another, and forgiving each other. </strong> The pronouns are different, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:32">Ephesians 4:32</span>; the latter marking more strongly the relation of Christians as members of Christ. On ‘forbearing,’ see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:2">Ephesians 4:2</span>.
	</p>
<p>If (as is probable) a <strong> ny man have a complaint </strong> (a cause of blame) <strong> against any: even as the Lord forgave you</strong>. The authorities vary: many of the best read ‘the Lord;’ most have ‘Christ,’ and two of the best have ‘God.’ This state of things renders it most probable that ‘the Lord’ was the original form, especially since the parallel passage (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:23">Ephesians 4:23</span>) has ‘God in Christ.’
	</p>
<p><strong> so also do ye.</strong> In English we supply an imperative (‘do’), but the grammatical ellipsis is that of a participle (‘so also <em> doing </em> yourselves’). The mode of forgiveness is here spoken of (‘even as,’ ‘so’); the ground of Christ’s forgiveness is left out of view.
