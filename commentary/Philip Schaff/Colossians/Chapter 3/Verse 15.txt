Colossians 3:15.  And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts. The word ‘rule’ is more exactly: ‘act as umpire,’ a figure borrowed from the Grecian games. In Philippians 4:7, ‘the peace of God’ occurs, and this passage was probably altered to conform. The idea is, however, substantially the same.

Those who accept ‘rule’ as the meaning of the verb, refer the precept more immediately to Christian concord.
