Colossians 3:18.  Wives, submit yourselves,  etc. (The word ‘own’ is to be omitted; it was inserted to conform with the parallel passage.) Comp. the similar exhortation, with the basis of it, in Ephesians 5:22-24: ‘The husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the Head of the Church.’ The Bible everywhere recognizes the relation as of this character (from Genesis 2:18-24 to Revelation 22:17). Hence the submission is to be a loving one, with a Christian motive:  As if fitting  (as it should be)  in the Lord.  This means: as should be the case, in consequence of the fellowship with Jesus Christ.
