<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:18">Colossians 3:18</span>. <strong> Wives, submit yourselves, </strong> etc. (The word ‘own’ is to be omitted; it was inserted to conform with the parallel passage.) Comp. the similar exhortation, with the basis of it, in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:22-24">Ephesians 5:22-24</span>: ‘The husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the Head of the Church.’ The Bible everywhere recognizes the relation as of this character (from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:18-24">Genesis 2:18-24</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+22:17">Revelation 22:17</span>). Hence the submission is to be a loving one, with a Christian motive: <strong> As if fitting </strong> (as it should be) <strong> in the Lord. </strong> This means: as should be the case, in consequence of the fellowship with Jesus Christ.
