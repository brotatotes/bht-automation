<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:19">Colossians 3:19</span>. <strong> Husbands, love your wives. </strong> (The word ‘your’ is supplied several times in this section; it represents the Greek article with its possessive force; hence the italics of the E. V. are unnecessary.) ‘Even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave Himself for it’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:25">Ephesians 5:25</span>). This example and motive put a transforming power into the corrupt social life of the first century. The love commanded is more than the fancy or passion of youth.

<p><strong> And be not bitter </strong> (or, ‘embittered’) <strong> against them. ‘</strong> This special warning concerns a foul blot in married life, when the husband, as head of the house, not as head of the wife, not in love to her, but ruled by “the old man,” either shows bitterness in word or deed or in tone to the wife, should she be wanting in humility or submission, or have violated or disregarded the household right of the husband; or treats her with indifference, neglect, or harshness, without any fault of hers, from the cares and weariness of business, or the changing moods of the flesh, or mere habit’ (Braune). On the duties of husband and wife all other social duties rest. To make the marriage the less sacred, to encourage its dissolution, is like poisoning the wells of an entire community.
