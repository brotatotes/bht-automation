In their earliest years children learn respecting God from their relation to their parents. If they do not learn to obey, the foundation of their ethics, as well as of their theology, is not properly laid.

Christian parents are referred to (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:1">Ephesians 6:1</span>: ‘in the Lord’), and Christian children are addressed, since this motive is added: <strong> for this is well pleasing in the Lord. </strong> (The received reading is poorly supported) Such obedience is indeed well pleasing ‘unto the Lord,’ but the Apostle uses the phrase ‘in the Lord,’ in connection with these social precepts, to set forth the Christian character of the duty: ‘as judged by a Christian standard, as judged by those who are members of Christ’s body’ (Lightfoot).
