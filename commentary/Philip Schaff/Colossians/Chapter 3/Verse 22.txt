<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:22">Colossians 3:22</span>. <strong> Servants, </strong> lit., ‘bondmen,’ slaves. See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5-6">Ephesians 6:5-6</span>.

<p>In all things. Peculiar to this passage. Here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:20">Colossians 3:20</span>, it states the general rule; the limitations arise from the modifications of the relation, but chiefly from the superior commands of God.
	</p>
<p><strong> Hasten according to the flesh; </strong> in contrast with the higher Master; ‘Lord’ representing the same Greek word.
	</p>
<p><strong> Not with eyeservice</strong>, lit., ‘eyeservices.’ In Ephesians, the singular points to the abstract spirit; the plural here, to the various manifestations of it. The word was coined by the Apostle to express the service which aims only to <em> seem </em> faithful.
	</p>
<p><strong> As menpleasers. </strong> The motive must be a higher one than that of pleasing men. ‘Eyeservices’ are the natural result of being ‘men-pleasers.’
	</p>
<p>But <strong> in singleness</strong> <strong> of</strong> <strong> heart. </strong> Duplicity is a vice engendered by slavery, but wherever one serves another for wages there is room for it. The Christian should render the service due another, with a desire to be, not merely to seem, faithful.
	</p>
<p><strong> Fearing the Lord</strong>. (The reading, ‘God,’ is poorly supported.) The same word is translated ‘master’ in the beginning of the verse. Hence the thought is: your real Master (not ‘according to the flesh’) is Christ; jour obedience is to be prompted, not by a desire to please men, but by a fear of the Lord Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:24">Colossians 3:24</span>). Too often employers have been expected to act in a Christian, benevolent spirit, while the employees forgot their true Lord.
