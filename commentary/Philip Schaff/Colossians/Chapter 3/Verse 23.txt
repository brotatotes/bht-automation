<p>As to the Lord, <strong> and not to men</strong>. Every thing should be done as for Christ, as service rendered for Him, in view of the relation to Him. ‘And the relation to the human master should not, in this method of regarding it, be taken into the account at all, on the principle of not serving two masters’ (Meyer).
