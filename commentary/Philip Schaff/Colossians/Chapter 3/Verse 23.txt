Colossians 3:23.  Whatsoever,  however small, ye do, in this relation,  work from  the heart  ‘Do it’ is inexact; the same word is not repeated. ‘From the heart,’ or, ‘soul,’ is equivalent to ‘heartily,’ but should be rendered in correspondence with Ephesians 6:6. ‘With good heart, not from servile necessity, but of a free mind and choice’ (Chrysostom).
	As to the Lord,  and not to men. Every thing should be done as for Christ, as service rendered for Him, in view of the relation to Him. ‘And the relation to the human master should not, in this method of regarding it, be taken into the account at all, on the principle of not serving two masters’ (Meyer).
