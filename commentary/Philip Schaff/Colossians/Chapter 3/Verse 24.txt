Colossians 3:24.  Knowing. Or, ‘seeing that ye know.’ The motive which has been alluded to through-out is plainly stated.
	That from the Lord,  i.e.,  from Christ, the true Master of the Christian.
	 Ye shall receive the  recompense.  Not pay or reward, but that which is a compensation for the present privations.
	 Of  the inheritance.  This is the compensation, the heritage of heaven, full salvation. Because it is an inheritance, it is not purchased by the privations or the good service for which it becomes a compensation.
	 Ye serve.  The word ‘for’ is to be omitted; and the original may mean either ‘ye serve,’ or ‘serve ye.’ The latter is preferable, summing up in one phrase the contents of all the previous precepts.
	The Lord Christ,  i.e., the Master Christ.
