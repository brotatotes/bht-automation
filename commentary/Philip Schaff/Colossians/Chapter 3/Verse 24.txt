<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:24">Colossians 3:24</span>. <strong> Knowing</strong>. Or, ‘seeing that ye know.’ The motive which has been alluded to through-out is plainly stated.
	</p>
<p>That from the Lord, <em> i.e., </em> from Christ, the true Master of the Christian.
	</p>
<p><strong> Ye shall receive the</strong> <strong> recompense. </strong> Not pay or reward, but that which is a compensation for the present privations.
	</p>
<p><strong> Of</strong> <strong> the inheritance. </strong> This is the compensation, the heritage of heaven, full salvation. Because it is an inheritance, it is not purchased by the privations or the good service for which it becomes a compensation.
	</p>
<p><strong> Ye serve. </strong> The word ‘for’ is to be omitted; and the original may mean either ‘ye serve,’ or ‘serve ye.’ The latter is preferable, summing up in one phrase the contents of all the previous precepts.
	</p>
<p>The Lord Christ, <em> i.e.</em>, the Master Christ.
