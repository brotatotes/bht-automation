<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:6">Colossians 3:6</span>. <strong> For which things’ sake</strong>; ‘on account of which sins;’ <strong> the wrath of God cometh,</strong> etc. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:6">Ephesians 5:6</span>. The clause: <strong> on the sons</strong> (not, ‘children’) <strong> of disobedience </strong> is not found in the Vatican manuscript, and some versions omit it. The suspicion of an insertion from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:6">Ephesians 5:6</span> is against accepting it, but the weight of authority is too strong to be overcome by this consideration. If omitted, the verse should read in English: ‘cometh the wrath of God.’ In any case ‘cometh’ is emphatic, expressing a general principle. The full manifestation will be at the day of judgment, but present punishment is not necessarily excluded. On ‘the wrath of God,’ see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18">Romans 1:18</span>.
