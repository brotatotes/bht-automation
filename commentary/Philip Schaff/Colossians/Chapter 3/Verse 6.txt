Colossians 3:6.  For which things’ sake; ‘on account of which sins;’  the wrath of God cometh, etc. Comp. Ephesians 5:6. The clause:  on the sons (not, ‘children’)  of disobedience  is not found in the Vatican manuscript, and some versions omit it. The suspicion of an insertion from Ephesians 5:6 is against accepting it, but the weight of authority is too strong to be overcome by this consideration. If omitted, the verse should read in English: ‘cometh the wrath of God.’ In any case ‘cometh’ is emphatic, expressing a general principle. The full manifestation will be at the day of judgment, but present punishment is not necessarily excluded. On ‘the wrath of God,’ see on Romans 1:18.
