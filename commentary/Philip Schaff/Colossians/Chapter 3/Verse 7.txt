Colossians 3:7.  Among whom, or, ‘in which.’ The former rendering is preferable, if the longer reading be retained in Colossians 3:6: among these sons of disobedience. Comp.

	 Ye also, like the other Gentiles, once walked, this describes their conduct;  when ye lived in these things  refers to their continued life and character. There is no doubt that ‘in these things’ is the correct reading and rendering. The distinction between the two verbs prevents tautology, if ‘in which’ be accepted as the correct explanation in the first clause. But the other seems preferable, if the longer reading is retained in Colossians 3:6.
