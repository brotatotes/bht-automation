<p><strong> Anger, wrath, malice</strong> (these three form a climax), <strong> evil speaking </strong> (lit., ‘blasphemy’). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:31">Ephesians 4:31</span>, where all the terms occur.
	</p>
<p><strong> Abusive talking</strong>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:4">Ephesians 5:4</span> a similar expression is rendered ‘filthiness;’ this word occurs only here, and refers to coarse abusive speech, not exclusively to ‘filthy talking.’

<p>Out of your month; this applies to the last two terms.
