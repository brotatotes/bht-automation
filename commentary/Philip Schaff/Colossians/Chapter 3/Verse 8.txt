Colossians 3:8.  But now, in contrast with ‘once’ (Colossians 3:7), ye also, as well as other Christians, put off, as garments are put off (not the same word as in Colossians 3:9, but found in Ephesians 4:22; Ephesians 4:25), all these, ‘the whole of them,’ including the sins named in Colossians 3:5, as well as those now mentioned. This is a command, not a declaration.
	 Anger, wrath, malice (these three form a climax),  evil speaking  (lit., ‘blasphemy’). See on Ephesians 4:31, where all the terms occur.
	 Abusive talking. In Ephesians 5:4 a similar expression is rendered ‘filthiness;’ this word occurs only here, and refers to coarse abusive speech, not exclusively to ‘filthy talking.’
	Out of your month; this applies to the last two terms.
