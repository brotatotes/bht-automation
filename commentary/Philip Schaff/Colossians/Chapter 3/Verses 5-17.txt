<p>2. <em> General Exhortations</em>.
	</p>
<p>We find here, though in much briefer form, substantially the same exhortations contained in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17">Ephesians 4:17</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:21">Ephesians 5:21</span>. The section may be thus divided: </p>
<p>(1.) Negative precepts, answering to the fact that they died with Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:5-11">Colossians 3:5-11</span>), concerning earthly pleasures and possessions (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:5-7">Colossians 3:5-7</span>), and social relations (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:8-11">Colossians 3:8-11</span>).
	</p>
<p>(2.) Positive precepts, answering to the fact that they were raised together with Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12-17">Colossians 3:12-17</span>); the exhortations are: to exercise Christian affection and forbearance, for Christâ€™s sake (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12-14">Colossians 3:12-14</span>), and to glorify Christ in grateful word and work (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:15-17">Colossians 3:15-17</span>).
	</p>
<p>While the contrast between the old man and the new (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17-32">Ephesians 4:17-32</span>) and the motive from the love of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:1-21">Ephesians 5:1-21</span>) appear here, the arrangement is more logical, and accords with the main theme of the Epistle. In Ephesians the thought of unity in Christ gives greater diversity to the exhortations; here the thought of Christ the one Head seems to arrange the precepts in accord with the fact of having died and rising again with Him.
