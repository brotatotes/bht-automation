3.  Special Precepts as to Household Relations.
	This section agrees, not only in outline, but in detail, with the corresponding passage in Ephesians. The arrangement is identical, the precepts and motives in the main the same. Here, however, the relation of wife and husband is not enlarged upon, as in Ephesians. The fundamental thought of that Epistle would suggest a fuller treatment. From this nothing can be inferred as to which was first written. The precepts are as follows:  (a.) To wives (Colossians 3:18) and husbands (Colossians 3:19).
	 (b.) To children (Colossians 3:20) and parents (Colossians 3:21).
	 (c.) To servants (Colossians 3:22-25) and masters (chap. Colossians 4:1).
	Nowhere is the division of chapters more infelicitous than here.
