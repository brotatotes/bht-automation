Colossians 4:10.  Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner saluteth you.  A Macedonian from Thessalonica (Acts 19:29; Acts 20:4; Acts 27:2), who was with Paul in Asia Minor, and probably not unknown at Colossæ. He afterwards accompanied the Apostle to Jerusalem, and sailed with him to Rome, where, according to Philemon 1:24, he was a ‘fellow-worker’ with the Apostle, Epaphras being there termed ‘fellow prisoner.’ As the word means a prisoner of war, it may have here a figurative sense. He might have voluntarily shared the Apostle’s captivity, or been temporarily confined in consequence of his intimacy with the latter.
	 And Mark. Doubtless the Evangelist; also named in Philemon 1:24. The name in all the New Testament passages seems to refer to the same person.
	the cousin of Barnabas ‘Cousin’ is doubtless the proper rendering, referring to the relation between children of brothers or of sisters, or of brother and sister. ‘Barnabas was better known than Mark; hence the latter is named from the former’ (Bengel). Notice the affectionate reference of Paul to Barnabas, here and Galatians 2:13, after the collision and separation (Galatians 2:11; Acts 15:34).
	 Touching whom (  i.e., Mark, not Barnabas)  ye received commandments. Probably written commendations (but this can only be conjectured), in any case ‘received’ before this Epistle readied them.
	If he come unto you, receive him. The Gentile churches may have regarded Mark with suspicion in view of the separation of Paul and Barnabas occasioned by him. This command, rendered the more forcible by the change of construction, bespeaks for him a friendly welcome. The past failure was forgiven by the Apostle, he would have it forgotten by the churches.
