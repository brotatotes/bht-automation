<p><strong> who are of the circumcision. </strong> These three companions of Paul were Jews. Many disconnect this clause from what precedes, and render: ‘Of those who are of the circumcision, only these are my fellow-workers,’ etc. This is undoubtedly the correct sense, since others, who were not Jews, had labored with him and been a comfort. But this view makes the grammatical connection (in the Greek) very difficult

<p><strong> These only</strong>, etc. This indicates the general antagonism of the Jewish Christians; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+1:15">Philippians 1:15</span>.

<p><strong> Such as </strong> (of such a kind as) <strong> have been a comfort onto me;</strong> ‘have proved a comfort unto me.’ A touching allusion to the trials he encountered from the Judaizers. Others, not of the Jews, had been a comfort to him. The verse does not necessarily imply that others of the Jews had been ‘fellow-workers unto the kingdom of God,’ and yet not a comfort unto him. The use of the term ‘fellow-worker’ seems to oppose this view.
