<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:14">Colossians 4:14</span>. <strong> Luke, the beloved physician; </strong> undoubtedly the Evangelist, not to be confounded with Lucius (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>), this being a shorter form of Lucanus. He was a Gentile, being distinguished from those ‘of the circumcision’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:11">Colossians 4:11</span>). As he accompanied Paul from Cæsarea to Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:0">Acts 27:0</span>), hence the mention of his name does not decide where the Epistle was written. He probably attended the Apostle as a ‘physician,’ at least the first hint of his personal presence is given (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:10">Acts 16:10</span>) about the time Paul was suffering from his unknown malady (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:13-14">Galatians 4:13-14</span>). He may have been known at Colossæ, but his gospel could scarcely have been known there, if indeed it was written so early. The word ‘beloved’ is emphatic (‘the physician, the beloved one’), giving prominence to his relation to Paul.

The latter notice tells of his desertion of the Apostle. ‘The absence of any honorable or endearing mention here may be owing to the commencement of this apostasy, or some unfavorable indication in his character’ (Alford).
