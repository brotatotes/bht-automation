Colossians 4:15.  Salute the brethren that are at Laodicea.  A natural message, owing to the proximity of the two places; see Introduction, § 1.
	 And Nymphas; evidently an inhabitant of Laodicea, thus singled out. It is most natural to regard the name as masculine, but it may be that of a woman. The Vatican manuscript favors the feminine form, and reads ‘her’ in the added clause. But the reading ‘their’ is the more probable one, ‘his’ and ‘her’ being corrections made to avoid the difficulty of the plural pronoun after a singular noun. Westcott and Hort, as usual, follow the Vatican manuscript
	 The church that is in their house;  see above. On these household churches, see Romans 16:5, etc. ‘Their’ refers to Nymphas and his family, but ‘the Church’ does not include all the believers at Laodicea; nor may we suppose that this was a small community of Christians in the neighborhood of that city. A certain number of the Laodicean believers met for worship at the house of Nymphas, and for reasons, unknown to us, a special greeting is sent to them.
