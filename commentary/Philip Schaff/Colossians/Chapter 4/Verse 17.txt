<p>a resident of Laodicea, and hence singled out here. But <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:2">Philemon 1:2</span> indicates a residence with Philemon, whatever relationship existed between them. Where he was <strong> </strong> associated with the Apostle can only be conjectured.

<p><strong> Take heed to the ministry, </strong> etc. As to the nature of this ministry, we know nothing whatever; and as little as to the reason for sending <strong> </strong> the exhortation in this public manner. Archippus might have been a ‘deacon,’ though the word does not necessarily suggest this; or he may have been the most prominent elder in the Colossian congregation. Some find a reproof here, but it is rather a caution. Whether it was occasioned by the danger threatening the Church, or by something in Archippus himself is uncertain. Meyer rightly calls attention to the anti-hierarchical tone of this verse; the New Testament Church was <strong> </strong> an evangelical Church of the people.

<p><strong> Didst receive in the Lord. </strong> At the time of his setting apart to his office. ‘In the Lord’ is not to be explained as ‘from the Lord,’ or, ‘through the Lord,’ but points to ‘the sphere of the <em> reception </em> of the ministry; in which the recipient lived and moved and promised at his ordination; not of the ministry itself’ (Alford). The whole phrase furnishes a motive for the exhortation.
	</p>
<p><strong> That thou fulfil it</strong>; fully perform its duties. (Some render: ‘take heed that thou fulfil the ministry,’ etc., but this is harsh and unnecessary.) Official gifts bring responsibility, both to Christ and to His people. What we receive in the Lord, but increases the need of watchfulness on our part.
