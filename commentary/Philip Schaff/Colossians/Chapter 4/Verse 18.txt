<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:18">Colossians 4:18</span>. <strong> The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand; </strong> comp. 1Co 16:21 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>, which are in the same words, and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:11">Galatians 6:11</span>, which resembles this. The rendering here given agrees with that of the E. V. in the first passage. These autograph salutations were <strong> </strong> to attest the genuineness of the document, as is shown in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>; comp. the salutation of the amanuensis in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:22">Romans 16:22</span>.

<p><strong> Remember my bonds. </strong> The connection between the autographic salutation and this clause is natural: the chain which bound him was <strong> </strong> probably on the right hand, hindering his use of the pen. These bonds were occasioned by his preaching the gospel to the Gentiles: ‘A touching exhortation, speaking vividly to the hearts of his readers, <strong> </strong> and breathing patience, love, and encouragement’ (Ellicott). It is not so much a request for sympathy as an appeal to be heard and obeyed, since he as ‘the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span>) should command a hearing for his message in behalf of Christ. For himself he is ‘more concerned about the preservation of his person in triumphant fellowship with the Lord, for His sake and that of His Church, than for release or for the alleviation of his imprisoned condition’ (Braune).

<p><strong> Grace be with you. </strong> (Here also the word Amen <strong> </strong> is poorly supported: comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:24">Ephesians 6:24</span>. The subscription is not genuine, but was naturally added in conformity with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:7-9">Colossians 4:7-9</span>.) See references for this brief form of the benediction; all the instances are in the later Epistles. Brief as it is, this blessing is all comprehensive: that the grace of God in Christ was all-sufficient need not be proved at the close of an Epistle whose theme is; Christ the Head of all things.</p>
