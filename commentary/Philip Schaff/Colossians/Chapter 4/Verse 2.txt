<p><strong> Being watchful therein with</strong> (lit, ‘in’) <strong> thanksgiving, </strong> Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:18">Ephesians 6:18</span>, as well as the injunction: ‘watch and pray’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:41">Matthew 26:41</span>, etc.). ‘In,’ repeated in the Greek, points in the first instance to the sphere of the watchfulness, and in the second to an accompaniment.
