<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:6">Colossians 4:6</span>. <strong> Let your</strong> <strong> speech </strong> (lit, ‘word’ <strong> ) be always with grace. </strong> The first characteristic of Christian discourse, especially ‘toward them that are without,’ is here indicated: it should be ‘with (lit., ‘in’) grace,’ attractiveness, the result not of studying to please, but of Divine grace.

<p><strong> Seasoned with</strong> <strong> salt. </strong> The word ‘seasoned’ points to a permanent characteristic. ‘Salt’ preserves both from insipidity and corruption, and Christian speech should not be flat, but fresh and wholesome. The figure is a culinary one, not borrowed from sacrificial usage, still less from the notion of ‘Attic salt,’ which was corrupting enough. Stupid speech is wicked for Christians, since Christ’s grace should suffice to season well their utterances.

<p><strong> That ye may know </strong> (indicating the result) <strong> how ye ought to answer each one. ‘</strong> What’ is presupposed; ‘how’ refers to the form. It should be specially adapted to the hearer (‘each one’). The context shows that unbelievers are meant, although the rule holds good in all social intercourse. ‘Sweetness and point,’ adaptation to the hearer; these characteristics of Christian speech, when supported by a wise walk and watchfulness for proper opportunities, will give power to the words of the humblest believer. Alas, how much ‘pious talk’ is acrid and flat, inopportune and without tact.
