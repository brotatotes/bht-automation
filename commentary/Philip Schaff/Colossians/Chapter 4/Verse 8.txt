<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:8">Colossians 4:8</span>. <strong> Whom</strong> <strong> I sent</strong>, etc. See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:22">Ephesians 6:22</span>, which is verbally identical, if we accept here the reading of the earliest authorities: <strong> that ye may know the things respecting us.</strong> The received reading (in the Greek) differs from this in but three letters; moreover the variations are such as would readily arise. The best Greek manuscripts nearly all read as in Ephesians. The Vulgate is on the side of the received text. Since the discovery of Aleph, which in its corrections presents the entire history of the change, critical editors have usually accepted ‘ye’ and ‘our.’ The weight of authority overbears the probability of an alteration to conform with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:22">Ephesians 6:22</span>.
