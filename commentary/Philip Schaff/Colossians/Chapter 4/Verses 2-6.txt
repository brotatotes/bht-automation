4.  Concluding Exhortations.
	This brief section contains special exhortations, but not addressed to special classes. The thoughts are familiar; Colossians 4:6 alone is without a parallel in the Epistle to the Ephesians. The connection, however, is not obvious. The precepts may have been suggested by the thought of Christian service in general, or they may be regarded as entirely supplementary. They are aphorisms in form, and have reference  (a) to  prayer (Colossians 4:2), especially  supplication for the Apostle (Colossians 4:3-4), and (  b) to  conduct toward those who were  not Christians (Colossians 4:5-6). The duties enjoined have not lost their importance.
