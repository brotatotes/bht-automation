<p>4. <em> Concluding Exhortations</em>.
	</p>
<p>This brief section contains special exhortations, but not addressed to special classes. The thoughts are familiar; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:6">Colossians 4:6</span> alone is without a parallel in the Epistle to the Ephesians. The connection, however, is not obvious. The precepts may have been suggested by the thought of Christian service in general, or they may be regarded as entirely supplementary. They are aphorisms in form, and have reference <em> (a)</em> to <em> prayer</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:2">Colossians 4:2</span>), especially <em> supplication</em> for the Apostle (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:3-4">Colossians 4:3-4</span>), and ( <em> b</em>) to <em> conduct</em> toward those who were <em> not Christians</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:5-6">Colossians 4:5-6</span>). The duties enjoined have not lost their importance.
