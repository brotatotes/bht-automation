This division of the Epistle is brief. It may be divided into three paragraphs: (1.) Personal intelligence (Colossians 4:7-9).
	(2.) Greetings  from Paulâ€™s companions (Colossians 4:10-14), and  to the brethren at Laodicea, with other messages (Colossians 4:15-17).
	(3.) Farewell greeting and benediction (Colossians 4:18). Only the first paragraph finds a parallel in the Epistle to the Ephesians.
