Ephesians 1:15.  For this cause.  ‘Wherefore’ is the usual rendering of another Greek word. Because of the grace for which the Apostle has made his ascription of praise (Ephesians 1:3-14), but especially on account of what is stated in Ephesians 1:13-14, where the Gentile readers are addressed.
	 I also; as well as you, implying their cooperation in such prayerful activity (Meyer).
	 Having heard.   When and where is not indicated, nor can anything be inferred as to his acquaintance or non-acquaintance with the readers. ‘On hearing,’ whenever it was.
	 Of the faith which is among you.  The peculiar Greek expression which the Apostle here uses may be thus paraphrased. The faith is there among them; ‘your faith in Christ Jesus’ (Colossians 1:4), marks the faith as the possession of the individuals. ‘Faith’ does not, however, mean ‘that which is believed,’ but ‘believing.’
	 In the Lord Jesus.  This is the sphere and object of the faith: ‘Christ centred faith’ (Ellicott).
	 And the love which ye have.  The full form of the Greek may be thus paraphrased. But some ancient authorities omit the words ‘the love.’ Those who accept the briefer reading explain thus: the faith which is among you in the Lord Jesus and which  ye show  unto all saints. We prefer to retain the words, because they are not only well supported, but the omission can be readily accounted for. The original suggests, first, love in general, and then this characteristic manifestation of it:  unto all the saints,   i.e., Christians (comp. chap. Ephesians 1:1). Brotherly love is a characteristic of Christianity (Bengel). ‘We should not overlook the emphasis resting on the word “all,” permitting no distinction as respects condition, rank, possessions, or internal endowment, either mental or spiritual’ (Braune). But the community of faith precedes and produces the community of feeling. The order is always ‘faith and love.’
