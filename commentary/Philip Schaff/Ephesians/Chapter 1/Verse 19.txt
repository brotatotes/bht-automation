Ephesians 1:19.  And what the exceeding greatness of his power, etc. The third object of knowledge is God’s  power,  but as manifested, both in present redemption and future glorification, not in the latter alone, which, however, is included: ‘There is thus a kind of climax, the  hope  which the calling awakens, the exhaustless and inexpressible  glory  (Chrysostom) of that inheritance to which hope is directed the limitless  power  that shall bestow it’ (Ellicott).
	 To usward who believe. This phrase is to be joined with ‘His power,’ setting forth the personal objects toward and upon whom the power is exercised. ‘Who believe,’ is almost equivalent to ‘who are believers.’ The present tense favors the view that the whole clause includes a reference to present redemption.
	 According to the working of the might of his strength. This clause, which is expanded in Ephesians 1:20-21, qualifies the whole preceding part of the verse, setting forth the mode of the operation of ‘His power to usward,’ etc. Others join it with ‘who believe,’ as indicating the cause of our faith; but ‘who believe’ is too subordinate a thought to call for this amplification. Others connect it with ‘may know,’ which is too remote. The greatness of the power which bestows the ‘glory’ and fulfils the ‘hope’ is in accordance with a manifestation already made of God’s strength. ‘Strength’ is God’s inherent power; ‘might’ is the putting forth of that power; ‘working’ is its actual efficiency. The accumulation of terms is designed to exalt our conception of the greatness of God’s power, as put forth in the Resurrection and exaltation of Christ.
