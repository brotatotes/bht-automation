Ephesians 1:5.  In love  having predestinated us.  The tense here used does not imply that the predestination preceded the election; the two may be regarded as synchronous. There is no grammatical objection to the former view, but there seems to be no instance in the N. T. which establishes the priority of predestination. The word  predestine  (fore-ordain) refers to choosing for a preappointed end; the word translated ‘chose’ (Ephesians 1:4) points to the fact that the choice has been made out of a mass. If ‘in love’   be connected with this verse, it gives special emphasis to the motive of the predestination. These things, at which men cavil, are prompted by love, and will be apprehended only when men respond in love.
	 Unto adoption.  The end of the foreordaining is that we may be placed in the position of sons, enjoy the privileges of sons; comp. Romans 8:15-29. Christ is ‘the first-born,’ the only begotten Son; we are foreordained unto adoption, to become His brethren.
	 Through Jesus Christ unto himself.  ‘Jesus Christ’ is the personal mediator through whom this adoption takes place; the end of it is ‘unto Himself,’  i.e., ‘to lead us into, and unite us to God’ (Ellicott). ‘Himself’ does not refer to Christ. All this constitutes the end of the predestination.
	 According to the good pleasure of his will.  The word ‘good-pleasure’ has two meanings: (1.) good-pleasure, what one pleases to do, because good to him, or (2.) benevolence, what involves good will to others. The former is the sense here, as the context plainly indicates. The freedom of God’s will is here asserted, and for us this thought is an all-important one. If God is not free, then our freedom is impossible. If He is not free, His benevolence is of little value to sinners. On ‘will,’ see Ephesians 1:11.
