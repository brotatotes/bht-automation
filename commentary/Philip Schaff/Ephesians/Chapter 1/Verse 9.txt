Ephesians 1:9.  Having made known to us.  This explains what precedes. Ellicott: ‘in making known to us’; Alford: ‘in that He made known.’ Hence this takes place at the same time with the causing to abound (Ephesians 1:8).
	 The mystery of his will. The mystery concerning His will, rather than belonging to His will, or, which is His will. On ‘will,’ see ver. Ephesians 1:8. The word ‘mystery’ (comp. Romans 11:25) in the N. T. is applied to: (1.) ‘such matters of fact as are inaccessible to reason, and can only be known through revelation; (2) such matters as are patent facts, but the process of which cannot be entirely taken in by the reason’ (Tholuck). In this Epistle the term is frequently used, the primary reference being to the one great gospel mystery, the person of Christ in its connection with the body of Christ. But the union of Jews and Gentiles in this one body, as an especial feature of this mystery, is in some instances the most prominent aspect presented; comp. on chap. Ephesians 3:3-4; Ephesians 3:9. Here the wider reference is to be accepted; the redemption in Christ as belonging to the eternal plan of God. We could not know this great fact were   it not revealed, and even now it contains much that transcends our reason.
	 According to  his good pleasure.  Comp. Ephesians 1:5. This making known was, in all its details, according to His will.
	 Which he purposed in himself,  or, ‘in Him.’ The latter is literally correct, but ‘Himself’ makes the reference to God more obvious to the English reader. ‘Purposed’ means to put before one’s self, not necessarily beforehand, though the whole context shows that the purpose is to be regarded as taking place before the foundation of the world (comp. Ephesians 1:4-5; Ephesians 1:11). A comma is the only punctuation necessary at the close of the verse.
