<p>I. <em> Praise for Spiritual Blessings in Christ.
	</em></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3-14">Ephesians 1:3-14</span> form but one sentence, so heaped up in thought and so involved in construction as to well-nigh baffle all attempts at exact analysis. The passage, as a whole, has a triumphant liturgical tone, the key-note being found in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span>. Probably no one view exhausts the meaning, we therefore give a number of summaries: </p>
<p>Braune finds in the refrain ‘unto the praise of the glory of His grace’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:6">Ephesians 1:6</span>), ‘unto the praise of His glory’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:12">Ephesians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>), the key to the divisions: ‘in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4-6">Ephesians 1:4-6</span> the <em> first foundation</em> for praise (the election of eternal mercy); in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7-12">Ephesians 1:7-12</span> the <em> second</em> (the carrying out of the eternal decree); in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13-14">Ephesians 1:13-14</span>, the <em> third</em> (the personal appropriation of salvation).’ Stier and Alford find a Trinitarian arrangement, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3-6">Ephesians 1:3-6</span> pointing to the <em> Father</em>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7-12">Ephesians 1:7-12</span> to the <em> Son,</em> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13-14">Ephesians 1:13-14</span> to the <em> Spirit.
	</em></p>
<p>Another outline is: Praise to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span>), who in the <em> past</em> chose us in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4-6">Ephesians 1:4-6</span>), in the <em> present</em> redeems us in Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7-9">Ephesians 1:7-9</span>), and in the <em> future </em> will unite all in Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:9-10">Ephesians 1:9-10</span>), both <em> Jews</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11-12">Ephesians 1:11-12</span>), and <em> Gentiles</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span>), both of whom received the Spirit, the earnest unto full redemption (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>).
