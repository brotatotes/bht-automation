<p>I. THE CHURCH CHOSEN IN CHRIST, THE HEAD OF THE BODY.
	</p>
<p>This chapter is made up of two parts: the <em> first</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3-14">Ephesians 1:3-14</span>), an ascription of praise for spiritual blessings in Christ; the <em> second</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:15-23">Ephesians 1:15-23</span>), a thanksgiving for the faith and love of the readers, passing into a supplication that soon becomes a glowing description of the exalted Christ, as the Head of the Church, His body. The whole chapter is liturgical in its form, sublime in its thought, the great ideas ever struggling for expression, and giving the language a full tone, rarely found even in the Apostle's writings.
