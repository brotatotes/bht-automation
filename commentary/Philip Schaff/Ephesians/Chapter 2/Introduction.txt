 II. THE CHURCH REDEEMED IN CHRIST.
	The contents of this chapter have been variously designated, but all commentators agree in dividing the passage into two sections, and in finding in each section the setting forth of a contrast between the previous condition of the readers and their present privileges as Christians, (1) Ephesians 2:1-10 portray this contrast, as between a past state of death and a present one of new creation, in Christ, by grace. (2.) Ephesians 2:11-22 restate the same method and movement of redemption as a reconciliation of those who were aliens, but who are now, through Christ, at peace with God and in fellowship with His people. (For further details, see the analysis of the sections.) As both these contrasts present the carrying out of the Father's electing love through the Son, we prefer to give this chapter the above heading.
