<p><strong> Remember. </strong> The exhortation, as is evident, is to recall both their previous and present condition, since the contrast is to heighten their gratitude.

<p><strong> That once ye, Gentiles in the flesh. </strong> ‘Once’ here = formerly. ‘Ye’ refers to those of the readers who are now Christians. ‘Gentiles,’ lit., ‘the Gentiles,’ but the English article does not convey the force of the original,’ belonging to the class of.’ ‘In the flesh’ has not here the ethical sense, but refers to their external condition of un-circumcision, as appears from what follows.

<p><strong> Who are called Uncircumcision. </strong> This further defines the class to which they belonged. The Gentiles were thus called, in accordance with the fact, but the name was contemptuously bestowed by the Jews: <strong> by that which is called </strong> (or, ‘by so-called’) <strong> Circumcision</strong>.

<p><strong> In the flesh wrought by hands, </strong> <em> i.e.</em> <strong> , </strong> wrought in the flesh by men’s hands. The Apostle does not undervalue circumcision, but suggests that the true circumcision is of the heart (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:11">Colossians 2:11</span>), to which the external sign was designed to point. ‘The Jew who remains satisfied with this external mark of the covenant with Israel, is a so-called circumcised one, and exalts himself without reason arrogantly above the un-circumcised and unclean nations. How miserable must be the condition of the heathen, who are despised by the Jew! So much the more glorious is it that they as Christians are now exalted above the latter’ (Braune).
