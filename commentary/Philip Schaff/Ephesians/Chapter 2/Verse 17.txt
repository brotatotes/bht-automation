<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:17">Ephesians 2:17</span>. <strong> And he came and preached </strong> (‘brought good tidings of’) <strong> peace. </strong> This verse is not dependent on what precedes, but is connected in thought with, ‘He is our peace’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:14">Ephesians 2:14</span>), which is explained by what intervenes. The reference in ‘came’ cannot be to His coming in the flesh, since no such preaching took place then, but must be to some coming after His resurrection. In accordance with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:18">John 14:18</span>, it is usually explained of His coming in the gift of the Holy Ghost, as the result of which these good tidings of peace were everywhere proclaimed through the preachers of the gospel. (See marginal references on this coming through the Holy Spirit.) It is not to be referred to His salutation of peace after the resurrection, nor limited to the day of Pentecost, nor to the Apostles. In the case of each Christian this coming is at conversion.

<p><strong> To you who were afar off. </strong> The Gentiles are mentioned first, both in accordance with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:19">Isaiah 57:19</span>, where similar language occurs, and because of the importance attached to this phase of subject. This order opposes the view that ‘came’ refers to Christ’s coming in the flesh.

<p><strong> Peace to them who were nigh</strong>, <em> i.e.</em>, the Jews. The Apostle does not say ‘us,’ lest he might uphold ‘the distinction where he wishes to merge it altogether’ (Alford). The repetition of the word ‘peace’ with both classes shows that it has here its complex sense, but with the emphasis resting on ‘peace with God.’
