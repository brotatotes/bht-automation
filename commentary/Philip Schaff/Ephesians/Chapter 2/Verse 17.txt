Ephesians 2:17.  And he came and preached  (‘brought good tidings of’)  peace.  This verse is not dependent on what precedes, but is connected in thought with, ‘He is our peace’ (Ephesians 2:14), which is explained by what intervenes. The reference in ‘came’ cannot be to His coming in the flesh, since no such preaching took place then, but must be to some coming after His resurrection. In accordance with John 14:18, it is usually explained of His coming in the gift of the Holy Ghost, as the result of which these good tidings of peace were everywhere proclaimed through the preachers of the gospel. (See marginal references on this coming through the Holy Spirit.) It is not to be referred to His salutation of peace after the resurrection, nor limited to the day of Pentecost, nor to the Apostles. In the case of each Christian this coming is at conversion.

	 Peace to them who were nigh,  i.e., the Jews. The Apostle does not say ‘us,’ lest he might uphold ‘the distinction where he wishes to merge it altogether’ (Alford). The repetition of the word ‘peace’ with both classes shows that it has here its complex sense, but with the emphasis resting on ‘peace with God.’
