<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:19">Ephesians 2:19</span>. <strong> So</strong> <strong> then. </strong> A favorite phrase in the writings of the Apostle. It sums up and infers.
	</p>
<p><strong> Ye are no longer</strong>; in contrast with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12">Ephesians 2:12</span>, and in consequence of the saving facts detailed in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:13-18">Ephesians 2:13-18</span>.
	</p>
<p><strong> Strangers and sojourners</strong>. The same class is designated by both terms, which together form an antithesis to ‘fellow citizens;’ ‘strangers’ describing the Gentiles as belonging to another state; ‘sojourners’ as not yet possessed of the right of citizens. Others, however, take the former alone as in contrast with ‘fellow citizens,’ the latter being explained as the absence of domestic privileges, in contrast with ‘of the family of God.’ But the term will scarcely bear this sense.
	</p>
<p><strong> But ye are. </strong> The correct text emphasizes ‘are.’
	</p>
<p><strong> Fellow citizens with the saints. </strong> The figure requires no explanation; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12">Ephesians 2:12</span>. ‘The saints’ here includes all ‘the members of that spiritual community in which Jew and Gentile Christians were now united and incorporated, and to which the external theocracy formed a typical and preparatory institution’ (Ellicott). It is almost equivalent to the ‘spiritual Israel.’ To refer it to angels, or even to include them, is unwarranted.
	</p>
<p><strong> And of the household of God</strong>. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:10">Galatians 6:10</span> (‘of the household of faith’). ‘This means those who belong to the house, to the family, whose Head and Father is God. To the right of citizen is added that of the house, of the child, of the heir’ (Braune). The new figure strengthens the idea of privilege, adding the intimate relation to God.
