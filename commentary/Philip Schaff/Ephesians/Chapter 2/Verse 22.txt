<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:22">Ephesians 2:22</span>. <strong> In whom</strong>. Either parallel to ‘in whom’ at the beginning of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:21">Ephesians 2:21</span>, certainly not to ‘temple,’ or more naturally referring to ‘Lord.’ Ye also, as included in the previous declaration (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:19-21">Ephesians 2:19-21</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> Are being builded together</strong>, as a continuous process. The verb is slightly different from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>, referring not to the superstructure, but the construction, to the compacting of the parts.
	</p>
<p><strong> For a habitation of God</strong>. The word translated ‘habitation’ occurs only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+17:2">Revelation 17:2</span>. It answers to temple in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:21">Ephesians 2:21</span>, since in the truest sense the church, as the mystical body of Christ, is the temple of God.
	</p>
<p><strong> In the Spirit</strong>, <em> i.e.</em>, <em> </em> the Holy Spirit, not the human spirit, nor ‘spiritually;’ nor yet ‘through the Spirit,’ but in the fellowship of the indwelling Holy Spirit. Some join it with the verb, with an instrumental sense, but, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:21">Ephesians 2:21</span> (‘in the Lord’), the phrase further defines ‘a habitation of God.’ Alford: ‘Thus we have the true temple of the Father, built in the Son, inhabited in the Spirit; the offices of the Three blessed Persons being distinctly pointed out: God, <em> the Father, </em> in all His fulness, dwells in, fills the Church; that Church is constituted an holy Temple to Him in <em> the Son, </em> is inhabited by Him in the ever present indwelling of the Holy Spirit.’
