<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:6">Ephesians 2:6</span>. <strong> And raised us up together, </strong> etc. The thought of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span> is carried out in detail: ‘Together’ is = ‘with Him,’ Christ, whose Resurrection and exaltation have already been set forth as the exhibition of Divine energy in accordance with which God’s power is exerted to usward who believe (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:19-21">Ephesians 1:19-21</span>). The reference, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span>, is physical and future, but at the same time spiritual and present
	</p>
<p><strong> In the heavenly places. </strong> This is to be explained as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span>. Bengel notices that ‘at His right hand’ (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span>) can be applied to Christ alone, but this phrase to all Christians.

<p><strong> In Christ Jesus. </strong> This does not qualify ‘in the heavenly places,’ but should be joined with the verbs. It brings out more fully than ‘together,’ the fact that all these saving acts are in virtue of our mystical union with Christ. Comp. the close of the next verse.
