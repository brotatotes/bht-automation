Ephesians 2:9.  Not of works.  This resumes the negative side, asserting that salvation does not proceed from works, as a meritorious ground. Comp. on Romans 3:20; Galatians 2:16, etc. It is obvious that we cannot supply ‘faith’ here, and this is a strong argument for the view taken of the latter part of Ephesians 2:8.
	 That no man should boast,  or, ‘glory;’ comp. on Romans 2:17. The purpose of this method of grace is that God alone should have the glory, the negative side of which is ‘that no man should boast’ On this familiar thought of the Apostle, see marginal references.
