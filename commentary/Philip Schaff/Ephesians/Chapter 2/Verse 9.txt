<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:9">Ephesians 2:9</span>. <strong> Not of works. </strong> This resumes the negative side, asserting that salvation does not proceed from works, as a meritorious ground. Comp. on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20">Romans 3:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:16">Galatians 2:16</span>, etc. It is obvious that we cannot supply ‘faith’ here, and this is a strong argument for the view taken of the latter part of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span>.

<p><strong> That no man should boast, </strong> or, ‘glory;’ comp. on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:17">Romans 2:17</span>. The purpose of this method of grace is that God alone should have the glory, the negative side of which is ‘that no man should boast’ On this familiar thought of the Apostle, see marginal references.
