<p>2. <em> Redemption in Christ as Reconciliation between Jew and Gentile</em>, <em> because both are reconciled with God.
	</em></p>
<p>The Apostle bases upon his previous statement (especially <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1-7">Ephesians 2:1-7</span>) an exhortation to recall what redeeming grace in Christ had done for them. He recalls their previous condition without Christ, as one of alienation from God’s people and from God Himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:11-12">Ephesians 2:11-12</span>). With this he contrasts their present condition of nearness to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:13">Ephesians 2:13</span>), detailing the means by which this change has been brought about, namely, through the Person and sufferings of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:14-18">Ephesians 2:14-18</span>). He then sketches their present condition, as citizens in God’s kingdom, as members of His family, as constituent parts of the holy temple in which God dwells in the Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:19-22">Ephesians 2:19-22</span>). The references to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are perhaps most marked in this section, as they are certainly most practical and precious.
