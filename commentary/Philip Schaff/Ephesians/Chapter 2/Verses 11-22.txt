2.  Redemption in Christ as Reconciliation between Jew and Gentile,  because both are reconciled with God.
	The Apostle bases upon his previous statement (especially Ephesians 2:1-7) an exhortation to recall what redeeming grace in Christ had done for them. He recalls their previous condition without Christ, as one of alienation from God’s people and from God Himself (Ephesians 2:11-12). With this he contrasts their present condition of nearness to God (Ephesians 2:13), detailing the means by which this change has been brought about, namely, through the Person and sufferings of Christ (Ephesians 2:14-18). He then sketches their present condition, as citizens in God’s kingdom, as members of His family, as constituent parts of the holy temple in which God dwells in the Spirit (Ephesians 2:19-22). The references to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are perhaps most marked in this section, as they are certainly most practical and precious.
