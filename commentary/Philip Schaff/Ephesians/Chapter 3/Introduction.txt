<p><strong> III. The Apostle’s Office and Prayer, in view of this Mystery of one Universal Church in Christ.
	</strong></p>
<p>(1.) The Apostle, moved by the great thoughts of chap. 2, is about to offer his prayer for his readers, but mentioning his own condition he turns aside to speak of his own office as Apostle to the Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1-13">Ephesians 3:1-13</span>). (2.) He then resumes, and utters his petition, which closes with a doxology. In view of the historical facts which resulted from Paul’s office and labors, we, who are Gentiles, should least of all object to the prominence so humbly given by the Apostle to himself in this chapter. Braune gives to this chapter the heading: ‘The Office and Service of the Church, which is not unfitting, since Paul’s office was ' to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the Church the manifold wisdom of God ’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</span>).
