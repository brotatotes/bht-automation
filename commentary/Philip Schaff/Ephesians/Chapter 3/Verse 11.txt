But it seems best to refer it to the execution of it, regarded as an accomplished fact. In favor of this is urged, (1.) that the  historical  Saviour is here described in full terms; (2.) that the next verse is an explanatory confirmation of the  accomplished,  not of the  purposed,  design (Meyer); (3.) that this sense of the verb is more common in the New Testament than that of ‘constituted.’ At the same time ‘wrought’ seems preferable to the more definite ‘fulfilled.’ Comp. my note, Lange,  Ephesians,  p. 117. This purpose was wrought in Jesus of Nazareth, the personal Messiah, the Lord of His people. His work and Person are not to be sundered here.
