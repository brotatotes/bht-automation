<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:12">Ephesians 3:12</span>. <strong> In whom we have</strong>. This explains and confirms what precedes. ‘We’ refers to those who are really in Christ, since the privileges which follow are matters of experience.
	</p>
<p><strong> Our boldness and access.</strong> Lit., ‘the boldness and access,’ but some authorities repeat the article, giving this sense: ‘our boldness and our access.’ ‘Boldness’ is frequently used by Paul (see references), and here denotes the believer’s free joyous attitude toward God, the result of assurance of His favor. Some take ‘access’ here (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:18">Ephesians 2:18</span>) in its primary sense of ‘introduction;’ but its connection with ‘boldness’ (especially if the article is omitted) favors the other and subjective meaning, our continued access.
	</p>
<p><strong> In confidence</strong>. This phrase is joined by some to ‘access’ alone, which is admissible, unless the article be repeated. It is better to connect it with the verb: this is the subjective condition in which we have our boldness and access. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:38-39">Romans 8:38-39</span>; a noble example of this confidence as expressed by the Apostle himself.
	</p>
<p><strong> Through our faith in him</strong>; lit.,’ through the faith of Him;’ comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:22">Romans 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:22">Galatians 3:22</span>, where the form and meaning are similar. This is the subjective means through which we have the privileges just named; ‘confidence’ is the subjective state in which we have them. ‘That faith whose object is Jesus is the means to all who are Christ’s: first, of “boldness,” for their belief in the Divine Mediator gives them courage; secondly, of “access,” for their realization of His glorified humanity warrants and enables them to approach the throne of grace; and, thirdly, these blessings are possessed “in confidence,” for they feel that for Christ’s sake their persons and services will be accepted by the Father’ (Eadie).
