<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:19">Ephesians 3:19</span>. <strong> And to know</strong>. The connective translated ‘and’ is used to append a closely related thought; hence the object to be supplied in the previous clause is the same as that here expressed. ‘Know’ here points to experimental knowledge.

<p><strong> The love of Christ</strong>; His love to us, since our love to Him could not be described by the phrase: which exceedeth knowledge. The verb ‘know,’ and the noun ‘knowledge’ correspond, in Greek as in English. For similar paradoxes, see references; comp. also <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+4:7">Philippians 4:7</span>. Hence it is unnecessary to explain: ‘that ye may know that the love of Christ is knowledge-surpassing.’ The meaning is: to have an adequate experimental knowledge of Christ’s love which surpasses any abstract Knowledge independent of religious experience and Christian gratitude. Love is the key to love; yet it must be remembered that Christ’s love is in itself infinite, and that even when our love is warmest and purest we have not yet fully measured its extent
	</p>
<p><strong> That ye may be filled.</strong> This is the further and final end of the prayer. There is a verbal correspondence between ‘filled’ and ‘fulness.’
	</p>
<p><strong> Unto all the fulness of God.</strong> ‘Unto’ points to the measure or standard, and does not imply that this standard is reached at once, but that the knowledge of the love of Christ will lead toward this. ‘The fulness of God’ has been variously explained; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span>. (1.) ‘Fulness,’ or, ‘abundance,’ which God imparts, either in gifts of grace, or more generally. (2.) The fulness with which God is filled, the fulness of His spiritual perfections. The latter view takes ‘fulness’ in its strict sense and forms a climax, while the former seems tame. ‘All the fulness of the Godhead abides in Christ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9">Colossians 2:9</span>. Christ then abiding in your hearts, ye, being raised up to the comprehension of God’s mercy in Him and of his love, will be filled, even as God is full each in your degree, but all to your utmost capacity, with Divine wisdom, might, and love’ (Alford).
