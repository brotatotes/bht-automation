Ephesians 3:4.  In accordance with which,   i.e., what he had written was to be the measure, or standard, by which they could determine his knowledge.
	 While reading  is better than ‘when ye read,’ since it points to an action taking place at the same time with the perceiving.
	 Ye can perceive. ‘ Can’ (E. V., incorrectly: ‘may’) is the emphatic word, and ‘perceive’ is preferable to ‘understand,’ referring to an immediate perception, as if it were a single act.
	 My understanding.  The word is thus rendered in every other instance in the New Testament (See marginal references.)
	 In the mystery of Christ.  Either the mystery about Christ, or the mystery the purport of which is Christ, who is Himself ‘the concrete Divine mystery’ (Meyer); comp. Colossians 1:27. The mystery had been revealed, hence the Apostle had an ‘understanding’ in regard to it, as could be perceived by his readers. He does not refer to his labors among them, since he has in mind what he has written. Some have used this passage as an argument against the genuineness of the Epistle, but without success. Notice that the Apostle expected his language even in regard to this mystery to convey a definite meaning discoverable by the individual Christians to whom he wrote.
