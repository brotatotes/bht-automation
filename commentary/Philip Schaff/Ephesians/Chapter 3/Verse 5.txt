<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5">Ephesians 3:5</span>. <strong> Which. </strong> This refers to ‘the mystery of Christ’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:4">Ephesians 3:4</span>), the parenthesis being unnecessary.

<p><strong> In other generations</strong>; not ‘ages,’ or, ‘periods,’ though the phrase has a temporal sense, as in the Old Testament use of the word ‘generations.’

<p><strong> Was not made known. </strong> Less definite than ‘revealed.’
	</p>
<p><strong> To the sons of men. </strong> To any of the sons of men. It includes the Old Testament prophets, but not these alone. The contrast with ‘holy’ and ‘in the Spirit,’ suggests that those merely sons of men, not born of the Spirit, could not know this mystery.
	</p>
<p><strong> As </strong> it <strong> has been now revealed. </strong> The contrast between ‘now’ and ‘in other generations’ is one of degree. It was not then made to the extent that it has now been revealed.
	</p>
<p><strong> To his holy apostles and prophets;</strong> the terms are to be understood as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>; the Apostles, and the New Testament prophets, two classes of inspired men (‘in the Spirit’), to whom this mystery had been revealed. The adjective ‘holy’ is applicable to both classes, and need occasion no difficulty. Paul speaks of them as a body, not as individuals, so that there is no self-glorying in the term.
	</p>
<p><strong> In</strong> <strong> the Spirit. </strong> This is the sphere in which the revelation was made. To the Apostles there was a permanent inspiration to fit them for their peculiar work as laying the foundation of the Christian Church; but in the peculiar condition of the apostolic Church, without a complete New Testament, and the experience of centuries, there was an inspiration for teaching, ‘prophesying’). Those thus gifted were the New Testament prophets. Both classes were for the specific work in that age (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>); when the revelation was complete, and the emergency was <strong> </strong> met, both offices, in their distinctive features, ceased to exist. See chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>.
