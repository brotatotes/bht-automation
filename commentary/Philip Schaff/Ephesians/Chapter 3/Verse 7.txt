<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:7">Ephesians 3:7</span>. <strong> Whereof, </strong> of this gospel, <strong> I became a minister. </strong> The word was applied to a ‘servant,’ and is several times so translated in the E. V. The word usually rendered ‘servant’ (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>, etc.) suggests the personal relation to the master; this one the obligation to service. (Our word ‘deacon’ is a corruption of the Greek term, which was the title of this class; comp. Php 1:1 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8-12">1 Timothy 3:8-12</span>, and also <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:1">Romans 16:1</span>.)

<p><strong> According to the gift of the grace of God. </strong> The ‘gift’ consisted of the ‘grace,’ and this was doubtless the apostolic office. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span>. His becoming a minister of the gospel was in accordance with this gift of God’s grace.
	</p>
<p><strong> Which was given to me. </strong> The better established reading joins this with ‘grace,’ not with ‘gift.’ The sense is not altered, but tautology is avoided.
	</p>
<p><strong> According to the working of his power. ‘</strong> By’ is incorrect. The clause belongs to ‘which was given to me’ not to ‘became.’ The giving was in accordance with God’s efficiency, not with Paul’s desert. Thus Saul became Paul; the persecuting Pharisee was transformed into the minister to the Gentiles.
