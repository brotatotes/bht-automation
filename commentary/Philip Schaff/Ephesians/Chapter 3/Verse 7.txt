Ephesians 3:7.  Whereof,  of this gospel,  I became a minister.  The word was applied to a ‘servant,’ and is several times so translated in the E. V. The word usually rendered ‘servant’ (comp. Romans 1:1, etc.) suggests the personal relation to the master; this one the obligation to service. (Our word ‘deacon’ is a corruption of the Greek term, which was the title of this class; comp. Php 1:1 ; 1 Timothy 3:8-12, and also Romans 16:1.)
	 According to the gift of the grace of God.  The ‘gift’ consisted of the ‘grace,’ and this was doubtless the apostolic office. Comp. Ephesians 3:8. His becoming a minister of the gospel was in accordance with this gift of God’s grace.
