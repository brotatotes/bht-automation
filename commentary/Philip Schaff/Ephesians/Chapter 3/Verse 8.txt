The fact that a sentence begins here does not compel us to find the resumption of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span> at this point (see note above). The Greek adjective is a comparative of a superlative, and need not be regarded as a hyperbole. ‘The great Apostle, however, so truly, so earnestly, felt his own weakness and nothingness (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:11">2 Corinthians 12:11</span>), that the mention of God’s grace towards him awakens within, by the forcible contrast it suggests, not only the remembrance of his former persecutions of the Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:9-10">1 Corinthians 15:9-10</span>), but of his own sinful nature (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span>), and unworthiness for so high an office’ (Ellicott).

Wherein this grace consisted is added: <strong> to preach to the Gentiles, </strong> etc. The best authorities omit the preposition <em> ‘</em> among’ (lit, ‘in’) <em> . </em> The word ‘preach’ here is literally ‘evangelize,’ not ‘proclaim,’ as often.
