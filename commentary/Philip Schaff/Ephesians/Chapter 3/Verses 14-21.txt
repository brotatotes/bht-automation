 The Apostles Prayer for the Church,  and the concluding Doxology.
	As stated in the last section, the thought begun in Ephesians 3:1 is here resumed, and the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of the Gentiles utters his prayer for these Gentile readers. The prayer is to the Father (Ephesians 3:14-15); its  purport is that they may be strengthened (Ephesians 3:16); its  result that Christ may dwell in them (Ephesians 3:17  a); its  end that they may know His love (Ephesians 3:17-18), and hence be filled unto the fulness of God (Ephesians 3:19).
	A doxology is added, describing God’s omnipotence (Ephesians 3:20), but so worded as to form an appropriate conclusion to the doctrinal part of the Epistle, since the ascription of the glory is ‘in the Church and in Christ Jesus’ (Ephesians 3:21).
