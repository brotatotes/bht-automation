<p><em> The Apostles Prayer for the Church</em>, <em> and the concluding Doxology</em>.
	</p>
<p>As stated in the last section, the thought begun in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span> is here resumed, and the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of the Gentiles utters his prayer for these Gentile readers. The prayer is to the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:14-15">Ephesians 3:14-15</span>); its <em> purport</em> is that they may be strengthened (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:16">Ephesians 3:16</span>); its <em> result</em> that Christ may dwell in them (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:17">Ephesians 3:17</span> <em> a);</em> its <em> end</em> that they may know His love (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:17-18">Ephesians 3:17-18</span>), and hence be filled unto the fulness of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:19">Ephesians 3:19</span>).
	</p>
<p>A doxology is added, describing God’s omnipotence (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:20">Ephesians 3:20</span>), but so worded as to form an appropriate conclusion to the doctrinal part of the Epistle, since the ascription of the glory is ‘in the Church and in Christ Jesus’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:21">Ephesians 3:21</span>).
