Ephesians 4:10.  He it is also; not, ‘is the same also’ (E. V.). The two thoughts of descending and ascending are here joined in such a way as to give prominence to the Person of Christ.
	 Above all the heavens. It is immaterial whether Paul had in mind three heavens or seven heavens, according to the Jewish notion. Whatever divisions exist, or whatever Paul referred to, his statement is that Christ was exalted above all such places.
	 That he might fill all things. As this was the purpose of His exaltation, that He might be able to ‘penetrate with His grace and glory all regions and all persons within them’ (Braune), it is proven that He can and does give to each Christian as He will (Ephesians 4:7). Thus, too, the way is prepared for the statement which follows, respecting His gift of official persons to His Church, and the purpose of the Christian ministry. The thought in its connection is the same as that of chap. Ephesians 1:22-23: ‘gave Him as Head over all things to the Church,’ etc.
