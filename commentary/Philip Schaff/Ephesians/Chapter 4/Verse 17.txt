<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17">Ephesians 4:17</span>. <strong> This therefore I say. </strong> ‘This’ points to what follows; ‘therefore’ may refer to what immediately precedes; it is better, however, to find here a resumption of the exhortations begun in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1-3">Ephesians 4:1-3</span>, but with the force added by the intervening discussion.

<p><strong> Testify in the Lord. </strong> He bears witness, not in his own, but in the cause of the Lord in whom he lives, and in whom his

It is evident that the ‘mind’ is here regarded as depraved; that part of man’s nature, which in its original constitution was noblest, has become the stronghold of his depravity.
