Ephesians 4:17.  This therefore I say.  ‘This’ points to what follows; ‘therefore’ may refer to what immediately precedes; it is better, however, to find here a resumption of the exhortations begun in Ephesians 4:1-3, but with the force added by the intervening discussion.

It is evident that the ‘mind’ is here regarded as depraved; that part of man’s nature, which in its original constitution was noblest, has become the stronghold of his depravity.
