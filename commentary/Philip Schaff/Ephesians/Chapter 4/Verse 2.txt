Ephesians 4:2.  With all lowliness and meekness.  These two attendants of the Christian walk are closely joined. The former is humility: ‘the esteeming ourselves small, inasmuch as we are so; the thinking truly, lowlily of ourselves’ (French). How welt adapted Christian privilege is to produce this state of mind the believers experience shows (comp. chap. Ephesians 3:8 and similar passages). As we receive all of Christ’s grace, we feel our unworthiness. In one aspect it is the basis of all Christian virtue. ‘Meekness’ is a gentleness, resting on ‘lowliness,’ humble submission to God, and a consequent mildness toward men as His instruments, as if to say: ‘Have I been helped, then I do not know who should not be helped’ (Braune). ‘All,’  i.e.,  ‘every kind of,’ qualifies both words.
	 With longsuffering.  This is another attendant of the Christian walk, closely connected with the other two, but introduced by itself. The phrase should not be joined with what follows. ‘Longsuffering’ means, not taking swift vengeance, not inflicting speedy punishment, though it sometimes has the more general sense of ‘forbearance.’ It is meekness toward the sins of others, and the more difficult to exercise be-cause justice seems at times to be against it is promoted by recalling that we were called when sinners, that all our privileges are proofs of God’s longsuffering.
	 Forbearing one another in love.  This clause defines the walk still further, but is in reality a vivacious setting forth of how ‘longsuffering’ is exhibited. ‘One another’ suggests that each one who forbears gives occasion to others for forbearance.
	 In love. This is the element in which all true forbearance is manifested; without the Christian grace of love it degenerates into indifference, but love ‘is longsuffering’ (1 Corinthians 13:4). The phrase should not be joined with what follows.
