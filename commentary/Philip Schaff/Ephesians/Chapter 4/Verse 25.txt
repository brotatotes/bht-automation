<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:25">Ephesians 4:25</span>. <strong> Wherefore. </strong> In view of the previous exhortation, especially <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22-24">Ephesians 4:22-24</span>.
	</p>
<p><strong> Having put off falsehood</strong>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22">Ephesians 4:22</span>. The negative side comes first. The participle points to a single act, hence ‘having put off;’ this precedes the habit which is commanded. ‘Falsehood’ is the vice or habit of lying, a chief characteristic of ‘the old man,’ a necessary result of selfishness and sin. The mention of ‘truth’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span>) seems to have suggested this precept. But lying is a fundamental vice. It comes from the devil (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>). The motive with which the verse closes shows that it is inconsistent with love, and a lie spoken out of love is still a lie. Falsehood includes deceptive acts and looks, and this single precept, if obeyed, would revolutionize many a community, and destroy some kinds of business.

<p><strong> Speak ye truth each one with his neighbor. </strong> The command is to habitual action. (The language is a reminiscence from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="zec+8:16">Zechariah 8:16</span>). ‘With’ points to mutual intercourse, and the added motive shows that ‘neighbor’ means fellow-Christian. Of course the application of the precept is not confined to intercourse with Christians.
	</p>
<p><strong> For we are members one of another. </strong> Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:5-8">Romans 12:5-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:15-27">1 Corinthians 12:15-27</span>. More than members of human society, and hence mutually dependent; in close fellowship as holding the same views and laboring for the same end; as members of the body of Christ we become members of one another; as He is true, we should be truthful.
