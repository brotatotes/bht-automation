Ephesians 4:25.  Wherefore.  In view of the previous exhortation, especially Ephesians 4:22-24.
	 Having put off falsehood; comp. Ephesians 4:22. The negative side comes first. The participle points to a single act, hence ‘having put off;’ this precedes the habit which is commanded. ‘Falsehood’ is the vice or habit of lying, a chief characteristic of ‘the old man,’ a necessary result of selfishness and sin. The mention of ‘truth’ (Ephesians 4:24) seems to have suggested this precept. But lying is a fundamental vice. It comes from the devil (comp. John 8:44). The motive with which the verse closes shows that it is inconsistent with love, and a lie spoken out of love is still a lie. Falsehood includes deceptive acts and looks, and this single precept, if obeyed, would revolutionize many a community, and destroy some kinds of business.
	 Speak ye truth each one with his neighbor.  The command is to habitual action. (The language is a reminiscence from Zechariah 8:16). ‘With’ points to mutual intercourse, and the added motive shows that ‘neighbor’ means fellow-Christian. Of course the application of the precept is not confined to intercourse with Christians.
	 For we are members one of another.  Comp. Romans 12:5-8; 1 Corinthians 12:15-27. More than members of human society, and hence mutually dependent; in close fellowship as holding the same views and laboring for the same end; as members of the body of Christ we become members of one another; as He is true, we should be truthful.
