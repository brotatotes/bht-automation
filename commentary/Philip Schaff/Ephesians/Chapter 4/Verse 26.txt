Ephesians 4:26.  Be angry and sin not Psalms 4:5 is here cited. Both verbs are imperative, not the first conditional. Wrath, for this is the proper force, is not only allowable, but in certain cases commanded, yet in no case should sin be joined with it. This throws the emphasis on the second member of the sentence, so that the first becomes more of an assumption than a command: ‘Be angry (for this must be so) and do not sin.  ’  There is no necessity for supposing that all wrath is sinful. Sinless wrath is like the wrath of God, and needs no excuse; but our wrath is rarely like God’s.
	 Let not the sun go down upon your irritations.  The article is omitted by some of the most ancient authorities. If retained it points to the ‘irritation’ in consequence of being angry. Even allowable anger should not continue. If the article be omitted, the precept is more general, forbidding the continuance of any ‘irritation,’ This term occurs only here, and means a condition of aroused wrath. The reference to the going down of the sun is a ‘reminiscence of Deuteronomy 25:13-15, according to which the poor man should receive his cloak, given in pledge, and wages should be paid before sun-down’ (Braune). The limit need not be applied too literally, but night is a good season for the growth of the forbidden feeling. The verse teaches that anger may be right, but is far more likely to be wrong; that it certainly is if it lasts long, and becomes worse by giving entrance to Satan.
