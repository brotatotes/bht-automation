Ephesians 4:29.  Let no corrupt communication,  etc. ‘Corrupt’ is used of what is decayed and loathsome, but the idea of worthlessness is included. It is implied that such things naturally rise to the lips, but they should never be spoken.
	 But whatever; the form is conditional, as if to suggest how rare such speech is. Much speaking is likely to be evil speaking.
	 Good  (  i.e.,  fitting, though possibly suggesting the moral quality)  for the building up of  the need.  This means either ‘for edifying with respect to the need,’ or more probably,’ for the building up of the need which occasions or calls for it.’ (The E. V. is not correct.) In either case the requirement is, adaptation to place and time, and to the person whose edification is sought; comp. Colossians 4:6: ‘how ye ought to answer every man.’
	 That it may give grace,  etc. This is the purpose of what has just been commanded, and should be made the purpose of those who obey it. ‘Give grace’ is here = confer benefit, impart a blessing, suggesting  spiritual  benefit, since ‘grace’ usually refers to God’s favor. But it should not be limited to that sense here, nor weakened into ‘that it may be gracious,’ or ‘agreeable.’ Profitable conversation is so rare, because our social intercourse has no such exalted aim as this.
