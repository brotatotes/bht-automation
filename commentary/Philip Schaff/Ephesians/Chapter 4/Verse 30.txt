<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:30">Ephesians 4:30</span>. <strong> And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, </strong> lit, ‘the Spirit, the Holy (Spirit) of God.’ This emphatic form shows the importance of the command. The verb means to disturb, render sorrowful, while ‘and’ shows that corrupt words do thus ‘grieve’ the Spirit, which dwells in us and in others, and can be thus ill treated by foul speech. Believers can ‘grieve’ the Spirit, unbelievers ‘resist’ Him; comp. Acts 5:51. Though the expression is in one sense figurative, it points to a great reality, namely, the sympathetic (not apathetic) presence of the Holy Spirit in Christian hearts.

<p><strong> In</strong> <strong> whom, </strong> not ‘by whom,’ since God seals us with the Spirit as the Seal (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span>); ‘in’ suggests fellowship.

<p><strong> Unto the day of redemption</strong>; the day of final and complete redemption; comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>. The motive is one of love, not of fear, the day of judgment is for Christians the <strong> </strong> day of redemption. The possibility of losing the seal is not suggested, except as all exhortations imply danger.
