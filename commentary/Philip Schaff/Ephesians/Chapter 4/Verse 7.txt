Ephesians 4:7.  But. In contrast with ‘all,’ there is a gift to each one of at; each has a part in the same salvation, and the gift, though adapted to individuals, has its unity.
	 Was the grace given.  The tense points to a particular time, namely, the exaltation of Christ, as Ephesians 4:8 shows. The emphatic word is ‘given;’ it is not ours by right, but is bestowed, and that upon ‘each one.’ Here is a motive to Christian forbearance, as a means of preserving unity. ‘The grace’ refers, not to the spiritual gift itself, but rather to the one grace, bestowed by Christ, and manifesting itself in various ways, so that each one has his peculiar gift. This grace is bestowed according to the measure of the gift of Christ,  i.e., ‘in proportion to the amount of the gift which Christ gives’ (Ellicott). As His good pleasure determines this ‘measure,’ this suggests another reason for humility and forbearance, as helps to concord ‘The gift does not obliterate natural, corporate, local, temporal, individual, differences, but purifies and ennobles them. Temperament and natural mental powers, talents and inclinations, are only refined, directed, moved, and used for the Lord’s kingdom and our own salvation’ (Braune).
