<p><strong> III. GENERAL CHRISTIAN DUTIES.
	</strong></p>
<p>This part of the Epistle is difficult to analyze. The ethical precepts are not arranged in any discoverable logical order. For convenience a division into two sections is adopted: (1) Chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17-32">Ephesians 4:17-32</span>, in which the duties are based upon the contrast between the old and the new man. (2.) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:1-21">Ephesians 5:1-21</span>, in which the precepts have as their motive the self-sacrificing love of Christ.
