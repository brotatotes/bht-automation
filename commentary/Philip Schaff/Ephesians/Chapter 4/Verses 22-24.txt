Ephesians 4:22-24. These verses depend on the en-tire preceding thought. The substance of what you learned, of what you heard and were taught properly, ‘as is truth in Jesus,’ was ‘that ye put off,’ etc. In the connection, this is equivalent to ‘that ye must put off.’ Some find in ‘ye ‘a contrast with ‘Jesus,’ and hence join the verses with the clause: ‘as truth is in Jesus,’ but the contrast is with their previous condition, the Christian walk as opposed to the walk of the Gentiles. Ephesians 4:22 presents the  negative  side, and Ephesians 4:23-24 the  positive  side of the Christian walk.
