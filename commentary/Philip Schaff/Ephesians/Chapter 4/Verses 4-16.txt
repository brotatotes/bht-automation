 II. MOTIVES FOR PRESERVING THE UNITY OF THE SPIRIT.
	In this passage the leading thought is ‘ the unity of the Spirit; ’ the duty of preserving it is not directly enjoined, but motives are presented: (1.) The basis of unity is found in certain existing unities, necessarily involved in the relations of the Spirit, Lord and Father to the one body of believers (Ephesians 4:4-6).
	(2.) The diversity of individual gifts is in accordance with the gift of the one Lord, who has power to bestow them (Ephesians 4:7-10).
	(3.) The persons given to be officers in the Church are instruments to promote growth toward unity (Ephesians 4:11-16). These persons are Christ’s gift (Ephesians 4:11); the aim of their effort is the perfecting of the saints (Ephesians 4:12), until unity and maturity are attained (Ephesians 4:13); this perfecting has as its end, avoiding the instability and error of a childish condition (Ephesians 4:14), and truthful, loving growth into Christ as Head (Ephesians 4:15), He being the source of life for every part of His body, so that it can symmetrically grow ‘unto the building up of itself in love’ (Ephesians 4:16).
	The first paragraph is almost epigrammatic; the second is broken and somewhat obscure; the third is involved, full of metaphor and perplexing subordinate clauses. Yet all three present, with varied matter and manner, the great thought: the ultimate design of the Triune God, in the Church as a whole, in every individual member, and in all its outward organism, is the complete unity of the Body of Christ.
