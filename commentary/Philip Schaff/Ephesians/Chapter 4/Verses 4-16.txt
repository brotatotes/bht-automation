<p><strong> II. MOTIVES FOR PRESERVING THE UNITY OF THE SPIRIT.
	</strong></p>
<p>In this passage the leading thought is ‘ the unity of the Spirit; ’ the duty of preserving it is not directly enjoined, but motives are presented: </p>
<p>(1.) The basis of unity is found in certain existing unities, necessarily involved in the relations of the Spirit, Lord and Father to the one body of believers (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:4-6">Ephesians 4:4-6</span>).
	</p>
<p>(2.) The diversity of individual gifts is in accordance with the gift of the one Lord, who has power to bestow them (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:7-10">Ephesians 4:7-10</span>).
	</p>
<p>(3.) The persons given to be officers in the Church are instruments to promote growth toward unity (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11-16">Ephesians 4:11-16</span>). These persons are Christ’s gift (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>); the aim of their effort is the perfecting of the saints (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:12">Ephesians 4:12</span>), until unity and maturity are attained (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span>); this perfecting has as its end, avoiding the instability and error of a childish condition (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span>), and truthful, loving growth into Christ as Head (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:15">Ephesians 4:15</span>), He being the source of life for every part of His body, so that it can symmetrically grow ‘unto the building up of itself in love’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:16">Ephesians 4:16</span>).
	</p>
<p>The first paragraph is almost epigrammatic; the second is broken and somewhat obscure; the third is involved, full of metaphor and perplexing subordinate clauses. Yet all three present, with varied matter and manner, the great thought: the ultimate design of the Triune God, in the Church as a whole, in every individual member, and in all its outward organism, is the complete unity of the Body of Christ.
