<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:4-6">Ephesians 4:4-6</span>. Meyer gives this analysis of these verses: ‘Objective relations of unity to which the non-observance of the precept in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:3">Ephesians 4:3</span> would be opposed. These are: (1.) <em> The Church itself constituted as a unity, </em> one body, one Spirit, one blessed consummation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:4">Ephesians 4:4</span>). (2.) <em> That by which this constitution of the same as a unity has and does come to pass, </em> one Lord, one faith, one baptism (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:5">Ephesians 4:5</span>). (3.) The Supreme Ruler, Administrator, and Preserver of this entire unity, one God and Father, etc. (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:6">Ephesians 4:6</span>). Notice the triple tri-partite division.’
