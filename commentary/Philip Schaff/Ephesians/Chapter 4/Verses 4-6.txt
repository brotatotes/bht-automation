Ephesians 4:4-6. Meyer gives this analysis of these verses: ‘Objective relations of unity to which the non-observance of the precept in Ephesians 4:3 would be opposed. These are: (1.)  The Church itself constituted as a unity,  one body, one Spirit, one blessed consummation (Ephesians 4:4). (2.)  That by which this constitution of the same as a unity has and does come to pass,  one Lord, one faith, one baptism (Ephesians 4:5). (3.) The Supreme Ruler, Administrator, and Preserver of this entire unity, one God and Father, etc. (Ephesians 4:6). Notice the triple tri-partite division.’
