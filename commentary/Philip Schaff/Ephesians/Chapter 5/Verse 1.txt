<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:1">Ephesians 5:1</span>. <strong> Become therefore. </strong> ‘Therefore’ connects the exhortation with chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:31-32">Ephesians 4:31-32</span>, but there is an advance in thought, so that a new section begins here. Strictly speaking <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:1-2">Ephesians 5:1-2</span> are transitional; an inference from what precedes, a basis for the following exhortation.
	</p>
<p><strong> Followers. </strong> Lit, ‘imitators,’ which perhaps suggests too much. In any case <strong> God </strong> is the model, especially in the crowning act of His love (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:32">Ephesians 4:32</span>); hence ‘become,’ not ‘be.’
	</p>
<p><strong> As beloved children</strong>; children through Christ, and beloved of God, hence to imitate Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:2">Ephesians 5:2</span>); each word contains a motive.
