<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:10">Ephesians 5:10</span>. <strong> Proving</strong>; putting to a practical test. It seems best to take <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:9">Ephesians 5:9</span> as parenthetical, and to join this participle with ‘walk’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:8">Ephesians 5:8</span>).

<p><strong> What is well-pleasing to the Lord, </strong> <em> i.e.,</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> to Christ. The walk of the children of light is a continuous attempt to give a practical answer to the question, How can I please Christ? The Christian conscience is enlightened by the gospel so as to answer correctly. The greatest mistake is in failing to ask the question. Christ is thus made the Lord of the conscience: what pleases Him is right; He becomes the God of our ethics as well as of our dogmatics.
