<p><strong> But rather even reprove them. </strong> To have no fellowship is not enough (Bengel). ‘Them,’ which must be supplied, refers to the ‘works.’ ‘Reprove’ points to oral rebuke, such as shows the immorality of such works, quickens the conscience of the person doing them, with a view to his improvement. Some with less accuracy explain the word ‘convince by evidence,’ inferring that our duty is simply to let ‘the light of Divine truth shine into the darkened minds of men, and upon their evil deeds’ (Hodge). The danger in the application of this command arises from wrong motives in the heart of the reprover, not from any too strict view of the sinfulness of the works of darkness.’
