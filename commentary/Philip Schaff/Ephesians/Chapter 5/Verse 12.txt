Ephesians 5:12.  For the things,  etc. The E. V. has unnecessarily transposed the order of this verse.
	D  one in secret.  The reference is not to heathen mysteries, nor to ‘works of darkness in general (Ephesians 5:11), but to special forms of sin, ‘which presented the worst features of the germs, and which, from their nature and infamy, shunned the light of day and of judgment’ (Ellicott). These it is  a shame even to speak of.  The main difficulty is the question of connection. ‘For’ introduces a reason for a   preceding precept; most naturally the last: ‘rather even reprove them’ (Ephesians 5:11). This reproof was so necessary because some of the sins could not even be spoken of. Alford explains: ‘I mention not and you need not  speak  of these deeds much less have any fellowship with them your connection with them must be only that which the act of  reproof  necessitates.’ The former view is preferable. All the explanations which refer to heathen mysteries, or identify ‘things done in secret’ with ‘works of darkness,’ seem untenable. Nor is it natural to find here a reason for not enlarging upon the evil deeds, or for the exhortation, ‘have no fellowship.’ The verse does not indicate that the reproof of Ephesians 5:11 should not be oral. They could rebuke other sins all the more emphatically because these were the signs of secret crimes that could not be named.
