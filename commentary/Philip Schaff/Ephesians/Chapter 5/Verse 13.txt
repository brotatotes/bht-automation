Ephesians 5:13.  But all things.  Either ‘all things’ in general, or’ all things spoken of in Ephesians 5:12. The principle is a general one, but as the connection with Ephesians 5:12 is close, it seems better to accept the special reference. The Apostle confirms his precept about reproof, by showing how the light wholesomely affects even these things   which it is a   shame to speak of.
	 Being reproved; when they are reproved, in case they are reproved, not ‘that are reproved.’
	 Are made manifest by the light.  The order of the Greek permits ‘by the light’ to be connected with ‘reproved,’ but there are several objections to this, while the above rendering involves no difficulty. To join with both (Braune) is unsatisfactory. ‘The light’ is that of Christian truth as made to shine in those who are Might in the Lord’ (Ephesians 5:8).
	 For everything which is made manifest is light. A general proposition to prove the last, Much difficulty has arisen from taking the verb as active (‘doth make manifest’) or middle (‘makes itself manifest’). It is precisely as in the previous clause. All things, such as these secret sins, when they are reproved by you (as commanded in Ephesians 5:11) are made manifest by the light, their true moral quality is revealed by the light thus thrown upon them; only the light can do this, for everything which is made manifest is light. What is in the effect should be in the cause. (So Meyer.) ‘Light’ is here used in a metaphorical (not in its ethical) sense. It is not asserted that a moral transformation necessarily results from this revealing process. ‘Whether this tends to condemnation or otherwise, depends on the nature of the case, and the inward operation of the outwardly illuminating influence’ (Ellicott).
