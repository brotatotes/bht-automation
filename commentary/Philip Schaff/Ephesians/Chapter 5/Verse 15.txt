Ephesians 5:15.  Take heed then.  This is a resumption of the exhortations, after the digression of Ephesians 5:12-14.
	 Strictly how  (not, ‘that’)  ye walk.  The order of words in the oldest authorities joins strictly,’ or ‘accurately,’ with ‘take heed.’ The common reading gives the sense: ‘take heed how ye walk strictly.’ ‘Take heed not only that your walk be exact, strict, but also of  what sort  that strictness is not only that you have a rule and  keep to it,  but that that rule be the best one’ (Alford). The rendering of the E. V. is incorrect whichever reading be adopted.
	 Not as unwise men, but  as wise.  This preserves the verbal correspondence of the Greek. They were to walk strictly, and this clause explains further what is meant by’ strictly,’ ‘Wisdom and not mere intelligence was to characterize them; that wisdom which preserves in rectitude, guides amid temptations, and affords a lesson of consistency to surrounding spectators’ (Eadie).
