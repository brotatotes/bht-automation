Ephesians 5:16.  Buying up the opportunity.  This describes the walk of the ‘wise.’ The impression made by the E. V. (‘making the most of our time,’ not wasting or abusing it) is quite incorrect. The simple sense is: improve the opportunities which occur, looking out for them as a merchant does. ‘Buying up’ suggests that these opportunities are rare enough to be sought out. All special references to these from whom the purchase is made, or to the price paid, seem fanciful.
	 Because the days are evil;  not difficult, or unfavorable, or few (as the common rendering possibly suggests; comp. Genesis 47:9), but morally evil, full of iniquity. Hence every opportunity to do good should be seized upon, as a merchant looks for a good bargain, especially when the current of trade is against him. But in this respect too often the children of this world are wiser than the children of light.
