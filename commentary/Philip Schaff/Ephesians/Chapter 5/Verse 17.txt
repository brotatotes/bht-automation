<p><strong> Become </strong> (as usual in exhortations to Christians) <strong> not senseless, </strong> not rightly using the mind, <strong> but understanding, </strong> more than knowing, discerning intelligently, <strong> what the will of the Lord (</strong> <em> i.e.,</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> Christ) is; not in <strong> general, </strong> but in particular, since thus discernment is shown. ‘This will reaching to what is least and most peculiar, is the object of the insight of the wise; the further he advances the less is anything to him <em> merely permissible; </em> everything becomes for him a precept and will from above; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:15">Acts 21:15</span> ’(Braune). The opposite inference is: culture which forgets to refer constantly to the will of Christ is ‘senseless.’
