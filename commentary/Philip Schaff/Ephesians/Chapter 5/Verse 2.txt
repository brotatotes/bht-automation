<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:2">Ephesians 5:2</span>. <strong> And walk in love</strong>; since in this (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:32">Ephesians 4:32</span>) they are to be imitators of God. ‘Love’ is God’s characteristic (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4-5">Ephesians 1:4-5</span>), and our aim (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:17-19">Ephesians 3:17-19</span>).

<p><strong> As Christ also loved you. </strong> Some authorities read ‘us,’ and a few have ‘you’ in both clauses, but the variation ‘you’ ‘us’ is the more probable reading. ‘You’ here gives emphasis to the exhortation; ‘also’ joins the Christian walk in love to the work of Christ among men.

<p><strong> And gave himself up for us. </strong> Some sup-ply ‘to death’ others join ‘to God’ with the verb, but it seems best to take it absolutely of Christ’s self-sacrifice. ‘And’ serves to explain how He ‘loved,’ while ‘for us,’ which in itself means’ on behalf of us,’ in this connection points to the vicarious work of Christ; comp. on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6">Romans 5:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>. The pronoun ‘us’ extends the thought to all Christians; the Apostle thus including himself.

<p><strong> An offering and a sacrifice. </strong> The former is the more general term for all offerings; the latter refers specifically to sacrificial (bloody) offerings. Here both terms explain Christ’s giving up of Himself: the former including His entire work, the latter referring especially to His vicarious death.
	</p>
<p><strong> To</strong> <strong> God. </strong> This phrase is connected by Meyer and others with ‘gave Himself up;’ Stier and Braune join it with the following phrase (as in the LXX. rendering of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:18">Exodus 29:18</span>). But Alford and Ellicott more correctly regard it as a qualification of the preceding substantives, the meaning being ‘with respect to God.’
	</p>
<p><strong> For a savour of sweet smell. </strong> See marginal references. This phrase is rarely applied in the Old Testament to an expiatory offering (but see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+4:31">Leviticus 4:31</span>). The Apostle, although speaking of the result of Christ’s propitiatory work (especially of His vicarious death), refers to His self-sacrifice as a proof of His love, in order to present a motive for Christian love. Hence the expression is appropriate here. Our free-will offering of self-sacrificing love becomes acceptable to God (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1-2">Romans 12:1-2</span>) through His self-sacrificing work of love, which, however, was distinct from all other work in having a real expiatory character.
