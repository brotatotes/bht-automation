Ephesians 5:20.  Giving thanks always for all thing. This is the third and more general expression of the result of being ‘filled in the Spirit’ The phrases need not be limited to blessings, nor regarded as hyperbolical. Thankfulness is the constant sign of the Spirit’s presence, the tone of the whole Christian life, and that too in all circumstances. See marginal references.
	 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. In fellowship with this Person, on the ground of what He has done which gives us occasion for thanksgiving. The phrase is a very general one, but the precise application can be determined by the context
	 To God and the Father,  or, ‘ever the Father.’ Comp. chap. Ephesians 1:3; Galatians 1:4. Here, however, the reference is quite general: He is  the  Father, the Father of our Lord and through Him our Father. To Him we give thanks, but always in the name of Christ, for without Christ we would not have Him as our God to thank, still less know Him as the Father.
