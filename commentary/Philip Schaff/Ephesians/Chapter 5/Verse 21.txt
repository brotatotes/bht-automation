Ephesians 5:21.  Submitting yourselves one to another.  While this precept is expounded in several directions in the sections which follow, it stands here as a fourth qualification of being ‘filled with the Spirit’ (so nearly all recent commentators), not as an imperative. The connection of thought is, however, not obvious. The view of Ellicott is safe: he finds here named a comprehensive  duty  in regard to  man  (after the three duties in regard to  God),   the exact connecting link being ‘thanking God for all things (for sorrows as well, submitting yourselves to Him, yea) submitting yourselves to one another.’
	 In the fear of Christ; so all the early manuscripts. This is to be the controlling sentiment in the submission. The phrase is rare, and marks the tender, reverent attitude to Him as Head of the Body, rather than as Judge. Such submission is not cringing obsequiousness, which is always selfish; but it is opposed to rudeness, insolence, haughtiness, and kindred manifestations of unchristian temper. The relation to Christ involves humility, and only true humility can produce the submission here required. The example of Christ teaches the same lesson: ‘The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister’ (Mark 10:45).
