<p><strong> As the church is subject to Christ </strong> (the word is the same as that rendered ‘submit yourselves’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:21-22">Ephesians 5:21-22</span>), <strong> so let the wives also be to their husbands. </strong> ‘Own’ should be omitted here. The repeated exhortation is strengthened still further by the phrase: <strong> in everything. </strong> This is to be understood in accordance with ‘in the Lord’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:22">Ephesians 5:22</span>), and with the precepts which follow. The submission is ‘in everything,’ but this phrase ‘teaches its extent, not its degree. It extends over all departments, but is limited in all, first, by the nature of the relation; and secondly, by the higher authority of God’ (Hodge).
