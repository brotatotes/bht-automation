<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:27">Ephesians 5:27</span>. <strong> That he might himself present to himself. </strong> A slight change of reading gives this sense. This is the purpose of the sanctification (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:24">Ephesians 5:24</span>), but also of the giving up of Himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:25">Ephesians 5:25</span>). ‘Present,’ as a bride, not as an offering, is presented. But ‘Christ permits neither attendants nor handmaids to present the Bride’ He alone presents, He receives’ (Ellicott), as He has prepared her for the bridal presentation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:24">Ephesians 5:24</span>). That this is to take place at the Second Ad-vent is generally admitted, especially since that event is so frequently referred to as a marriage.

<p><strong> The church </strong> glorious. ‘A glorious church’ is inexact. ‘The Church’ (His Church) is to be presented as ‘glorious,’ this word being in emphatic position, and explained by what follows.
	</p>
<p><strong> Not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. </strong> The figures taken from the perfection of physical beauty express what is stated without a figure in the next clause.

<p><strong> That it might be holy and without blemish. </strong> The thought is still explanatory of ‘glorious,’ notwithstanding the change of construction; ‘might’ marks the purpose better than ‘should.’ ‘Holy and without blemish,’ as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>, refer to the positive and negative sides of moral purity. Clearly enough the Church is not yet ready to be thus presented; but the Bridegroom is preparing her for it. Precisely this thought furnishes a strong motive for the duty under discussion.
