This clause is ‘the sacred refrain of the entire Christian conjugal ethics; comp. Ephesians 5:23; Ephesians 5:25 ’ (Meyer). It is altogether unnecessary to distinguish between the expressions, ‘nourisheth’ and ‘cherisheth,’ as applied to Christ; and to find a reference to His feeding His Church in the Lord’s Supper seems unwarranted.
