<p><strong> Ho one, </strong> no human being, <strong> ever hated his own flesh. </strong> ‘Flesh’ as here used is nearly equivalent to ‘body,’ but was probably chosen by the Apostle, ‘because he already had in mind the quotation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:31">Ephesians 5:31</span>), which refers to the institution of marriage before the fall’ (Braune); this of course excludes any ethical reference.

<p><strong> But nourisheth and cherisheth it. </strong> The latter word means to ‘warm,’ but here probably includes the notion of protecting and preserving.

<p><strong> Even as Christ </strong> (‘the Lord’ is supported only by the less weighty authorities) <strong> also doth the </strong> church. Christ’s love toward His Church is manifested in His nourishing and cherishing it. This clause is ‘the sacred refrain of the entire Christian conjugal ethics; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:23">Ephesians 5:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:25">Ephesians 5:25</span> ’ (Meyer). It is altogether unnecessary to distinguish between the expressions, ‘nourisheth’ and ‘cherisheth,’ as applied to Christ; and to find a reference to His feeding His Church in the Lord’s Supper seems unwarranted.
