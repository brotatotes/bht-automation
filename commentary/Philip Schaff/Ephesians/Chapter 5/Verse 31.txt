<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:31">Ephesians 5:31</span>. <strong> For this cause, </strong> etc. The Apostle cites <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24">Genesis 2:24</span>, somewhat freely from the LXX. The Apostle recalls a <strong> </strong> passage based upon the fact of Eve’s having been taken out of Adam. Whether the language is that of Adam or an inspired comment (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:5">Matthew 19:5</span>) is immaterial in this connection. The phrase in Genesis equivalent to ‘for this cause’ points directly to the creation of Eve, and the variation here does not of itself indicate a different reference.

<p><strong> Shall a man, </strong> the man, not the woman, <strong> leave his father and his mother, </strong> or, ‘father and mother.’ Some authorities insert the articles, here equivalent to possessive pronouns; others omit in both cases.
	</p>
<p><strong> Shall be joined</strong>; closely joined, or, ‘shall cleave,’ as in other passages.
	</p>
<p><strong> To his wife. </strong> This is God’s precept
	</p>
<p><strong> And the two shall be one flesh. </strong> So close and peculiar is the relation. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:5">Matthew 19:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:7-8">Mark 10:7-8</span>, where our Lord cites the same passage in regard to earthly marriage.

<p>In the Apostle’s use of the Old Testament language a secondary application to Christ and His Church may well be admitted, since the Apostle throughout has both in mind; but the mystical interpretation, which connects ‘for this cause’ with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:30">Ephesians 5:30</span>, and refers this verse exclusively to a future union of Christ and His Church, is unsafe. The omission of the last clause of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:30">Ephesians 5:30</span>, which resembles <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:23">Genesis 2:23</span>, makes the latter view the less necessary. Others refer the last clause alone to Christ and the Church; others apply the whole to the first coming of Christ and His present union with the Church. Alford more correctly regards ‘the saying as applied to that, past, present, and future, which constitutes Christ’s union to His Bride the Church: His leaving the Father’s bosom, which is <em> past.
	</em></p>
<p>His gradual preparation of the union which is <em> present; </em> His full consummation of it, which <em> is future.’
