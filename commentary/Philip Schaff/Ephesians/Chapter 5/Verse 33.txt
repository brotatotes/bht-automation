<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:33">Ephesians 5:33</span>. <strong> Nevertheless</strong>. ‘Not to enter further upon this greater mystery;’ enough has been said. This is preferable to explaining: ‘to return to the subject of marriage,’ to finding a contrast between ‘I say’ and ‘ye also.’ Whether more of the mystery be known or not, the analogy has been sufficiently set forth to enforce this exhortation.

<p>Ye, all of you, <strong> </strong> also, as in the case of Christ toward His Church, <strong> severally,</strong> as individuals the exhortation applies to you, <strong> let each one so,</strong> in this manner, namely, like Christ, <strong> love his own wife as himself</strong>; not love his wife as he loves himself, but love her as being part of himself (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:28">Ephesians 5:28</span>) thus furnishing a motive corresponding with the previous statements.

<p>And let the wife see. The construction of the original is peculiar, but the sense is expressed by supplying ‘let’ and ‘see.’ Ellicott: <em> ‘</em> and the wife <em> I</em> <em> bid </em> that,’ etc.

<p><strong> Reverence</strong>, lit, ‘fear,’ in the sense which the word has in the Old Testament. The exhortation implies that the husband is the head of the wife (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:23">Ephesians 5:23</span>), and it is a question whether a woman who cannot reverence her husband despises her-self or him the more; that both are the objects of derision to others is notorious. To reverse the duties of this verse and section is as much a folly as it is a crime. But the duties become a privilege only when rendered ‘in the Lord,’ The section may be thus summed up: ‘To the husband <em> one </em> command is given, and in this three requirements: <em> Love </em> even unto <em> self-sacrifice, </em> with the consequence and purpose of <em> sanctification </em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:25-27">Ephesians 5:25-27</span>), and this with such energy, purity, and constancy, that more is required of the husband than of the wife. The wife should love the husband, as <em> the Church loves Christ, </em> in entire, exclusive, indissoluble, and <em> ministering </em> love; and the husband should love the wife, as <em> Christ the Churchy </em> in entire, exclusive, indissoluble, and <em> protecting </em> love’ (Braune).
