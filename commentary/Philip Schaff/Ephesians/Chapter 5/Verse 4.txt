Ephesians 5:4.  Neither filthiness,  or, ‘obscenity;’ whether of thought, word, or deed; in Colossians 3:8 the reference is to words.
	 Nor foolish talking; insipid, stupid speech, perhaps including more than this: ‘the talk of fools, which is folly and sin together’ (Trench).
	 Or jesting.  ‘Or’ is used as in Ephesians 5:3. The word rendered ‘jesting’ was applied to witty, well-turned speech, the characteristic of cultivated but frivolous people. Ephesus seems to have been noted for this kind of wit (comp. Plautus,  miles gloriosus).  That such talk soon descends to ‘scurrility’ is notorious, but the word here includes more than this, probably extending to manners also.
	 Which are not fitting. This defines ‘foolish talking’ and ‘jesting;’ it does not limit the latter. All witty speech uttered for its own sake is not fitting for a Christian whose tongue is to be consecrated to the service of Christ.
	 But rather giving of thanks.  Either, thanksgiving rather is ‘fitting,’ or, let it be among you (from Ephesians 5:3). The latter is preferable. ‘Thanksgiving’ is not to be explained as ‘gracious speech,’ or ‘devout-ness,’ but means giving of thanks to God. This is the proper tone of Christian speech, and this will drive off the evil habits just spoken of: ‘to the abuse of the tongue   is opposed this holy and yet glad use; Ephesians 5:18-19 ’ (Bengel).
