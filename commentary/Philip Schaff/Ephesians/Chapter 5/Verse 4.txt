<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:4">Ephesians 5:4</span>. <strong> Neither filthiness, </strong> or, ‘obscenity;’ whether of thought, word, or deed; in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:8">Colossians 3:8</span> the reference is to words.
	</p>
<p><strong> Nor foolish talking;</strong> insipid, stupid speech, perhaps including more than this: ‘the talk of fools, which is folly and sin together’ (Trench).
	</p>
<p><strong> Or jesting. </strong> ‘Or’ is used as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3">Ephesians 5:3</span>. The word rendered ‘jesting’ was applied to witty, well-turned speech, the characteristic of cultivated but frivolous people. Ephesus seems to have been noted for this kind of wit (comp. Plautus, <em> miles gloriosus). </em> That such talk soon descends to ‘scurrility’ is notorious, but the word here includes more than this, probably extending to manners also.
	</p>
<p><strong> Which are not fitting</strong>. This defines ‘foolish talking’ and ‘jesting;’ it does not limit the latter. All witty speech uttered for its own sake is not fitting for a Christian whose tongue is to be consecrated to the service of Christ.

<p><strong> But rather giving of thanks. </strong> Either, thanksgiving rather is ‘fitting,’ or, let it be among you (from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3">Ephesians 5:3</span>). The latter is preferable. ‘Thanksgiving’ is not to be explained as ‘gracious speech,’ or ‘devout-ness,’ but means giving of thanks to God. This is the proper tone of Christian speech, and this will drive off the evil habits just spoken of: ‘to the abuse of the tongue <strong> </strong> is opposed this holy and yet glad use; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:18-19">Ephesians 5:18-19</span> ’ (Bengel).
