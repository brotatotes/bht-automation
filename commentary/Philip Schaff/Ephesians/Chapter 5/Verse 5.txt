Ephesians 5:5.  For of this ye are sure, knowing,  etc. ‘For’ introduces the ground for the preceding prohibitions in an appeal to the Christian knowledge of the readers. It seems better to refer ‘this’ to what precedes, and to take the first clause as indicative, not imperative. The change of a single letter in the Greek requires the above paraphrase; lit., ‘this ye know, knowing;’ the participle, however, being a different word. Some render: ‘this surely know, that,’ etc. But the expression is not a Hebraism.
	 That no fornicator, etc. These words are to be explained in accordance with Ephesians 5:3.
	 Who,  or, ‘which,’ in any case refers only to ‘covetous man;’ comp. Colossians 3:5. The latter reading may be correct, as it is found in the two most ancient Greek manuscripts.
	 Is an idolater.  The covetous man makes wealth his God; this is now the most common form of idolatry, and the Scriptures plainly reveal its sinfulness. ‘The fact that it is compatible with outward decorum, and with the respect of men, does not alter its nature. It is the permanent and controlling principle of an irreligious heart and life, turning the soul away from God. There is no cure for this destructive love of money, but using it for other than selfish purposes. Riches, therefore, must ruin their possessor, unless he employs them for the good of others and for the glory of God’ (Hodge).
	 Hath any inheritance; comp. Galatians 5:21. More than ‘shall not inherit;’ can have no inheritance, this being the unchangeable law of God’s moral government, eternally true,  in the kingdom of Christ and God.  The second ‘of ‘is to be omitted, since the two terms are closely united. We should not explain ‘of Christ even God,’ although the fact that the kingdom of Christ and of God is one rests on the deeper fact of the Divinity of our Lord. This ‘kingdom’ is not merely the future kingdom of glory, but the present kingdom of grace; comp. Matthew 13:0 and similar passages.
