<p>THE WALK WORTHY OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE CHURCH IN CHRIST.
	</p>
<p>As in most of his Epistles, the Apostle turns his didactic statements into practical exhortations. The latter are not appended, but grow out of the former (‘therefore,’ chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>). This Apostolic ‘therefore ’ is the characteristic of all Christian ethics; the duties are presented as deduced, not from abstract moral principles, but from the facts of Redemption, the privileges in Christ Jesus. Christian morals, no less than Christian doctrines, always form a part of a circle whose centre is Christ; when the Christian curvature is wanting, the duties, however strictly performed, are no longer ‘good works.’ We may distinguish, but cannot divide, Christian doctrine and precept. This part of the Epistle may be analyzed as follows: </p>
<p>I. The statement of the practical theme: walk, worthy of Christian privilege, in humility and unity; chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1-3">Ephesians 4:1-3</span>.
	</p>
<p>II. Motives for the preservation of unity; chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:4-16">Ephesians 4:4-16</span>. (This section has been regarded as a final summary of the doctrinal position.)
	</p>
<p>III. General Christian duties, characteristic of the new walk in the Spirit (over against the old), in various aspects; chaps, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17">Ephesians 4:17</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:21">Ephesians 5:21</span>.
	</p>
<p>(1.) Exhortations based upon the contrast between the old and the new man; chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17-32">Ephesians 4:17-32</span>.
	</p>
<p>(2.) Precepts having as their motive the self-sacrificing love of Christ; chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:1-21">Ephesians 5:1-21</span>.
	</p>
<p>IV. Special Christian duties in household relations; chaps, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:22">Ephesians 5:22</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:9">Ephesians 6:9</span>.
	</p>

Servants and masters (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5-9">Ephesians 6:5-9</span>).
	</p>
<p>V. Concluding exhortation: be strengthened in the Lord and put on the armor of God; chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:10-20">Ephesians 6:10-20</span>.
