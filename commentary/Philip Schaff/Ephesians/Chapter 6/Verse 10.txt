<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:10">Ephesians 6:10</span>. <strong> Henceforth. </strong> So the oldest authorities read; this suggests an inference. The words ‘my brethren’ must be rejected. Singularly enough the Apostle does not thus address his readers throughout this Epistle.

<p><strong> Be strengthened;</strong> the verb is passive. It is God who strengthens (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+4:13">Philippians 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:12">1 Timothy 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:17">2 Timothy 4:17</span>); we are strengthened, and thus become strong, but we are not exhorted to ‘be strong.’ The internal fitness for the fight is from God, as the armor is from Him.

<p><strong> In the Lord</strong>, <em> i.e., </em> Christ, in whom is our life and strength; in fellowship with Him, ‘out of weakness’ we are ‘made strong’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:34">Hebrews 11:34</span>)-
	</p>
<p><strong> And in the might of his strength. </strong> Here, as chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:19">Ephesians 1:19</span>, the latter word refers to inherent strength, the former to the manifestation of it. The clause explains where our strength resides; until thus strengthened the armor is useless, and the foes too powerful for us. Here our sense of weakness is essential to our strength. Notice, this expression is applied to Christ, as it is to God in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:19">Ephesians 1:19</span>.
