Ephesians 6:13.  Wherefore.  Against such superhuman foes we need not only Divine strength (‘in the Lord’) but Divine equipment, defensive and offensive.
	 Take up.  A technical term, used of taking armor in order to put it on.
	 The whole armour of God; see Ephesians 6:11, and below.
	 That,  in order that,  ye may be aide to withstand,  a more vivacious expression than that of Ephesians 6:11, as if the assault had begun.

	 To    stand,  i.e., either to stand firm until the combat is over, or, to stand victorious after it is over. The former seems more accordant with usage.
