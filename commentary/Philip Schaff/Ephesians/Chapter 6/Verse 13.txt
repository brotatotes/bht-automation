<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span>. <strong> Wherefore. </strong> Against such superhuman foes we need not only Divine strength (‘in the Lord’) but Divine equipment, defensive and offensive.

<p><strong> Take up. </strong> A technical term, used of taking armor in order to put it on.

<p><strong> The whole armour of God</strong>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:11">Ephesians 6:11</span>, and below.

<p><strong> That, </strong> in order that, <strong> ye may be aide to withstand, </strong> a more vivacious expression than that of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:11">Ephesians 6:11</span>, as if the assault had begun.

<p><strong> In the evil day. ‘</strong> The war is perpetual; the fight rages less on one day, more on another. It is <em> the evil day, </em> on the approach of death, or during life; longer or shorter, varying in itself, when the Evil One attacks us, and his malignant host infest us’ (Bengel). More particular explanations seem open to objection.
	</p>
<p><strong> Having accomplished all</strong>; whether of preparation or of conflict; not to be referred to one or to the other exclusively, not yet to the final victory an interpretation incompatible with the next phrase.
	</p>
<p><strong> To</strong> <em> </em> <strong> stand,</strong> <em> i.e.,</em> either to stand firm until the combat is over, or, to stand victorious after it is over. The former seems more accordant with usage.
