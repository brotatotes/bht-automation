<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:16">Ephesians 6:16</span>. <strong> In all</strong> <strong> things,</strong> <em> i.e., </em> on all occasions. The received reading is, however, well supported, and means ‘in addition to all.’

<p><strong> Taking up, </strong> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span>.

<p><strong> The shield of faith. </strong> The large shield of ancient times is referred to; four feet long, and two and a half wide. It was held on the left arm, and could be used to protect the entire body. In the Christian armor ‘faith’ is the shield; and we should have this on all occasions. ‘Faith entirely covers and defends the Christian; as God’s gift effecting salvation (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span>), bringing about forgiveness of sins in the past (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7">Ephesians 1:7</span>), affording for every moment access to God (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:12">Ephesians 3:12</span>), assuring in advance of eternal life, by securing to us the gift of the Holy Ghost (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13-14">Ephesians 1:13-14</span>), rendering holy and without blame (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>)’ (Braune). This is better than to restrict it to justifying faith.

<p><strong> Wherewith. </strong> Literally, ‘in which,’ when the darts light upon it
	</p>
<p><strong> Shall be able. </strong> This does not point to the last great fight: the conflict was after the arming.
	</p>
<p><strong> Quench all the fiery darts of the evil one, </strong> the personal Evil One. Satan is represented as throwing many (‘all’) burning darts or javelins at the Christian. In ancient warfare this was common; the darts were caught on the large shield covered with tough hides, and extinguished by the contact. The emphasis is on the word ‘fiery,’ pointing to what inflames the passions, corrupts the heart, and fills our mind with horrible thoughts. But a special explanation is not absolutely necessary.
