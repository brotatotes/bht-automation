Ephesians 6:16.  In all  things,  i.e.,  on all occasions. The received reading is, however, well supported, and means ‘in addition to all.’

	 The shield of faith.  The large shield of ancient times is referred to; four feet long, and two and a half wide. It was held on the left arm, and could be used to protect the entire body. In the Christian armor ‘faith’ is the shield; and we should have this on all occasions. ‘Faith entirely covers and defends the Christian; as God’s gift effecting salvation (chap. Ephesians 2:8), bringing about forgiveness of sins in the past (chap. Ephesians 1:7), affording for every moment access to God (chap. Ephesians 3:12), assuring in advance of eternal life, by securing to us the gift of the Holy Ghost (chap. Ephesians 1:13-14), rendering holy and without blame (Ephesians 1:4)’ (Braune).

The emphasis is on the word ‘fiery,’ pointing to what inflames the passions, corrupts the heart, and fills our mind with horrible thoughts. But a special explanation is not absolutely necessary.
