Ephesians 6:18. This verse is to be connected with ‘Stand therefore’ (Ephesians 6:14). Prayer must attend the putting on of the armor and the subsequent use of it.
	 With  all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the Spirit. This is the correct order, the emphasis resting on the phrase ‘with all prayer and supplication.’ Prayer in general is meant by the former term, special petition by the latter: every form of both is commanded. ‘With,’ literally, ‘through,’ as if this were the instrument by which the praying took place. Some prefer to translate it ‘throughout;’ while the seeming repetition of thought has led others to disconnect the phrase from ‘praying.’ But the Apostle is enjoining prayer with great fulness of expression. This phrase describes it as earnest and varied; ‘at all times’ defines it as constant; while ‘in the Spirit’ (which is to be joined with ‘praying’) sets forth the necessary sphere of Christian prayer. ‘The Holy Spirit,  in  whose blessed and indwelling influences, and by whose merciful aid, we are enabled to pray (Romans 8:15; Galatians 4:6), yea, and who himself intercedes for us’ (Ellicott).
	 And watching thereunto,   i.e., with reference to this varied, constant prayer in the Spirit, since such prayer cannot be maintained without personal watchfulness for that very purpose.
	In, not the same word as before.
	 All perseverance and supplication. This is nearly equivalent to persevering supplication; in this they should abide. Watchfulness unto prayer leads to sympathy with others, and to constant supplication  for all  the saints,   i.e.,  believers, who are consecrated to God and thus become sanctified; the word including both ideas.
