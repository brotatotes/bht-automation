<p><strong> That ye also</strong>; as well as those who are <strong> </strong> near him. Some explain: you as well as the Colossians to whom I have just written; but this will hold good only when the priority of that Epistle is otherwise established (see Introduction, § 2).

But Paul seems to have employed him in such personal errands. Yet his ministering was ‘in the Lord,’ since what he did for Paul was done as Christ’s work, in fellowship with Him. Some join the last phrase with both nouns.
