Ephesians 6:21.  But.  With this word of transition the Apostle passes to his brief conclusion.
	 That ye also; as well as those who are   near him. Some explain: you as well as the Colossians to whom I have just written; but this will hold good only when the priority of that Epistle is otherwise established (see Introduction, § 2). Alford paraphrases: ‘As  I have been going at length into matters concerning  you,  so if  you also  on your part, wish to know,’ etc. But this is far from natural.
	 The things concerning me, how I fare,  not, ‘what I do,’ for he did but one thing (Meyer). The two phrases point respectively to his external circumstances, and to his demeanor therein.
	 Tychicus.  The bearer of this Epistle and that to the Colossians; mentioned several times in the New Testament (see references), but nothing more known of him than that he was a native of Asia and a faithful companion of Paul.
	 The beloved brother; a fellow-Christian, probably known to them (Acts 20:4).
	 And faithful minister in the Lord;  ‘faithful,’ ‘trusty,’ but without reference to the trustworthiness of his message, which is taken for granted. The word ‘minister’ is that sometimes rendered ‘deacon,’ but can scarcely have that sense here. Whether it points to his preaching the gospel, or to his ministering to Paul personally, is difficult to decide; comp. Colossians 4:7, which seems to favor the former view. But Paul seems to have employed him in such personal errands. Yet his ministering was ‘in the Lord,’ since what he did for Paul was done as Christ’s work, in fellowship with Him. Some join the last phrase with both nouns.
	 Shall make known to you all things,    i.e.,  ‘concerning me,’ etc. In the Greek this comes before ‘Tychicus,’ etc.
