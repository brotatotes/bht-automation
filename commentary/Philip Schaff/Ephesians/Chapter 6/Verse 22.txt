<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:22">Ephesians 6:22</span>. <strong> Whom I sent. </strong> The sending would be a past act, when the letter was received. Meyer says, sent from Colosse, but the same phrase occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:8">Colossians 4:8</span>, so that nothing can be inferred as to the priority of writing, or in delivering the letters.

<p><strong> For this very purpose, </strong> namely, <strong> that ye may know the things respecting us. </strong> This phrase ‘merely extends the circle: the situation, not merely of the Apostle, but of his companions also (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10-14">Colossians 4:10-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:10">Philemon 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:23-24">Philemon 1:23-24</span>). Paul does not send these merely in his own interest’ (Braune). Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:9">Colossians 4:9</span>, where the reading is in doubt.

<p><strong> And that he may comfort your hearts. </strong> This may refer to their need of consolation in view of the imprisonment of the Apostle; ‘it is better, however, owing to our ignorance of the exact state of the Church, to leave the precise reference undefined, and to extend it generally to all particulars in which they needed it’ (Ellicott). It is evident that the Apostle sought to maintain fellowship among the churches by sending such messengers, to give such intelligence as would strengthen the hearts of the distant brethren. The press in these days does much of this duty, but communication through beloved brethren will always remain an essential part of wider Christian fellowship.
