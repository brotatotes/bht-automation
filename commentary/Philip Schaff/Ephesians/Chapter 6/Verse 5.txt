<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5">Ephesians 6:5</span>. <strong> Servants</strong>; lit, ‘bondmen,’ slaves. While the passage has its very obvious application to all servants, the word itself refers to ‘slaves.’ The last clause of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:8">Ephesians 6:8</span> (‘bondman or free’) does not oppose this view. The application of the principles here involved must legitimately result in the abolition of slavery; but the Apostle rightly deemed it of more importance to secure Christian ethics in the already existing relation than to violently overthrow it. Here is the true point of view for Christian reformers. When these principles fail to secure the proper result, God’s Providence does quickly and retributively what His professed people would not permit the gospel to do.

<p><strong> Be obedient, </strong> or, ‘obey,’ as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:1">Ephesians 6:1</span>.

<p><strong> According to the flesh your</strong> <strong> masters. </strong> The best authorities give this order, and the phrase suggests that there is a higher Master (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:7">Ephesians 6:7</span>), Others find in the expression a limitation of the idea of servitude, as temporary or merely bodily; but this is not probable.

<p><strong> With fear and trembling</strong>; with anxious, conscientious solicitude, <strong> in singleness</strong> <strong> of heart,</strong> as the element of their anxious service; opposed to duplicity, in which the inner disposition and outward appearance do not correspond.
	</p>
<p><strong> As to Christ. </strong> The distinctly Christian motive is especially important here,’ as common and secular inducements can have but small influence on the mind of a slave’ (Eadie). The same motive ought to have validity in connection with the duties of any Christian employé, from a cabinet minister to a day laborer. Fidelity is a rare virtue when this basis does not exist.
