Ephesians 6:6.  Not in the way of  eyeservice, as men-pleasers.  A further description of the last clause, ‘in singleness,’ etc. ‘Eyeservice’ is a word coined by the Apostle to express that kind of service which seeks the appearance of fidelity, namely, under the master’s eye; hence rendered as ‘men-pleasers,’ solely to please the master.
	 But  as servants  (bondmen)  of Christ (not ‘as men-pleasers’);  doing the will of God from the heart  (Greek, ‘soul’), not ‘in the way of eye-service.’ The last clause, however, defines how ‘as servants of Christ’ their service is rendered. Some without sufficient reason join ‘from the heart’ to the next verse.
