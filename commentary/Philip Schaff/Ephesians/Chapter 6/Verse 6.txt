<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:6">Ephesians 6:6</span>. <strong> Not in the way of</strong> <strong> eyeservice, as men-pleasers. </strong> A further description of the last clause, ‘in singleness,’ etc. ‘Eyeservice’ is a word coined by the Apostle to express that kind of service which seeks the appearance of fidelity, namely, under the master’s eye; hence rendered as ‘men-pleasers,’ solely to please the master.

<p><strong> But</strong> <strong> as servants </strong> (bondmen) <strong> of Christ</strong> (not ‘as men-pleasers’); <strong> doing the will of God from the heart </strong> (Greek, ‘soul’), not ‘in the way of eye-service.’ The last clause, however, defines how ‘as servants of Christ’ their service is rendered. Some without sufficient reason join ‘from the heart’ to the next verse.
