Ephesians 6:9.  And ye masters.  The position and authority is recognized.
	Do  the same things  to-wards them.  ‘The Apostle had stooped to the slave, and he was not afraid to speak with erect attitude to the master. The language is general, and expresses what Calvin well calls  jus analogum’  (Eadie). The reference need not be limited to Ephesians 6:7, or Ephesians 6:6, nor extended to every detail of the preceding exhortation.
	 Forbearing threatening,  lit., ‘the threatening,’ your habitual threatening. ‘St. Paul singles out the prevailing vice and most customary exhibition of bad feeling on the part of the master, and in forbidding this naturally includes every similar form of harshness’ (Ellicott).

Here, and here only, is the true social science. Our duties to one another are duties to Christ.
