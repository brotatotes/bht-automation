<p><strong> Forbearing threatening, </strong> lit., ‘the threatening,’ your habitual threatening. ‘St. Paul singles out the prevailing vice and most customary exhibition of bad feeling on the part of the master, and in forbidding this naturally includes every similar form of harshness’ (Ellicott).

<p>The general principles underlying this section are applicable to all the relations of employer and employee. The latter is warned against eye-service, exhorted to faithful labor ‘as in God’s sight,’ bidden to look unto a higher recompense than the temporal wages, because he serves a higher Master. The former is reminded of the equality of all before God, warned that position does not avail in His sight, and exhorted respecting the duties to Him involved in the duties of an employer. Here, and here only, is the true social science. Our duties to one another are duties to Christ. </p>
