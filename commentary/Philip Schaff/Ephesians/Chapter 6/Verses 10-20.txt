 V. CONCLUDING EXHORTATION: BE STRENGTHENED IN THE LORD, AND PUT ON THE ARMOR OF GOD.
	Having exhorted his readers with respect to these various duties, the Apostle most appropriately concludes the practical part of the Epistle by directing them to the true source of strength and defence in the discharge of these duties. The section is readily analyzed: Exhortation to be strengthened within by God’s power (Ephesians 6:10); the need of armor from the nature of the Christian’s foes (Ephesians 6:11-13); the description of the armor, and the one weapon of attack (Ephesians 6:14-17); the prayer and intercession of the Christian soldier (Ephesians 6:18-20). The personal turn given to Ephesians 6:19-20 aptly leads to the concluding paragraph (Ephesians 6:21-24).
