<p><strong> V. CONCLUDING EXHORTATION: BE STRENGTHENED IN THE LORD, AND PUT ON THE ARMOR OF GOD.
	</strong></p>
<p>Having exhorted his readers with respect to these various duties, the Apostle most appropriately concludes the practical part of the Epistle by directing them to the true source of strength and defence in the discharge of these duties. The section is readily analyzed: Exhortation to be strengthened within by God’s power (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:10">Ephesians 6:10</span>); the need of armor from the nature of the Christian’s foes (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:11-13">Ephesians 6:11-13</span>); the description of the armor, and the one weapon of attack (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:14-17">Ephesians 6:14-17</span>); the prayer and intercession of the Christian soldier (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:18-20">Ephesians 6:18-20</span>). The personal turn given to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:19-20">Ephesians 6:19-20</span> aptly leads to the concluding paragraph (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:21-24">Ephesians 6:21-24</span>).
