<p>3. <em> Christian Duties of Servants and Masters</em>.
	</p>
<p>The precepts for the subordinate class come first, but both are exhorted as Christians; the servants to serve as to the Lord, the masters to rule as having a common Master with their servants. The principles here set forth may readily be applied to all industrial and social relations of service and authority.
