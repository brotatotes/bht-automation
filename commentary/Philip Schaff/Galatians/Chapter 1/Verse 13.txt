Galatians 1:13.  For ye heard  (when I was with you)  of my former manner of life  (or,  conduct)  in Judaism,   i.e.,  the Jewish religion as opposed   to Christianity, the religion of the Jewish hierarchy and the Pharisaic school, not the genuine religion of the Old Testament. Paul appeals to the well-known fact of his past career as a persecutor, which formed a part of his teaching, and conclusively proved that no mere human teaching could have converted him. All his antecedents were of such a character that nothing but a divine intervention could produce so great a change.
	 That beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and was destroying it,  or ‘labored to destroy it’ (the same word as in Acts 9:21). Paul intended to annihilate Christianity, was actually employed in the attempt and carried it out as far as he could (comp. Acts 22:4). ‘I persecuted this way (or, belief)  even to death ’ (Acts 26:10-11).
