<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:14">Galatians 1:14</span>. <strong> And made progress (or, advanced) in Judaism beyond many of mine own an in my race (or, nation), being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. </strong> Paul far surpassed in zeal for the Jewish religion his contemporary kinsmen or fellow-religionists. He belonged to the extreme party of the Pharisees who called themselves ‘zealots of the law, zealots of God’; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:3">Acts 22:3</span>, ‘I was zealous towards God’; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:6">Acts 23:6</span>, ‘I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+3:5-6">Philippians 3:5-6</span>). ‘Traditions of my fathers’ are the law of Moses with all the explanations and additions of the Pharisees (afterwards embodied in the Mishna), which concealed rather than unveiled the Word of God and either hindered or destroyed its direct effect (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:2">Matthew 15:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:3">Mark 7:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:13">Mark 7:13</span>). Perhaps the written law is not included here. ‘Tradition’ <em> (paradosis) </em> embraces everything which is handed down orally or in writing from generation to generation. It occurs twelve times in the New Testament, twice in a good sense of the Christian doctrine itself (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:2">1 Corinthians 11:2</span>, rendered ‘ordinances’ in the English version; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:15">2 Thessalonians 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:6">2 Thessalonians 3:6</span>); in the other passages in an unfavorable sense of the human additions to, and perversions of, the written word of God; hence defined as ‘traditions <em> of the elders’ </em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:2-3">Matthew 15:2-3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:6">Matthew 15:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:3">Mark 7:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:8-9">Mark 5:8-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:13">Mark 5:13</span>), or ‘tradition <em> of men’</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:8">Colossians 2:8</span>). Our Saviour never appeals to tire Jewish traditions except to oppose them; and this is of great moment in the controversy with Romanism, which relies more on ecclesiastical traditions than on the Bible.
