<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:18">Galatians 1:18</span>. <strong> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to make the acquaintance of </strong> (or <strong> , to become acquainted with</strong>) <strong> Cephas, and remained with him</strong> <strong> fifteen days. </strong> This first visit of Paul to Jerusalem after his conversion is the same as the one mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:25">Acts 9:25</span>, and took place A. D. 40. The ‘three years’ must be reckoned from his conversion (A. D. 37). It was quite natural that he should wish to make the personal acquaintance (‘to see’ in the English version is not strong enough) of Peter, the leader of the Twelve. The fact implies the high position of Peter, but no superior authority. Paul’s object is to show that he was independent of human instruction and direction, and fully equal to the older Apostles. In ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:11">Galatians 2:11</span>, he relates that he even publicly reproved Peter at Antioch, which would have been an act of flagrant insubordination, had Peter been his superior in rank and authority. ‘Cephas’ is the reading of the best MSS. throughout this Epistle and the Epistle to the Corinthians, except <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:7-8">Galatians 2:7-8</span>, instead of ‘Peter,’ which arose from an explanatory gloss. This Syro-Chaldaic name was given to Simon by Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:43">John 1:43</span>), and was adhered to by the Judaizers. It was, perhaps, in silent opposition to them that Peter in his Epistles used the Greek form. ‘Fifteen days,’ or, as we would say ‘a fortnight,’ too short a time to become a disciple of Peter, as much of it was occupied by public disputations with the Hellenists. The reason of his short stay at Jerusalem was the persecution of the Greek Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:28-29">Acts 9:28-29</span>), and the express command of the Lord to go to the Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17-21">Acts 22:17-21</span>).
