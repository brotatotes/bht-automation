<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:2">Galatians 1:2</span>. <strong> And all the brethren who are with me. </strong> The companions and co-laborers of Paul, such as Silas, Timothy, Luke, Sosthenes, some of whom are expressly mentioned in the address of other Epistles ( 1Co 1:1 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:1">2 Corinthians 1:1</span>; Php 1:1 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1">2 Thessalonians 2:1</span>). The word ‘all’ seems to imply a considerable number. The reason why he mentions others is his strong sense of brotherly communion, rather than the desire to give additional force to his exhortations.

<p><strong> Unto the churches of Galatia.</strong> In Ancyra, Pessinus, Tavium, and other towns of the province. ‘Churches’ are here (as often) local congregations, which belong to the church universal. In the New Testament the word ‘church’ has only two senses: (1) the whole church; (2) a particular congregation. We use it in two additional senses: (3) a confession or denomination (the Roman, the Anglican, the Lutheran, Church, etc.); (4) a church building. The Epistle was encyclical, or intended for several congregations, like the Epistle to the Hebrews and that to the Ephesians. Hence the absence of individual greetings at the close. The mere mention of the name without those honorable epithets (as ‘saints in Christ,’ ‘faithful brethren’) which he bestows upon other congregations, betrays his dissatisfaction with the apostate Galatians. He has no words of praise for them; they must be chastised like disobedient and ungrateful children.
