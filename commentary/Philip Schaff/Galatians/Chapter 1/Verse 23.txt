<p><strong> The faith</strong> <em> is </em> used here in the passive or objective sense=the gospel, the Christian religion (not a formulated statement of dogmas, but rather a living system of divine truth); comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:10">Galatians 6:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:7">Acts 6:7</span>; Jude <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:3">Galatians 1:3</span>.
