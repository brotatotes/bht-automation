<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:3">Galatians 1:3</span>. <strong> Grace to you and peace.</strong> The apostolic salutation combines the Greek <em> charis </em> (‘grace’) and the Hebrew <em> shalom </em> (‘peace’), and infuses into both a deep Christian meaning. ‘Grace’ comprehends the fulness of the gospel blessing, ‘peace’ the fulness of our personal enjoyment of it and happiness resulting from it.

<p><strong> From God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong> The Father is the direct giver, the Son the mediator, of saving grace and inward peace; but both are here (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span>) so immediately associated that we have a right to infer from this the divinity of our Lord. No mere man could, without blasphemy, be put into such juxtaposition with the infinite Jehovah as a giver of grace and peace.

Some ancient authorities read ‘from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.’
