Galatians 1:3.  Grace to you and peace. The apostolic salutation combines the Greek  charis  (‘grace’) and the Hebrew  shalom  (‘peace’), and infuses into both a deep Christian meaning. ‘Grace’ comprehends the fulness of the gospel blessing, ‘peace’ the fulness of our personal enjoyment of it and happiness resulting from it.
	 From God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ. The Father is the direct giver, the Son the mediator, of saving grace and inward peace; but both are here (as in Galatians 1:1) so immediately associated that we have a right to infer from this the divinity of our Lord. No mere man could, without blasphemy, be put into such juxtaposition with the infinite Jehovah as a giver of grace and peace.
	Galatians 1:3 forms a sentence for itself, distinct from the address or inscription in Galatians 1:1-2 (comp. note on Romans 1:7). Some ancient authorities read ‘from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.’
