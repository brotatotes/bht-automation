Galatians 1:5.  To whom  (  is)  the glory,  without diminution or division. The article denotes that it is the glory which essentially belongs to God, and to God alone. To boundless mercy belongs boundless praise and gratitude. It is an affirmation (  is) rather than a wish (  be); comp. Matthew 6:13; 1 Peter 4:11. The doxology in this place implies an indirect reproof of the Galatians for dividing the glory of our salvation between God and man. Similar doxologies, flowing from an overwhelming sense of gratitude, are frequent with Paul, in connection with the mention of the Christian salvation (Romans 11:36; Romans 16:26; Ephesians 3:21; Philippians 4:20; 2 Timothy 4:18).
	 For ever and over,  lit,  ‘unto the ages of ages’ (æons of æons, sæcula sæulorum),  a Hebraizing term for very long, or (as here) endless duration. In opposition to the present transitory world (Galatians 1:4; comp. Ephesians 2:2; Ephesians 2:7).
