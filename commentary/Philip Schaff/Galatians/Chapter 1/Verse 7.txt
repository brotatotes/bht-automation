Galatians 1:7.  Which  (pseudo-gospel of the heretical teachers)  is not another,   i.e.,  no gospel at all, but a perversion and corruption of the one unchangeable gospel. The gospel of Paul teaches that man is justified  by grace alone  through faith in Jesus Christ; the pseudo-gospel of the Judaizers teaches that man is justified by grace  and works  through faith in Christ  and the circumcision  of Moses. The former makes good works the effect, the latter the cause, of justification; and this is thus in fact a relapse into the Jewish standpoint under a Christian name.
	 Save that there are some troubling you.  Only in this sense is it another gospel that it is a perversion of the true gospel of Christ by those well-known troublers of your conscience.
