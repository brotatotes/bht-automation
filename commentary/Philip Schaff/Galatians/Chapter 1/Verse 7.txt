<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:7">Galatians 1:7</span>. <strong> Which </strong> (pseudo-gospel of the heretical teachers) <strong> is not another, </strong> <em> i.e., </em> no gospel at all, but a perversion and corruption of the one unchangeable gospel. The gospel of Paul teaches that man is justified <em> by grace alone </em> through faith in Jesus Christ; the pseudo-gospel of the Judaizers teaches that man is justified by grace <em> and works </em> through faith in Christ <em> and the circumcision </em> of Moses. The former makes good works the effect, the latter the cause, of justification; and this is thus in fact a relapse into the Jewish standpoint under a Christian name.

<p><strong> Save that there are some troubling you. </strong> Only in this sense is it another gospel that it is a perversion of the true gospel of Christ by those well-known troublers of your conscience.
