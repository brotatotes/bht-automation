<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span>. <strong> But even though we ourselves </strong> (I and my colleagues, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:2">Galatians 1:2</span>), <strong> or an angel from heaven, should preach [unto you] any gospel other than that </strong> (beyond that) <strong> which we preached unto you, let him be anathema. </strong> It is impossible to express more strongly and solemnly the conviction of the unerring truth of the gospel as preached by Paul, the zeal for its purity, and the aversion to every heresy. Only an inspired Apostle could thus speak. The condemnation of the opponents is indirect, but the more certain by the argument <em> a fortiori. </em> The severity of Paul against <em> false </em> brethren was equalled by his forbearance with <em> weak </em> brethren (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:1">Galatians 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1">Romans 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:1">Romans 15:1</span>), All personal assumption and arrogance is here excluded, the more so as he conditionally includes himself and his colleagues in the anathema. His only motive was zeal for the purity of the gospel of his divine Lord and Master.

<p><strong> An angel from heaven, </strong> proverbial expression for a being possessed of the highest authority next to the divine. <strong> Beside that</strong>; lit., <em> beyond what, </em> which is both <em> beside </em> ( <em> præterea</em>) and <em> against (contra). </em> The gospel admits of no rival, either in the form of foreign additions or in the form of changes. Paul condemns not indeed mere differences in form, such as existed even among the Apostles themselves, and will always exist, but every material alteration of the gospel, either by perversion, or omission, or such additions as contradict the spirit of apostolic teaching. The Judaizers did not expressly deny the doctrine of justification by faith, but they indirectly undermined it by adding the assertion of the coordinate necessity of circumcision; just as the Pharisees professed to hold fast to the Word of God in the Old Testament, and yet made it of none effect by their human traditions (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:13">Mark 7:13</span>). The passage admits of easy application to the unscriptural traditions of the Greek and Roman churches.

<p><strong> Let him be anathema, </strong> anathematized, <em> i.e., </em> devoted (in a bad sense), given over to the judgment of God. It is a solemn judgment of condemnation as in the name of God (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:22">1 Corinthians 16:22</span>: ‘If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be <strong> </strong> anathema;’ also <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:10">Galatians 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>). Subsequently, among the fathers the idea of ecclesiastical excommunication (accompanied sometimes with an execration) was attached to this term; but this is not the Biblical sense, and in our passage it is forbidden by the mention of an angel who cannot be excommunicated from the church.
