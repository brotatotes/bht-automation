<p><strong> Preach </strong> εὐαγγελίζεται implies the actual fact, not the mere possibility, as the hypothetical <strong> should preach </strong> (εὐαγγελίζηται, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span>), and thus attacks more directly the Galatian pseudo-apostles.
