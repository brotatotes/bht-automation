<p>The very address reveals the occasion of the Epistle, the commotion and fervor of Paul, and the weightiness of his subject: (1) by the emphasis laid on his independent apostolic office and dignity, which had been called in question by the Judaizing errorists; (2) by the reference to the atoning death of Christ, which the Galatians practically undervalued in their legalistic tendency; and (3) by the doxology (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:5">Galatians 1:5</span>), which indicates his fervent zeal for the glory of God in opposition to every over valuation of human works.
