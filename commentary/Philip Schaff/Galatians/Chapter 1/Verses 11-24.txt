<p><em> Apostolical Call and Authority of Paul.
	</em></p>
<p>Paul now enters upon his apology. He defends first his independent apostolical dignity (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:11">Galatians 1:11</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:11">Galatians 2:11</span>). and proves that he was called directly by Christ, that he received his gospel through revelation before he became even acquainted with the older Apostles, and that he was recognized by them in his independent apostleship at the conference of Jerusalem. The several points he makes are these: (1.) I did not learn the gospel from men in my youth; on the contrary, I was a violent persecutor (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:13-14">Galatians 1:13-14</span>); (2.) I learned it directly from Christ when He revealed Himself to me and called me at my conversion (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:15">Galatians 1:15</span>); (3.) I was not instructed by men after my conversion, for I retired forthwith into the desert of Arabia where there were no Christians (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:17">Galatians 1:17</span>); (4.) nor by the Apostles in Jerusalem, for I only saw Peter and James, and them but for a few days (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:18">Galatians 1:18</span>); (5.) at a later visit to Jerusalem I met the Apostles on equal terms and was fully acknowledged by them (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1-10">Galatians 2:1-10</span>); (6.) I even openly rebuked Peter, at Antioch, for his inconsistency (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:11-14">Galatians 2:11-14</span>).
	</p>
<p>These allusions to important facts in his former life are of great value for a biography of Paul, and tend partly to confirm, partly to supplement the account of the Acts concerning his conversion, his relation to the other Apostles, and the council of Jerusalem. The differences are such as must be expected from two independent writers and can be easily reconciled.
