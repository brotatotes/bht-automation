<p><em> Excursus on the Conversion of St. Paul.
	</em></p>
<p>Here we have from Paul’s own pen a brief account of his conversion, which coincided with his call to the apostleship. It is more fully related three times in the Acts, once by Luke (chap. 9), and twice by Paul himself, before his countrymen at Jerusalem (chap. 22), and before King Agrippa (chap. 26). He alludes to it repeatedly in his Epistles; he saw the Lord Jesus Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span>), who appeared to him on the way to Damascus as really and visibly as he had previously appeared to the older Apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:8">1 Corinthians 15:8</span>). We make a few reflections on this great event: </p>
<p>1. The conversion of Paul was a miracle of divine grace, resting on the greater miracle of the resurrection of Christ. All attempts to explain it from external causes such as thunder and lightning, or out of a previous state of his mind, have failed. The most learned of modem skeptics (Dr. Baur) confessed at the end of his life (1860), that ‘no psychological nor dialectical analysis’ can explain this extraordinary transformation of Paul ‘from the most vehement adversary into the most resolute herald of Christianity,’ and he felt constrained to call it ‘a miracle,’ notwithstanding his philosophical aversion to miracles.

<p>2. It was sudden and radical. Paul compares it to the creative act of God which called the natural light out of the darkness of chaos (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>). He was in a state of active and fanatical hostility to Christ, bent upon the destruction of Christianity, and at once became a most determined and devoted champion of the cross he had hated and despised, and the most successful promoter of the religion he had hoped to exterminate from the face of the earth. The connecting link between the Jewish Saul and the Christian Paul was the honesty of purpose and the energy of will. Resolute and energetic characters are apt to change suddenly and radically, and to embrace the new cause with all the ardor of their soul. Upon proud, heroic natures the Spirit of God comes, not in the still, gentle breeze, but in the earthquake, the fire, and the storm. Augustine, Luther, Calvin, and Knox may be quoted as illustrations, although they fall far behind the great Apostle of the Gentiles.

<p>3. It was as sincere as any conversion that ever took place. It cannot be explained from any selfish motive of gain or ambition. Paul was neither an impostor nor an enthusiast. He had nothing to win and everything to lose in a worldly point of view. He left a commanding position as a leader of the Jewish nation, to join a poor, weak, despised sect, which at first distrusted him; he sacrificed honor, influence, and power for a life of toil, self-denial, and persecution. He suffered the loss of all things and ‘counted them but dung that he might win Christ’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+3:8-9">Philippians 3:8-9</span>); and in Him he found the richest compensation for all his sacrifices.
	</p>
<p>4. It was lasting and most effective for all future ages. Paul labored more in word and deed than any other Apostle. He was a true moral conqueror of the world. His life and work after his conversion is, next to the life of his and our Lord and Master, the sublimest spectacle in the history of religion. It was one unbroken act of self-consecration to the glory of Christ and the good of mankind, and sealed at last with a joyful and triumphant martyrdom.
	</p>
<p>5. It is an unanswerable argument for the truth of Christianity. It is a regenerative, converting, ennobling, and sanctifying agency wherever Paul’s name is known, his history read, and his Epistles studied in the fear and love of God. It has led to many conversions besides that of Lord Lyttleton, who wrote a special book on the subject. No other religion can produce such characters as Paul. A life so pure, so noble, so devoted, so fruitful in good works, is a perpetual benediction to the church and the world.
