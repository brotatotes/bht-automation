<p><em> The Apostasy of the Galatians; Anathema on the False Teachers</em>.
	</p>
<p>In all other Epistles Paul begins in a spirit of Christian courtesy and love, thanksgiving and encouragement, thereby winning the affections and securing the respectful attention of his readers. But here he begins with an indignant expression of his painful surprise at the speedy apostasy of his spiritual children, and enters his solemn protest against every perversion of the gospel of Christ, whom alone he served in his ministry. Yet his deep emotion is more that of sorrow than of anger, and implies his profound interest in the Galatians (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:19">Galatians 4:19</span>). He chastises them in order to win them back to their former position. It was his love that made him severe.
