<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:10">Galatians 2:10</span>. <strong> Remember</strong> <strong> the poor</strong> of the Jewish Christians in Palestine, who suffered much from famine and persecution (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:29">Acts 11:29</span>). Charity should thus not only afford temporal relief to the needy, but be a moral bond of union also between the Jewish and the Gentile Christians and furnish a proof of the gratitude of the latter for the unspeakable gift of the gospel which they received from the former. Such a collection is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:29">Acts 11:29</span> f., and was forwarded by the congregation of Antioch to the brethren in Jud√¶a through the hands of Paul and Barnabas during the famine of 44. On his third great missionary tour between 54 and 57, Paul raised large contributions in his congregations for this purpose, and took them himself to Jerusalem on his fifth and last visit (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:1">1 Corinthians 16:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:0">1 Corinthians 2:0</span> Corinthians 8-9; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:25">Romans 15:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:17">Acts 24:17</span>).

<p><strong> The very thing which</strong> <strong> I was zealous </strong> (diligently endeavored) to do <strong> , </strong> then and always. He needed no prompting to this duty and privilege. It was his habit, and hence the Judaizers had no ground whatever to charge him with a breach of contract on that score. The exercise of Christian liberality and benevolence for the poor, for missions and all the general operations of the Church, is as much a duty and ought to be as steady a habit, as prayer, or any other exercise of piety. What Paul did in the Apostolic age, has been done by the Church ever since. The West receives the gospel from the East and must show its gratitude by helping the East. If pure Christianity is to be revived in Bible Lands it must be done by the faith and the money of the Churches of Europe and America.
