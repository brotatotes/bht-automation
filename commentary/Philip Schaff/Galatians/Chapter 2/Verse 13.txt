<p><strong> Dissembled likewise with him, </strong> were guilty of the same hypocrisy. A very strong, yet truthful expression. For we have here no mere accommodation to weak brethren for the sake of charity and peace, such as Paul himself taught and practised (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:20">1 Corinthians 9:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1">Romans 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:3">Romans 15:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:3">Acts 16:3</span>), but a duplicity and self-contradiction at the expense of truth, a denial of the better conviction to the detriment of the Gentile Christians whom Peter acknowledged as brethren in theory, and whom he now disowned in practice.

Cæsar’s <em> Et tu, Brute! </em> The two friends separated on this occasion, and each pursued an independent path (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:39">Acts 15:39</span>), thus dividing and doubling the work of mission, but Paul afterwards respectfully alludes to Barnabas (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:6">1 Corinthians 9:6</span>), and to Mark, his cousin (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:16">Colossians 4:16</span>).
