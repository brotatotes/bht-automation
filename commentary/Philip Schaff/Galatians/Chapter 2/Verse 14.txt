<p><strong> Before all, </strong> <em> i.e.,</em> the assembled congregation. For only in this public way the censure could have its desired effect upon the body of the Jewish Christians. ‘A public scandal could not be privately cured’ (Jerome).

<p>The following verses to the end of the chapter are a summary report or dramatic sketch of Paul’s address to Peter. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:15-18">Galatians 2:15-18</span> are certainly addressed to Peter, but the personal and historical narrative imperceptibly loses itself in appropriate doctrinal reflections suggested by the occasion and admirably adapted to the case of the Galatians, who had fallen into the same error. In the third chapter it naturally expands into a direct attack on the Galatians. A similar mingling of narrative and reflection occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:14-21">John 3:14-21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:31-36">John 3:31-36</span>.

<p><strong> Livest as the Gentiles, </strong> according to the manner and custom of the Gentiles in regard to eating (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:12">Galatians 2:12</span>). The present tense ‘livest,’ or ‘art wont to live,’ implies habit and principle (for Peter had partaken of unclean food long before, and by divine command, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:10-16">Acts 10:10-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:28">Acts 10:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:3">Acts 11:3</span>), and brings out more vividly the inconsistency of Peter, who in the same breath gave up his native Judaism and led the Gentile converts back to Judaism.

<p><strong> Why art thou constraining </strong> (or, <strong> compelling</strong>), <strong> </strong> not physically and directly, but morally and indirectly, by the force of example which is powerful for good or evil according to the character and position of the man who sets it. It is not necessary to sup-pose that the delegates of James required from the Gentile converts the observance of the Jewish law of meats. James himself, at all events, confined it to Jewish Christians. But the example of such an Apostle as Peter implied a sort of moral compulsion even for Gentile Christians.
