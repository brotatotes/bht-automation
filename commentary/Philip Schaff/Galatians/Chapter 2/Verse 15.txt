Galatians 2:15.   Many commentators close here the speech of Paul to Peter; others with Galatians 2:16; still others with Galatians 2:18. But the words, ‘we  who are Jews  by nature,’ would not suit the Galatians, most of whom were Gentiles by birth, and there is no mark of a return of the speech to the Galatians till Galatians 3:1.
	 We Jews by birth, and not sinners,   i.e., gross sinners without law and without God, like the heathen. The two words were almost synonymous in the mouth of the Jew. Comp. Matthew 9:13; Luke 7:34; Romans 2:12; Ephesians 2:12.
