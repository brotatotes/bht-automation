Galatians 2:17.  Were found,  discovered, in the eyes of God and men, at the time of our conversion to Christ and our justification by faith in him.
	 Sinners  in the Jewish sense,  i.e.,  lawless heathen, as in Galatians 2:15.
	 A minister of sin,  helper, promoter.
	 Let it never be! or ‘Far be it;’ ‘By no means;’ ‘Away with the thought;’ ‘Nay, verily.’ This phrase occurs fourteen times in St. Paul, thrice in Galatians (Galatians 2:17; Galatians 2:21; Galatians 3:21), ten times in Romans (Romans 3:4; Romans 3:6; Romans 3:31; Romans 6:2; Romans 6:15; Romans 7:7; Romans 7:13; Romans 9:14; Romans 11:1; Romans 11:11), and once in 1 Corinthians 6:15. It is an expression of strong denial, often mixed with moral indignation or aversion, and is here and generally used by Paul interjectionally in rebutting an unjustifiable inference deduced from his teaching by an opponent. The rendering ‘God forbid’ in the E. V. in all these passages is strongly idiomatic, but unfortunate, as it implies a familiar use of God’s name then prevalent in England, which borders on profanity. There is neither ‘God’ nor ‘forbid’ in the Greek phrase.
