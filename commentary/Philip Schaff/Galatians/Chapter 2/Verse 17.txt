<p><strong> Sinners </strong> in the Jewish sense, <em> i.e., </em> lawless heathen, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:15">Galatians 2:15</span>.

<p><strong> Let it never be</strong>! or ‘Far be it;’ ‘By no means;’ ‘Away with the thought;’ ‘Nay, verily.’ This phrase occurs fourteen times in St. Paul, thrice in Galatians (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:17">Galatians 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:21">Galatians 2:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:21">Galatians 3:21</span>), ten times in Romans (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:4">Romans 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:6">Romans 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:31">Romans 3:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:2">Romans 6:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:15">Romans 6:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7">Romans 7:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:13">Romans 7:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:14">Romans 9:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:1">Romans 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:11">Romans 11:11</span>), and once in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:15">1 Corinthians 6:15</span>. It is an expression of strong denial, often mixed with moral indignation or aversion, and is here and generally used by Paul interjectionally in rebutting an unjustifiable inference deduced from his teaching by an opponent. The rendering ‘God forbid’ in the E. V. in all these passages is strongly idiomatic, but unfortunate, as it implies a familiar use of God’s name then prevalent in England, which borders on profanity. There is neither ‘God’ nor ‘forbid’ in the Greek phrase.
