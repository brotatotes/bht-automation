<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:5">Galatians 2:5</span>. These false brethren, it must be remembered, required circumcision and the observance of the whole ceremonial law not only from the Jewish, but also from the Gentile Christians, and that not only as an old venerable custom, but as a necessary condition to salvation. Paul and his companions could, therefore, not yield to them for a moment <strong> by the submission </strong> (required by the false brethren) to the law of circumcision, so as to circumcise Titus according to their demand. He could here not become a Jew to the Jews in order to gain them (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:20-22">1 Corinthians 9:20-22</span>), as in such cases where the truth was not jeopardized, and where subjection was simply a matter of charity and expediency. Submission in the case of Titus would have been treason to the truth that Christ is the only and sufficient source of salvation; it would have been a sacrifice of the sacred rights and liberty of the Gentile Christians. Bengel takes ‘submission.’ as a limitation: ‘We would willingly have yielded for <em> love.’
