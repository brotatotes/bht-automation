The gospel <strong> is </strong> the same, but the sphere of labor is different Paul was directed to the field of heathen missions at his conversion (which coincided with his call and apostleship), <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span>, and more clearly by a special revelation in the temple of Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17-21">Acts 22:17-21</span>. Yet the division of labor was not absolute and exclusive. Paul generally commenced to preach in the synagogue because it furnished the most convenient locality and the natural, historical connection for the announcement of the gospel, and because it was resorted to by the numerous proselytes who formed the bridge to heathen missions (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:5">Acts 13:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:46">Acts 13:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:1">Acts 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:6">Acts 18:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:1">Romans 9:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</span>). On the other hand, Peter, though he was then, and continued to be, the head of the Jewish Christian branch of the Apostolic Church, opened the door for the conversion of the Gentiles by the baptism of Cornelius (Acts 10-11; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:7">Acts 15:7</span>), and his Epistles show that in his later years he did not confine himself to the circumcision, for the congregations to which they are addressed were of a mixed character and partly founded by Paul.
