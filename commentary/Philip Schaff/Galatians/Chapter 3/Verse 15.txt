<p><strong> After the manner of men, </strong> refers to the following illustration taken from human relations. An argument <em> a fortiori. </em> If even changeable men keep legal contracts sacred, how much more the unchangeable God. The Judaizers altered the covenant with Abraham by adding new conditions, and thus virtually set it aside.

<p><strong> Covenant. </strong> Such was the nature of the promise of God to Abraham (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:18">Genesis 15:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:7">Genesis 12:7</span>). The translation ‘will,’ ‘testament’ (in the margin of the E. V.), is unsuited to the connection, and the translation ‘promise’ is ungrammatical. In the Septuagint and in the Greek Testament, the word διαθηκη always means ‘covenant, ’ except in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15-17">Hebrews 9:15-17</span>, and the rendering of the E. V. ‘testament’ (from the Vulgate, and in accordance with classical usage) in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:28">Matthew 26:28</span>, and other passages should be corrected. The designation of the ‘Old and New Testament’ (instead of ‘Covenant’) arose from this mistranslation, and is especially improper in the case of the Old Covenant (since God cannot die), but has become so well established that it must be retained.
