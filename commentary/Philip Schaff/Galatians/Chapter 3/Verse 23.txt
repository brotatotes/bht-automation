<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:23">Galatians 3:23</span>. <strong> Before the faith came, </strong> the faith in Jesus Christ just mentioned (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:22">Galatians 3:22</span>), which under the legal dispensation existed only as a latent element of life.

<p><strong> We were shut up and kept in ward under the law for the faith about to be revealed,</strong> <em> i.e., </em> in order to be prepared for the free state of the Christian faith. The word ‘faith’ usually means the <em> subjective </em> state of the heart, the exercise of trust; but in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:22-23">Galatians 3:22-23</span> it seems to pass over into the <em> objective </em> sense, <em> i.e.</em>, the dispensation of faith, the gospel, hence the verbs <em> came </em> and <em> to be revealed. </em> In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:24">Galatians 3:24</span> again the subjective sense is meant.
