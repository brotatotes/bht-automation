Galatians 3:23.  Before the faith came,  the faith in Jesus Christ just mentioned (Galatians 3:22), which under the legal dispensation existed only as a latent element of life.
	 We were shut up and kept in ward under the law for the faith about to be revealed,  i.e.,  in order to be prepared for the free state of the Christian faith. The word ‘faith’ usually means the  subjective  state of the heart, the exercise of trust; but in Galatians 3:22-23 it seems to pass over into the  objective  sense,  i.e., the dispensation of faith, the gospel, hence the verbs  came  and  to be revealed.  In Galatians 3:24 again the subjective sense is meant.
