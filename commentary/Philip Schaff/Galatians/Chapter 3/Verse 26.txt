Galatians 3:26.  For ye all are sons of God. ‘All,’ Jews and Gentiles alike (comp. Galatians 3:27-28). ‘Sons’ (not ‘children,’ E. V.), implies here the idea of age and freedom, as distinct from the state of childhood and pupilage under the training of the pædagogue. Comp. Galatians 4:6-7; Romans 8:14-15.   Paul uses the term ‘sons’ and ‘children’ of God mostly in opposition to slaves (Galatians 4:7). John uses the term ‘children’ of God with reference to their new birth (John 1:12; 1Jn 3:1-2 ; 1 John 3:10; 1 John 5:2).
	 By the faith, which is the act of a freeman, in  Christ Jesus (the dative in Greek)  i.e., reposing in Christ, or (if we prefer connecting the words with ‘sons’  )  by virtue of your life-union with Christ, being grounded and rooted in Him.
