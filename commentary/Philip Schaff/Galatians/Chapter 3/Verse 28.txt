Galatians 3:28.  There is neither Jew nor Greek, etc., there is no room for, and there can be no room. Paul negatives, ‘not the fact only, but the possibility, as James 1:17.’ The great idea of freedom, fraternity, and equality, then, is to be traced to Christianity, although it is often carnally misunderstood and caricatured by men. Error steals the livery of truth, and anti-Christ the livery of Christ. It is to be understood here, of course, in a religious sense. The gospel makes all men equal before God, both as sinners, and as subjects of redeeming grace; it has broken down the national, social, and sexual partition walls of the ancient world, and raised women and slaves to the true dignity and the enjoyment of the rights of man, not in the violent way of a sudden revolution, but by the slow and silent, yet sure process of a moral transformation of society from within, a process still going on till its final consummation at the second coming of Christ.
	 For ye all are one (man) in Christ Jesus,  one moral person in Jesus Christ the head, comp. Ephesians 2:15 (‘one new man’); 1 Corinthians 12:12. The masculine gender in the original is chosen on account of Galatians 3:16, and is more expressive in this connection than the neuter, which we find in John 10:30; John 17:11; John 17:21.
