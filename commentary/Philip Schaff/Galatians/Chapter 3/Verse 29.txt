<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:29">Galatians 3:29</span>. <strong> And if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, heirs according </strong> to premise. The final conclusion of this profound, comprehensive, varied, and terse reasoning, in proof of the assertion <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7">Galatians 3:7</span>, that the believers are the true children of Abraham, and consequently heirs by promise. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16">Galatians 3:16</span> must here be kept in view, where Christ is declared to be the seed of Abraham. Union with Christ constitutes the true spiritual descent from Abraham, and secures the inheritance of all the Messianic blessings by promise, as against inheritance by law.
