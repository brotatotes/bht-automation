Galatians 3:3.  Having begun in the Spirit,  are ye now ending (or  finishing) in the flesh? A fine irony. The middle voice of the Greek verb (ἐ πιτελε ῑ σθε) is preferable to the passive (‘are ye now brought to perfection’) on account of the correspondence with ‘begun,’ and on account of the parallel passages, Philippians 1:6 (‘he who began a good work in you will finish it’), and 2 Corinthians 8:6. ‘Spirit’ and ‘flesh’ represent here the spiritual religion which makes man free, and the carnal religion which makes him a slave to outward forms and observances.
