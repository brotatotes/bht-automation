<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:3">Galatians 3:3</span>. <strong> Having begun in the Spirit,</strong> <strong> are ye now ending</strong> (or <strong> finishing) in the flesh?</strong> A fine irony. The middle voice of the Greek verb (ἐ πιτελε ῑ σθε) is preferable to the passive (‘are ye now brought to perfection’) on account of the correspondence with ‘begun,’ and on account of the parallel passages, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+1:6">Philippians 1:6</span> (‘he who began a good work in you will finish it’), and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6">2 Corinthians 8:6</span>. ‘Spirit’ and ‘flesh’ represent here the spiritual religion which makes man free, and the carnal religion which makes him a slave to outward forms and observances.
