Galatians 3:4.  Did ye experience so many things in vain?  The usual rendering ‘suffer’ would refer to persecutions which the Galatians had to endure (probably from the Jews); but as we know nothing of them, it seems preferable to take the Greek verb (ἐ πάθετε)   in the neutral and wider sense (otherwise not found in the New Testament, except perhaps in Mark 5:26), embracing all spiritual experiences (blessings and benefits as well) of the Galatians (comp. Galatians 3:3; Galatians 3:5).
	 If it be really in vain.  This leaves room for doubt; the Apostle cannot believe that the Galatians will lose all the benefit of their spiritual experiences and continue in their folly. Others take the words in the sense: ‘if it be only in vain,’ and not much worse; since spiritual expeperiences increase the responsibility and risk. Comp. Luke 12:47-48; 2 Peter 2:21.
