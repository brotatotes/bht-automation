Galatians 3:6.   The only reply the Galatians could make to the foregoing question was: ‘By the preaching of faith.’ Taxing this for granted, Paul proceeds (as in Romans 4:1) to give the historical and scriptural proof from the example of Abraham, the father of the faithful. The words are a quotation from Genesis 15:6 (Sept.). The emphasis lies on  believed,   i.e., trusted in God.
