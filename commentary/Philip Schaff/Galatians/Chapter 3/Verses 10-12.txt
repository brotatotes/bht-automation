<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:10-12">Galatians 3:10-12</span>. Negative proof of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:9">Galatians 3:9</span>, by showing the impossibility of justification by law, because we cannot keep the law, and the violation of the law subjects us to its curse (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:9-20">Romans 3:9-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7-25">Romans 7:7-25</span>). No man lives up even to his own imperfect standard of goodness, much less to the perfect rule of the revealed will of the holy God.

<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:11-12">Galatians 3:11-12</span> contain the following syllogism: The just lives by faith; the law is not of faith: consequently no man is justified by the law.
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:11">Galatians 3:11</span>. <strong> Now that in (the) law no man is justified in the sight of God, is evident ‘</strong> In’ is elemental and instrumental, ‘in and by,’ or ‘under’ the law, in the sphere and domain of the law. ‘In the sight,’ in the judgment of God; man standing as a culprit before His tribunal. <strong> For the righteous shall live by faith. </strong> From <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:4">Habakkuk 2:4</span>, according to the Septuagint. Comp. note to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>. The passage refers originally to the preservation of the righteous Israelite amidst the ruin of the Chaldæan invasion. The stress lays oh ‘faith,’ as the power which gives life. ‘By faith’ must not be joined with ‘righteous,’ but with ‘shall live’; this is required by the original Hebrew (‘the righteous shall live by <em> his faith,’ </em> or ‘his fidelity’), by the rendering of the Septuagint (‘the righteous shall live <em> by my faith,’ </em> or according to another reading: ‘ <em> my righteous </em> shall live by faith’), and by the contrast between ‘live by faith,’ and ‘to live in them,’ <em> i.e.</em>, in the commandments (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:12">Galatians 3:12</span>). The Old Testament, then, already declares faith to be the fountain of spiritual life and salvation, or rather the organ by which we apprehend and appropriate the saving grace of God in Christ to our individual use and benefit.
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:12">Galatians 3:12</span>. <strong> The law is not of </strong> [springs not from] <strong> faith, but </strong> [declares], ‘ <strong> He who hath done them’ </strong> [ <em> i.e., </em> the statutes and judgments, previously mentioned in the Old Testament passage,] ‘ <strong> shall live in them.’ </strong> Quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+18:5">Leviticus 18:5</span>. The life-element of the law is not faith, but work. <em> Doing </em> is the essential thing in law. Faith <em> receives </em> the gift of God, the law requires us to <em> give, </em> to perform all its enactments.
