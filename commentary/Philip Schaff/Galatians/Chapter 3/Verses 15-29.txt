 The Educational Mission of the Law.
	Paul now assumes a milder tone, and reasons with the Galatians from the common dealings of men. Even a human covenant is sacred and cannot be set aside, much more a divine covenant. Hence the promise of God to Abraham and to his seed,  i.e., to his believing posterity summed up in Christ, cannot be annulled by the law which came in several hundred years later (Galatians 3:15-18), but the law intervened between the promise and its fulfilment, or between Abraham and Christ as a school of discipline, or as a schoolmaster to prepare men for the freedom in Christ (Galatians 3:19-24), so that now by faith in Christ we are no more slaves, but sons and heirs (Galatians 3:25-29).
