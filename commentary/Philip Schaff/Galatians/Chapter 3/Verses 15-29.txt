<p><em> The Educational Mission of the Law</em>.
	</p>
<p>Paul now assumes a milder tone, and reasons with the Galatians from the common dealings of men. Even a human covenant is sacred and cannot be set aside, much more a divine covenant. Hence the promise of God to Abraham and to his seed, <em> i.e.,</em> to his believing posterity summed up in Christ, cannot be annulled by the law which came in several hundred years later (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:15-18">Galatians 3:15-18</span>), but the law intervened between the promise and its fulfilment, or between Abraham and Christ as a school of discipline, or as a schoolmaster to prepare men for the freedom in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19-24">Galatians 3:19-24</span>), so that now by faith in Christ we are no more slaves, but sons and heirs (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:25-29">Galatians 3:25-29</span>).
