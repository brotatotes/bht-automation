<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:1">Galatians 4:1</span>. <strong> But what I would say if this, that to long as the heir is an infant (a minor</strong>), <strong> he differeth nothing from a slave, though he is lord of all, </strong> owner of the whole patrimony or inheritance by right and prospectively, but not in actual possession. In human relations the taking possession of the inheritance is conditioned by the death of the parent, or at all events by a corresponding loss; while God gives to his children at the appointed time all the blessings of salvation without losing anything, since He is the living fountain and preserver of all. But in both cases the majority of the heir is presupposed. The heir in his nonage represents the Jewish people and the state of the world before Christ.
