Galatians 4:11.  I am  apprehensive of you, last haply I have toiled for you in vain.  This verse is, as it were, bathed in tears, and betrays the deep and painful solicitude of a faithful pastor for his stray sheep, or a tender father for his erring children. It leads to the affectionate appeal, Galatians 4:12 ff.
