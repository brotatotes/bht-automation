Galatians 4:14.  And your trial in my flesh ye did not scorn, nor loathe  (lit. ‘spit out,’ comp. Revelation 3:16). ‘  Your  trial’ is better supported than ‘  my  trial.’ The infirmity of Paul tried the patience and love of the Galatians and tempted them to scorn and reject both him and the gospel which he preached. For the natural man is always disposed to judge from outward appearance.
	 But ye received me as an angel of God, (even) as Christ Jesus,  who is much superior to any angel. The Galatians acted according to Matthew 10:40: ‘He that receiveth you, receiveth Me, and he that receiveth Me, receiveth Him that sent Me.’
