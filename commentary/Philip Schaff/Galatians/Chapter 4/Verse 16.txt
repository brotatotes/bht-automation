Galatians 4:16.  So then have I become your enemy by telling you the truth? He puts the conclusion politely and delicately in the form of a question instead of direct assertion. Others translate: ‘Therefore (because ye loved me so much) I have become (in the opinion of the Judaizing teachers) your enemy by telling you the truth.’ In the Judaizing pseudo-Clementine writings Paul is called an ‘enemy,’ and ‘lawless’ or ‘antinomian’ Some substitute ‘hateful to you’ for ‘jour enemy’ (taking the Greek word in the passive  sense,  as Romans 5:10; Romans 11:18). ‘By telling you the truth,’ refers to the second visit of Paul (Acts 18:23), when the Judaizers had probably already done much mischief.
