<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:17">Galatians 4:17</span>. Warning against the errorists on account of their selfish exclusiveness and party spirit.
	</p>
<p><strong> They court you, </strong> the Judaizers (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:7">Galatians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:10">Galatians 5:10</span>) pay you every attention and are very busy to win you over to their party and their creed, but <strong> not well, </strong> in no good, honest way, not from unselfish love to you; <strong> nay, they desire to exclude you, </strong> or to shut you out from me and virtually from Christ Himself, by insisting on ceremonial observances as necessary to salvation; <strong> that ye may court them, </strong> they wish selfishly to monopolize your esteem and affection. Zeal is no test of sound doctrine, but sound doctrine must prove the zeal. Zeal without knowledge is like a <strong> </strong> sword in the hands of a madman.
