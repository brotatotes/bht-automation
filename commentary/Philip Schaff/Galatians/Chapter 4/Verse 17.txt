Galatians 4:17. Warning against the errorists on account of their selfish exclusiveness and party spirit.
	 They court you,  the Judaizers (Galatians 1:7; Galatians 5:10) pay you every attention and are very busy to win you over to their party and their creed, but  not well,  in no good, honest way, not from unselfish love to you;  nay, they desire to exclude you,  or to shut you out from me and virtually from Christ Himself, by insisting on ceremonial observances as necessary to salvation;  that ye may court them,  they wish selfishly to monopolize your esteem and affection. Zeal is no test of sound doctrine, but sound doctrine must prove the zeal. Zeal without knowledge is like a   sword in the hands of a madman.
