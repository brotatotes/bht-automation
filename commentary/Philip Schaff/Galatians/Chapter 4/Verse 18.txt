<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:18">Galatians 4:18</span>. <strong> It is good to be zealously courted in a good cause at all times, and not only when I am present with you. </strong> I do not object to kind attentions and zealous devotion, provided it be from pure motives and in an honorable cause; I myself received your warmest affection during my personal presence; I only wish you would not grow cold and indifferent during my absence. This interpretation suits the tender appeal which follows.
