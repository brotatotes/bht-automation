<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:21">Galatians 4:21</span>. <strong> Tell me. </strong> This makes the question more urgent and compels the Judaizing Galatians to an evangelical answer.
	</p>
<p><strong> Ye that desire to be under</strong> <strong> law, do ye not hear the Law? </strong> Ye who are so anxious to live under the power and authority of the legal dispensation, will ye not listen to the lesson of the book of the Law? Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:13">Matthew 13:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:15">Matthew 24:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:29">Luke 16:29</span>. Others take it as a question of astonishment! Is not the Law (which ought to convince you of your error) constantly read in your synagogues? Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:16">Luke 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:32">John 12:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:21">Acts 15:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:14">2 Corinthians 3:14</span>. The law in the first clause means the legal institute and authority; the Law in the second clause designates, as often, the Pentateuch (the <em> Thora), </em> as distinct from the Prophets <em> (Nebiim), </em> and the remaining sacred writings <em> (Chetubim </em> or <em> Hagiographa).
