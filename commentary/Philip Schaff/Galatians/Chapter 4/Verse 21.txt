Galatians 4:21.  Tell me.  This makes the question more urgent and compels the Judaizing Galatians to an evangelical answer.
	 Ye that desire to be under  law, do ye not hear the Law?  Ye who are so anxious to live under the power and authority of the legal dispensation, will ye not listen to the lesson of the book of the Law? Comp. Matthew 13:13; Matthew 24:15; Luke 16:29. Others take it as a question of astonishment! Is not the Law (which ought to convince you of your error) constantly read in your synagogues? Comp. Luke 4:16; John 12:32; Acts 15:21; 2 Corinthians 3:14. The law in the first clause means the legal institute and authority; the Law in the second clause designates, as often, the Pentateuch (the  Thora),  as distinct from the Prophets  (Nebiim),  and the remaining sacred writings  (Chetubim  or  Hagiographa).
