Galatians 4:22.  Abraham had two sons, one by the bondmaid, the other by    the freewoman.  See Genesis 16:1 ff; Genesis 21:1 ff. The ‘bondmaid’ is Hagar, the ‘freewoman’ is Sarah. In the national legends of the Mohammedan Arabs who derive their descent from Ishmael, Hagar is represented as the lawful wife, and Ishmael as the legitimate son of Abraham; they settled in Mecca and were refreshed from the well in the holy Kaaba, which was from time immemorial and is to this day a sanctuary and resort of pilgrimage. The Mohammedans pray five times a day with their face turned to Mecca. It is remarkable how the relation of Ishmael to Abraham has been perpetuated in history. The Mohammedans are in their religion genuine Ishmaelites, bastard Jews, and wild sons of the desert, whose hands are against every man. (Genesis 16:12).
