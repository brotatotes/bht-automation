Galatians 4:23.  But the son from the bondmaid was born after the flesh,  in the regular course of nature. (Used somewhat differently in Romans 1:3; Romans 9:5.)  But the son of the freewoman is through the promise,  by virtue of supernatural influence, by the Spirit of God working through the word of promise (as in the conception of our Lord). Genesis 17:16; Genesis 17:19; Genesis 18:10-11; comp. Romans 4:19.
