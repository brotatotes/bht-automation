<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:26">Galatians 4:26</span>. <strong> But the Jerusalem which</strong> <strong> is above (or, the upper Jerusalem) is free; and she is our mother (mother of us). </strong> The reading of the E. V. ‘of us <em> air </em> is not sufficiently supported, and arose probably at an early time from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:16">Romans 4:16</span>, ‘the father of us all,’ or from a loose quotation of this passage by Polycarp. The other covenant, that which is represented by Sarah and her believing offspring, is the true or heavenly Jerusalem, that is not (as the rabbinical teachers imagined) an actual material city in heaven (the exact counterpart of the earthly Jerusalem), which was to be let down in the Messianic age, but a spiritual city, the Messianic theocracy, the kingdom of heaven, to which all true Christians belong, even here on earth, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+3:20">Philippians 3:20</span>. The word ‘above,’ therefore is not local, but ethical and spiritual; as in the phrase, ‘the kingdom of heaven,’ to be born ‘from above.’ Comp. the ‘heavenly Jerusalem,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:22">Hebrews 12:22</span> (where it is contrasted with mount Sinai, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:18">Galatians 4:18</span>), the ‘new Jerusalem,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>. ‘And she is our mother,’ the mother of us Christians. This passage and the concluding chapters of Revelation struck the keynote to the hymn ‘Mother dear, Jerusalem,’ and the other New Jerusalem hymns in Latin, English, and German, which express so touchingly the Christian’s longing after his eternal home in heaven.
