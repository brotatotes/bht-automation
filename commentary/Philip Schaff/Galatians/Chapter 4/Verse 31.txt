The change of the definite and indefinite article (so often obliterated by the E. V.) is not without point. There are <em> many </em> bondwomen, false churches and sects, but only <em> one </em> freewoman, the lawful spouse of Christ, in whom all true believers are one. Some eminent commentators begin with this verse a new section, as expressing the theoretical preamble of the practical exhortation in chap. 5, thus: ‘Therefore, brethren, we are not children of a bondwoman (like the Jews), but of the freewoman; for (or, unto) freedom Christ hath made us free: ‘stand fast, therefore,’ etc. (So Meyer.)
