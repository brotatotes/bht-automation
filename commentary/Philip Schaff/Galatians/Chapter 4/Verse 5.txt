Galatians 4:5.  To redeem, to buy off from the curse and the slavery of the law. This he did by His perfect obedience and the bestowal of the spirit of love and freedom.
	 Receive, not  recover,  for the redemption by Christ infinitely transcends the original child-like innocence lost by Adam.
	 The sonship, through and for the sake of Jesus, the only begotten Son. He is the Son by nature and from eternity, we become sons by grace in time. The word ‘sonship’ or adoption as sons is used only by Paul, in five passages, Romans 8:15; Romans 8:23; Romans 9:4; Ephesians 1:5; while the term ‘children of God’ is more frequent. The former suits here better, as contrasted with slavery, and in distinction also from a state of mere pupilage. Both terms, ‘sons’ and ‘children’ of God, and the corresponding ‘Father’ never refer in the New Testament to the natural relation of man as the creature to God as the creator, but always to the moral and spiritual relation, which results from the new birth and the communication of the Holy Spirit.
