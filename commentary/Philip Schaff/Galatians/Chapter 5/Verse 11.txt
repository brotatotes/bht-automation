<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:11">Galatians 5:11</span>. <strong> If I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then hath the offence </strong> (or <strong> stumbling block) of the cross been done away. </strong> The first ‘still’ refers to the time since his conversion from Judaism. If circumcision is preached as a condition of salvation, then the cross, that is, the crucifixion, the doctrine of salvation by the atoning death of Christ, has lost its offensive character to the Jews, and there is no further reason for persecution by the Jews. The false teachers had probably spread the malicious report that Paul himself preached circumcision, because he practised it in the case of Timothy who had a Jewish mother (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1-3">Acts 16:1-3</span>); but this was exceptional and a measure of expediency and charity, not <strong> a </strong> surrender of the principle.
