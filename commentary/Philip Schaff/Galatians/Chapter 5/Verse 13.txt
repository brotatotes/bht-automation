Galatians 5:13.  For ye were called unto freedom, brethren.  The word ‘for’ justifies the indignant scorn of the preceding verse. ‘Unto’ denotes the object of the Christian calling.
	 Only  (turn)  not your freedom into  in occasion  (or,  opportunity) for  the flesh.  A sudden check: freedom, but not license. True freedom is self-government and inseparable from law; it is a law to itself. How often has the word freedom been abused and perverted into its diabolical caricature! So also the truly Christian ideas of equality and fraternity. Gentile churches, like that of Corinth, were especially liable to the abuse of freedom and sensual excesses. The verb  turn  or  make  or  use  must be supplied (as often in animated passages of the classical writers). ‘An occasion,’ a starting-point, an Opportunity (comp. Romans 8:8; Romans 8:11; 2 Corinthians 5:12; 2 Corinthians 11:12; 1 Timothy 5:14).
	 But by love serve one another.  By faith we are lords, by love we are servants of all. Show your freedom by love, and your love by service. This kind of bondage is honorable and delightful. ‘To serve God is true freedom’ (Augustine).
