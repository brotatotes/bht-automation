Galatians 5:14.  For the entire  law is  (hath been and is)  fulfilled in one  word  (even),  in  this:  Thou s  halt love thy neighbor as thyself. The law commands supreme love to God (in the first table), and love to our neighbor as to ourselves (in the second table). Love to our neighbor springs necessarily from love to God, and is impossible without it. The teaching of Christ (Matthew 22:39) and of the Apostle (comp. Romans 13:8-9) ere perfectly agree. ‘The neighbor.’ In the Hebrew law, Leviticus 19:18, probably restricted to the Jewish people, but by Christ extended to the universal brotherhood of men. Comp. Matthew 5:43, and the parable of the good Samaritan, Luke 10:29.
