<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:17">Galatians 5:17</span>. <strong> For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit</strong> <em> (strives) </em> <strong> against the flesh. </strong> There is a conflict between reason and appetite, between conscience and depravity, between the higher and lower aspirations, between heaven and hell, going on in every man who is roused to a sense of duty and responsibility; but this conflict becomes most serious under the awakening influence of the Holy Spirit (who is meant here), and results in the triumph of one principle and the defeat of the other. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:4">Romans 7:4</span> ff. ‘The strife of the Spirit against the flesh is an infallible token of regeneration and a state of grace, and is distinguished from the strife of the mere powers of reason in this that the former always wins the victory’ (Starke). ‘The state of the believer is conflict, but with final victory’ (Ellicott.) The natural man may acquire a Stoic virtue, and achieve a conquest over his lower appetites, but not over his pride, which rises all the more powerful on the ruin of vulgar passions.
