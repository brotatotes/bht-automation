Galatians 5:21.  Of which I forewarn you, as I did tell you before,  on my former visits (Galatians 1:9; Galatians 4:13; Galatians 4:16), when I preached to you the gospel which is death to all forms of immorality, and demands conformity to the holy character of Christ.  They who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God,  unless they be converted and sanctified. A hard and terrible word, yet most true (comp. 1 Corinthians 6:9-10; 1 Corinthians 15:50; Revelation 22:15). Heaven is the abode of absolute purity, and nothing unclean can enter therein. ‘Without sanctification no man shall see the Lord.’ Hebrews 12:14.
