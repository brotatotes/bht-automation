Galatians 5:24.  Now they  that are of Christ Jesus did crucify the flesh with its passions and lusts.  Union with Christ is a complete separation from sin; hence the baptismal formula of renunciation of the flesh, the world, and the devil, and devotion to the service of Christ Conversion is death of the old man and birth of the new. ‘Passions’ are passive, ‘lusts’ active, vices. The destruction of the old man of sin is an imitation of the crucifixion, as the birth of the new man of righteousness corresponds to the resurrection of Christ (comp. Galatians 2:20; Galatians 6:14; Romans 6:4-6; Colossians 3:5). The Greek aorist represents this ethical and subjective crucifixion as an act accomplished in the past at the time of conversion and baptism (comp. Galatians 3:27); but in the nature of the case it is continued from day to day, as long as sin and temptation remain.
