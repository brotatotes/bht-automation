Galatians 5:25.  If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by  the Spirit. Application to the Galatians, Paul included. To live and to walk are related here as condition and action, or as the inward and the outward life. If we live in the higher element of the Holy Spirit, we must also show it  by  a corresponding conduct (comp. Galatians 5:16; Romans 8:5-6). The dative in Greek here denotes the rule or direction (as Galatians 6:16). ‘By,’ in English, has both the instrumental and the normal force.
