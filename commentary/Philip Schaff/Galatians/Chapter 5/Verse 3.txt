<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:3">Galatians 5:3</span>. N <strong> ay, I testify again to every man that is circumcised </strong> (suffers himself to be circumcised), <strong> that he is a debtor to do the whole law. </strong> Circumcision is an initiatory rite by which the person circumcised becomes a Jew, and assumes the solemn obligation to keep the whole law of Moses, moral and ritual; just as the baptismal vow is a pledge of obedience to the gospel of Christ. The sacramental rite implies all the responsibilities and duties as well as privileges of membership. ‘I testify,’ I bear witness, I solemnly assert as in court (In classical Greek the verb usually means to summon as a witness, to call to witness.) ‘Again’ refers to ‘I say’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:2">Galatians 5:2</span> <em> . ‘</em> To every man,’ without exception, stronger than the preceding general ‘ye.’
