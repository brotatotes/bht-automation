Galatians 5:4.  Ye are out off from Christ all ye who are being (or, would be) justified by (the) law; y e  are fallen away from grace. ‘ Ye are cut off from Christ,’ completely separated from Him. The Greek verb means to be annulled, to be done away with. Your union with Christ was dissolved and came to nothing in the moment when you sought your justification in the law. ‘Ye are fallen away from grace,’ not totally and finally (in which case the warning  ;  would be useless), but for the time being. Looking to God’s promise and faithfulness, our salvation is sure; looking to our weakness and temptations, all is doubtful, unless we watch and pray without ceasing.
