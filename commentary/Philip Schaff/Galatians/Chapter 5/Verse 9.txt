<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:9">Galatians 5:9</span>. <strong> A little leaven loaveneth the whole lump. </strong> A proverbial expression for the all-pervading influence of a good or bad principle. Here used in a bad sense, as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:6">1 Corinthians 5:6</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:15">Mark 8:15</span>, and often by rabbinical writers. The Judaizing doctrine of the necessity of circumcision poisons the whole system of Christian doctrine and practice. Others less aptly apply it to the <em> persons </em> of the false teachers who corrupt the mass of the people. In a good sense the figure of the leaven is used of the kingdom of heaven which penetrates all the faculties and powers of man and of society. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:32">Matthew 13:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:21">Luke 13:21</span>.
