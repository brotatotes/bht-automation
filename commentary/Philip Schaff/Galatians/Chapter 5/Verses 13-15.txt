<p><em> Warningâ€™ against the Abuse of Freedom, and Exhortation to Brotherly Love.
	</em></p>
<p>In the spirit of true Christian wisdom and moderation, the Apostle now warns the readers against the danger of abusing Christian freedom and running it into antinomian license. This passage is chiefly directed to those Galatians who remained faithful to the free gospel as preached by Paul, but were exposed to the danger of running into the opposite extreme of lawlessness.
