<p><em> Walking by the Spirit. The Works of the Flesh and the Fruit of the Spirit.
	</em></p>
<p>Paul exhorts the Galatians to lead a truly Christian life under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and contrasts the vices of the flesh with the graces of the Spirit. Such exhortations and contrasts are impossible on heathen soil, or in the sphere of natural morality, and reveal the lofty spirituality of the Christian religion.
