<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:1">Galatians 6:1</span>. Spiritual life (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:25-26">Galatians 5:25-26</span>) must show itself in spiritual action, especially in charity, meekness, and modesty.

<p><strong> Brethren. </strong> A word of love more potent than argument.
	</p>
<p><strong> Even if a man be</strong> <strong> overtaken </strong> or surprised, before he is aware of it or able to resist. Sins of precipitancy. We ought to take this charitable view of our neighbor’s trespasses as far as possible. If ‘even’ be connected with the verb (caught in the very act), an aggravation of the offence would be implied, but this is not consistent with the context.

<p><strong> Ye that are spiritual, </strong> or ‘Ye the spiritual ones,’ who are possessed and animated by the Holy Spirit. This refers back to chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:25">Galatians 5:25</span>, and especially to that part of the congregation which remained faithful to the teaching of Paul. Comp. ‘Ye are strong,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:1">Romans 15:1</span>. True charity is a test of spirituality. True strength and freedom show themselves in bearing and forbearing.
	</p>
<p><strong> In</strong> <strong> the spirit of meekness, </strong> stronger than ‘in a meek spirit.’ Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:21">1 Corinthians 4:21</span>, ‘in love and a spirit of meekness.’
	</p>
<p><strong> Looking to thyself, </strong> taking heed each one of you. An individualizing transition from the plural to the singular which makes the charge more direct.
