<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:10">Galatians 6:10</span>. <strong> So then as we have opportunity </strong> (lit.,?. seasonable time). Each opportunity for doing good is an angel that offers us his services. If neglected, it may never return. <strong> Let us do good unto</strong> <strong> all, especially unto the members of the household of the faith. </strong> To do good is the great end of life: first and most to our home, our kindred, our country, our church, our brethren in the faith then to all men good and bad. Charity begins at home, but does not stay at home; it goes to the ends of the earth. The church is often represented as the house of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:15">1 Timothy 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:17">1 Peter 4:17</span>), and believers as one family, as ‘fellow citizens with the saints, and members of the household of God’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:19">Ephesians 2:19</span>).
