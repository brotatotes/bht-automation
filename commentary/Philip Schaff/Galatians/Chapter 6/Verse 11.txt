<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:11">Galatians 6:11</span>. <strong> See in what large letters (or characters) I write unto you with mine own hand.</strong> Not ‘how large a letter’ (E. V.), This would require the accusative in Greek, not the dative (‘with’ or ‘in what large letters’). It refers to the handwriting, not to the contents. Some understand it of awkward, ill-formed characters, and trace them to Paul’s inexperience in Greek (?), or to want of mechanical skill, or to defective eyesight, or to bodily suffering at the time. But the Greek (πηλίκοις ) refers to large <em> size </em> only, and may indicate the emphasis laid on these concluding sentences (corresponding to our use of underscoring), or a habitual bold hand which is often expressive of energy and strong conviction. We have no autographs of the Apostles; the oldest manuscripts date from the fourth century, and are written in large or uncial characters. Paul employed usually an amanuensis or copyist (as Tertius, who wrote the Epistle to the Romans from dictation, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:22">Romans 16:22</span>), but added with his own hand a closing benediction, or some sentences as a special mark of affection, or as a precaution against forgers of letters in his name ( 2Th 2:2 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17-18">2 Thessalonians 3:17-18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:21-24">1 Corinthians 16:21-24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+4:18">Colossians 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25-27">Romans 16:25-27</span>). ‘I write’ (lit ‘I wrote’ or ‘have written’) is often used in epistolary style from the standpoint of the recipient. It may refer to the concluding part only, or to the whole Epistle. The former is more probable from his habit of dictating or sending a copy of his letters.
