Galatians 6:13.  For not even they who are circumcised keep the law (in all its details, comp. Galatians 5:3),  but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. The advocates of circumcision are not sincere in their zeal, but want to gratify their vanity in making proselytes. (Comp. Matthew 23:15.)
