Galatians 6:16.  And as many as shall walk according to this rule, etc. Rising above all earthly distinctions to the height of Christian contemplation, Paul pronounces a benediction to all who walk according to the rule indicated in Galatians 6:15. The Greek term for ‘rule’  (canon)  is the same which is now used for the Sacred Scriptures as the rule of the Christian faith and practice.
	 Peace be on them  and mercy, ‘ Peace’ with God and with themselves, the precious fruit of the atonement and the greatest Christian blessing, which the world cannot give nor take away (John 14:27). ‘Mercy’ is coupled with peace (1 Timothy 1:2  ; 2 Timothy 1:2; 2 John 1:3). In the other Pauline Epistles we have ‘grace and peace’ in the salutation.
	And (namely)  upon  the Israel of God, the true children of Israel, the people of God, as distinct from the mere carnal descendants. The believing Christians generally (not the Jewish Christians exclusively) are meant (comp. Galatians 3:29; Galatians 4:26; Romans 9:6-8).
