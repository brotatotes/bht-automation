Galatians 6:17.  From  henceforth let no  man trouble  me.  Directed against the Judaizing troublers.

They were his credentials and his trophies. ‘Of Jesus,’ as the owner, the master (the genitive of possession). Much Romish superstition has been built upon the term’ stigmata,’ as signifying the prints of Christ’s wounds, as in the case of St. Francis of Assist.
