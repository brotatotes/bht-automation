<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:17">Galatians 6:17</span>. <strong> From</strong> <strong> henceforth let no</strong> <strong> man trouble</strong> <strong> me. </strong> Directed against the Judaizing troublers.

<p><strong> For I bear in</strong> <strong> my body the marks of</strong> <strong> Jesus. ‘</strong> Marks’ (stigmata) were usually letters burnt upon the arm or forehead of slaves, soldiers, criminals, also devotees of a divinity, to indicate the master, the captain, the crime, the divinity. (Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+7:3">Revelation 7:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+13:16">Revelation 13:16</span>). Paul means the wounds and scars of persecution and suffering which he endured in the service of his Master, and which proved him to be a faithful bondman of Christ. (Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23-25">2 Corinthians 11:23-25</span>.) They were his credentials and his trophies. ‘Of Jesus,’ as the owner, the master (the genitive of possession). Much Romish superstition has been built upon the term’ stigmata,’ as signifying the prints of Christ’s wounds, as in the case of St. Francis of Assist.
