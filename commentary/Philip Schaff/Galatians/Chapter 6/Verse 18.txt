<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:18">Galatians 6:18</span>. The last sentence of this polemic Epistle is a benediction, and the last word is a word of affection, <strong> brethren</strong>. It takes the sting out of the severity. With all your faults, the Apostle means to say, I love you still, and the very rebuke was dictated by my deep concern for your welfare.
	</p>
<p>Thus concludes this Epistle so full of polemic fire and zeal, yet more full of grace, free, sovereign grace, justifying, sanctifying grace, and full of forgiving love even to ungrateful pupils; an Epistle for the time, and an Epistle for all times.
