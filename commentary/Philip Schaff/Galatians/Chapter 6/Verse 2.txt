Galatians 6:2.  Bear ye one  anotherâ€™s burdens,  all sorts   of troubles, cares, errors, and infirmities. Sin and error should be resisted and rebuked in a spirit of charity and meekness; but with all our faults we ought to esteem and love one another as brethren in Christ (Comp. Romans 15:1.)
	 And thus ye shall  (completely)  fulfil the law of Christ,  namely, the law of love. (Comp. Galatians 5:14; Romans 13:8; John 13:34; 1 John 3:23.) The E. V. is based on another reading which expresses the imperative, instead of the future. The authorities are almost equally divided.
