<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:2">Galatians 6:2</span>. <strong> Bear ye one</strong> <strong> anotherâ€™s burdens, </strong> all sorts <strong> </strong> of troubles, cares, errors, and infirmities. Sin and error should be resisted and rebuked in a spirit of charity and meekness; but with all our faults we ought to esteem and love one another as brethren in Christ (Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:1">Romans 15:1</span>.)
	</p>
<p><strong> And thus ye shall </strong> (completely) <strong> fulfil the law of Christ, </strong> namely, the law of love. (Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:14">Galatians 5:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:8">Romans 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:34">John 13:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:23">1 John 3:23</span>.) The E. V. is based on another reading which expresses the imperative, instead of the future. The authorities are almost equally divided.
