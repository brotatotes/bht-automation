<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:5">Galatians 6:5</span>. <strong> For each man shall bear his own burden. </strong> No <em> </em> contradiction to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:2">Galatians 6:2</span>. Those who bear their own burden are best able to sympathize with others and to share in their burdens. Those who pray most for themselves pray most for others. ‘Each is to prove his own work and not to leave it to be accomplished by others, and at the same time each is to help all others as often as he can find opportunity. And the opportunity to bless others is itself one of the greatest of blessings.’ Paul is fond of paradoxes and antithetic expressions of complementary truths (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:12-13">Philippians 2:12-13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:10">2 Corinthians 12:10</span>; ‘when I am weak, then I am strong’).
