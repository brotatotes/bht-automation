Galatians 6:8.  He that soweth unto (upon)  his own flesh shall from the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto  (upon)  the Spirit shall from the Spirit  reap life eternal. Galatians 6:7 speaks of the kind of seed sown (‘whatsoever’), Galatians 6:8 of the kind of soil on which the seed is sown. The soil of the flesh, that is of corrupt human nature, yields blighted and rotten fruit; the soil of the Holy Spirit yields sweet and healthy fruit, even eternal happiness and peace.
