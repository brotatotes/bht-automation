<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:8">Galatians 6:8</span>. <strong> He that soweth unto</strong> (upon) <strong> his own flesh shall from the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto </strong> (upon) <strong> the Spirit shall from the Spirit</strong> <strong> reap life eternal. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:7">Galatians 6:7</span></strong> speaks of the kind of seed sown (‘whatsoever’), <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:8">Galatians 6:8</span> of the kind of soil on which the seed is sown. The soil of the flesh, that is of corrupt human nature, yields blighted and rotten fruit; the soil of the Holy Spirit yields sweet and healthy fruit, even eternal happiness and peace.
