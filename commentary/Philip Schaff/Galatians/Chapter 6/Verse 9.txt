Galatians 6:9.  But let  us not be weary  (lose heart)  in well  doing. Not only in regard to the duty of liberality, but in every good work. (Comp. 2 Thessalonians 3:13.) ‘Fatigue is not weariness. In well-doing we are more apt to be weary than fatigued’ (Riddle).
	 In  due season we shall reap,  in the time of harvest (comp. 1 Timothy 6:15; 1 Timothy 6:15; Titus 1:3). ‘The due season is God’s season’ (Riddle).  If  we faint not, ‘as husbandmen overcome with heat and fatigue.’ (Comp. James 5:7.)
