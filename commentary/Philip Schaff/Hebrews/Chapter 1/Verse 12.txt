Hebrews 1:12.  As a mantle shalt thou roll them up, as a garment also shall they be changed  a quotation from Psalms 102:0, with the words ‘as a garment’ added, on the authority of the best MSS. The heavens and the earth are to be lolled up as done with, and they are to be changed for a new heaven and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
