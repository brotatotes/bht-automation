Hebrews 1:13.  Sit thou, etc., from Psalms 110:1. The right hand is the place of authority and honour. Thy footstool, lit. a footstool of thy feet not a resting-place for the feet, but what is to be trodden under by them. The application of this Psalm to the Messiah is accepted by the Jews, as appears from the Targums and other Jewish writings, is affirmed by Christ (Matthew 22:43-46) and by His apostles (Acts 2:34-35; 1 Corinthians 15:25; Ephesians 1:20-23), and by different passages in this Epistle. Whom else could David acknowledge as his Lord? and to whom else did God swear that he should be a priest for ever?
