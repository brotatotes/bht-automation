<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>. <strong> Are they not all ministering spirits? </strong> a blending in reverse order of the expressions found in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:7">Hebrews 1:7</span>. The play upon the words ‘ministering spirits sent forth to minister’ is not in the Greek. The original is simply ‘ministering spirits continually sent forth on (or for) service.’ The word here rendered ‘ministering’ is used in N. T. to express the temple service; and the word rendered ‘ministry’ or service is a form of the word that expresses deaconship or subordinate service generally. The worship and the work of angels is carried on in the great temple of nature and grace, and their service originates in the needs and claims of those who are soon to possess complete salvation. Of their ministry, for the benefit of all who believe, we have many examples under both Testaments. It is none the less real now that it is unseen.
