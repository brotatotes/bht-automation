<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>. <strong> The brightness </strong> the <em> effulgence</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> of the divine glory, with allusion probably to the visible glory of the Shekinah over the mercy-seat, though the meaning is deeper. ‘Light of ( <em> i.e</em> emanating from Him who is the) light.’

<p><strong> The express image</strong>, the impress or stamp wherein and whereby the divine essence is made manifest: and all this He is in His own nature, so the Greek implies (‘being,’ comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>), not that He became so by incarnation. ‘Image of his <strong> person</strong> ’ is not felicitous. The earlier rendering, substance (Tyndale, essence or nature), is more accurate.
	</p>
<p><strong> And bearing</strong>, upholding and directing all things by the word, the <em> fiat </em> of His power, <strong> when</strong> (rather <em> after</em>) <strong> he had made purification of sins</strong>, <em> i.e </em> had atoned for them, sat down, etc.

<p>What higher honour can be given to our Lord? He is the glory the love and holiness of God made visible; the very essence, the nature of the Father in loving embodiment. He therefore that has the Son has the Father also.
	</p>
<p>Note that God not only acted in creating all things; He acts still in upholding them. A creation regulated by dead law alone is not Scripture teaching (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:24-25">Acts 17:24-25</span>, He <em> is giving </em> to all life and all things, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:27-28">Acts 17:27-28</span>). And it is in and through Christ this is done.
