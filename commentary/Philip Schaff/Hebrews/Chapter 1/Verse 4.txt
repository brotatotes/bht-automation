Hebrews 1:4.  Having become, after He had made at nement for sin, as much superior to the  angels, as he has obtained a name far more excellent than they. His greatness is partly essential and partly acquired (see Philippians 2:6-11). The first He had as Son before the world was; the second He obtained through His incarnation, and after He had suffered.
