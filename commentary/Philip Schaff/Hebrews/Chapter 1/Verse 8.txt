<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:8">Hebrews 1:8</span>. But whatever the difficulties in the minute interpretation of those verses, the general sense is clear. Angels are all subordinate; while to Christ are given names of a very different import God and Lord, and highest dignities a sceptre and a throne, a kingdom.
	</p>
<p><strong> A sceptre of righteousness</strong>, or rather of <strong> uprightness</strong>, as the word is translated in the Old Testament. If this change be made, it may then be said that righteous, righteousness, just, justify, justification, are throughout the New Testament forms of the same Greek word. His character befits His kingdom. His is a sceptre of uprightness. He loves righteousness and hates iniquity, showing herein the very nature of the Father.
