Hebrews 1:9. The dignity of the God-man He owes to His Father. God anointed Him as King and Priest, and gave Him honours such as kings, prophets, priests His ‘fellows,’ associates that is, not necessarily equals never knew. He therefore is now the One Priest, the King of kings and Lord of lords (see Ephesians 1:21). This supremacy is a joy to all who trust and obey Him. Nay, the earth itself is called to rejoice because He reigneth. The anointing oil that consecrates Messiah Priest and King is oil of gladness indeed!
	Of these quotations, Hebrews 1:8 is taken from Psalms 45:0, which Jewish commentators maintain to be written of the Messiah; Hebrews 1:9 is taken from a passage that speaks of Solomon, and of Christ as an antitype; and Hebrews 1:10 is taken from a Psalm (Psalms 102:25-27) that seems to speak of Jehovah only; and yet Hebrews 1:13-14 of that Psalm are connected with the Messianic kingdom. Creating power and immortality are here ascribed to the Son, as in Psalms 102:13 universal empire is given to Him. The quotation in Hebrews 1:13 is from Psalms 110, a strictly Messianic Psalm (see Matthew 22:43-44).
