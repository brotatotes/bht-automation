<p><strong> DOCTRINAL HINTS.
	</strong></p>
<p>In this Epistle, as in the Gospel of John, the doctrine is based on the Divine nature of Christ, and on His incarnation. As in the Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1-18">John 1:1-18</span>) it is said that the Word was God and became flesh, and this double truth pervades the book, so in the Hebrews the Deity and the humanity of the Son form the foundation of the entire treatise, and give strength and consistency to its teaching. The double truth is not worked as a pattern on the surface, it forms part of the texture.
	</p>
<p>In this last dispensation God is said to speak to us in His Son. The Son is the medium of the revelation. As revealer He has as His associates the apostles. But this office of Christ is quite subordinate. His true character is that He is Himself <em> the revelation. </em> To know God and His Son Jesus Christ is eternal life. God in Christ, Christ as God, redeeming, renewing, sanctifying, is the saving doctrine of the Gospel.
	</p>
<p>There is a double Trinity in Scripture the Trinity of the Old Testament: the Trinity of the eternity that precedes the incarnation, wherein Christ shares the glory He had with the Father, wherein He made the worlds; the Trinity of the New Testament, wherein He, as incarnate Son of God, becomes Messianic King, and regains with accumulated honours His original glory the second founded on the first, revealing it in clearer colours, with greater tenderness, and in closer relation to ourselves; again, perhaps, to become subordinate to the first, when God Himself in His essential nature shall be all in all (chaps. 1 and 2.).

<p><strong> PRACTICAL HINTS.
	</strong></p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1">Hebrews 1:1</span>. God is the chief teacher of the Church, and what He taught of old has still its authority and its lessons even under the Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5">Hebrews 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:8">Hebrews 1:8</span>, etc.).
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>. The author of the Old Testament is also the author of the New. It is God who gives Christ the supremacy. To put Moses or some ‘son of David’ above Christ is to disobey God. <em> By whom: </em> Christ, then, is a distinct person from the Father, and yet He is Creator of all things.
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>. As the sun is manifested only by its effulgence, so the Father is revealed to us by Him who is Light <em> of </em> Light, God <em> of </em> God. He who upholds all things is our Redeemer and sacrifice. The atonement of sin is effected not by our doings or sufferings, but by Christ, and was completed by Him before He ascended. . . .
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4">Hebrews 1:4</span>. Names are qualities and character when God gives them. ... To give angels the worship that is due to Christ is to frustrate the Divine purpose, and to give to the servant what belongs only to the Son or the Father.
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5">Hebrews 1:5</span>. In the first age of the Church, Scripture determined what was truth, and that is its province still.
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2-3">Hebrews 2:2-3</span>. Not to believe the Gospel is a greater sin than to break the law. . . . When men are <em> warned </em> or exhorted, the <em> first </em> person is more impressive than the second, ‘How shall <em> we </em> escape?’
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:4">Hebrews 2:4</span>. The rejection of the Gospel is rejection of the doctrine which Christ and His apostles preached. Post-apostolic doctrine has no <em> Divine </em> authority. . . . The doctrine is Divine which miracles confirm; the miracles are false when the doctrine they support is not Divine.
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:6-7">Hebrews 2:6-7</span>. The Gospel, which is sometimes said to libel human nature, so darkly does it paint our character, gives man highest dignities, and raises him to the greatest blessedness.
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>. Faith is <em> insight, </em> and sees much that to the unbelieving remains unseen.
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:11">Hebrews 2:11</span>. The poorest, feeblest Christian who is sanctified and believes is recognised by Christ as a ‘brother.’
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:13">Hebrews 2:13</span>. Christ Himself is a believer, one with us in the covenant of grace. He lived a life of faith even as we.
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:15">Hebrews 2:15</span>. There is a natural fear of death in man not always felt, but easily wakened. Christ’s death delivers man from the danger of death, and from the fear of it. None but the true Christian is really free.
