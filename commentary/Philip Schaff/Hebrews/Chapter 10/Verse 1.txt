Hebrews 10:1. For a particle that connects the argument with the last verses of chap. 9. The sacrifice of Christ will not be repeated, we are told in Hebrews 9:28. Nor need it, is the statement here
	 the law having, as we know it has,  a shadow  only a mere outline of  the good things which belong to the world  to come (chap. Hebrews 6:5), of which Christ is High Priest (Hebrews 9:11),  not the very image the very form of the things,  i.e  the heavenly realities themselves (comp. Romans 8:29),  they can never  at any time or anyhow  with the same sacrifices year by year which they offer  continually  words that describe the ever-recurring cycle of the same sacrifices for sin  make perfect those who are ever drawing nigh to God.
