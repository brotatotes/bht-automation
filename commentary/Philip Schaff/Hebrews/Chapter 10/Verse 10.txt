Hebrews 10:10.  In which will, and in the accomplishment of it, we have been and are sanctified freed from the guilt of sin (and so we are said to be sanctified in Christ Jesus, 1 Corinthians 1:2) and made morally fit for God’s service  by the offering of the body of Christ, ‘which Thou hast prepared for me,’  once for all.
