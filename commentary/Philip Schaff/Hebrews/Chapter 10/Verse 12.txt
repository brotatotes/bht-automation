Hebrews 10:12.  But he (this Priest)  having offered one  s  acrifice for sins for ever, took his seat on the right hand of God, an evidence of the completeness of His work, which left no room for another sacrifice or for the repetition of His own. His priesthood indeed continues, and the presentation of His sacrifice ‘the perpetual oblation;’ but His atoning work is over. ‘For ever,’ in perpetuity, uninterruptedly, may be connected with ‘took His seat,’ but the usage of this Epistle is to connect it with the words that precede, Hebrews 7:3, Hebrews 10:1.
