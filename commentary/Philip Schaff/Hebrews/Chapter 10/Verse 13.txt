Hebrews 10:13. Not a second time can He suffer: Only  waiting as he now is till, in fulfilment of the Divine promise (Psalms 110:1),  his enemies be made the footstool of his feet. The Jewish priest stood fearful and uneasy in the holy place hastening to depart when the service was done as from a place to which he had only temporary access. Christ sits as at home, having completed His work and now awaiting His full reward.
