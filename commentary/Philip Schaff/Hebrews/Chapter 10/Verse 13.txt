<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:13">Hebrews 10:13</span>. Not a second time can He suffer: Only <strong> waiting as he now is till</strong>, in fulfilment of the Divine promise (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1">Psalms 110:1</span>), <strong> his enemies be made the footstool of his feet</strong>. The Jewish priest stood fearful and uneasy in the holy place hastening to depart when the service was done as from a place to which he had only temporary access. Christ sits as at home, having completed His work and now awaiting His full reward.
