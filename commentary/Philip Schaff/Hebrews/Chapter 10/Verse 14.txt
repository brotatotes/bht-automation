Hebrews 10:14.  For by one offering he hath perfected for ever, in unbroken continuance,  them that are being sanctified. Here the word used is the present participle not as in Hebrews 10:10, the perfect and calls attention to the progressive purification that belongs to the redeemed. The word ‘sanctified’ implies both the imputed and the imparted righteousness of Christ. When the perfect is used, and we are said to be sanctified in Christ, imputed purification from the guilt of sin is the predominant thought; when the present is used, it points rather to the subjective process whereby Christ’s work is realized in the peace and holiness of believers.
