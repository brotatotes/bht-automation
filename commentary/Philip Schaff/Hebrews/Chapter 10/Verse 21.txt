Hebrews 10:21.  A great priest  not high priest chiefly, for which the word high priest is always used in this Epistle, but a priest who is enthroned at Godâ€™s right hand  over the house of God  not a servant like Moses in the house (Hebrews 3:5-6), but over it,  i.e  over the universal Church, including both the heaven of glory (John 14:2) and the Church on earth. We are under Christ in our earthly pilgrimage, as we shall be in the home above; and indeed we have both privileges, for we reach the inmost recesses of the very sanctuary of God even now by   faith and prayer (Hebrews 10:22).
