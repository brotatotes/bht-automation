<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:21">Hebrews 10:21</span>. <strong> A great priest </strong> not high priest chiefly, for which the word high priest is always used in this Epistle, but a priest who is enthroned at Godâ€™s right hand <strong> over the house of God </strong> not a servant like Moses in the house (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:5-6">Hebrews 3:5-6</span>), but over it, <em> i.e </em> over the universal Church, including both the heaven of glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:2">John 14:2</span>) and the Church on earth. We are under Christ in our earthly pilgrimage, as we shall be in the home above; and indeed we have both privileges, for we reach the inmost recesses of the very sanctuary of God even now by <strong> </strong> faith and prayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:22">Hebrews 10:22</span>).
