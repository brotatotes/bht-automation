Hebrews 10:24.  And let us (who have the same right of approach, the same interest in one another’s holiness, the same common relation to one Lord all still depending on Hebrews 10:19)  well consider  (the weakness, the capabilities, the dangers, the preciousness of the graces of one another)  to provoke unto love, etc. (in the old sense of calling forth literally, ‘to the sharpening or quickening of love,’ etc.), and kind beneficent works which are its appropriate fruit. Such provocation is the only provocation the Gospel recognises, and it must be carried on from proper principles and with Gospel motives so as to confirm our faith and hope. A loving Christian community striving for the faith of the Gospel is sure to be stedfast (Philippians 1:27-28) a loving temper is a wonderful aid to faith. The connection between states of heart and belief is far closer than most suppose (Hebrews 10:25), as also is the connection between faith and the maintenance of fellowship with Christians.
