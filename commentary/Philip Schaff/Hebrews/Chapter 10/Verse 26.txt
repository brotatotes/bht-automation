<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:26">Hebrews 10:26</span>. <strong> For if we sin wilfully</strong>; rather, are wilfully continuing in sin. It is a word which needs to be noted. First of all there is no ‘if’ in the passage; it is stated as an actual case, not a supposed one. Then the emphasis is on ‘wilfully ‘and on continuance in sin. In a sense all sin implies the consent of the will for a time; and yet there is a distinction. Paul was a blasphemer and a persecutor; but he did it ignorantly in unbelief. Peter was a true disciple, and nevertheless he denied Christ with curses and oaths; but not wilfully, rather apparently through passing fear (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:74-75">Matthew 26:74-75</span>). The expression seems taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="nu+15:30-31">Numbers 15:30-31</span>, where sinning wilfully is described as doing something presumptuously, with a high hand, and by one who despises the Word of the Lord. The willing sinner is one who <em> will </em> sin. Nor is it a single act that is denounced, but a permanent state (not an aorist, but the present), continuance in a sinful course, and such continuance as implies apostasy. Moreover, it is the state of one who has received the knowledge of the truth, and who knows it to be truth (not as in Paul’s case, and not as in the case of the murderers who crucified Christ ignorantly, and some of whom became obedient to the faith). They were enlightened; they received the word with joy; for a while they believed (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:13">Luke 8:13</span>). And this ‘knowledge of the truth,’ it may be added, is found only here in this Epistle, though common in Paul’s writings. Such was their character; and yet they gave up the Gospel, trod under foot the Son of God, counted His blood an unholy, a common, even a profane thing, offered insult to the Spirit of grace. They rejected that one sacrifice which completed and ended the sacrifices of the ancient Law, against their better knowledge, and resolved to return to their former sinful life; and for them there is no longer remaining any sacrifice for sin.
