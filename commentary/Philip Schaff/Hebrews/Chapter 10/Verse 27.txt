<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:27">Hebrews 10:27</span>. <strong> The only thing left is a fearful award, an awful reservation, of judgment and fiery indignation</strong> (fervour of fire flaming fire, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:8">2 Thessalonians 1:8</span>; the heat of the consuming fire of God Himself, chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:29">Hebrews 12:29</span>), <strong> which shall devour those that oppose</strong>. The word ‘reservation,’ ‘award,’ is found only here in the New Testament, though the verb is not infrequent. It always means in common Greek reservation (in a literal or a figurative sense), and this is probably its meaning here. It describes not what is expected, but what will certainly be, and in truth what is already in reserve ‘a reception of judgment.’
