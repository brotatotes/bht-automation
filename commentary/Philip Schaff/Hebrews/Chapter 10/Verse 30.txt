Hebrews 10:30.  For.  This punishment is certain, and is fulfilled and executed by God Himself. The first quotation in this verse follows neither the Hebrew nor the Greek text, but is the exact rendering adopted by Paul in Romans 12:19. The second is taken from Deuteronomy 32:36, and from the Psalms. The Hebrew of the word ‘judge’ has two meanings to exercise judgment in punishing others, and to exercise judgment on behalf of others. The second sense may be seen in Psalms 82:3-4 (compare margin), Psa 43:1 , 1 Samuel 24:12; 1 Samuel 24:15, and is appropriate to the passage in Deuteronomy 32:35-36, as well as here. He will execute judgment on behalf of His people, and against those who become traitors and blasphemers. God is Judge, is the first truth; and His judgment will be executed, is the second.
