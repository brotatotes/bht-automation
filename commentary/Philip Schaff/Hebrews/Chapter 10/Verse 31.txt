<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:31">Hebrews 10:31</span>. <strong> It is a fearful thing to fall into the</strong> <strong> hands of the living God. </strong> His hands represent His power for work, whether in love or in wrath. To fall into His hands in faith is to have peace; but to fall into His hands in punishment is dreadful.
