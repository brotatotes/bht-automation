Hebrews 10:32.  Call to remembrance  (rather, call up and keep in remembrance)  those former days in which, when first enlightened  (as in chap. Hebrews 6:4),  ye  endured,  without losing heart or hope (so the word implies),  a great fight  (a manifest struggle)  of suffering,   i.e  consisting in suffering, not with suffering as your foe (Hebrews 10:34, where it is said that they suffered with those that were bound).
