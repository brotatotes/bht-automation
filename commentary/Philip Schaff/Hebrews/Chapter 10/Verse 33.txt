Hebrews 10:33.  Partly in that ye became a spectacle of shame  ‘a theatrical spectacle’ a term taken from those who were exposed in the theatre to shameful punishment (1 Corinthians 4:11)  in the scornful taunts  (you suffered)  and in active persecution, and partly in that ye became partakers  (partners)  with those who were living and suffering in this way.  The word ‘living’ is not passive, but is repeatedly found in the Epistles to describe the actual condition of a man’s life (chap. Heb 13:18 ; 2 Corinthians 1:12; 1 Timothy 3:15). Such ‘reproach and affliction’ is recorded in Acts 5:18; Acts 5:40; Acts 8:3; Acts 11:19; Acts 22:19; Acts 26:10-11, and in the history of Paul himself (Acts 21:27). All those instances must have been familiar to Hebrew believers.
