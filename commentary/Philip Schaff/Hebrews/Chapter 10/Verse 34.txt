Hebrews 10:34.  For ye had compassion upon those who were in bonds, and ye also took joyfully the spoiling  (the plundering)  of your goods, knowing that ye have yourselves  or for yourselves the alternate reading (‘in yourselves’) is   certainly wrong, and ‘in heaven’ is probably wrong, though it makes a good sense, and is implied in the shorter reading a better  and an abiding substance  (possession. Compare Acts 4:32; Luke 12:15, where a form of   the same word is used).
