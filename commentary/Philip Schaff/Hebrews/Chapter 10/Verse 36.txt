Hebrews 10:36.  For ye have need of patience  an emphatic word; when used in relation to suffering, it describes the patient endurance which bears all with stedfastness and hope; when used in relation to active work, it describes the ‘patient continuance in well-doing’ (Romans 2:7) which endures (a form of the same word) to the end; the former is the commoner meaning, and both seem to be combined in this passage  that ye may do the will of God and receive the promise.  The doing and the receiving are not separated in time; the one crowns the other. ‘The promise’ means the promised reward, which in a sense is already yours; but the full possession is still future, and the present enjoyment broken and imperfect. Hence the need of patience and kith, as is shown by Old Testament teaching.
