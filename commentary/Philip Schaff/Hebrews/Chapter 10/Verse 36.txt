<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:36">Hebrews 10:36</span>. <strong> For ye have need of patience </strong> an emphatic word; when used in relation to suffering, it describes the patient endurance which bears all with stedfastness and hope; when used in relation to active work, it describes the ‘patient continuance in well-doing’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:7">Romans 2:7</span>) which endures (a form of the same word) to the end; the former is the commoner meaning, and both seem to be combined in this passage <strong> that ye may do the will of God and receive the promise. </strong> The doing and the receiving are not separated in time; the one crowns the other. ‘The promise’ means the promised reward, which in a sense is already yours; but the full possession is still future, and the present enjoyment broken and imperfect. Hence the need of patience and kith, as is shown by Old Testament teaching.
