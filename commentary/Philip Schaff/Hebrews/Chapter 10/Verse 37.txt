Hebrews 10:37.  For yet a very little while  a phrase that is taken from the Greek of Isaiah 26:20, where it is translated, in E. V., ‘for a little moment’ (literally, for a little time, how little).
	 He that cometh  ‘He that is to come’ ‘the coming One’ the name of Christ under both economies He was called ‘the coming One,’ and He is so still. The prophecy is taken from Habakkuk, where it refers to the vision of the fell of the Chaldean monarchy, a type for the time of a great persecuting power, and of the setting up in immediate sequence (as is common in prophecy) of the Divine kingdom.
	 Will come though it tarry, wait for it. The Greek of the Septuagint makes the object of the vision a person, and the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews makes the person the Messiah. The day of Jehovah in the one covenant becomes the day of the Lord in the other.
