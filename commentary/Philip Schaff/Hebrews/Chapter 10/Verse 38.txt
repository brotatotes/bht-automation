Hebrews 10:38.  But (or now)  my righteous one (he who belongs to God’s people)  by faith shall live. As it is by faith he first gets life (as is told us in Romans 1:16-17, and Galatians 3:11), so it is by faith that life is preserved in the midst of judgments and of delays that are incident to them.
	 But if he (A. V. ‘any man’) Owen and Gill, Winer and De Wette, prefer ‘he,’ which is simpler and in harmony with the context; the same person is described in the two clauses  draw back  the rendering of the Septuagint adopts apparently a different reading of the Hebrew text, as it does to a small extent in the following clause. The reference of those two clauses to the same person need create no difficulty. The apostasy of a professed Christian is always possible, or warnings would be needless: not necessarily the apostasy of a true Christian. The perseverance of the elect is one thing; the perseverance of a particular person is to us another.
