Hebrews 10:39.  But we are not of them that draw back unto perdition (destruction, Romans 9:22; Philippians 1:28; Philippians 3:19, etc.), but of them  that believe. ‘We’ the writer again includes himself with them as true believers, though subject to the same law as here is applied to his own case (‘I keep my body under, lest, having preached the Gospel to others, I should be myself rejected’). ‘That draw back’ ‘that believe’ each expression describes a quality or character which originates in apostasy or faith respectively. We are not of the character that drawing back produces; we are of the character that faith produces. Unto the saving of the soul. This last phrase is very striking the gaining of possession of the soul. As the backslider loses his soul, gets, instead of eternal life, never-ending death, which yet is not annihilation, so the man of faith wins back his soul from impending perdition, gains a possession that is truly his. The man who is not God’s is not even his own; his entire personality is the slave and the property of another.
