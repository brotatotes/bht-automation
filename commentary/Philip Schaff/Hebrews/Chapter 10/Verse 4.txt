<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:4">Hebrews 10:4</span>. Nor could it be otherwise, for the sacrifices themselves are inherently defective. This teaching may seem to contradict the statement that ‘the blood upon the altar’ makes an atonement for the soul (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+17:11">Leviticus 17:11</span>), and is appointed (‘given’) for that purpose. The fact is, that the blood of the bullock or of the goat (the sin offering on the Day of Atonement) could not weigh against the guilt of a nation, or even of a single worshipper. It could only sanctify to the purifying of the flesh (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13">Hebrews 9:13</span>), restoring the sinner to living membership with the literal Israel. It cancelled ceremonial guilt, not spiritual sin, and gave legal outward purity, not spiritual regeneration. The annual sacrifice was only a shadow and prophecy of another sacrifice, in which the Divine will was to be perfectly accomplished.
