<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:7">Hebrews 10:7</span>. <strong> Then said I, Lo, I am come (in the volume or roll of the book it is written of me) </strong> the book of the ancient Law from Moses downwards (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:18">Acts 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:11">1 Peter 1:11</span>) <strong> to do thy will</strong>, <strong> O God</strong>. To do the will of God is to obey His commands, and especially in this context the command to lay down His life (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:17">John 10:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:31">John 14:31</span>). It is on this one thing the writer is insisting. That He might render this obedience a body was prepared for Him, and a nature capable of those sufferings both in heart and in life which were necessary to expiate sin, and fulfil the one righteousness whereby many were to be made righteous. This was, indeed, the chief design of His coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span>).
