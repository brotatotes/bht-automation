Hebrews 10:9.  Then saith he (literally, hath He said),  He (that is, Christ)  taketh away the first,  that he may establish (set up)  the second. Legal sacrifices are abolished that there may be substituted for them, the will the good pleasure of God, which Christ came to do by the one sacrifice of Himself.
