Hebrews 10:1-18. We now reach the conclusion of the argument, which is also in part a repetition. Christ’s offering of Himself, as contrasted with the yearly offerings of the Law, is the completion of the will and purpose of God (Hebrews 10:1-10). Christ’s priestly service, as contrasted with the daily services of the priests, oft-repeated and all imperfect, is for ever perfected by His one priestly act, and in His kingly authority (Hebrews 10:11-14): and His finished work is the inauguration of a New Covenant, in which the law being written on the heart, and sin put away and forgotten, no further offering is needed or allowed (Hebrews 10:15-18).
