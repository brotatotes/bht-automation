For nearly four chapters the argument has remained unbroken by those exhortations which abound in the earlier parts of the Epistle. From chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:1">Hebrews 7:1</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:18">Hebrews 10:18</span> the reasoning is close and continuous; but the one great purpose of the Epistle is never absent from the writerâ€™s mind. Here he resumes the appeals with which the fourth chapter closes, and repeats with characteristic differences, as suggested by the train of the thought, the solemn warnings of chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:1-8">Hebrews 6:1-8</span>.
