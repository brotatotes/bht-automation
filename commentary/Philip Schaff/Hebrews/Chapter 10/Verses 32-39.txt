Hebrews 10:32-39. The argument now takes a turn,  as in chap. Hebrews 6:9. The writer hopes better things. He bids them to remember again and again their earlier struggles and their hope of a blessed reward (Hebrews 10:32-34). He exhorts them not to give up their confidence (Hebrews 10:35), which needs patient waiting for God (Hebrews 10:36); the time required for it, indeed, is short (Hebrews 10:37), though it requires faith and stedfastness (Hebrews 10:38). To those who owe their all to faith, and who mean, God helping them, still to believe, and so to secure their souls from the ruin that will otherwise overtake them, he affirms they belong (Hebrews 10:39).
