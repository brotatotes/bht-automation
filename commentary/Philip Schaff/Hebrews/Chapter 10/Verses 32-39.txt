<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:32-39">Hebrews 10:32-39</span>. The argument now takes a turn, <strong> as</strong> in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:9">Hebrews 6:9</span>. The writer hopes better things. He bids them to remember again and again their earlier struggles and their hope of a blessed reward (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:32-34">Hebrews 10:32-34</span>). He exhorts them not to give up their confidence (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:35">Hebrews 10:35</span>), which needs patient waiting for God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:36">Hebrews 10:36</span>); the time required for it, indeed, is short (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:37">Hebrews 10:37</span>), though it requires faith and stedfastness (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:38">Hebrews 10:38</span>). To those who owe their all to faith, and who mean, God helping them, still to believe, and so to secure their souls from the ruin that will otherwise overtake them, he affirms they belong (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:39">Hebrews 10:39</span>).
