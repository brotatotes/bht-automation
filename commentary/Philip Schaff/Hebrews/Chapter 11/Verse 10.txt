Hebrews 11:10.  For (the reason of his being a sojourner only) he looked, or waited,  for a city which hath foundations, whose Builder (the word implies the skill employed in building the skill of the architect who forms the plan, as the following word implies rather the labour of erecting it)  and Maker is God. The contrast here is first between tents, which are easily removed, and a permanent home, and then between an earthly tent and the city of the living God, of which we read in chap, Hebrews 12:22 and chap. Hebrews 13:14. Abrahamâ€™s faith looked forward to a home for himself and his descendants in Canaan, in the earthly Jerusalem, with its foundations in the holy mountains (Psalms 87:0); and then, beyond Canaan and his mortal life, to the heavenly reality, of which Jerusalem was the type a double Jerusalem, the one below and the other above; of which Jews had some knowledge, and devout Jews had strong hope, long before the Gospel had thrown fuller light upon these themes.
