Hebrews 11:14.  For (they proved that they lived and died in faith)  they who say of themselves that they are sojourners  (Genesis 23:4) of their life that it is a pilgrimage (Genesis 47:9), a wandering in a foreign land, make it plain that it is a fatherland, a true home, they are seeking, and not the home they have left in the country of Terah, or elsewhere.
