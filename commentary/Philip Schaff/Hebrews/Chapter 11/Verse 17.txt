The writer now returns to particular instances, in order to illustrate not the final results, but the power and heroic deeds of the faith which was thus honoured. <strong> By faith Abraham being tried </strong> (his trials were long continued), <strong> hath offered up </strong> (the purpose of his heart was complete, and has abiding results) <strong> Isaac; and </strong> (intensive nor only Abraham, Isaac, but yea) <strong> he that had gladly received</strong> (literally, accepted, welcomed as with open arms) <strong> the promises was offering up his only-begotten son.</strong> The tense now recalls attention to the literal fact; the work was begun a marvellous act of faith; it was against nature nay, even against what seemed the Divine purpose; for it was through this son the nations were to be blessed.
