Hebrews 11:17. Thus they lived and died. The writer now returns to particular instances, in order to illustrate not the final results, but the power and heroic deeds of the faith which was thus honoured.  By faith Abraham being tried  (his trials were long continued),  hath offered up  (the purpose of his heart was complete, and has abiding results)  Isaac; and  (intensive nor only Abraham, Isaac, but yea)  he that had gladly received (literally, accepted, welcomed as with open arms)  the promises was offering up his only-begotten son. The tense now recalls attention to the literal fact; the work was begun a marvellous act of faith; it was against nature nay, even against what seemed the Divine purpose; for it was through this son the nations were to be blessed.
