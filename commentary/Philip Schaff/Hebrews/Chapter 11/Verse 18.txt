<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:18">Hebrews 11:18</span>. <strong> Even he to whom</strong> (‘whom’ refers in the Greek to Abraham, not to Isaac, and therefore it is ‘to whom,’ not with respect to (of) whom) <strong> it was said, In Isaac</strong> (through and in descent from him) <strong> shall there be named to thee a seed </strong> only his descendants shall be (and shall be known as) Abraham’s seed. To be called, is generally used in Scripture with one of two senses, ‘to have the name,’ or really to be. Sometimes, as here, the two senses are combined.
