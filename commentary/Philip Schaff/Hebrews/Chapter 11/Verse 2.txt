In just such and no other </strong> faith all the heroes of the older economy were testified of, and <strong> obtained a</strong> [good] <strong> report </strong> became, through their stedfastness and amid inferior means of grace, examples to the younger generation, ourselves (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:40">Hebrews 11:40</span>). The forms of expression used to describe a life of faith are all instructive. Here it is ‘in it,’ as the region or state in which the good report and testimony was gained; later it is ‘by it’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:3-5">Hebrews 11:3-5</span>, etc.); ‘through it,’ as the instrument calling attention not to ‘it,’ but to some living force which is behind it (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:33">Hebrews 11:33</span>); ‘in accordance with it,’ <em> i.e </em> in such a way as faith requires or prompts (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:7">Hebrews 11:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>). All those phrases are common in Paul’s writings ‘out of faith’ <em> i.e </em> having its origin in faith, another of Paul’s expressions, is also found (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:38">Hebrews 10:38</span>).
