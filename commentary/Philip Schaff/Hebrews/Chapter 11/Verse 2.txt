Hebrews 11:2.  For in it. In just such and no other  faith all the heroes of the older economy were testified of, and  obtained a [good]  report  became, through their stedfastness and amid inferior means of grace, examples to the younger generation, ourselves (see Hebrews 11:40). The forms of expression used to describe a life of faith are all instructive. Here it is ‘in it,’ as the region or state in which the good report and testimony was gained; later it is ‘by it’ (Hebrews 11:3-5, etc.); ‘through it,’ as the instrument calling attention not to ‘it,’ but to some living force which is behind it (Hebrews 11:33); ‘in accordance with it,’  i.e  in such a way as faith requires or prompts (Hebrews 11:7; Hebrews 11:13). All those phrases are common in Paul’s writings ‘out of faith’  i.e  having its origin in faith, another of Paul’s expressions, is also found (chap. Hebrews 10:38).
