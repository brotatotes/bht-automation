Hebrews 11:20. Nor is faith restricted to trial; it realizes blessing also.  By faith Isaac blessed  Jacob (the heir of the greater promise)  and Esau too (the two articles of the original call attention to distinct acts)  even concerning things to come  the act of faith and of prophetic faith. The blessing and the prayer of faith, proceeding as they do from a mind instructed by the Divine mind, and from a will in harmony with the Divine will, bind even God, and control the future destinies of him on whose behalf they are offered.
