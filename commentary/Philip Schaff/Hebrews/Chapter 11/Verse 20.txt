Nor is faith restricted to trial; it realizes blessing also. <strong> By faith Isaac blessed</strong> <strong> Jacob</strong> (the heir of the greater promise) <strong> and Esau too</strong> (the two articles of the original call attention to distinct acts) <strong> even concerning things to come </strong> the act of faith and of prophetic faith. The blessing and the prayer of faith, proceeding as they do from a mind instructed by the Divine mind, and from a will in harmony with the Divine will, bind even God, and control the future destinies of him on whose behalf they are offered.
