<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:21">Hebrews 11:21</span>. <strong> By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph.</strong> The dying acts of the two patriarchs are connected together as worshippers (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+47:31">Genesis 47:31</span>).

<p><strong> He worshipped on the top of his staff.</strong> The history explains this allusion. Jacob had arranged with his son for his own burial in the distant land of Canaan (itself an act of faith), recognising in Canaan the future home of his posterity. When Joseph had given the promise, Jacob showed the energy of his faith by the energy of his thankfulness. Though dying, he rose in his bed, leaned on his staff (the staff, perhaps, of which he spoke long before, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+32:10">Genesis 32:10</span>), and bowed in worship (this is the meaning of the Hebrew, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:2">Genesis 48:2</span>) to the God who had now fulfilled all his desires. The same word (written ‘staff’) means, with other vowel pointing, ‘bed;’ and, as the older Hebrew text had no vowel points, the Septuagint has one rendering and the English version of the Old Testament another. The writer adopts the version of the Septuagint. If the English version be retained, it means that he worshipped, leaning on (with his face towards) the bed. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+38:2">Isaiah 38:2</span>.)
