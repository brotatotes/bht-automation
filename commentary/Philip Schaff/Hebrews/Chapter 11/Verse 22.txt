Hebrews 11:22. This dying act of Jacobâ€™s recalls the like faith of Joseph.  By faith Joseph, when drawing to his end, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and made his brethren swear that his bones should rest in the land of promise; an expression at once of his faith and of his love for those who were the heirs of that promise. Centuries later Moses carried his bones out of Egypt (Exodus 13:19), and the burial of them in Shechem is recorded in the closing verses of the Book of Joshua. All this had deeper meaning. He would be buried where they were buried, because is God was their God.
