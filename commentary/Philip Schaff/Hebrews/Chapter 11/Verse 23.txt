<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:23">Hebrews 11:23</span>. Thus far the writer has been dealing with examples of faith in Genesis alone. The examples are few compared with all recorded in that book, but they are very striking and noble. The history and character of Moses naturally occupy a chief place in the following verses. From the first he was a child of faith. His parents hid him three months, noting his comeliness (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:20">Acts 7:20</span>), and hoping apparently that God might use him as He had used Joseph, to be the deliverer of their people. They therefore disregarded the kingâ€™s ordinance, and did their duty, looking for Divine succour.
