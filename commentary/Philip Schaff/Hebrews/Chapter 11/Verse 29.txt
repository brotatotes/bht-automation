That awful night is followed by a glorious deliverance. <strong> By faith they passed through</strong> (the verb is used of crossing in any way) <strong> the Red Sea.</strong> God by a strong east wind made a passage through the water, and in faith the Israelites entered <strong> as by dry land,</strong> assured of their safety. The Egyptians tried (either the sea or the seemingly dry land) as an uncertain experiment, and were swallowed up.
