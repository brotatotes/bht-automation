Hebrews 11:29. That awful night is followed by a glorious deliverance.  By faith they passed through (the verb is used of crossing in any way)  the Red Sea. God by a strong east wind made a passage through the water, and in faith the Israelites entered  as by dry land, assured of their safety. The Egyptians tried (either the sea or the seemingly dry land) as an uncertain experiment, and were swallowed up.
