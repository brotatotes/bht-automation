<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:32">Hebrews 11:32</span>. <strong> What shall I say more? for time will fail,</strong> etc. The groups named in this verse are really two; and though there are various readings as to the connecting particles, they necessitate no change. The chronological order of the names would be, Barak, Gideon, Jephthah, Samson; Samuel, David. Samuel is probably put last to connect his name with the prophets, to which class he belongs (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:23">Acts 3:23</span>); and Gideon and Samson are probably put before Barak and Jephthah respectively, because they are of greater celebrity as men of faith. The characteristic exploits of each will be found in the passages named in the margin.
