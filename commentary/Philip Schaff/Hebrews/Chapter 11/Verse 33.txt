Hebrews 11:33.  Who through faith.

Through faith (not ‘in’ or ‘according to’), the expression for the last time in this chapter, and specially appropriate as describing the instrument by which those great works were accomplished.

	 Subdued kingdoms  true of all the judges named, as it is of Samuel and David.
	 Wrought righteousness  is specially true of David, the righteous king (2 Samuel 8:15, etc.), and of Samuel, the righteous judge (1 Samuel 12:4).
	 Obtained promises,  i.e  obtained the fulfilment of them, not indeed of the great promise of all (see Hebrews 11:40), but of the lesser promises which God fulfilled to the prophets themselves. Joel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, all saw the partial fulfilment of things they foretold.
	 Stopped the mouths of lions  true in part of Samuel and David, and specially of Daniel, of whom it is said that an angel shut the mouths of the lions, because he believed in his God (Daniel 6:22-23).
