Hebrews 11:34.  Quenched the power of fire (not the fire, which still burnt, but the power of it); true of Shadrach and his companions.
	 Escaped the edge of the sword, as in the case of Elijah (1 Kings 19:1, etc.), Elisha (2 Kings 6:14, etc.), Jeremiah (Jeremiah 36:26, etc.).
	 Out of weakness were made strong, as in the case of Samson (Judges 16:28, etc.), and David, whose most plaintive Psalms end often in thanksgiving.
	 Waxed  (became)  mighty in war  true of many heroic men under the judges and during the monarchy.
	 Turned to flight the armies of the aliens  a word used in the Septuagint of the Gentiles true of Gideon and the Midianites, and of Jonathan and the Philistines. It is probable, however, that these last clauses, without excluding those older deeds of faith, refer mainly to the later history of Israel after the close of the Old Testament canon. They find a striking fulfilment in the Maccabaean age. It is certain that some of the sufferings spoken of in the next group of verses are found only in that age; and the expressions of Hebrews 11:34 seem taken from the First Book of the Maccabees (compare Malachi 3:3; Malachi 3:3; 1Ma 1:38 ; Malachi 2:7; Malachi 2:7, etc.). No doubt the faith of these later heroes was sometimes of a lower type, rather patriotic than theocratic, the result of a noble enthusiasm as much as of trust in the living God; but in other cases it was true and Divine; while the struggles between the holy and atheistic nations, which the book describes, seem referred to in the Book of Daniel as of the deepest interest.
