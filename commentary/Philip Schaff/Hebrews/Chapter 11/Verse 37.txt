<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:37">Hebrews 11:37</span>. <strong> They were stoned,</strong> as was Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, the last martyr mentioned in the Old Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:20-22">2 Chronicles 24:20-22</span>), as Abel was the first Jeremiah is also said to have been stoned to death at Tahpanhes (Daphne) in Egypt.

<p><strong> They were sawn asunder</strong>, as was Isaiah by Manasseh.

<p><strong> They were tempted.</strong> This word reads feeble, standing as it does in the midst of three descriptions of violent death. A similar word means, ‘they were burnt;’ another, ‘they were mutilated;’ and there is evidence, though not preponderating, for the omission of it altogether. If it is genuine, ‘they were experimented upon’ is a possible rendering, and makes a fairly consistent sense. As it is now rendered, it means that in addition to a cruel death they were, all through, offered relief if they would only abandon their faith.

<p><strong> They were slain with the sword </strong> (literally, they died by the murder of the sword) true of Urijah in Judah (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jer+26:23">Jeremiah 26:23</span>), and quite common in Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:10">1 Kings 19:10</span>, etc.).
	</p>
<p><strong> They went about. </strong> The writer now returns from the various kinds of death they suffered to their lifelong conflicts they were wanderers, destitute, <strong> </strong> oppressed, evil entreated.
