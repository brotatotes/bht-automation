<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:39">Hebrews 11:39</span>. The <strong> </strong> Bible is largely a history of faith, its deeds and sufferings and rewards; pre-eminently of the patience and perseverance which belong to it, and which seem essential in a world where virtue is militant. <strong> These all having had witness borne to them through their faith, </strong> <em> i.e </em> though they had all this noble attestation, had still to wait for the fulfilment of the promise the promise of final and complete salvation (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span>).

<p><strong> God having provided, </strong> or rather, having looked forward to, <strong> some better thing </strong> that salvation which the Lord has accomplished and made known, which God reserved for our economy, and which Old Testament saints receive only when we receive it too. Our <strong> </strong> economy completes the former. To give up the Gospel and go back to the Law is to return from what is perfect to what is preparatory; and to sever ourselves from the blessedness for which the patriarchs died.
