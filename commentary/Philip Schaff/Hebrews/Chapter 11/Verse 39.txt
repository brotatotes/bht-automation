Hebrews 11:39. The   Bible is largely a history of faith, its deeds and sufferings and rewards; pre-eminently of the patience and perseverance which belong to it, and which seem essential in a world where virtue is militant.  These all having had witness borne to them through their faith,   i.e  though they had all this noble attestation, had still to wait for the fulfilment of the promise the promise of final and complete salvation (chap. Hebrews 9:15).
	 God having provided,  or rather, having looked forward to,  some better thing  that salvation which the Lord has accomplished and made known, which God reserved for our economy, and which Old Testament saints receive only when we receive it too. Our   economy completes the former. To give up the Gospel and go back to the Law is to return from what is perfect to what is preparatory; and to sever ourselves from the blessedness for which the patriarchs died.
