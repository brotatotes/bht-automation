<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:8">Hebrews 11:8</span>. <strong> By faith Abraham, when being called </strong> the reading, <em> he who is called</em>, has less authority than the common text, though it makes a good sense ‘he who is called the father of nations’ <strong> obeyed and went</strong>; his confidence showing itself in this way.

<p><strong> And he went out, not knowing whither </strong> (where) <strong> he was going.</strong> When Abraham left Chaldea he had no promise; that was given afterwards in Canaan (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:7">Genesis 12:7</span>). In Noah faith showed its power by the feeling it produced; in Abraham by obedience. It works, if it be true, now through feeling, fear, love; and now in an obedient life.
