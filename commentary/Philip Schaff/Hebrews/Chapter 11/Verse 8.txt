Hebrews 11:8.  By faith Abraham, when being called  the reading,  he who is called, has less authority than the common text, though it makes a good sense ‘he who is called the father of nations’  obeyed and went; his confidence showing itself in this way.
	 And he went out, not knowing whither  (where)  he was going. When Abraham left Chaldea he had no promise; that was given afterwards in Canaan (Genesis 12:7). In Noah faith showed its power by the feeling it produced; in Abraham by obedience. It works, if it be true, now through feeling, fear, love; and now in an obedient life.
