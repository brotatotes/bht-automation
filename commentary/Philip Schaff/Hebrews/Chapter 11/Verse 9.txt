By faith he received the promise, and still waited for the fulfilment of it. <strong> By faith he sojourned</strong> (a temporary resident only) <strong> in the land of promise</strong> (which God had given him) as (if it were) <strong> another’s </strong> (and not his own), <strong> having his home in tents </strong> tents without foundation pitched today, struck tomorrow. His whole life, therefore, was a life of promise unfulfilled, and so of patient waiting for God’s time and at God’s disposal.
