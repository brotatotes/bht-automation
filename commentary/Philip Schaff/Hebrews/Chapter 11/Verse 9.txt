Hebrews 11:9. By faith he received the promise, and still waited for the fulfilment of it.  By faith he sojourned (a temporary resident only)  in the land of promise (which God had given him) as (if it were)  another’s  (and not his own),  having his home in tents  tents without foundation pitched today, struck tomorrow. His whole life, therefore, was a life of promise unfulfilled, and so of patient waiting for God’s time and at God’s disposal.
