Hebrews 11:13-16. The one attribute of the faith of all these men is that it continued till death.  In faith (rather, consistently with it, still looking forward to a glorious future as yet unrealized).
	 These all (from Abraham downwards, as is clear from Hebrews 11:15)  died as not having received the promises (often repeated, and containing blessings of many kinds hence the plural; the promises which they did not receive are the ‘things promised,’ as in chap. Hebrews 9:15 and Acts 1:4), but  as having seen them from afar, and greeted  (or saluted)  them, and having confessed, as Abraham did, and Jacob (see references). They saw their home all through their lives; and even when they were dying they saw their homes from afar, and greeted them ‘though distant still.’
