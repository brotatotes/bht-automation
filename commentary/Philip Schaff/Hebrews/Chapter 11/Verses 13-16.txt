<p><strong> These all</strong> (from Abraham downwards, as is clear from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:15">Hebrews 11:15</span>) <strong> died as not having received the promises</strong> (often repeated, and containing blessings of many kinds hence the plural; the promises which they did not receive are the ‘things promised,’ as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:4">Acts 1:4</span>), but <strong> as having seen them from afar, and greeted </strong> (or saluted) <strong> them, and having confessed</strong>, as Abraham did, and Jacob (see references).
