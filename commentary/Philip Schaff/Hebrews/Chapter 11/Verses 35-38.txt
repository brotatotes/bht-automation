Hebrews 11:35-38. What faith has done we have seen; what it helps men to suffer is now told us.  Women received  (back)  their dead raised to life again (literally, by a resurrection, which is regarded as the cause or origin of their so receiving them), true of the widow of Sarepta and of the Shunamite.

The word here used (a wheel or drum-head on which the victim was stretched and beaten to death) shows that the reference is to Eleazar ( 2Ma 6:18-31 ), and the heroic mother and her seven sons mentioned in chap. 7. Fuller details of the same martyrdom are given in the so-called Fourth Book of Maccabees, sometimes, though erroneously, ascribed to Josephus.
