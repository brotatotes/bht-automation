Hebrews 12:14.  Follow peace with all (believers, the true parallel being Romans 14:19),  and holiness  (the appropriation by us of the Divine holiness of Hebrews 12:10; there it is the Divine attribute, here it is the process whereby the quality is made our own);  without which  (apart from which)  no man shall see the Lord  shall not enter His presence, and share His blessedness. The reference is to God the Father. Only the holy rise to the sight of Him. The word ‘Lord’ is applied to Christ in chap. Hebrews 2:3, and to God in chap. Hebrews 8:2. When, however, Scripture speaks of seeing as a future reward, it is seeing God that is meant (Matthew 5:8; 1 John 3:2); and yet as the throne of God is also the throne of the Lamb, to see one is really to see both.
