Hebrews 12:25.  See that ye refuse  decline  not  (the same word as in Hebrews 12:19)  him that speaketh  (offering peace through the blood of Christ: see Hebrews 12:24):  for if they escaped not, declining as they did to hear him that spoke on earth  a different word, meaning to speak as an oracle with Divine authority. God is the speaker in both cases; but the contrast is between God speaking on earth and through Moses who received the living oracles to give to men, and God speaking from heaven and in the life and blood of His Son not concerning an earthly covenant with earthly blessings, but concerning blessings that are spiritual and eternal. The medium (the Son), the place, the blessedness of the message, all combine to make the guilt of rejecting the Gospel the greater (see Hebrews 12:1-5, and Hebrews 10:28-29).
