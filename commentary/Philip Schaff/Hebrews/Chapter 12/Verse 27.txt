Hebrews 12:27.  And this word yet once more  once for all, as it means, shows plainly that there is to be one change only from the time when the prophet spoke, and consequently that the things which are introduced by that change are to remain unshaken. The shaking of the ‘heavenly things’ has created some difficulty. But, in fact, the new covenant affected both earth and heaven. The Word made flesh, the complete forgiveness of sin, eternal life through the blood of Christ, the introduction of sinners of all nations into the Church of God, the changing of the Church itself from an earthly into a spiritual fellowship, Christ exalted as Priest and King: these are changes that affect both worlds, but cannot themselves be changed. The shaking, therefore, here spoken of is not  now  future, as some suppose. It began at the incarnation (and so the ‘I will shake’ of the prophecy is here changed into ‘I am shaking’), and it is only the complete realization of it that is still to come. The last clause,  as of things that have been made,  etc., refers probably not to creation but to the Jewish economy, to which the word ‘made’ has been already applied; and their removal is with the view to the permanence of the spiritual economy which is ‘to abide.’
