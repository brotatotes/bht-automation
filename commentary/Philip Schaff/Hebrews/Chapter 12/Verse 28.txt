<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:28">Hebrews 12:28</span>. <strong> Wherefore, we receiving as we do a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful </strong> (or have grace), <strong> and thereby serve God acceptably </strong> (well-pleasingly) <strong> with godly reverence and fear. </strong> Thankfulness, not discontent, is the becoming feeling, and when blended with fear (‘awe’) will make our service reverent and joyous. The Greek phrase <strong> </strong> favours this rendering (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:3">2 Timothy 1:3</span>, Gr.). ‘Let us <strong> </strong> have grace’ is, however, a possible meaning.
