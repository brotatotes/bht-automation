Hebrews 12:28.  Wherefore, we receiving as we do a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful  (or have grace),  and thereby serve God acceptably  (well-pleasingly)  with godly reverence and fear.  Thankfulness, not discontent, is the becoming feeling, and when blended with fear (‘awe’) will make our service reverent and joyous. The Greek phrase   favours this rendering (see 2 Timothy 1:3, Gr.). ‘Let us   have grace’ is, however, a possible meaning.
