<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:29">Hebrews 12:29</span>. <strong> For </strong> a <strong> </strong> fresh reason for the reverence <strong> and the service our God is a consuming fire. </strong> The description is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+4:22">Deuteronomy 4:22</span>, and the meaning may be, Our God also (as well as the God of the Jews) is a consuming fire; but the former rendering an additional reason simply without specific reference to a distinction between our God and theirs, is the juster view. A devout sense of what we owe to God is a strong motive to holy service: so also is our reverence for Godâ€™s holiness and justice. Thankfulness and fear are both among the motive forces of the Gospel, and both are stimulated by the character and acts (mercies and judgments alike) of the blessed God.
