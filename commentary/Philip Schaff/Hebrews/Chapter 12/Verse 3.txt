Hebrews 12:3.  For  (He suffered as well as you, therefore you may well)  consider  (properly, compare His case with your own, and gather the lessons)  him who hath endured  (it is His permanent character that is described)  such contradiction  (not in words only, but hostility of every kind, even treason (John 19:12))  of sinners against themselves  (  i.e   of those who, in thus acting, sinned  against their own souls)  ,  the other reading, ‘against Himself,’ has also good authority; ‘themselves’ suggests a fresh reason why the Hebrew Christians should not join ‘a gainsaying people’ by rejecting the Gospel.
	 Lest ye grow weary and faint in your souls.  Still the athlete’s figure. As the limbs grow faint (loose) in the race, so the soul in the Christian conflict. Principle is strengthened by thoughtfulness; for want of consideration Israel perished, as well as from want of knowledge.
