<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:5">Hebrews 12:5</span>. <strong> And ye have quite forgotten </strong> (not a question, as Calvin, and Delitzsch, and others have suggested; the fact is rather assumed in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:7-11">Hebrews 12:7-11</span>; and a question,; after the strong assertion of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:4">Hebrews 12:4</span>, is unnatural); <strong> the exhortation</strong> (blended exhortation and comfort or consolation, which is the more common rendering: see an instance in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:31">Acts 15:31</span>), <strong> which reasons with you, </strong> etc. (both words, ‘consolation’ and ‘reasons,’ are favourite ones in describing Paul’s method of teaching, consisting as it did of argument and appeal, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:2-17">Acts 17:2-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:4">Acts 18:4</span>, etc.). The quotation is from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:11-12">Proverbs 3:11-12</span>; and as wisdom speaks there as a person, so here the exhortation she gives is spoken of as a person addressing tender, motherly appeals to all who suffer. . . . <strong> Nor faint when corrected by him. </strong> The rendering of the Greek is here adopted; the Hebrew means, to resent or to murmur against. Despondency and resentment imply the same unbelief of the loving purpose of the discipline, and they express themselves in the same outward form of complaint
