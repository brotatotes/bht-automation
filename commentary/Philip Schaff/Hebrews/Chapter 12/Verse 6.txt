Hebrews 12:6.  Whom he receiveth,  i.e.  whom He takes to His heart as His son. The quotation is from the Septuagint of Proverbs 3:12. The Hebrew may be rendered as in the English version (‘even as a father’), or, by an alteration of the vowel points, as here, ‘and scourges.’ All suffering inflicted by God upon His children, or permitted, is a proof of love, and forms in itself or in its results part of the evidence of their sonship.
