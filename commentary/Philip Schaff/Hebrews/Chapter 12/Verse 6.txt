<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:6">Hebrews 12:6</span>. <strong> Whom he receiveth,</strong> <em> i.e. </em> whom He takes to His heart as His son. The quotation is from the Septuagint of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:12">Proverbs 3:12</span>. The Hebrew may be rendered as in the English version (‘even as a father’), or, by an alteration of the vowel points, as here, ‘and scourges.’ All suffering inflicted by God upon His children, or permitted, is a proof of love, and forms in itself or in its results part of the evidence of their sonship.
