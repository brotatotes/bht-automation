<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:7">Hebrews 12:7</span>. <strong> It is for chastening</strong> (for filial chastening) <strong> ye endure; as with sons God deals with you</strong> (bears Himself towards you). The reading, ‘It is for chastening for improvement as sons ye endure,’ has decisive support. It differs from the common text only by the addition of a single letter ( <em> us </em> for <em> u</em>); and the use of the expression ‘for’ is quite common in this Epistle (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:16">Hebrews 6:16</span>).

<p><strong> For what son is he</strong> (not ‘who is a son,’ or ‘what sort of a son is he,’ though each is a possible meaning) <strong> whom a father</strong> (or his father the statement is quite general, and does not refer primarily to God) <strong> chastises not?</strong> Correction and chastening while character is forming is the condition of all sonship and of all true fatherhood, and our sonship in relation to God is no exception to the common law.
