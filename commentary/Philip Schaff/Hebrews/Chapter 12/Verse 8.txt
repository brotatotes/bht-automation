Hebrews 12:8.  If ye be without (be severed from, have no part in)  chastisement (filial discipline),  of which all (Godâ€™s sons, or better, because of the tense, the sons mentioned in chap. 11)  have become partakers (or have had their share),  then are ye bastards (of spurious parentage)  and not sons.
