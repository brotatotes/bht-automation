Further exhortations. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:12">Hebrews 12:12</span>. <strong> Wherefore</strong> (connecting the practical appeals, as is usual in this Epistle, with the reasoning and imagery of the previous verses) <strong> lift up</strong> (make straight) <strong> the hands that hang down, and the weak</strong> (the loose or the palsied) <strong> knees</strong>. The figure of a race is still preserved, and perhaps of a fight also; the last requiring the strong hands, and the first firm knees; or perhaps the drooping hands and the palsied knees denote simply the complete collapse which threatened the Hebrew Christians in the race set before them.

<p><strong> And make straight</strong> (or level) <strong> paths for your feet</strong> (the same verb as above), <strong> that that which is lame,</strong> that part of the Church which is stumbling between Christianity and Judaism, may walk in plain, beaten tracks, and so <strong> be kept from turning aside.</strong> Some interpret ‘that that which is lame may not be put out of joint’ a possible meaning of the verb. It is used, however, in the New Testament only in the pastoral Epistles, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:6">1 Timothy 1:6</span>; 1Ti 5:15 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:20">1 Timothy 6:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:4">2 Timothy 4:4</span>, and has always the sense given to it above. Who can estimate the power of a few courageous, consistent men in any struggle, and not least in Christian churches!

<p><strong> Nay, rather </strong> than let it suffer further infirmity, as it is needlessly doing, <strong> let it be healed.
	</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile here, as in the Church at Rome, the weak, the lame, are to be treated with great forbearance, and peace is to be carefully cultivated, not division.
