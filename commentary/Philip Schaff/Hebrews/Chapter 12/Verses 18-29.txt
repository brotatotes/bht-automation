Hebrews 12:18-29. All these warnings become the more impressive from the fact that our economy is one of much greater privilege than the previous, and that it is the last revelation which God will give.
	 For ye have not drawn near to a mountain that is touched  (a material, tangible mountain)  and that burned with fire and blackness (of clouds)  and darkness  (as in the night)  and tempest.  At the giving of the Law the top of the mountain burned with fire; lower down were black, impenetrable clouds, and out of the darkness which they caused came the mutterings of the storm. Amid this terror was heard the sound of a trumpet, and an articulate voice giving the commandments which were delivered to Israel; which voice was so awful that those who heard implored to be excused, begged off from hearing (declined to hear) more. The same word is found in the parable, ‘They began to make excuse.’
	 For (a parenthetical explanation of their awe)  they could not bear what was commanded,  viz.   And if even a beast (much more a man)  touch the mountain . . .
