The fatherhoods differ, and so the rule and purpose of their discipline differ also. <strong> Furthermore, we once had fathers of our flesh </strong> (our natural parents, and probably rather more those who were mediately the originators of our flesh), <strong> as chasteners</strong> (correctors), <strong> and we gave them reverence; shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? </strong> The contrast here is between earthly fathers, men who being flesh themselves are in a sense the creators of our flesh, and God, Himself a Spirit, and the immediate Creator of spirits. Other interpretations have been discussed in both ancient and modern times ‘The Father of our spirits, <em> i.e </em> of human souls;’ ‘the Father or Originator of all spiritual life.’ Others think the reference is not to the origination of our nature at all, but only to parental feeling ‘We have had those who, in relation to our fleshly nature, have shown a father’s care; shall we not much rather submit ourselves to Him who, in relation to our spiritual nature and life, has a father’s rights, and shows a father’s kindness?’ The ethical meaning implied in this last interpretation is implied more or less in all the others. This last suggestion will bear further illustration. The earthly discipline of nearly all nations, their Paideutics, was physical, and found its best results in physical beauty, with Apollo as its ideal, or in manly strength, with Hercules as its ideal; when it went further, and cultivated wisdom, as in Greece, or patriotism, as at Rome, or the commoner virtues, as in the model Republics of ancient or even of modern writers; it was still fleshly and secular. The Paideutique that sanctifies our higher nature is peculiar to Divine revelation, and is perfected only under the personal superintendence of the Father of spirits. The recognition of His rights, and the acceptance of His discipline, and the laying hold of His strength, are essential to it.
