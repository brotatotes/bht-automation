<p>CHAP. 13. The exhortations with which the Epistle closes are various; but all are connected with the argument and with the condition of those addressed. The writer has sought to confirm their faith and grace, and now a loving holy life, which ever grows feeble with waning faith, is his chief concern. To their faith he has exhorted them to add godliness (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:28-29">Hebrews 12:28-29</span>), and now they are to add to godliness brotherly kindness and universal love. It is characteristic of the Epistle, too, that the graces commended in the earlier verses of this chapter are those for which the readers are commended in previous chapters (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:33-34">Hebrews 10:33-34</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:10">Hebrews 6:10</span>).
