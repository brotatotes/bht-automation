<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:13">Hebrews 13:13</span>. Of Christ the sin-offering we may partake, provided we go forth unto Him without the camp, bearing His reproach. The cross is the <strong> </strong> meeting-place of all who would be saved. To number ourselves with those who cast Him out, and so unconsciously made Him the antitype of the holiest of <strong> </strong> the <strong> </strong> ancient sacrifices, is to be undone. We must abandon the Law, we must find in Christ Himself the sin-offering in which we are to share, if we desire to partake of the forgiveness and holiness of the Gospel.
