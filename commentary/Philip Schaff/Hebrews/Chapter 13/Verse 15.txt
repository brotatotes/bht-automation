Hebrews 13:15. Meanwhile our sacrifice or peace-offering is praise; ‘the perpetual offering,’ as even Jews described it, ‘which is never to cease’ the fruit, ‘the calves,’ of lips that are ever giving thanks to His name. Praise, continuous praise, is the fitting recognition of an abiding Saviour and an unending salvation.
