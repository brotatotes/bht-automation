Hebrews 13:16. Nor is that all: there must be also the further sacrifice of a beneficent and generous life; for with such sacrifices ‘well-doing’ and fellowship in love, in service, and in gifts God is well pleased. A life of cheerful thankfulness, of ceaseless well-doing, of ready participation with others in the gifts God has entrusted to us these are the offerings of the Gospel; the one great sin-offering of our Lord possessing ceaseless power.
