He now returns to their leaders. <strong> Obey </strong> (give, and keep giving, the obedience which springs from trust in them, and from the persuasion that their rule is right) <strong> your leaders, and submit yourselves </strong> (to their reproof and admonition, even to their authority); and this rule he enforces by a delicate reference to the leaders’ responsibility; <strong> for </strong> it is their duty and their right to watch over and in the interest of your souls, free alike from indolence and from false security, <strong> as having to give account, that they may do this work </strong> (of watching) <strong> with joy, and not mourning </strong> (literally ‘groaning ‘) over it or you; <strong> for, </strong> if it is a grief to them, the loss will be yours; <strong> that is unprofitable for you.
