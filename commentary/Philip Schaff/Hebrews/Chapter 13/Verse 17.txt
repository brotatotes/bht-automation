Hebrews 13:17, etc. Having referred to deceased leaden and to   their stedfastness, the writer is naturally led to speak of the danger of apostatizing to Judaism; he therefore exhorts them  to  come completely out of it and boldly follow Christ. He now returns to their leaders.  Obey  (give, and keep giving, the obedience which springs from trust in them, and from the persuasion that their rule is right)  your leaders, and submit yourselves  (to their reproof and admonition, even to their authority); and this rule he enforces by a delicate reference to the leaders’ responsibility;  for  it is their duty and their right to watch over and in the interest of your souls, free alike from indolence and from false security,  as having to give account, that they may do this work  (of watching)  with joy, and not mourning  (literally ‘groaning ‘) over it or you;  for,  if it is a grief to them, the loss will be yours;  that is unprofitable for you.
