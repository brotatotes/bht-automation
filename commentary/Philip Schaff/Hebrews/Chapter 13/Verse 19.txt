Hebrews 13:19.  And I beseech you the more exceedingly  (earnestly)  to do this,  i.e   to pray for us (comp. Philemon 1:22),  that I may be restored to you the sooner.  This language agrees remarkably with the deep affection Paul cherished for the Hebrew Church at Jerusalem, a Church he visited many times.
