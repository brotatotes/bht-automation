Hebrews 13:2. Nor was this love confined to the family. The God they worshipped loves strangers (Deuteronomy 10:18-19). In His gracious philanthropy (Titus 3:4) He had welcomed  them  when strangers; and now He sometimes sends His messengers His angels in the disguise of wayfarers, that He may know whether those who bear His name are like Him in their kindness, and that He may reward them as of old (Genesis 18:0). Hebrews 13:3. Debtors to all the brotherhood, and to others besides, there were some who had strong claims on their sympathy. There were prisoners who were their bonds for Christ’s sake and the Gospel’s; and in loving tenderness these they were to remember as bound with them (Hebrews 10:34). There were others in afflictions natural to men; these also they were to bear ever in mind as being themselves in the body, and subject to like trials. Loving and prayerful remembrance might bring deliverance, and would certainly comfort their hearts and deepen their thankfulness.
