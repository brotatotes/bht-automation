Hebrews 13:22.  Now I exhort you, brethren, bear with (in the sense of giving a patient, willing audience to; see Acts 18:14; 2 Corinthians 11:4)  the word of exhortation. The language is partly apologetic, on the ground that the writer stands in no close relation to his readers, and yet had not spared them in his warnings (cp. 6 and 10). All be had to say, however, is made as brief as possible
	 For (with deeper reasons for such forbearance, there is also the brevity of the letter itself)  I have written a letter (which is implied in the word used)  in few words. This is the first time the writer speaks in the singular number, as it is the first intimation he gives that the treatise is an epistle. A similar close is found in Romans 16:17, and in 1 Corinthians 16:15.
