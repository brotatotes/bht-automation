<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:22">Hebrews 13:22</span>. <strong> Now I exhort you, brethren, bear with</strong> (in the sense of giving a patient, willing audience to; see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:14">Acts 18:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:4">2 Corinthians 11:4</span>) <strong> the word of exhortation.</strong> The language is partly apologetic, on the ground that the writer stands in no close relation to his readers, and yet had not spared them in his warnings (cp. 6 and 10). All be had to say, however, is made as brief as possible

<p><strong> For</strong> (with deeper reasons for such forbearance, there is also the brevity of the letter itself) <strong> I have written a letter</strong> (which is implied in the word used) <strong> in few words.</strong> This is the first time the writer speaks in the singular number, as it is the first intimation he gives that the treatise is an epistle. A similar close is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:17">Romans 16:17</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:15">1 Corinthians 16:15</span>.
