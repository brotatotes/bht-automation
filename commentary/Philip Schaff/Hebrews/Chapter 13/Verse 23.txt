<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:23">Hebrews 13:23</span>. <strong> Know ye</strong> (imperative rather than indicative, as a matter of joy, one of the prisoners whose bonds you shared in spirit is now free) <strong> that our brother Timothy is set at liberty </strong> (the most natural rendering. The word is used for entering on some official work, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:3">Acts 13:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:30">Acts 15:30</span>; but a fuller description would have been necessary if that had been the meaning here); <strong> with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</strong> This language does not prove that Paul wrote the Epistle, but it intimates that the readers knew the writer, and it is certain that no one stood in closer relation to Paul than Timothy, especially towards the close of the apostleâ€™s life (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+2:19">Philippians 2:19</span>).
