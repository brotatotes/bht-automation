Hebrews 13:7. This verse is connected in part with the preceding.  Remember them who are your leaders  a title found only in this chapter in the Epistles, but used in the Gospels and Acts for the leaders of the Church (Acts 15:22; Luke 22:26). Leadership is the prominent thought with so much of ruling as is essential to lead. As applied to ministers, it gives no authority to make new laws in Christ’s kingdom, or even to enforce Christ’s commands by any authority except His own.
	 The which (who have this quality that a word which defines the ground and the limit of their authority)  have spoken to you the word of God  (the Gospel);  whose faith  (not their creed, but their blessed trust in trouble and fidelity to principle)  copy (or imitate),  thoroughly considering what a blessed end their life had.  These words refer not necessarily to martyrdom, of which, as yet, there were but few examples. The meaning is rather, that a course of Christian conduct, which even to the end is the outcome of a holy noble faith, is well worthy of the contemplation and imitation of all who observe it.
