<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:8">Hebrews 13:8</span>. This verse is closely connected with the preceding, though not in the way the Authorised Version (with a colon, or sometimes a comma, at the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7">Hebrews 13:7</span>) indicates, as it is also with what follows. It is a general truth. <strong> Jesus Christ is, the same yesterday </strong> (when our fathers lived and struggled), <strong> today</strong> (now that we live and struggle), <strong> and throughout the ages.</strong> He was the chief theme of the Gospel they preached so ‘the word of God’ generally means in the New Testament. His power and love and grace are all unchanging and exhaustless.
