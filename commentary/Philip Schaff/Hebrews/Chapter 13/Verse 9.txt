Hebrews 13:9. Very different from the  varied  and strange (foreign) doctrines (teachings) with which this Gospel is sometimes confounded, and very different from the  legal precepts  as to meats which are profitless as means of quickened life, or of true salvation, by which we must  not suffer ourselves to be carried away  (the true reading, not ‘carried about’):  For it is a good thing  (a fine thing a thing that has the beauty of virtue as well as the substance of it)  that the heart be established  (be made strong and firm)  with grace  (here opposed as a Divine operation in the soul to the outward and lifeless precepts of Jewish teachers, Colossians 2:22-23) the flesh  profiting nothing  (John 6:63),  wherein those that walked  (a common Pauline expression, Ephesians 2:2-11; Colossians 3:7)  were not profited.  The precepts of a   ritual law have no living power, no saving efficacy. The mind that is occupied with them is generally blind to the great duties of piety and virtue, and is neither peaceful nor strong. The simplicity of Gospel rites is as certainly helpful to holiness as the purity of Gospel truth.
