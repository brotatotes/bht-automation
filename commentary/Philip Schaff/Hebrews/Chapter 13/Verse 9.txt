Very different from the <em> varied </em> and strange (foreign) doctrines (teachings) with which this Gospel is sometimes confounded, and very different from the <em> legal precepts </em> as to meats which are profitless as means of quickened life, or of true salvation, by which we must <strong> not suffer ourselves to be carried away </strong> (the true reading, not ‘carried about’): <strong> For it is a good thing </strong> (a fine thing a thing that has the beauty of virtue as well as the substance of it) <strong> that the heart be established </strong> (be made strong and firm) <strong> with grace </strong> (here opposed as a Divine operation in the soul to the outward and lifeless precepts of Jewish teachers, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:22-23">Colossians 2:22-23</span>) the flesh <strong> profiting nothing </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:63">John 6:63</span>), <strong> wherein those that walked </strong> (a common Pauline expression, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2-11">Ephesians 2:2-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:7">Colossians 3:7</span>) <strong> were not profited. </strong> The precepts of a <strong> </strong> ritual law have no living power, no saving efficacy. The mind that is occupied with them is generally blind to the great duties of piety and virtue, and is neither peaceful nor strong. The simplicity of Gospel rites is as certainly helpful to holiness as the purity of Gospel truth.
