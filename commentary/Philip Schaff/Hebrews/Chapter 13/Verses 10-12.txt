Hebrews 13:10-12. And yet we have our altar and our meat. We are worshippers, nay, even  priestly  worshippers. Our altar is the cross: our sin-offering the body of our Lord. ‘His flesh is meat indeed, and His blood is drink indeed.’ But all is hidden from the view and forbidden to the touch of those who serve the earthly tabernacle. Under the Law, some offerings were shared by the priest and people, and the arrangement implied that fellowship was restored and ceremonial expiation was completed. But the sin-offering of atonement was not eaten (Leviticus 6:30), and the bodies of national and priestly expiations were burnt without the camp. When atonement was a figure only, and not a   reality, the worshipper had no communion with what professed to furnish it.  Now  we discern the  body,  and are partakers of it, and claim the reconciliation which the partaking implies. The old altar must be renounced, and the old sacrifice abandoned. Men must go to the place where Christ was offered (cp. Hebrews 9:28), the place where Christ offered Himself (Hebrews 9:25), and those who seek acceptance through legal sacrifices have no part in Him, as they had no part in that sacrifice, which was the completest type of His work, yet was itself powerless to make full atonement, and therefore insufficient to secure the reconciliation and the strength of which the eating of the altar was the sign.
