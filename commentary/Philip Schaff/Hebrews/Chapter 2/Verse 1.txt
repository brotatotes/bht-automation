<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:1">Hebrews 2:1</span>. <strong> We have heard</strong>, rather ‘[the things] heard,’ an expression less definite, and intended to include all that was spoken by our Lord and by His servants, whatever was heard by them and reported to us, or directly by ourselves. The dignity of the messenger adds greatly to the responsibility of those who hear the message (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:6">Mark 12:6</span>).

<p><strong> Lest haply, possibly, we drift away from them</strong>. The A. V. (‘let them slip’) is, in a general sense, accurate; but it fails to represent the figure, and conceals part of the lesson. It is not the truths of the Gospel that slip away, but we who slip or ‘fleten’ past them, as Wycliffe expressed it. The word well describes the subtle power of temptation. We have simply to do nothing, and we shall be carried along to our ruin. To fall away requires no effort. To stand firm, to hold stedfast, is the difficulty.
