Hebrews 2:13.  I will put my trust in him. Christ’s oneness with us is not only proved by the fact that we have one Father and are brothers, all ‘partakers of a Divine nature,’ but by the further fact that we have the same trials and struggles, and faith the principle of our spiritual life. The brotherhood, moreover, that begins on His part with His incarnation and sufferings (Hebrews 2:12; see Psalms 22:0) continues till His work is complete, and all the children, Himself and we, are presented perfect before God (Hebrews 2:13; see Isaiah 8:18).
