<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>. <strong> He himself likewise</strong>. The Greek word here is not easily rendered. It implies great likeness without absolute identity; very closely like, and absolutely like so far as flesh and blood are concerned. He partook <em> in the main </em> of our nature. His was an actual incarnation Jesus Christ in the flesh (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:2">1 John 4:2</span>), but with the difference which His personal sinlessness implied. The word rebukes the Doketism (the mere <em> appearance </em> of a human nature) of the early heresies, the mythical dreams of Strauss and other modern inquirers, but without admitting that He was in every respect as man is, still less that He was only man.
