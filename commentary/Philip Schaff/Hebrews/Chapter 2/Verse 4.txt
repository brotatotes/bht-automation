<p><strong> With signs, wonders, and miracles. </strong> This is the threefold division of the miraculous acts which prove the superhuman mission of those who work them. As ‘miracles’ ( δυνάμεις ), <em> </em> they display Divine power; as ‘wonders,’ they excite surprise; as ‘signs’ (St. John’s usual word), they supply evidence which remains after the sensuous excitement of miraculous power has passed away evidence which is the usual proof and accompaniment of a divine revelation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:12">2 Corinthians 12:12</span>).

<p><strong> The gifts of</strong> <strong> the Holy Ghost </strong> are illustrated in their diversity (to one man one gift; to another, another) in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4-11">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</span>, God Himself distributing them (as in First Corinthians it is the Holy Ghost who is said to distribute them) according to His own will.
