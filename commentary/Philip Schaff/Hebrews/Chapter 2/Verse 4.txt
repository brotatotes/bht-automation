Hebrews 2:4.  God also bearing them witness,   i.e  God bearing witness with them to the Gospel they preached, confirming their word by the signs that followed (Mark 16:20).
	 With signs, wonders, and miracles.  This is the threefold division of the miraculous acts which prove the superhuman mission of those who work them. As ‘miracles’ ( δυνάμεις ),   they display Divine power; as ‘wonders,’ they excite surprise; as ‘signs’ (St. John’s usual word), they supply evidence which remains after the sensuous excitement of miraculous power has passed away evidence which is the usual proof and accompaniment of a divine revelation (2 Corinthians 12:12).
	 The gifts of  the Holy Ghost  are illustrated in their diversity (to one man one gift; to another, another) in 1 Corinthians 12:4-11, God Himself distributing them (as in First Corinthians it is the Holy Ghost who is said to distribute them) according to His own will.
