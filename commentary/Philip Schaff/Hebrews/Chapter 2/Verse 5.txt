<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:5">Hebrews 2:5</span>. <strong> For</strong>. This verse introduces a new proof of the superiority of the Gospel; but it is also connected with what precedes. The most natural explanation is to connect the ‘for’ with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>. Angels are not sons: they are ministering spirits appointed only to serve. Not unto angels is the government of men under the Gospel committed. The new dispensation economy, the kingdom of God, the order of things under the Messiah, is committed to man, as was the world of old (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:0">Psalms 8:0</span>); to the model man, however, the ideal man, the second Adam, the Lord from heaven. The name, ‘the world to come’ (see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>), was quite familiar to the Jews, who called their own economy ‘this world,’ and was used after the Jewish economy had practically ceased (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:32">Matthew 12:32</span>), as Christ Himself is called, even after He had come, ‘the Coming One’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:14">Romans 5:14</span>). This world of the future was already introduced; but the description was still appropriate, and is used again in this Epistle (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:10-11">Hebrews 9:10-11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span>), partly because it was the name that described the hope of the Jews, and partly because the temple was still standing. Some regard the name as applying to the new heaven and the new earth, some to the heavenly state itself. It really includes them both, only it is wider, and applies to the whole order of things and to the government of men (see Gr.) under the Messiah. (See chap, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:5">Hebrews 6:5</span>.)
