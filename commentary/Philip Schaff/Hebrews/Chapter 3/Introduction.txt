<p>CHAP. 3. Having set forth the dignity of the person of Christ and the greatness of His condescension in taking our nature, the author exhorts the Hebrews to an earnest consideration (Gr.) of Jesus, the Apostle and Priest of the new economy, whom they, moreover, had accepted as their Apostle and Priest. The grounds of this exhortation are that Christ was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as was Moses, and that He is as superior to Moses as the son is to a servant, as the founder of an economy is to the economy Itself, to which economy we really belong only if we are stedfast and true (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6">Hebrews 3:6</span>).
