Hebrews 3:1.  Holy brethren.  No mere complimentary title, but descriptive of the blessed brotherhood to which Christ and all who believe belong.
	 Partakers of,  partners in a ‘calling’ that comes from heaven and leads to it, besides giving the tastes and spirit appropriate to our destiny (John 3:31; Matthew 3:2; Philippians 3:20), servants, therefore, and workers under a new and divine economy.
	 Christ Jesus. The true reading is  Jesus  simply, with special reference to His human nature and His connection with ourselves (see Hebrews 6:20, Hebrews 7:22, Hebrews 11:4; Exodus 3:10-15). He was  sent  from God, as was Moses, and He was Priest also, with Aaron’s office and dignity a thought expanded later (Hebrews 4:14, Hebrews 10:22). This Apostle and Priest the Hebrews had acknowledged as their own (of our profession, or confession rather), and it became them to be faithful as confessors to Him they had in this double office accepted. It is probable that the expression, ‘Apostle and Priest of our confession,’ means even more than ‘sent by God and accepted by us.’ When the high priest went into the holy place on the day of Atonement, he was called the apostle, the messenger of the nation whom he represented, and for whom as priest he pleaded. So Christ has entered into the holy place as our accepted Messenger and Priest. To reject Him now is a double insult.
