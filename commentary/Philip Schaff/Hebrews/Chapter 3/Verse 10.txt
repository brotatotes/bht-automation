Hebrews 3:10. I  was grieved  is somewhat feeble; displeased, offended, deeply pained, is nearer the thought. The word means properly what is a burden, physical or mental, ‘grieved’ being etymologically good (comp. ‘it lay heavy on Him’). In some forms of the word it means what presses into the flesh and inflicts wounds.
	 That generation  is the common Greek text, and it is the reading of the LXX.
	 This generation  is the reading of the revised text. The Hebrew is simply ‘with the generation.’ The author has no doubt purposely inserted ‘this’ to show that he regards the passage as applying to the Jewish people generally, the living race of his time, as the word ‘always’ is added to the Hebrew in the following clause, being found, however, also in the LXX., and implied in the present tense of the verb in this place.
	 Have not Known,  or did not know. The Greek may describe a historical fact that preceded the erring in their hearts, or it may sum up their character, as in the Authorised Version: they have not known or understood the true nature and blessedness of the ways in which I would have had them to go (see Exodus 18:20).
