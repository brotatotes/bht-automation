Hebrews 3:12.  Lest there be.  The peculiar expression of the original implies that the writer’s fear lest there should be, is blended with the feeling that there will somehow be, an evil heart of unbelief. His interest in them, and what he knows of their tendencies, make his fear preponderate, and it is only kindness to them to tell them what he fears.
	 An evil heart of unbelief is not a heart made evil by unbelief, but a heart of which the essence is that it does not believe. The two qualities, evil and unbelief, are closely connected, and each produces the other.
	 In departing; literally, ‘in apostatizing.’
	 From the living God; not the idols of the heathen, but the God of Israel, who is known emphatically by this name (Isaiah 37:4), and who is now the God of the Christian Church, its Defender and Judge (see Hebrews 9:14; Hebrews 10:31; Hebrews 12:22).
