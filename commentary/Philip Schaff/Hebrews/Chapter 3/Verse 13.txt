<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:13">Hebrews 3:13</span>. <strong> Exhort one another. </strong> The verb is very frequent in the Acts and in Paul’s Epistles, and occurs four times in this Epistle. Both here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:16">Hebrews 13:16</span> (where it is said in the Authorised <strong> </strong> Version that Christians are to exhort one another in psalms and hymns) mutual exhortation is implied; but the Greek is literally ‘exhort yourselves,’ and part of the idea is that the exhorter should have himself also as a hearer, even when he has no other. The word ‘exhort,’ moreover, includes all the kinds of help, consolation, encouragement, rebuke, which the Christian life needs.

<p><strong> While </strong> as long as ‘the <strong> today</strong> ’ is called sounded in your hearing, so long as the warning lasts, and the need for it, let there be circumspection and wariness.
	</p>
<p><strong> Look</strong> to it (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12">Hebrews 3:12</span>) that no one from among <em> you </em> (as well as your fathers, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:9">Hebrews 3:9</span>) fall into unbelief.
	</p>
<p>Another interpretation of ‘while today is called’ is, ‘while the Psalm continues to be read;’ so some eminent commentators (de Wette, Bengel, etc.); but this does not agree with the use which is made of the words in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:7">Hebrews 4:7</span>, nor does it give an appropriate sense to ‘is called.’ The words may mean while the day of grace lasts, the time during which we hear the Gospel and are warned of the danger of apostasy. This meaning does not practically differ from the one already given, ‘while today is sounded in your ears,’ and is supported by a similar comment on the ‘day of salvation’ made by Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:2">2 Corinthians 6:2</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> The deceitfulness</strong> <strong> of sin.</strong> All sin has this quality (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:9">Romans 7:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:11">Romans 7:11</span>), and especially the sin of unbelief, which is the sin of this context. Unlike the violation of purely moral precepts, it excites small disturbance in the conscience, and yet most effectively hardens the heart by making the most impressive truths powerless over the feelings.
