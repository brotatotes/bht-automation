Hebrews 3:14.  We are made partaken; rather, ‘we are become,’  i.e  we are now what we were not originally. The words describe a  present  character and an  acquired  character.
	 If, that is, we hold fast the  beginning of our confidence  the confidence we have begun to exercise
	 firm unto the end; not our former confidence (1 Timothy 5:12), not the principle of our confidence, the essence of it, but the  beginning of it... to the  end. On this condition we are  partakers of Christ, united with Him (John 15:4; John 17:23), ‘even as He is united with us’ (chap. Hebrews 2:14). This use of the word translated ‘confidence’ is found only in 2 Corinthians 9:4; 2 Corinthians 11:17, and in this place. The Fathers generally regard it as meaning the beginning of what is  our  subsistence,  our  life, or even the beginning of what is the subsistence of Christ in us. The word is found, however, in Hellenistic writers and is now well known in the sense of confidence.
