<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:14">Hebrews 3:14</span>. <strong> We are made partaken</strong>; rather, ‘we are become,’ <em> i.e </em> we are now what we were not originally. The words describe a <em> present </em> character and an <em> acquired </em> character.
	</p>
<p><strong> If, that is, we hold fast the</strong> <strong> beginning of our confidence </strong> the confidence we have begun to exercise
	</p>
<p><strong> firm unto the end;</strong> not our former confidence (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:12">1 Timothy 5:12</span>), not the principle of our confidence, the essence of it, but the <strong> beginning</strong> of it... to the <strong> end</strong>. On this condition we are <strong> partakers</strong> of Christ, united with Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:4">John 15:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:23">John 17:23</span>), ‘even as He is united with us’ (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>). This use of the word translated ‘confidence’ is found only in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:4">2 Corinthians 9:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:17">2 Corinthians 11:17</span>, and in this place. The Fathers generally regard it as meaning the beginning of what is <em> our </em> subsistence, <em> our </em> life, or even the beginning of what is the subsistence of Christ in us. The word is found, however, in Hellenistic writers and is now well known in the sense of confidence.
