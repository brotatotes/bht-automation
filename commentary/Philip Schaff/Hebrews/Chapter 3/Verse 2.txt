Hebrews 3:2.  Who was faithful;  rather, consider Him, he being faithful in that He is faithful. His faithfulness is the quality we are to contemplate, a fresh reason why we should trust Him and be faithful too. . . . The sphere of the service of Moses was a restricted economy the house of Israel. Christâ€™s is a wider economy, and includes all things. The maker must be greater than the work, and He that made all things must be Divine. Moses was part of the economy, the house  in  which he  served.  The economy, moreover, was a rough outline only a shadowy intimation of the higher economy of grace. Christ was faithful  over  His house as Son that house His own (see on Hebrews 3:6), and the completed universal kingdom to which the old type gave witness. And all this is ours the house, the kingdom if we remain faithful and stedfast (Hebrews 3:1-6).
