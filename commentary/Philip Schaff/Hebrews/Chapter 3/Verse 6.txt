Hebrews 3:6.  His own house; rather, perhaps, His,  i.e  God’s house, the contrast being between a servant ‘in the house’ and a son ‘  over  it.’ The Greek, however, may mean that while the house is God’s, it is also emphatically ‘the Son’s,’ whereas  over  His (  i.e  God’s) house means that it is Christ’s only by implication,  i.e because He is over the house and is Son.
	 Whose house  (  i.e  God’s, or by emphasis or by implication Christ’s) are   we,  i.e  (as the absence of the article shows) of whose house part, not all of it are we provided, if so be that (a strong particle) we hold fast the confidence as shown in speech and acts (not ‘boldness,’ which is too much a description of outward manner or profession only); and the ground, the matter of exultation (blended joy and boasting) which hope supplies. As the blessings are   even still largely future,  hope  even more than faith is the requisite grace.
