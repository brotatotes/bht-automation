<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6">Hebrews 3:6</span>. <strong> His own house</strong>; rather, perhaps, His, <em> i.e </em> God’s house, the contrast being between a servant ‘in the house’ and a son ‘ <em> over </em> it.’ The Greek, however, may mean that while the house is God’s, it is also emphatically ‘the Son’s,’ whereas <em> over </em> His ( <em> i.e </em> God’s) house means that it is Christ’s only by implication, <em> i.e</em> because He is over the house and is Son.

<p><strong> Whose house </strong> ( <em> i.e </em> God’s, or by emphasis or by implication Christ’s) are <strong> </strong> we, <em> i.e </em> (as the absence of the article shows) of whose house part, not all of it are we provided, if so be that (a strong particle) we hold fast the confidence as shown in speech and acts (not ‘boldness,’ which is too much a description of outward manner or profession only); and the ground, the matter of exultation (blended joy and boasting) which hope supplies. As the blessings are <strong> </strong> even still largely future, <em> hope </em> even more than faith is the requisite grace.
