Hebrews 3:7.  Wherefore.  Since it is only the giving up of your hope that can rob you of this blessedness, . . . beware of unbelief (a connection that unites the ‘wherefore’ with Hebrews 3:12); or lest you harden your hearts (a connection that unites the ‘wherefore’ with Hebrews 3:8). The former explanation gives a good sense, and the length of the parenthesis is no objection (see Hebrews 7:20-22; Hebrews 12:18-24, where we have similar examples); but perhaps the second explanation is simpler, and commends itself to Delitzsch and others. It is also adopted in the Authorised Version.
	 As the Holy Ghost saith.  The quotation is from the ninety-fifth Psalm, which in the Hebrew has no author’s name, but in the Greek Version is ascribed to David, as it is in Hebrews 4:7.
	 If ye will hear  quite misleads; if ye hear (literally, if you shall have   heard).
	 Today  equals, with the whole phrase, whenever He speaks, whenever you hear His voice.
