<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:7">Hebrews 3:7</span>. <strong> Wherefore. </strong> Since it is only the giving up of your hope that can rob you of this blessedness, . . . beware of unbelief (a connection that unites the ‘wherefore’ with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12">Hebrews 3:12</span>); or lest you harden your hearts (a connection that unites the ‘wherefore’ with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:8">Hebrews 3:8</span>). The former explanation gives a good sense, and the length of the parenthesis is no objection (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:20-22">Hebrews 7:20-22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:18-24">Hebrews 12:18-24</span>, where we have similar examples); but perhaps the second explanation is simpler, and commends itself to Delitzsch and others. It is also adopted in the Authorised Version.

<p><strong> As the Holy Ghost saith. </strong> The quotation is from the ninety-fifth Psalm, which in the Hebrew has no author’s name, but in the Greek Version is ascribed to David, as it is in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:7">Hebrews 4:7</span>.

<p><strong> If ye will hear </strong> quite misleads; if ye hear (literally, if you shall have <strong> </strong> heard).
	</p>
<p><strong> Today </strong> equals, with the whole phrase, whenever He speaks, whenever you hear His voice.
