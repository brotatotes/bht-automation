<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:8">Hebrews 3:8</span>. <strong> As in the day of provocation</strong>; <strong> like as in the day of temptation in the wilderness. </strong> These clauses probably refer to two distinct occasions. The two words which are here translated ‘provocation’ and ‘temptation’ are in the Hebrew proper names, ‘Meribah’ (strife) and ‘Massah’ (temptation). On the first occasion (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+17:1-7">Exodus 17:1-7</span>) the place is said to have been called Massah and Meribah, which the LXX. renders ‘temptation’ and ‘provocation.’ The second <strong> </strong> similar temptation occurred towards the close of the forty years, and is recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="nu+20:1-13">Numbers 20:1-13</span>. Their wanderings began and ended in tempting and proving God; forty years long did their unbelief last. Not for single acts were they finally condemned, but for settled habits and a fixed character.
