<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:2">Hebrews 4:2</span>. <strong> For unto us has the Gospel been preached as well as unto them</strong>, <em> i.e </em> we both have our Gospel or glad tidings of a future rest, equally a Divine message, though given with different degrees of fulness.
	</p>
<p><strong> But the word preached</strong>; rather, the word heard (literally, of hearing), was of no use to them, brought no profit, because they were not united (literally ‘mingled’) by (and in) faith with them that heard it, <em> i.e </em> who listened and obeyed Caleb, Joshua, and the rest. The word ‘not united,’ ‘unmingled,’ is found only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:24">1 Corinthians 12:24</span>, and describes a state that follows from affinity and sympathy.
