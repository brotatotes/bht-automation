<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:6">Hebrews 4:6</span> is clearly an unfinished sentence, finding its completion in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:9">Hebrews 4:9</span> or <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:11">Hebrews 4:11</span>.

<p><strong> Let us therefore labour, </strong> etc., <strong> seeing it remaineth; </strong> rather, it still remaineth, for some to enter in to God’s rest, and those who formerly heard the glad tidings of a rest entered not in because of unbelief. In all these verses where ‘it remains’ is used, the phrase has the same meaning not that a rest now remains and is still future, but that the promise was not fulfilled in the Sabbath-rest or in the Canaan-rest; and therefore when this Epistle was written, it was still a warning and an invitation. It awaited the faith and the entrance which were to exhaust its meaning.
