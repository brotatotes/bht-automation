Hebrews 4:6 is clearly an unfinished sentence, finding its completion in Hebrews 4:9 or Hebrews 4:11.
	 Let us therefore labour,  etc.,  seeing it remaineth;  rather, it still remaineth, for some to enter in to God’s rest, and those who formerly heard the glad tidings of a rest entered not in because of unbelief. In all these verses where ‘it remains’ is used, the phrase has the same meaning not that a rest now remains and is still future, but that the promise was not fulfilled in the Sabbath-rest or in the Canaan-rest; and therefore when this Epistle was written, it was still a warning and an invitation. It awaited the faith and the entrance which were to exhaust its meaning.
