Hebrews 4:8. Clearly, therefore, the Psalm speaks of  a  Divine rest into which men are bidden to enter, different from the rest of Canaan, and long subsequent to it.
	 For if Joshua  (here and in Acts 7:45,  Jesus,  the Greek form of Joshua, quite misleads)  had given them rest  had led them into the rest of which we are speaking He (  i.e  God, who further defines ‘the day’ in David, and describes the rest as still unentered) would not have gone on speaking after that of another day (or of another day after that,  i.e  still future).
