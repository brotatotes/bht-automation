Hebrews 4:9.  Therefore there remains  (still unrealized in any rest that Israel then enjoyed)  a sacred rest, a Sabbath-rest  (the word is now changed),  for the people of God.  The name here given,  ‘the people of God,’ is the usual designation of the covenant people. It occurs again in Hebrews 11:25, and is used in its deepest   sense of all who are ‘children of God through faith’ (Galatians 6:16). The use of the word Sabbath in this sense for the rest which God provides under the Gospel was quite familiar to the Jews. The coming kingdom of the Messiah was even called ‘the perpetual Sabbath.’ Into that rest all enter who believe. Some regard   this verse as   completing the   sentence that began in Hebrews 4:6. The better completion is found in Hebrews 4:11.
