<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:3">Hebrews 4:3</span>. <strong> For we who have believed are entering into rest. </strong> We only are entering who believe; it is not, therefore, the rest of the Sabbath which the Jews long since possessed (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:4-6">Hebrews 4:4-6</span>), nor is it, as the author goes on to say, the rest of Canaan. To strengthen the statement that it is only believers who enter into God’s rest, he quotes again the ninety-filth Psalm: <strong> As he </strong> ( <em> i.e</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> God) <strong> said, As I have sworn in my wrath, they </strong> (who did not believe) <strong> shall not enter into my rest. </strong> ‘ <strong> If they shall not enter</strong> ’ is the same phrase as is translated ‘ <strong> they shall not enter</strong>,’ in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:11">Hebrews 3:11</span>; the phrase is part of the Hebrew oath (‘God do so to me and more also, <em> if,’ i.e </em> I swear I will or I will <em> not</em>) <em> , </em> and is here a strong negation; so in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:5">Hebrews 4:5</span>: ‘ <strong> they shall not enter into my rest</strong>.’ <strong> </strong> It was unbelief that excluded them, and so it is faith that brings us in, the appropriate means of producing peace and blessedness, and itself obedience to God’s command.
