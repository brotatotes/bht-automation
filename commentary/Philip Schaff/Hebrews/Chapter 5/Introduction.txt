CHAP. 5. The high-priesthood of Christ is now formally introduced for fuller discussion. It has been mentioned in every chapter of the Epistle (Hebrews 1:3, Hebrews 2:17, Hebrews 3:1, Hebrews 4:5), and clearly occupies a chief place in the writerâ€™s mind, as it does in other books of Scripture. The notion that this office of our Lord has only economic or temporary interest; that it belongs rather to the ancient law and to Jewish conceptions than to the Gospel, quite misleads. It is, indeed, a doctrine demanded by the express teaching of the New Testament and by human nature as illustrated in the religious sacrifices of all nations, and in the felt needs of the human conscience.
	Two qualifications are said to be necessary in priests, and Christ is proved to have them both: the first is, that they should be able to feel for those whom they represent, and then that they should have the authority of a Divine appointment (Hebrews 5:1-4). Christ is thus shown to have both a Divine appointment and the requisite sympathy (Hebrews 5:5-10).
