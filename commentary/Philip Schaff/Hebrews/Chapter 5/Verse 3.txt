<p><strong> As for the people even,</strong> <strong> so</strong> <strong> also for himself</strong>. The reasoning applies to the Aaronic Priesthood, and also to all human priests. The provisions of the Jewish law in this respect are very clear (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+4:3-12">Leviticus 4:3-12</span>), and especially for the service of the great day of Atonement, when the priest confessed for himself and his house, then for the priesthood in general, and then for all Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+16:0">Leviticus 16:0</span>). Whether all this applies to Christ has been much discussed. Some have regarded it as spoken of human priests as distinguished from Christ; but it is more natural to regard it as true of all high priests in general, and then to allow the writer himself to show how far the Priesthood of Christ is like others, and how far it is unique; this he does as his argument proceeds (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7-8">Hebrews 5:7-8</span>, and chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:28">Hebrews 7:28</span>).
