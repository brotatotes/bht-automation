<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:5">Hebrews 5:5</span>. These requisites of the high priests are all found in Christ, and found in Him in such a degree as proves Him to be superior to all others.
	</p>
<p><strong> Thus</strong> <strong> Christ also</strong> (as well as others) <strong> glorified not himself</strong>, took not the honour upon Himself (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:54">John 8:54</span>) <strong> to be made High Priest</strong>, <strong> but he</strong> (the Father) <strong> who</strong> <strong> spake to him</strong>: <strong> Thou art my Son</strong>; <strong> I have this day</strong> <strong> begotten thee</strong>. He it was that made Him Priest, and made Him Priest in the very passage that speaks of Him as ‘Son;’ the ‘Only-begotten.’ This deeper meaning which regards the Sonship that Christ had before His incarnation as itself having reference to redemption, and to Christ’s place therein, is favoured by the Fathers. Others who regard the quotation as giving honour to the Son without making that honour an assertion of His Priesthood, interpret simply Christ did not Himself assume the office of Priest; God who acknowledges Him as His Son in a sense that raises Him above all creatures, God gives Him the office.
