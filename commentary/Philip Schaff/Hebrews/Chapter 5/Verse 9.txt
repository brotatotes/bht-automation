<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:9">Hebrews 5:9</span>. <strong> Being made perfect</strong>, not only brought to the end, the completion of His learning and suffering, but having acquired all the necessary merit, power, and sympathy needed in His office after His obedience unto death.
	</p>
<p><strong> He became the</strong> <strong> author</strong> (literally, the cause, the personal principle) <strong> of eternal</strong> <strong> salvation</strong>. A salvation not partial or temporal, like the atonements of the law, but a complete and ever-enduring deliverance from evil in all its forms and in every degree. It is the salvation of the soul which is immortal. It is the opposite of eternal condemnation. It takes in grace and glory; and Christ is its author or cause through the lasting virtue of His blood and righteousness, His obedience and suffering, His intercession and gifts.
	</p>
<p><strong> To all who obey him</strong>, who believe the truth He reveals, who live under the influence of it, and who acknowledge Him as their Master and Lord. His obedience unto death is the ground of our hope, and His obedience unto death is the model to which our life is to be conformed.
