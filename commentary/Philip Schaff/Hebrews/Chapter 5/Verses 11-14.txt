<p>CHAP. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:11">Hebrews 5:11</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:20">Hebrews 6:20</span>. The writer, knowing how unprepared his readers were to admit that the Aaronic priesthood was inferior to that of Melchisedec and to that of Christ (who was the antitype of both), interrupts his argument by remonstrating with them on their spiritual ignorance (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:11-14">Hebrews 5:11-14</span>), and urges them to attain higher knowledge (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:1-3">Hebrews 6:1-3</span>), by the danger of apostasy (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:4-8">Hebrews 6:4-8</span>), by his own hope of them founded on their former zeal (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:9-12">Hebrews 6:9-12</span>), and by the encouragement which Godâ€™s promise and oath give to persevering faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:12-20">Hebrews 6:12-20</span>).
