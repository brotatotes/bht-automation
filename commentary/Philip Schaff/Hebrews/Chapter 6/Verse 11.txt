Hebrews 6:11.  But (though persuaded of better things and recognising your work and love)  we desire  (not ‘earnestly desire;’ the preposition of the original indicates generally the object of the desire, not the intensity of it)  that every one of you do show the same diligence (the diligence you have already shown in cultivating brotherly love)  with respect to the full assurance  of your hope unto the end. The stress is on ‘the full assurance of your hope,’ and ‘unto the end.’ ‘Full assurance of hope’ is no doubt the meaning, just as elsewhere we read of the full assurance of faith (Hebrews 10:22), and the full assurance of understanding (Colossians 2:2). And we desire that you  show this quality and persevere  in it even to the end. The warnings of the Gospel are solemn, and yet Christians should live in the sunshine of an assured hope as the true safeguard against apostasy, a hope, however, which it is difficult to maintain.
