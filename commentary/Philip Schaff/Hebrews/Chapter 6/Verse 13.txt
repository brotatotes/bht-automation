Hebrews 6:13.  For when God made (or, had made)  promise to Abraham, because (since)  he could swear by none greater,  he aware by himself. ‘Made promise’ may be translated (as is done by De Wette and others)’ had made promise,’ with reference to previous promises, which were in substance repeated for the first time with an oath at the offering of Isaac. The only occasion on which God did swear was at Mount Moriah (Genesis 22:16-18). The quotation which is made in the next verse follows neither the Hebrew nor the Septuagint exactly, but it represents the sense. Similar promises without an oath were previously given (Genesis 13:16; Genesis 15:5). ‘Having made promise, He afterwards sware,’ may therefore be the meaning, as is rather implied in Hebrews 6:18; but whether the promise and the oath refer to one occasion only or to two, the sense is unchanged. God made promise, and then, because there was none greater to whom He could appeal, He pledged His own life or being to the truth of the promise. Both promise and oath were immutable; the oath did not add to the intrinsic certainty of the promise, His word being ever as good as His bond; but it gave a deeper impression of its certainty, and was fitted to remove every doubt.
