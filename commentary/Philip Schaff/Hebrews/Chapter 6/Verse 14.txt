Hebrews 6:14.  Saying, Surely. The Hebrew of ‘surely’ is equivalent to ‘  I swear.’ The unfamiliarity to the Greek translators of the Hebrew idiom for swearing has created various renderings of the Hebrew particles, and the meaning of the Greek particle has been misunderstood by the English translators in this Epistle (see chap. 4). But there is now no question as to the sense.
	 Blessing I will bless, etc. The repetition indicates, according to the order of the original words, either the certainty of the thing promised (‘Thou shalt surely die’), or the continuousness and consequent completeness of it. In neither case is it unmeaning.
	 I will multiply thee. The full expression in Genesis is: ‘I will multiply  thy seed.’  Some think the change is significant, as if it was intended to connect the promise more closely with Abraham and his faith rather than with his seed (so De Wette and Bleek), and there may be force in this somewhat refined reasoning; but the multiplying is the essential thing, and, as Abraham could be multiplied only through his descendants, the promise in this shorter form leaves the meaning unchanged.
