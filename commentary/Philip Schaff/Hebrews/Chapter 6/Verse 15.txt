Hebrews 6:15.  And so, in this way,  having patiently waited, believing and expecting the blessing amid all the trials and delays he was subjected to,  he obtained what had been promised, not so much the birth of Isaac (Alford), who was born before the oath, nor yet the restoration of Isaac from the dead (De Wette), a result that needed no waiting. The promise was really fulfilled in Abraham’s becoming through Isaac the father of the people of promise, and then of ‘many nations’ under the Gospel through Him who was ‘the seed’ (Galatians 3:16), and so of all who are through faith children of Abraham. This is the promise which, in the widest sense, Abraham has obtained. During his earthly life the fulfilment was very partial. At the exodus the seed are expressly said to have been as ‘the stars for multitude’ (Deuteronomy 1:10); but the blessing of the nations was still to come. Nineteen hundred years later appeared the great Deliverer, whose day Abraham also saw, and now His kingdom is supreme, and Abraham has lone since ‘obtained’ it all. This wide meaning of the promise is not properly a spiritualizing of the Old Testament; it is the true meaning on which St. Paul again and again insists (Galatians 3:7; Romans 4:11). No trial of faith under any dispensation has been severer than Abraham’s, and no reward more blessed or more complete. The lesson to ‘Israel,’ whether literal or spiritual, is decisive and clear.
