	 Intervened, ‘mediated,’  with an oath,  i.e  between Himself as the pro-miser and man as the recipient of the promise. He Himself came as pledge and surety, not for us (Psalms 119:122) but for Himself. The same loving purpose that provided the blessings He promised prompted Him to do everything that could be done to win our trust and establish our faith.
