<p><strong> God, willing to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise</strong> (those to whom under both economies the promises belong, see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:12">Hebrews 6:12</span>) <strong> the immutability or his will. </strong> The word used for ‘will’ is used by Luke and by Paul to express God’s gracious will or counsel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>, etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span>).

<p><strong> Intervened</strong>, ‘mediated,’ <strong> with an oath</strong>, <em> i.e </em> between Himself as the pro-miser and man as the recipient of the promise. He Himself came as pledge and surety, not for us (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+119:122">Psalms 119:122</span>) but for Himself. The same loving purpose that provided the blessings He promised prompted Him to do everything that could be done to win our trust and establish our faith.
