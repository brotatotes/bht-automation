<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:19">Hebrews 6:19</span>. <strong> Which</strong> ( <em> i.e </em> which hope, not which encouragement) <strong> we have</strong>. The hope spoken of in the previous verse is largely objective, <em> i.e </em> it includes the object of our hope, the glorious things which the promise warrants us in expecting. In this verse it is largely subjective the affection or grace (compare ‘Christ, our hope, sustains us,’ where hope is objective; and ‘hope in Christ sustains us,’ where nope is subjective; both are combined in the beautiful description, ‘Christ in us the hope of glory’). Each implies the other; the heavenly reward as set before us by God is ‘our hope’ in its objective sense; our hope of the heavenly reward is the grace of hope in the subjective sense.

<p><strong> As an anchor of the soul</strong> (a common classical emblem, though not found, as ‘anchor’ itself is never found, in the Old Testament) <strong> both sure</strong> (with firm holding ground) <strong> and stedfast</strong> (in itself strong), <strong> and entering</strong> <strong> into that which is within the veil</strong>. A mixed figure, but of great beauty. The anchor of the sailor is cast downwards into the depth of the ocean; but the anchor of the Christian, which is hope, finds its ground and hold above. Into the holiest above Jesus has entered for us, and there also the anchor of our hope has entered; so have we rest now, and shall outride all the storms of our earthly life. Some regard these last clauses, ‘sure and stedfast,’ as qualifying ‘hope,’ not the anchor; the image, in short, they think, is once named, and then no longer used; while others regard the hope as identical with Christ, who is said to enter heaven as our anchor, and then as priest for us. The general sense is not changed in any of these interpretations. The force and beauty of the figure is best preserved, however, by the interpretation first given.
