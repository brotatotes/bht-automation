Hebrews 6:13-20. The writer has sought to encourage the Hebrews by appealing to the Divine ‘righteousness.’ He who  graciously  made them fruitful would  righteously  treat them according to their fruitfulness, and would complete what He had begun (Hebrews 6:10). He now proceeds still further to encourage them by the fact that they had on their side the promise and the oath of God even as Abraham had.
