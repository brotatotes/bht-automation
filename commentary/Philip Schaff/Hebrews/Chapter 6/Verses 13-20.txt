<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:13-20">Hebrews 6:13-20</span>. The writer has sought to encourage the Hebrews by appealing to the Divine ‘righteousness.’ He who <em> graciously </em> made them fruitful would <em> righteously </em> treat them according to their fruitfulness, and would complete what He had begun (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:10">Hebrews 6:10</span>). He now proceeds still further to encourage them by the fact that they had on their side the promise and the oath of God even as Abraham had.
