Hebrews 6:9-10. After these solemn warnings comes the outburst of hope and love.
	 But, beloved  (only here in this Epistle),  we are persuaded (not the middle voice as often, ‘we have the inward confidence,’ but the passive, we are led to the conviction, we are persuaded by evidence which Justifies the conclusion, the evidence being given in the next verse. The whole expression, as Alford and Delitzsch note, resembles Romans 15:14).
	 Better things (either ‘in your moral state’ or ‘in your final destiny;’ both are really combined),  and things that accompany salvation (rather, things that lay hold of, that are in immediate connection with, so that he who has the one has the other);  though (notwithstanding that)  we thus speak (talk, not now only, but again and again). The better things, and things connected with salvation, are the holy dispositions they possessed (not the external privileges and spiritual gifts only), together with the final issues of that holy disposition in continued stedfastness and eternal life. They had ‘received the knowledge of the truth in the love of it’ (the exactest definition that can be given of true and saving faith), and being rooted and grounded in love, he hoped they would persevere and be preserved (the two sides of perseverance) in believing even till the completion of their salvation.
