Hebrews 7:12.  For the priesthood being changed. This is true of an institution that forms the foundation of the law in the sense just described (Hebrews 7:11). If Christ is made priest, the law is changed in its ceremonial and political arrangements, and even in the ethical relation of the people to God. They have another priest, and through the completeness of his work they have a freeness of access and a fulness of forgiveness which alters the very nature of their economy.
