<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:22">Hebrews 7:22</span>. <strong> Of so much better a covenant </strong> (or as in A. V., provided ‘a better covenant,’ which comes at the end of the verse, is made emphatic) <strong> hath Jesus become surety</strong>, <em> i.e </em> He has pledged Himself for the maintenance of it, and for the fulfilment of its promises. The covenant is the result of His death, and His presence above as Priest (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:20">Hebrews 6:20</span>) and the glory and honour with which He is crowned (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>) are a perpetual security for its continuance and completion.
