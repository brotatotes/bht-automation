Hebrews 7:22.  Of so much better a covenant  (or as in A. V., provided ‘a better covenant,’ which comes at the end of the verse, is made emphatic)  hath Jesus become surety,  i.e  He has pledged Himself for the maintenance of it, and for the fulfilment of its promises. The covenant is the result of His death, and His presence above as Priest (Hebrews 6:20) and the glory and honour with which He is crowned (Hebrews 2:9) are a perpetual security for its continuance and completion.
