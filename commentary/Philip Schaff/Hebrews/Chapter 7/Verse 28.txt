<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:28">Hebrews 7:28</span>. <strong> For the law appointed men </strong> (emphatic) <strong> high priests having infirmity; but the word of the oath </strong> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:21">Hebrews 7:21</span>) <strong> which was after the law </strong> five hundred years later as given in prophecy, and one thousand five hundred later still when fulfilled in Christ [appointeth] one <strong> who is Son </strong> (see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1">Hebrews 1:1</span>), <strong> made perfect for evermore. </strong> ‘For evermore’ is in the emphatic place, and belongs to ‘made perfect.’ ‘Having infirmity’ belongs to ‘high priests;’ they were mortal, sinful men, and therefore were an inefficient priesthood; their expiations, their intercessions, their benedictions, all had the character of weakness, and as such they were not fit to meet our needs. ‘Perfected’ or ‘made perfect’ (not ‘consecrated’) ‘for evermore;’ it is the same word as is used in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>, ‘made perfect through suffering;’ and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:9">Hebrews 5:9</span>, ‘having been made perfect;’ and this condition is continuous and unchanging, forming a contrast to the condition of the priests of the Law.
