Hebrews 7:5.  And they verily  (or, ‘indeed,’ as in Hebrews 7:8; or better, the emphatic ‘  and they,’ the Greek particle calling attention to the contrast between those mentioned in this verse and in the following)  that are of the sons of Levi, when they  (not  ‘ who  ’)  receive . . . have a commandment,  etc. The meaning here is best learned from the facts. The Levites, the teachers of the Jewish people, received their portion of the land of promise in the form of a tithe of all the produce of the ground (Numbers 18:21-24); of this tithe, the priests properly so called received a tithe (Numbers 18:26-28): the priests’ share, therefore, was taken from their brethren’s share, and all from the people. This was the arrangement ‘according to the law.’
