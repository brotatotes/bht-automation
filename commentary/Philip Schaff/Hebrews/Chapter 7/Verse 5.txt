<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:5">Hebrews 7:5</span>. <strong> And they verily </strong> (or, ‘indeed,’ as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:8">Hebrews 7:8</span>; or better, the emphatic ‘ <strong> and they</strong>,’ the Greek particle calling attention to the contrast between those mentioned in this verse and in the following) <strong> that are of the sons of Levi, when they </strong> (not <strong> ‘</strong> who <strong> ’</strong>) <strong> receive . . . have a commandment, </strong> etc. The meaning here is best learned from the facts. The Levites, the teachers of the Jewish people, received their portion of the land of promise in the form of a tithe of all the produce of the ground (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="nu+18:21-24">Numbers 18:21-24</span>); of this tithe, the priests properly so called received a tithe (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="nu+18:26-28">Numbers 18:26-28</span>): the priests’ share, therefore, was taken from their brethren’s share, and all from the people. This was the arrangement ‘according to the law.’
