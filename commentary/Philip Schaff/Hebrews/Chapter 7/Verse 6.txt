Hebrews 7:6.  But he (Melchisedec)  whose descent  (pedigree)  is not reckoned from them has  never theless  taken tithes of Abraham (when he contained in his own person both Levi and Israel). And not only did he receive tithes from the tithe-taking Levites,  he hath also blessed  him who has (who is the possessor of)  the promises.
