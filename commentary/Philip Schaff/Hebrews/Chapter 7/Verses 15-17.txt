<p><strong> And it is yet far more evident</strong>. What is more evident? That the law is changed? as De Wette and Bleek hold. Hardly; for this is not the main thought, but the imperfection of the priesthood (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:11">Hebrews 7:11</span>). That imperfection has been proved by the change of priests, and that imperfection is made still more evident by the fact that a new priesthood is to arise <strong> after the similitude of Melchisedec</strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:16">Hebrews 7:16</span>), <strong> who hath been made</strong> (who hath become) priest <strong> not after what is a law of a carnal commandment </strong> <em> i.e </em> a rule of external ordinances (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+21:17-24">Leviticus 21:17-24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+40:12-17">Exodus 40:12-17</span>), temporary and perishing <strong> but after what is the power</strong> (the priestly and kingly power, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:0">Romans 1:0</span>) <strong> of an endless</strong>, <strong> an indissoluble life</strong>. We are bidden to conceive of His priesthood in this light, and not in the light of the qualities and temporary office of the priests under the Levitical law (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:17">Hebrews 7:17</span>).

<p><strong> For</strong> <strong> it is testified of him, Thou art a priest for ever</strong>, the emphatic phrase.
