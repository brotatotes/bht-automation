CHAP. Hebrews 8:1 to Hebrews 10:18. Not only is Christ greater than Aaron,   but His functions, and the place where   He fulfils them, and His very posture there, are all superior to those of the priests under the Law. Jesus ministers permanently as Priest in the real (‘the true’) and heavenly temple (Hebrews 8:1-5), as Mediator of the new covenant, which is better because it is a spiritual covenant and is based upon better promises (Hebrews 6:13). Divine and orderly as were the tabernacle and its services (Hebrews 9:1-5, it belonged to an earthly state (see Hebrews 8:11), and had do power to give peace to the conscience, nor did it secure access to God (Hebrews 6:10); while Christ, by the offering of Himself, has done both (Hebrews 9:11-12), ratifying the new covenant by His death (Hebrews 9:15-17) as the old was ratified by the blood of its victims (Hebrews 9:18-22), and effectually opening the way into heaven: His sacrifice being offered once for all (Hebrews 9:23-28), a sacrifice that cannot be repeated being therein in contrast to the offerings of the Law (Hebrews 10:1-4); a complete fulfilment of the Divine will (Hebrews 10:5-10), followed by an exaltation never to be abrogated (Hebrews 10:11-14), and by the removal of all sin (Hebrews 10:15-18).
