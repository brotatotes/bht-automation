<p>CHAP. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:1">Hebrews 8:1</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:18">Hebrews 10:18</span>. Not only is Christ greater than Aaron, <strong> </strong> but His functions, and the place where <strong> </strong> He fulfils them, and His very posture there, are all superior to those of the priests under the Law. Jesus ministers permanently as Priest in the real (‘the true’) and heavenly temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:1-5">Hebrews 8:1-5</span>), as Mediator of the new covenant, which is better because it is a spiritual covenant and is based upon better promises (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:13">Hebrews 6:13</span>). Divine and orderly as were the tabernacle and its services (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:1-5">Hebrews 9:1-5</span>, it belonged to an earthly state (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:11">Hebrews 8:11</span>), and had do power to give peace to the conscience, nor did it secure access to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:10">Hebrews 6:10</span>); while Christ, by the offering of Himself, has done both (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11-12">Hebrews 9:11-12</span>), ratifying the new covenant by His death (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15-17">Hebrews 9:15-17</span>) as the old was ratified by the blood of its victims (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:18-22">Hebrews 9:18-22</span>), and effectually opening the way into heaven: His sacrifice being offered once for all (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:23-28">Hebrews 9:23-28</span>), a sacrifice that cannot be repeated being therein in contrast to the offerings of the Law (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1-4">Hebrews 10:1-4</span>); a complete fulfilment of the Divine will (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5-10">Hebrews 10:5-10</span>), followed by an exaltation never to be abrogated (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:11-14">Hebrews 10:11-14</span>), and by the removal of all sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:15-18">Hebrews 10:15-18</span>).
