<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:1">Hebrews 8:1</span>. <strong> Now </strong> a transitional particle <strong> in regard to</strong> (or in) <strong> the things here spoken of </strong> (literally being spoken of), <strong> the chief point is this: </strong> ‘The <em> sum</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> is this’ is a possible meaning of the word; but it does not agree with the force of the preposition, with the incomplete tense of the verb, or with what follows where it is implied that the previous enumeration is unfinished: <strong> We have such a high priest who </strong> (having finished His work) <strong> took his seat on the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens. </strong> The main point is that Christ, being exalted to the throne of God, and seated there, has an equally exalted sphere for His priestly office, with greater power than the priests of the Law.
