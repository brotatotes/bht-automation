<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:10">Hebrews 8:10</span>. The new differs also from the old in this, that ( <em> a</em>) God will write His law upon their hearts; ( <em> b</em>) <em> </em> they shall be permanently His people, and He will be their God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:11">Hebrews 8:11</span>); ( <em> c</em>) <em> </em> the true knowledge of God, moreover, will become the common heritage of all the members of the polity He is about to establish (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:12">Hebrews 8:12</span>); and fourthly, ( <em> d</em>) a more excellent promise, itself the beginning and the very reason (for) of the rest; <strong> God will forgive</strong> (will be propitious to them, and to) <strong> their unrighteousness and their sins and their lawlessness will he remember no more</strong>. Sins of every kind He will forgive at once and for ever. How completely this teaching agrees with Paulâ€™s need not be shown. In Christ all is forgiven when once men believe, and yet the doctrine is not the minister of sin, for the faith that justifies is ever the beginning of renewal, the germ of a holy life.
