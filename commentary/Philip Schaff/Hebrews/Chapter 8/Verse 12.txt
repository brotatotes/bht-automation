<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:12">Hebrews 8:12</span>. <strong> In saying a new covenant, he hath made the first old</strong>. Long ago, in Jeremiahâ€™s day, God showed by His promise of a new covenant that the former one had done its work; was antiquated and virtually obsolete. <strong> And</strong> (we know, for it is a general truth) <strong> that which is becoming antiquated</strong>, which is already obsolescent, <strong> and is daily growing feebler with age</strong>, is nigh to vanishing away. It is nearing the point where its power and its right to exist will both cease!
