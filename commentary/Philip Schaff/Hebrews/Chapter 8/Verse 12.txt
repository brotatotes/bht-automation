Hebrews 8:12.  In saying a new covenant, he hath made the first old. Long ago, in Jeremiahâ€™s day, God showed by His promise of a new covenant that the former one had done its work; was antiquated and virtually obsolete.  And (we know, for it is a general truth)  that which is becoming antiquated, which is already obsolescent,  and is daily growing feebler with age, is nigh to vanishing away. It is nearing the point where its power and its right to exist will both cease!
