Hebrews 8:2. A  minister  (the regular word for public work, and specially for priestly functions, Jeremiah 33:21)  of the sanctuary  (the inner part ‘the holy of holies,’ as it is called in Hebrews 9:3; though elsewhere, as here, the holy place or the sanctuary simply, Hebrews 9:25; Hebrews 13:11)  and of the true tabernacle  (the outer part of the same erection, called in Hebrews 9:2 the first tabernacle)  which the Lord pitched, not  man.  Christ’s place and work are described in terms taken from the divisions of the earthly copy of the spiritual or heavenly reality. The copy Moses pitched (Exodus 33:7); the reality is the work of God Himself. The holy place is the immediate presence of God, distinguished from the tabernacle, where God is pleased to meet with men. Jesus Christ mediates for us in both in the holy of holies of the Divine nature, while He welcomes and overshadows with His glorified humanity the whole company of the worshippers. Both are in the heavens, and in this double sphere Christ is acting as Priest and High Priest. And yet the spheres are really one. The veil having been removed by His incarnation and death, we all have free access to God. The Father Himself loveth us and gives us the right of entrance (Romans 5:2), because we have believed in the Son. ... ‘A minister of holy things’ (not of the holy places or place) is Luther’s rendering; but it is not sanctioned by the usage of this Epistle, where the expression is applied only to the holy place, Hebrews 9:25, Hebrews 10:19, Hebrews 13:11. The same form (the neuter pl.), ‘the holies,’ is clearly used of ‘the holy of holies’ in Hebrews 9:8; Hebrews 9:12. In Hebrews 9:3 the holy of holies (probably a superlative, the most holy place) is also used for the inner sanctuary.
