<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11">Hebrews 9:11</span>. Here begins the true antithesis to the preceding verses, though <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:6">Hebrews 9:6</span> marks a contrast of another kind. That old economy was earthly, glorious indeed, but (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:6">Hebrews 9:6</span>) ineffectual. The new economy has to do with another tabernacle not of this creation, with other blood, with a far completer redemption, and with the purification of the conscience and of the life (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11-14">Hebrews 9:11-14</span>). So it introduces a new covenant and a heavenly sanctuary (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15-20">Hebrews 9:15-20</span>), with complete forgiveness (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:26">Hebrews 9:26</span>); and the only thing that remains is Christâ€™s reappearance to complete salvation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:27-28">Hebrews 9:27-28</span>).

<p><strong> But Christ having come</strong> (having appeared, a word used to describe the appearance of any one in history or on some important stage of life, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:1">Matthew 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:51">Luke 12:51</span>), <strong> a high priest of the good things to come</strong> (not things that belong to the future state chiefly, but in conformity with the Jewish mode of speaking of them while they were yet future, the things that belong to the new covenant, extending indeed into the heavens and the distant future, but beginning here and now), <strong> by a greater and a more perfect tabernacle not made with hands</strong>, that is, <strong> not of this creation</strong> (see under <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span>).
