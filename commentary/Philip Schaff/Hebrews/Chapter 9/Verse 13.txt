Hebrews 9:13.  For if . . . and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling them that have been defiled, sanctifieth unto (  i.e  so as to secure; the full expression implies result, not purpose)  the purity of the flesh. This case of the ‘ashes of the heifer’ is one of the most suggestive symbols of the Law, and is well worth examination (see Numbers 19:0). The heifer without spot, slain by the priest without the camp, its blood sprinkled in the direction of the tabernacle, the animal itself burnt with solemn rites, its ashes laid up in a clean place to be used with water in cleansing those who had been defiled by contact with a dead body, itself a symbol and a result of sin all are instructive, and all was done to secure an outward purity only.
