Hebrews 9:15.  And for this cause (for the reason that His blood is thus efficacious, Hebrews 9:14, or because He has performed this great work, Hebrews 9:11-14)  he is mediator of a new (emphatic)  covenant, in order that, death having taken place (viz. His own) for redemption from (or expiration of)  the transgressions under the first covenant, they that have been called (‘partakers of a heavenly calling,’ chap. Hebrews 3:1)  may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. The first covenant left its transgressions unforgiven. It waited for the offering that had efficacy. The death of Christ, therefore, has a double work. It is offered once for all, and extends its efficacy forward to the end of time and backward to the entrance of the Law. It is the procuring cause of forgiveness for all dispensations (see Romans 3:24-26). The emphasis of the last words is on ‘may receive the promise,’  i.e  be put in possession of what was promised the eternal inheritance, the blessing of the Gospel-, ‘the good things to come,’ including the eternal life, which is the completion of them all.... As the writer is speaking of the Old Covenant, those ‘who are called’ refers properly to the Jews, but the principle applies to the Gentiles also, and to all economies.
