<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:19">Hebrews 9:19</span>. <strong> For</strong> (a proof of the assertion in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:18">Hebrews 9:18</span>) <strong> when every commandment had been spoken by Moses according</strong> <strong> to the law</strong> (as the law directed, without any variation from it) <strong> unto all the people, he took the blood of the calves and the goats</strong> (these last are not expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:6-8">Exodus 24:6-8</span>, but are implied in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+5:5">Exodus 5:5</span>) <strong> with water and scarlet wool and hyssop</strong> (those details are not named in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:6-8">Exodus 24:6-8</span>, but each is given elsewhere. Either God commanded Moses to do these things, as they were done later, or the writer is giving in brief a summary of the whole law as at first instituted), <strong> and sprinkled both the book itself</strong> (which probably lay on the altar) <strong> and all the people</strong>.
