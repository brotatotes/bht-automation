Hebrews 9:19.  For (a proof of the assertion in Hebrews 9:18)  when every commandment had been spoken by Moses according  to the law (as the law directed, without any variation from it)  unto all the people, he took the blood of the calves and the goats (these last are not expressed in Exodus 24:6-8, but are implied in Exodus 5:5)  with water and scarlet wool and hyssop (those details are not named in Exodus 24:6-8, but each is given elsewhere. Either God commanded Moses to do these things, as they were done later, or the writer is giving in brief a summary of the whole law as at first instituted),  and sprinkled both the book itself (which probably lay on the altar)  and all the people.
