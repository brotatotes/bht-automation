Hebrews 9:2. The writer first notes the beauty of the holy place, and then (Hebrews 9:6) the holy ordinances of the service.  For a tabernacle was prepared  with two apartments,  the first wherein were the candlestick (the golden candelabrum, with its upright shaft and six branches, three on each side, crowned with seven lamps: Solomon’s temple had ten of those lamps; Herod’s, again, but one),  and the table (of acacia and overlaid with gold)  and the shewbread (the loaves as set forth and presented before God), which part of the tabernacle is called the holy place.
