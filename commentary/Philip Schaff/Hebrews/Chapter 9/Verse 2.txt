The writer first notes the beauty of the holy place, and then (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:6">Hebrews 9:6</span>) the holy ordinances of the service. <strong> For a tabernacle was prepared </strong> with two apartments, <strong> the first wherein were the candlestick</strong> (the golden candelabrum, with its upright shaft and six branches, three on each side, crowned with seven lamps: Solomon’s temple had ten of those lamps; Herod’s, again, but one), <strong> and the table</strong> (of acacia and overlaid with gold) <strong> and the shewbread</strong> (the loaves as set forth and presented before God), which part of the tabernacle is called the holy place.
