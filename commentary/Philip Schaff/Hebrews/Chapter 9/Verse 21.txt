Hebrews 9:21.  Moreover, the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry (the service)  he sprinkled in like manner with blood (probably later: it was certainly done every year, Leviticus 16:16-20. Josephus, however, gives the same fact as occurring at the inauguration of the covenant, and in very similar words,  Antiq. iii. 8, 6).
	Hebrews 9:22.  And according to the law almost all things (some were purified with water, Exodus 19:10, etc.; others with water and the ashes of the heifer, Numbers 31:22-24; but things which were specially appropriated to the worship of God)  are cleansed with (in)  blood;  and apart from shedding of blood  the word here brings up the language of the Lord’s Supper, ‘Shed for you’ (Luke 22:20)
	 there is no remission  (forgiveness). The ‘almost’ of the first clause applies also to the second (see Leviticus 5:11-13). The need on blood and the significance of it may be seen in Leviticus 17:11.
