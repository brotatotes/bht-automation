Hebrews 9:24. ‘The heavenly things:’  for not into a holy place made with hands did Christ enter,  like in pattern (answering to the original, ‘the typical form’)  to the true, now to show (  to manifest) himself before (the face of)  God for us; His passover our offering, and by virtue of ‘the Eternal Spirit His own Divine nature’ with all the power of an endless life.
