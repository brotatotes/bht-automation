<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:8">Hebrews 9:8</span>. <strong> The Holy Ghost this signifying</strong>, <em> i.e </em> by the arrangement which excluded all from the sanctuary except the high priest, who entered only on one day in the year <strong> that the way into the holiest </strong> heaven itself, the true antitype, not the holy of holies <strong> hath not yet been made manifest, while as</strong> (an archaism, like <em> when as </em> [and the modern form <em> whereas</em> ] <em> ,</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> stating <em> time during which, </em> with a slight intimation that the thing stated is the reason of the result) <strong> the first tabernacle</strong>, <em> i.e </em> the holy place separated from the holy of holies, <strong> is still standing </strong> these present tenses all call attention to the continuance of the Jewish worship and to the need of its ceasing. That is, while there is a distinction of tabernacle and tabernacle with a veil between them, and a <em> hidden </em> glory, there is no freedom of access. Let the veil be removed, and then the two tabernacles will become one; and so the first will be done away . . . To refer the ‘first tabernacle’ to the old covenant neither suits the usage of the context nor the description given elsewhere of the ‘heavenly things’ which are prior to the first tabernacle.
