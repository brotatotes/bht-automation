Hebrews 9:8.  The Holy Ghost this signifying,  i.e  by the arrangement which excluded all from the sanctuary except the high priest, who entered only on one day in the year  that the way into the holiest  heaven itself, the true antitype, not the holy of holies  hath not yet been made manifest, while as (an archaism, like  when as  [and the modern form  whereas ]  ,   stating  time during which,  with a slight intimation that the thing stated is the reason of the result)  the first tabernacle,  i.e  the holy place separated from the holy of holies,  is still standing  these present tenses all call attention to the continuance of the Jewish worship and to the need of its ceasing. That is, while there is a distinction of tabernacle and tabernacle with a veil between them, and a  hidden  glory, there is no freedom of access. Let the veil be removed, and then the two tabernacles will become one; and so the first will be done away . . . To refer the ‘first tabernacle’ to the old covenant neither suits the usage of the context nor the description given elsewhere of the ‘heavenly things’ which are prior to the first tabernacle.
