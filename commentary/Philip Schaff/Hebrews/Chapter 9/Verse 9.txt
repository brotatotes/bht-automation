Hebrews 9:9.  The which tabernacle is a figure  (literally a parable, an arrangement with a lesson) for,  i.e  in reference to (or lasting till)  the time  [now]  present, or [then] present, for neither is expressed. Either makes good sense. The former, ‘now present,’ better suits the writer’s purpose; the latter, ‘then present,’ has found most favour with the commentators. The arrangement might have taught those who first witnessed it (then present) that the gifts and sacrifices which are still being offered (present tense) could not meet the needs of the human conscience or give free access to God. The arrangement teaches us (‘now’ present) the same lessons imposed, as it is till the fulness of the time when all is to be rightly arranged and with better results. And  according to which parable (or tabernacle,  i.e  a holy place with the holy of holies veiled and inaccessible either meaning gives the same lessons, and the Greek admits either)  were offered gifts  and sacrifices which could not give peace to the conscience or satisfy God’s justice.
