<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:25">Hebrews 9:25</span>. And as Christ has not entered into the holy place made with hands, <strong> neither has he entered into heaven that he should offer himself often</strong> (the reference is not to His dying, but to His presenting Himself and His blood. The dying is named later, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:26">Hebrews 9:26</span>), <strong> just as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood of others</strong> ( <em> i.e ‘</em> not his own,’ as the Syr. renders it); <strong> else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world. </strong> As His blood was His own, and as His death was essential to the offering of Himself, and necessary in order that He might have something to offer (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:3">Hebrews 8:3</span>), He must in that case have often suffered. The contrary, however, is the fact.

<p><strong> But now</strong>, the case is that <strong> once</strong> for all <strong> at the end</strong> ( <strong> the completion) of the ages</strong> which have elapsed since sin entered, antediluvian, patriarchal, Mosaic, <strong> hath he been manifested</strong>, <em> i.e </em> in our flesh (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span>), <strong> for the putting away of sin </strong> in its guilt and power <strong> by the sacrifice of himself</strong>.
