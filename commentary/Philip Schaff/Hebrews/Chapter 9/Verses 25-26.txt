Hebrews 9:25. And as Christ has not entered into the holy place made with hands,  neither has he entered into heaven that he should offer himself often (the reference is not to His dying, but to His presenting Himself and His blood. The dying is named later, Hebrews 9:26),  just as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood of others (  i.e ‘ not his own,’ as the Syr. renders it);  else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world.  As His blood was His own, and as His death was essential to the offering of Himself, and necessary in order that He might have something to offer (Hebrews 8:3), He must in that case have often suffered. The contrary, however, is the fact.
	 But now, the case is that  once for all  at the end (  the completion) of the ages which have elapsed since sin entered, antediluvian, patriarchal, Mosaic,  hath he been manifested,  i.e  in our flesh (1 Timothy 3:16; 1 Peter 1:20),  for the putting away of sin  in its guilt and power  by the sacrifice of himself.
