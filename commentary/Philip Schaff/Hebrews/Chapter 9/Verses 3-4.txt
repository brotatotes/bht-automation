<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:3">Hebrews 9:3</span>. <strong> And after</strong> (generally of time, here of place, <em> behind</em>) <em> </em> <strong> the second veil</strong>, the same <strong> tabernacle, which is called the holy of holies</strong> (the holiest of all); <strong> having</strong> (belonging to it, not necessarily ‘in it’) <strong> a golden censer</strong> or an <strong> altar of incense</strong>. The word means either; and interpretations differ. Incense was taken by the high priest into the holy of holies from the very first, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+16:12-13">Leviticus 16:12-13</span>, but a golden censer <em> is </em> not <em> named </em> in the Law, and only in the ritual of the second temple. On the other hand, if we take the other meaning, ‘the altar of incense,’ <em> that </em> stood not in the holy of holies, but without the veil; though it was regarded as belonging to the inner sanctuary (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ki+6:22">1 Kings 6:22</span>), and was sprinkled with the blood on the Day of Atonement.
	</p>
<p><strong> And the ark</strong> <strong> of the covenant</strong> (so called because it contained the two tables of the Law) overlaid on all sides (without and within, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:11">Exodus 25:11</span>, and with a golden rim or border, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+37:2">Exodus 37:2</span>) <strong> with gold</strong>, <strong> wherein was a golden pot having the manna</strong> <strong> and Aaron’s rod that budded</strong>. All these were in the holy of holies in the time of Moses. The first temple also possessed the ark (though not the manna or Aaron’s rod, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:9">1 Kings 8:9</span>). In the second temple the ark was wanting.
	</p>
<p><strong> And</strong> <strong> the tables of the covenant</strong>, the stones on which the ten commandments were written by the finger of God: mentioned last, because the writer is enumerating the things that were most costly and beautiful.
