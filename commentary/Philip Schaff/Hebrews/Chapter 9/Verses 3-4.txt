Hebrews 9:3.  And after (generally of time, here of place,  behind)    the second veil, the same  tabernacle, which is called the holy of holies (the holiest of all);  having (belonging to it, not necessarily ‘in it’)  a golden censer or an  altar of incense. The word means either; and interpretations differ. Incense was taken by the high priest into the holy of holies from the very first, Leviticus 16:12-13, but a golden censer  is  not  named  in the Law, and only in the ritual of the second temple. On the other hand, if we take the other meaning, ‘the altar of incense,’  that  stood not in the holy of holies, but without the veil; though it was regarded as belonging to the inner sanctuary (1 Kings 6:22), and was sprinkled with the blood on the Day of Atonement.
	 And the ark  of the covenant (so called because it contained the two tables of the Law) overlaid on all sides (without and within, Exodus 25:11, and with a golden rim or border, Exodus 37:2)  with gold,  wherein was a golden pot having the manna  and Aaron’s rod that budded. All these were in the holy of holies in the time of Moses. The first temple also possessed the ark (though not the manna or Aaron’s rod, 1 Kings 8:9). In the second temple the ark was wanting.
	 And  the tables of the covenant, the stones on which the ten commandments were written by the finger of God: mentioned last, because the writer is enumerating the things that were most costly and beautiful.
