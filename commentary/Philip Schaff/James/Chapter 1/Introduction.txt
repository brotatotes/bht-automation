James, after saluting his readers, commences his Epistle by adverting to those trials to which they were exposed: these, if patiently endured, would confirm and strengthen them in the faith; and, as they were placed in trying circumstances, he admonishes them to ask  ,  without doubting, wisdom from God. If, on the one hand, they successfully overcame those temptations to which their trials exposed them, they would receive the crown of life which the Lord had promised to them that love Him; but if, on the other hand, they were overcome, they must beware of attributing their sins, which arose from their own wicked desires, to God who is the Author, not of evil, but of good; and especially it   was of His pure goodness that they were born again by the word of truth.
