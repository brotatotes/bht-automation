<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12">James 1:12</span>. <strong> Blessed is the man that endureth temptations</strong>: not merely falleth into divers temptations, but endureth them, cometh out of them unscathed, does not succumb under them. A man who has been tempted, and has come victorious out of the temptation, is a far nobler man than one who preserves a moral character, because he has never been tempted. Temptations impart a manliness, a strength, a vigour to virtue. Victory over temptation is a higher attainment than untried innocence. Untried innocence is the negative innocence of children: righteousness approved by trial is the positive holiness of apostles, martyrs, and confessors. ‘Behold,’ says St. James elsewhere, ‘we count them happy that endure’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:11">James 5:11</span>).

<p><strong> for, </strong> the reason assigned for this blessedness.
	</p>
<p><strong> when he is</strong> <strong> tried, </strong> or rather, when he is approved by the trial, so that he is able to stand the test and to be purified by it.
	</p>
<p><strong> he</strong> <strong> shall receive the crown of life</strong>. If these words were found in one of St. Paul’s Epistles, the reference would be to the Grecian games to the crown of laurel which was bestowed on the victor in these games. But here there can be no such reference; as these games were discountenanced by the Jews, <strong> </strong> and regarded as polluting. The reference is to the conqueror’s crown, or to the royal diadem; it is a figure not uncommon in the O.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+21:3">Psalms 21:3</span>). So also in the Book of Wisdom: ‘The righteous live for evermore, their reward also is with the Lord, therefore shall they receive a beautiful crown from the Lord’s hand’ ( Wis 5:16-17 ). As has been beautifully said: ‘Earthly trials are the flowers of which the heavenly garland is made’ (Bishop Wordsworth). The genitive is that of apposition: life is itself the crown <strong> which the Lord, </strong> not Christ, but God, <strong> hath promised to them that love him. </strong> To endure temptation is a proof of love to God. It is attachment to His cause which induces us to endure.
