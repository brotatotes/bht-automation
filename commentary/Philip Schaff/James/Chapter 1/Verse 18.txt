<p><strong> of his creatures</strong>: of the new creation, that great multitude of the redeemed whom no man can number: and perhaps not even to be limited to them, but to embrace all the creatures of God, pointing forward to that time when ‘the creature itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21">Romans 8:21</span>).
