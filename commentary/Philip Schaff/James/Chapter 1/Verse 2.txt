<p><strong> count it all </strong> joy, that is, complete or pure joy a <strong> </strong> joy which excludes trouble and sorrow. Some suppose a reference here to the greeting of James, wherein he wishes his readers joy.

<p><strong> divers temptations. </strong> The adjective ‘divers’ does not indicate the different sources from which the temptations proceed, but rather the different forms which they assume. Temptations are generally regarded in two points of view enticements to sin, and trials or tests of character; here it is evident that they are chiefly regarded in the latter point of view, though the former is not excluded (see note to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:13">James 1:13</span>). They are outward trials <strong> as </strong> contrasted with inward temptations to evil. St. James may primarily allude to those trials to which, in the form of persecution, the Jewish Christians were exposed from their unbelieving countrymen; but the epithet ‘divers’ would appear to include temptations or trials of all kinds. It is not the mere falling into trials that is the cause of joy; but the beneficial effects which result from them, as is evident from the verse which follows.
