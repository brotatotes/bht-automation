James 1:20.  For, the reason assigned for the above exhortation, and especially for the last portion of it ‘slow to wrath.’
	 the wrath of man,  that is, carnal zeal, whose fruit is not peace, but contention. Those angry feelings which arise from religious controversy are here primarily alluded to. The word of God was then abused, as it is now, into an occasion of strife.
	 worketh not, produceth not.
	 the righteousness of God. By the righteousness of God is not meant the righteousness imputed by God, as if the meaning were that the wrath of man does not work out the faith which God counts to men for righteousness; nor that righteousness which God possesses the Divine attribute of righteousness; but that righteousness which is approved by God, and which He Himself forms within us by His Holy Spirit. The meaning of the verse is that contention, arising from dispute or controversy, is not conducive to holiness, either in ourselves or in others does not tend to the furtherance of the righteousness of God in the soul. Furious zeal does not promote the interests of God’s kingdom.
