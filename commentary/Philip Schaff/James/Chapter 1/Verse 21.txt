<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:21">James 1:21</span>. <strong> Wherefore</strong>, seeing that the wrath of man does not promote the righteousness of God, <strong> lay apart</strong>, divest yourself of, <strong> all filthiness</strong>, pollution. By some this word is taken by itself, but it is more in accordance with the context to connect it with ‘naughtiness, ‘indicating a particular kind of pollution.

<p><strong> and superfluity </strong> abundance or excess. of <strong> naughtiness</strong>: a word which has now lost somewhat of its original meaning. The Greek word signifies wickedness, depravity, malignity, malice, that disposition which manifests itself in the wrath of man mentioned above; accordingly, ‘all pollution and abundance of malice’ all that malice which is so polluting and abundant in our hearts. Some suppose that the words are metaphorical, having reference to agriculture, in correspondence with the ingrafted word which directly follows: Put away all the defilement and rank growth of malice which like weeds encumber the ground, and prevent the growth of the ingrafted word.
	</p>
<p><strong> and receive with meekness</strong>: here, as opposed to malice and wrath, not so much a teachable spirit, as mildness a gentle and loving disposition toward our fellow-men.
	</p>
<p><strong> the ingrafted word</strong>, or rather the implanted word that word which by Divine grace is implanted in your hearts. By this is meant, neither reason nor the inner light of the Mystics, but the word of truth or the Gospel of Christ as received into the heart. Some suppose that by the ingrafted word the incarnate Logos, namely the Lord Jesus Christ, is meant; but this is a fanciful supposition, and unsuitable to the context.
	</p>
<p><strong> which is able to save your souls</strong>. Compare with this the words of St. Paul: ‘I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among them who are sanctified’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:32">Acts 20:32</span>). Comp. also <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>. James does not mean that those who are born by the word do not already possess salvation, but that the salvation is not fully possessed in this life.
