James 1:21.  Wherefore, seeing that the wrath of man does not promote the righteousness of God,  lay apart, divest yourself of,  all filthiness, pollution. By some this word is taken by itself, but it is more in accordance with the context to connect it with ‘naughtiness, ‘indicating a particular kind of pollution.

Comp. also Romans 1:16. James does not mean that those who are born by the word do not already possess salvation, but that the salvation is not fully possessed in this life.
