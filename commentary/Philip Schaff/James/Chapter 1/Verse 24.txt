<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:24">James 1:24</span>. <strong> For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth</strong>. The words are in the lively style of narrative: literally translated they are: ‘For he contemplated himself, and has gone his way, and immediately forgot what manner of man he was.’ A general statement, not necessarily to be understood universally. A man has seldom any true or accurate notion of his own features: from beholding himself in a glass or mirror, he retains no distinct recollection of what he has seen.

<p><strong> what manner of man he was</strong>. No distinct impression is made on him; he cannot recall his own features. This most especially have been the case, when we take into consideration the imperfect nature of the mirrors of the ancients.
