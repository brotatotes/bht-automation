<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:26">James 1:26</span>. <strong> If any man among you seem</strong>, that is, not seems to others, but thinketh himself, appears to himself to be religious. The words denote the false opinion which a man has of himself; the false estimate which he has formed of his religion.

<p><strong> to be religious</strong>. ‘Religious’ and ‘religion’ are hardly the correct renderings. Both are, however, adopted in the Revised Version without note. We have no terms in our language to express the original; worshipper and worship is perhaps the nearest approach. See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>. See Trench’s <em> New Testament Synonyms, </em> pp. 192 ff. It is not internal religion to which St. James alludes, but the manifestation of religion, the service of God or religious worship. He speaks of the external form rather than of the internal essence, of the body rather than of the soul of religion. To be religious, in the sense of our verse, is to be a diligent observer of the external forms of worship: ‘If any man among you think that he is observant of religious service,’ that he is a true worshipper of God.

<p><strong> and bridleth not his own tongue</strong>, does not abstain from wrath and contention: does not exercise a command over his words.
	</p>
<p><strong> but deceiveth his own heart</strong>, imposeth upon himself, by relying upon the mere form of religion.
	</p>
<p><strong> this man’s religion</strong>, religious service or worship, <strong> is vain </strong> of no value in the sight of God.
