By patience here is not meant so much freedom from murmuring and repining, as endurance stedfastness or perseverance in the faith of the Gospel under these temptations. The Jewish Christians by their trials were tempted to apostatize from Christianity. A period of trial is a period of testing; the true metal is purified, not consumed.

Those who are not true believers fall away; ‘in time of temptation,’ says our Lord, ‘they fall away’ (Luke 8:13). With respect to joy in temptation, because it produceth patience, compare the language of St. Paul: ‘We glory in tribulation, knowing that tribulation worketh patience (endurance), and patience experience (approval),’ (Romans 5:3-4).
