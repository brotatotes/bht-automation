	</p>
<p><strong> work. </strong> Patience is not merely a passive but an active virtue; there is a work of patience, yea a perfect work. And this work consists in the purification of the soul in refining and ennobling our moral character. Patience under trials has preeminently a sanctifying tendency. The most perfect Christians are not the most active, but the most enduring; not so much in the bustle of the world is the work of grace carried on, as in the quietness of the sick-chamber. God proves His people in the furnace of affliction. He purges the fruitful branches that they may bear more fruit (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:2">John 15:2</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> that ye may be perfect</strong>. ‘The work of God in a man,’ as Dean Alford observes, <em> ‘is </em> the man. If God’s teaching by patience have had a perfect work in you, <em> you </em> are perfect.’ Of course by this cannot be meant absolute perfection; the word denotes maturity in grace, not absolute but relative holiness.
	</p>
<p><strong> and entire</strong>. Perfect and entire are almost synonymous terms; perfect denotes that which has attained to its maturity, entire that which is complete in all its parts. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:16">Acts 3:16</span>.
	</p>
<p><strong> wanting nothing </strong> or ‘in nothing lacking,’ a negative expression for the sake of strengthening these two positive attributes perfect and entire.
