James 1:6.  But,  as an essential prerequisite to our obtaining an answer to our prayers.
	 let him ask in  faith; that is, not believing that God will give us the precise thing that we ask, for we may ask for what is pernicious to us, but believing that God hears prayer. The object of prayer is here presupposed, namely, wisdom; and this we may ask without limitation, as it is a blessing which is always proper for God to give, and fit for us to receive.

The mind of the doubter is unsteady and wavering; like a wave, sometimes advancing and sometimes receding; there is wanting rest and calmness. It is in stillness that God communicates His grace; unrest is adverse to His operations.
