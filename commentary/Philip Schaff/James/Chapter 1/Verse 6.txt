<p><strong> let him ask in</strong> <strong> faith</strong>; that is, not believing that God will give us the precise thing that we ask, for we may ask for what is pernicious to us, but believing that God hears prayer. The object of prayer is here presupposed, namely, wisdom; and this we may ask without limitation, as it is a blessing which is always proper for God to give, and fit for us to receive.

<p><strong> nothing wavering, </strong> or more simply and correctly, ‘doubting nothing.’ It is the same expression as occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:20">Acts 10:20</span> in the address of the Spirit to Peter: ‘Arise, get thee down and go with them, doubting nothing, for I have sent them.’ Here the expression means ‘not doubting that God hears prayer.’ The nature of this doubting is well stated by Huther in his excellent commentary: ‘To doubt is not equivalent to “disbelieve,” but includes in it the essential character of unbelief; whilst faith says “yes,” and unbelief “no,” to doubt is the conjuction of “yes” and “no,” but so that “no” has the preponderance; it is an internal wavering which leans not to faith, but to unbelief.’ </p>
<p><strong> For he</strong> <strong> that wavereth, </strong> or doubteth, <strong> is like a wave of</strong> <strong> the sea</strong>: there is in the original no play upon words, as in our English Version.

<p><strong> driven of the wind and tossed. </strong> These terms are synonymous, and do not, as some think, refer to outward and inward temptations (Erdmann). The figure which St. James employs is striking. The mind of the doubter is unsteady and wavering; like a wave, sometimes advancing and sometimes receding; there is wanting rest and calmness. It is in stillness that God communicates His grace; unrest is adverse to His operations.
