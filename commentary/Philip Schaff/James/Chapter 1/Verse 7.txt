James 1:7.  For let not that man,  namely, the doubter,  think. This warning supposes that the doubter fancies that he will receive an answer to his prayers; but it is a vain delusion: his expectations will be disappointed.
	 that he shall receive anything of the Lord.  By the Lord is here meant not Christ, but God. James, as the Septuagint does, here uses the term as equivalent to Jehovah. This is the usual meaning of the term in this Epistle; it is applied to Christ only in James 5:7; James 5:14-15. In the Epistles of the other apostles the term ‘Lord’ generally denotes Christ.
