<p><strong> that he shall receive anything of the Lord. </strong> By the Lord is here meant not Christ, but God. James, as the Septuagint does, here uses the term as equivalent to Jehovah. This is the usual meaning of the term in this Epistle; it is applied to Christ only in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:7">James 5:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:14-15">James 5:14-15</span>.
