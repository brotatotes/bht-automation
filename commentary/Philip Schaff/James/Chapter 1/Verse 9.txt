<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:9">James 1:9</span>. The meaning of this and of the following verse has been much disputed.
	</p>
<p><strong> Let</strong>. The connection with the preceding is not obvious. It appears to be this: We must avoid all doubting of God in prayer, all double-mindedness; we must exercise confidence in Him, and realize His gracious dealings in all the dispensations of His Providence; and, whether rich or poor, we must place implicit trust in Him.
	</p>
<p><strong> the brother</strong>: here evidently the Christian brother, because Christianity unites all those who embrace it into one holy brotherhood.
	</p>
<p><strong> of low degree </strong> literally, ‘who is lowly.’ The word in itself does not necessarily involve the idea of poverty; but here, where the contrast is with the rich, it must denote ‘poor’ or ‘afflicted’ the poor brother. The majority of the early Christians were from among the poor; and it is probable that the unbelieving Jews by fines and extortions deprived their believing brethren of their goods. Poverty was a frequent form of persecution for conscience’ sake.
	</p>
<p><strong> rejoice in that he is exalted </strong> literally, ‘glory in his exaltation.’ Different meanings have been assigned to this phrase. The usual interpretation is to refer it to spiritual exaltation: Let the poor brother rejoice in the dignity and glory which as a Christian he possesses, in those spiritual riches which are conferred upon him, and in the crown of life which is in reserve for him. He is constituted a child of God and an heir of heaven. Doubtless many who were slaves in the world were the Lord’s freedmen. This dignity was a proper subject for glorying in, as it was conferred on them not because of their own merits, but from the Divine graciousness. May not the words, however, admit of a more extended and literal signification? The poor are permitted to rejoice when they become rich, because they are thus possessed of greater means of usefulness, and are the better enabled to promote the cause of Christ. Voluntary poverty is no virtue; money may be redeemed from the world and deposited in the treasury of the Lord.
