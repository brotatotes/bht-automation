<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:19-27">James 1:19-27</span>. In this passage St. James exhorts his readers to be not only hearers but doers of the word. They are to be swift to hear, and to receive the word implanted within them with freedom from malice and in mildness: but they are to hear it only with a view to practise its precepts; lest, being mere hearers of the word, they impose upon themselves. They must remember that true religious service does not consist in the performance of certain ceremonies, but in active benevolence shown especially towards the afflicted, and in purity of life.
