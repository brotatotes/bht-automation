James 2:11.  For: the reason of the above assertion, arising from the unity of the Divine Author of the law. He, namely God,  that said,  Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill (Exodus 20:13-14). Various reasons have been assigned for the selection of these two precepts; but the most obvious is that these are the two first commandments of the second table of the law, containing our duties to our neighbour; the fifth being generally classed by Jewish writers as belonging to the first table. [1]
	 [1] The seventh commandment, ‘Do not commit adultery,’ is also, as here, put before the sixth, ‘Do not kill,’ in Mark 10:19, Luke xviii 20, Romans 13:9; whereas in Matthew 19:18 the order in the Decalogue is retained.
	 Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. There is a Divine unity in the law, as well as in the Lawgiver. We must obey all the laws of God, without exception or limitation; if we offend in one particular, the law is broken and we become transgressors. A man who is a liar, although he may observe all the other precepts of the moral law, is evidently living in open violation of the law of God.
