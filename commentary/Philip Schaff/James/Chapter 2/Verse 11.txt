<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:11">James 2:11</span>. <strong> For</strong>: the reason of the above assertion, arising from the unity of the Divine Author of the law. He, namely God, <strong> that said</strong>, <strong> Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill</strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:13-14">Exodus 20:13-14</span>). Various reasons have been assigned for the selection of these two precepts; but the most obvious is that these are the two first commandments of the second table of the law, containing our duties to our neighbour; the fifth being generally classed by Jewish writers as belonging to the first table. [1]

<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] The seventh commandment, ‘Do not commit adultery,’ is also, as here, put before the sixth, ‘Do not kill,’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:19">Mark 10:19</span>, Luke xviii 20, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:9">Romans 13:9</span>; whereas in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:18">Matthew 19:18</span> the order in the Decalogue is retained.
	</p>
<p><strong> Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law</strong>. There is a Divine unity in the law, as well as in the Lawgiver. We must obey all the laws of God, without exception or limitation; if we offend in one particular, the law is broken and we become transgressors. A man who is a liar, although he may observe all the other precepts of the moral law, is evidently living in open violation of the law of God.
