<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:12">James 2:12</span>. <strong> So speak ye and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty</strong>. The law of liberty is not here the moral law, nor the love of our neighbour as a single commandment, but the same as that mentioned in the former chapter: ‘Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty’(<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:25">James 1:25</span>). See explanation of that passage. Believers are under the law of liberty, because they are freed from the condemning sentence of the moral law, and are delivered from the enslaving power of sin, a disposition having been implanted within them which renders them willing to obey the Divine commands. The spirit of bondage is superseded by the spirit of adoption. And by this law of liberty believers shall be judged; their good works will be rewarded, and their voluntary obedience to the moral law which springs from faith in Christ will be graciously accepted. They are no longer under the moral law, as a rule of rewards and punishments, but under grace this law of liberty.
