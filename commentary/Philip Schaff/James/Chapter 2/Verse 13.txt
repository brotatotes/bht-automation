<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:13">James 2:13</span>. <strong> For</strong>, the reason assigned for so speaking and acting, <strong> he shall have judgment without mercy</strong>, literally, the judgment will be without mercy to him, <strong> who hath showed no mercy</strong>.’ We must show mercy to our fellow-men, if we expect mercy from God. Compare the words of our Lord: ‘If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:15">Matthew 6:15</span>). On the other hand: ‘Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:7">Matthew 5:7</span>). The chief aim of the Gospel is to make men like God; to form the Divine image in the human soul; that they should be merciful, even as their Father in heaven is merciful.

<p><strong> and mercy rejoiceth against</strong>, boasteth over, <strong> judgment</strong>. Mercy and judgment <strong> are here personified</strong>; judgment threatens to condemn the sinner, but mercy interposes and overcomes judgment. The saying is genera], and not to be limited either to God or to man; mercy prevails against judgment. ‘Mercy,’ says St. Chrysostom, ‘is dear to God, and intercedes for the sinner, and breaks his chains, and dissipates the darkness, and quenches the fire of hell, and destroys the worm, and rescues from the gnashing of teeth. To her the gates of heaven are opened. She is the queen of virtues, and makes men like to God; for it is written, Be ye merciful, as your Father also is merciful. She has silver wings like the dove, and feathers of gold, and soars aloft, and is clothed with the Divine glory, and stands by the throne of God; when we are in danger of being condemned, she rises up and pleads for us, and covers us with her defence, and enfolds us with her wings. God loves mercy more than sacrifice.’ Compare with this Shakespeare’s celebrated lines on the quality of mercy.
