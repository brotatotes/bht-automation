Expressions of kind wishes toward the destitute; mere words, but no actions. The words are such as, if sincere, would have been followed by corresponding actions. ‘Depart in peace,’ are the words which our Saviour employed when He dismissed those whom He had cured (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:50">Luke 7:50</span>).

<p><strong> notwithstanding ye gave them not those things which are needful to the body,</strong> namely, food and raiment.
	</p>
<p><strong> what doth it profit?</strong> What good do your kind words do either to them or to yourselves? Undoubtedly charity, if it have not works, is dead.
