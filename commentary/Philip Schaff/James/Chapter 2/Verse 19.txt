<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:19">James 2:19</span>. <strong> Thou believest that there is one God.</strong> Here the existence of a theoretical faith is admitted: Thou assentest to the statement that there is one God, or, as it is otherwise read, ‘that God is one.’ This particular article of faith is chosen from a Jewish point of view, because the Jews put a high value on it, as that which distinguished them from the rest of the world. And it is still the boast of the Jews that their national vocation is to be witnesses to the unity of the Godhead. Hence then: Thou hast more knowledge and a more correct faith than the Gentiles, who have gods many and lords many.
	</p>
<p><strong> thou doest well:</strong> so far good. There is a certain touch of irony in the language; but the irony does not lie in the words, ‘Thou doest well,’ but in the whole statement that a theoretical faith in the unity of God, though in itself good, yet does not essentially differ from the belief of devils.

<p><strong> the devils.</strong> By the devils here are not meant the devils in the possessed who trembled before Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span>); nor the heathen divinities considered as demons(<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:20">1 Corinthians 10:20</span>), but evil spirits generally. also believe assent to this doctrine
	</p>
<p><strong> and tremble:</strong> the word in the Greek is stronger, ‘and shudder.’ The force of this addition may be: ‘The faith of the nominal Christian is no better than the faith which devils possess; nay, it is not even so good, for the devils not only believe, but they also tremble;’ or it may be: ‘The devils’ belief in God, because unproductive of works and obedience, not only cannot save them, but is the cause of their trembling before the Divine tribunal’ (Brückner).
