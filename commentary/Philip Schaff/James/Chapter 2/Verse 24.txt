<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:24">James 2:24</span>. <strong> Ye see then</strong>, from this example of Abraham, <strong> how that by works a man is justified.</strong> The emphasis is upon works: stress is put upon the fact that faith must be productive of works.
	</p>
<p><strong> and not by faith only</strong>. These words do not admit of the translation, ‘and not only by faith:’ as if there were two kinds of justification, the one by faith and the other by works; or as if faith did part, and works were required to do the rest. The meaning is, ‘not by faith simply,’ by a faith without works, which cannot justify either in whole or in part. It must be carefully observed that James does not deny that a man is justified by faith; on the contrary, he presupposes this truth, as without faith there can be no works, in the sense in which he employs the term works; he only asserts that justifying faith must not be alone, but must be productive of works.
