<p><strong> likewise also was not Rahab.</strong> The same example, and the same incident in Rahab’s history, is also adduced by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, as an illustrious instance of faith. The example is not so obvious as that of Abraham; and we can assign no sufficient reason why it was selected by both writers.

<p><strong> by works when she received the messengers, and sent them out another way.</strong> This was certainly a work springing from her faith; it arose from her firm belief in the God of Israel. Indeed, Rahab herself gives this as the reason of her conduct: ‘I know that the Lord hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon as, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. The Lord your God, He is God in heaven above and in the earth beneath’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jos+1:9">Joshua 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jos+1:11">Joshua 1:11</span>). Her receiving the messengers, and sending them out another way, was therefore a proof that her faith was real and living. ‘By faith,’ says the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, ‘the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:31">Hebrews 11:31</span>). Her deliverance from death is to be ascribed to her faith, but it was to her faith as active. Thus did she manifest the reality of her faith. Her faith cooperated with her works, and by works was her faith made perfect received its full realization; and in this sense she is said to be justified by works.
