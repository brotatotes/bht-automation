<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:6">James 2:6</span>. <strong> But ye,</strong> in contrast to Godâ€™s estimate of the poor. God has chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith, whereas ye, on the contrary, <strong> have despised the poor:</strong> not so much the poor generally, as the poor among Christians. Now follows a second consideration; that by showing respect to the rich, they give a preference to those who were the enemies both of themselves and of Christ.

<p><strong> Do not rich men:</strong> it is unnatural to suppose that Christian rich men are meant, but rich men as such, who in their worldliness and pride manifest a hatred to Christianity.

<p><strong> oppress you, and draw you before the judgment-seat?</strong> The rich unbelieving Jews were the bitterest enemies to their believing countrymen: they fined and imprisoned them, as apostates from Judaism. Thus we read that Saul made havoc of the Church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span>). Those who suppose that by the rich here mentioned Christians are intended, think that the reference is not to persecution, but to litigation, similar to the abuses which occurred in the Corinthian Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:6">1 Corinthians 6:6</span>).
