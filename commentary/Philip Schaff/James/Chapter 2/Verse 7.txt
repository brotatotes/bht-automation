<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:7">James 2:7</span>. <strong> Do not they blaspheme.</strong> The pronoun is emphatic: ‘Is it not they who blaspheme.’ The allusion may be to the attempts of the unbelieving Jews to compel believers to blaspheme the name of Christ. Thus it is said of Saul, that he punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:11">Acts 26:11</span>). But it is better to refer it to the blasphemous utterances of the Jews themselves. Thus Justin Martyr tells us, that the Jews were accustomed to blaspheme Christ in their synagogues. Those who suppose that the rich men here mentioned are Christians, think that it refers to the disgrace brought upon Christianity by their ungodly practices: that they blasphemed Christ in their lives. But such a meaning is less natural and appropriate.

<p><strong> that worthy, goodly, or noble name </strong> not the name of ‘God,’ or that of ‘brethren,’ but the name of ‘Christ.’ It does not, however, follow from this that believers were at this early period called Christians. It is a goodly name, for Christ is the Lord of glory, the Founder of Christianity, the Messiah promised to their fathers.

<p><strong> by the which you are called?</strong> or rather, ‘which was invoked upon you,’ namely at your baptism, when baptized into the name of Christ. The allusion is to the name of God being put upon the children of Israel to distinguish them as His property. ‘They shall put my name upon the children of Israel’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:27">Numbers 6:27</span>). So the name of Christ was put upon believers to signify that they belonged to Him.
