Others understand the expression, ‘the law which like the royal road is plain, straight and level;’ others, ‘the law which proceeds from the great King,’ whether God or Christ; and others, ‘the law which applies to kings as well as to other men.’ But all these meanings are objectionable, because they do not discriminate this special precept.
