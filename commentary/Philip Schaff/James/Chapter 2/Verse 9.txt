James 2:9.  But if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, ye violate this royal law,  and are convinced of, convicted by,  the law. By the law here is not meant a single commandment, as the law against partiality or respect of persons, but the moral law, and which, as regards our duties to others, is summed up in this command to love our neighbour as ourselves.
	 as transgressors, because such a respect of persons is contrary and opposed to a disinterested and universal love to others.
