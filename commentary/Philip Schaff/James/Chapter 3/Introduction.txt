In this chapter, St. James cautions his readers not to be too forward in assuming the office of teachers, but to exercise a wise restraint upon their zeal, knowing that such an office would confer on them a heavy responsibility. This caution leads him to advert to the importance of the government of the tongue. He who can command his tongue, commands himself. This observation he explains by two obvious illustrations, that of the bit which curbs the horse, and that of the helm which guides the ship. The tongue, he observes, though a little member, is a powerful instrument for good or evil. Its abuse gives rise to the greatest mischiefs, and influences for evil the whole circle of human life. It is more untameable than the wildest animals. By it we are guilty of the greatest inconsistency blessing God, and cursing His image in man; an inconsistency which never occurs in nature, as no fountain sends forth both salt and fresh water, and no tree produces different kinds of fruit. St. James therefore urges his readers to a candid and benevolent spirit, and to exhibit wisdom and meekness in their conduct. He then distinguishes between earthly and heavenly wisdom; the former is the cause of envy and contention, of confusion and all kinds of wickedness; the latter leads to righteousness and peace.
