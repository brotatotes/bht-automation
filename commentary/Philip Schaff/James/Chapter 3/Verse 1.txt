<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:1">James 3:1</span>. <strong> My brethren, be not many masters.</strong> Either ‘be not many of you masters;’ or rather, ‘be not a multitude of masters’ each one striving to be a master. ‘Masters’ here used not in the sense of rulers, but of <em> teachers. </em> Hence the sense is: Do not rashly enter upon the office of a teacher. The meaning is not to be limited, as is done by Calvin, to the office of a reprover ‘masters of morals;’ but is to be understood generally. Such an assumption of the office and authority of teachers was very prevalent among the Jews. The Pharisees loved to be called of all men ‘Rabbi, Rabbi’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:7">Matthew 23:7</span>). St. Paul, adverting to the Jews, says that they were confident of their ability to be guides to the blind, and teachers of the foolish (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:19-20">Romans 2:19-20</span>); and he finds fault with them for desiring to be teachers of the law, whilst at the same time they understood neither what they said, nor whereof they affirmed (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:7">1 Timothy 1:7</span>). And this craving to be teachers would be naturally carried by the converted Jews into the Christian church. The opportunity of exercising the office of teachers was greater in these days of early Christianity than in ours, as it would seem that teaching was not then restricted to a particular class, but was exercised by believers generally. The exhortation is not without its use in the present day. Many, especially in a season of religious excitement, assume the office of teacher, without any qualification of knowledge or experience, and thus expose themselves to the reproof of St. James.

<p><strong> knowing</strong>, as ye well do, being well aware.
	</p>
<p><strong> that we </strong> we who are the teachers. St. James includes himself out of humility, and in order the better to propitiate his readers.
	</p>
<p><strong> shall receive the greater condemnation.</strong> The meaning being that as the responsibility of teachers is great, they shall be the more strictly dealt with by God. Knowing that we shall undergo a stricter judgment than others in a private station.
