James 3:14.  But if ye have bitter envying  zeal or emulation in a bad sense, as is evident from the epithet ‘bitter,’
	 and strife, or rather factiousness, contention, party-strife; the reference being specially to religious controversies.
	 in your hearts, glory not, boast not,  and lie not, by a false pretence to wisdom and knowledge,  against the truth: not subjective, ‘against veracity,’ being destitute of the truth, which would render the passage tautological; but objective, ‘against the truth of God,’ namely the Gospel.
