<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:18">James 3:18</span>. <strong> And the fruit of righteousness.</strong> This does not mean ‘the reward of righteousness,’ nor ‘the fruit which springs from righteousness,’ but ‘the fruit which consists in righteousness.’ So in the Epistle to the Hebrews we read, that chastisement yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:11">Hebrews 12:11</span>). As bitter emulation and party-strife are the fruits of earthly wisdom, so righteousness is the fruit of heavenly wisdom. And by righteousness here is not meant the imputed righteousness of Christ, but moral goodness righteousness in ourselves and in others, in habit and in practice.

<p><strong> is sown</strong>; the fruit being supposed to be contained in the seed. The sower is not God; but, as is evident from the context, the peacemakers.
	</p>
<p><strong> in peace</strong>. Some render the words ‘into peace,’ meaning that they who are of a peaceful disposition will reap a harvest of peace both in this world and in the next; but this is giving a wrong meaning to the preposition. ‘In peace’ denotes the spirit with which the seed or fruit is sown.
	</p>
<p><strong> of them that make peace. </strong> Some render this ‘on behalf of them,’ or, ‘for the good of them that make peace.’ But it gives a better meaning to regard the peacemakers as the sowers of righteousness, hence ‘by them that make peace.’ The meaning of the whole verse is: The seed of righteousness is sown by the peacemakers in a spirit of peace. Only those who are actuated by the spirit of peace are the true sowers of righteousness; whereas ‘the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.’
