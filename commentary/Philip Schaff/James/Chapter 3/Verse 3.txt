James 3:3. St. James introduces two illustrations to prove the truth of his remark, that if a man is able to command his tongue, he is able also to command his whole conduct. The first illustration, that of the bit in the horses’ mouths, was naturally suggested by what he had just said about bridling the whole body.  Behold. The best manuscripts read, ‘But if:’ as if St. James had said, ‘But if you doubt the truth of my assertion, consider how the horse is bridled.’
	 we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. As the horses are governed by bits in their mouths, so axe we governed by the tongue in our mouths. The chief point of comparison here is that of governing.
