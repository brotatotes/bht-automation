<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:8">James 3:8</span>. <strong> But,</strong> expressive of contrast, <strong> the tongue, </strong> generally considered whether our own tongue or the tongue of others
	</p>
<p><strong> can no man tame </strong> or subdue. The tongue is more unconquerable than the wildest animal. No man can master his own tongue, or subdue that of the slanderer or the liar; we require the grace of God for this.

<p><strong> it is an unruly evil </strong> incapable of being curbed, full of disturbance. The best manuscripts read, ‘it is a restless evil’ incapable of being quieted.

<p><strong> full of deadly poison: </strong> the reference being to the poison of serpents which was supposed to be connected with their tongues. Compare the words of the Psalmist, referred to by St. Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:13">Romans 3:13</span>): ‘They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders’ poison is under their lips’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+140:3">Psalms 140:3</span>). Hence the importance and difficulty of the government of the tongue. We must pray for the grace of God ‘to keep our mouths as with a bridle.’ We must steer this little helm aright, lest we should make shipwreck of our immortal hopes. We must be cautious of every little spark, lest the infernal flames should burst forth, and spread devastation over the whole circle of our lives.
