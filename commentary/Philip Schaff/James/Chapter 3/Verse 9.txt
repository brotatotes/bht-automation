James 3:9.  Therewith: literally, ‘in it,’ ‘acting in the sphere of the tongue;’ hence, instrumentally, ‘by it.’
	 bless we God, even the Father.  The best manuscripts read, ‘bless we the Lord and Father,’ an unusual combination; both terms apply to God the Father. To praise God is the proper use of the tongue.
	 and therewith, by it,  curse we men  the improper and opposite use of the tongue.
	 which are made after the similitude, or likeness, of God.  Man was originally created after the Divine image (Genesis 1:26); and this image, although marred and obscured, is not, as some rashly affirm, obliterated by sin. Thus murder was declared to be punishable by death, because man  was made in the image of God (Genesis 9:6). Man in his understanding and affections, and especially in his conscience, still bears the traces of the moral image of his Creator; indeed, it is by reason of this resemblance that we can attain to a knowledge of the perfections of God, and are rendered capable of religion. And this Divine image obscured by sin is restored by Christ (Colossians 3:10). This Divine similitude, then, we ought to respect both in ourselves and in others. He who curses man curses the image of God, and consequently God Himself in His image. It is evident that the reference is not to the original condition of man prior to the fall, but to his present state; for thus only can there be any force in the apostle’s remark.
