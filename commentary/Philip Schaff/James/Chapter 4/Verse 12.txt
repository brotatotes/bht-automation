<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:12">James 4:12</span>. <strong> There is one Lawgiver. </strong> Most manuscripts read, ‘There is one Lawgiver and Judge:’ and this is more suitable to the context, as it is the province of a judge that is adverted to. These are not many, but one: one pre-eminently and exclusively. All human lawgivers and judges derive their authority from God, and are only to be obeyed when their commands are not opposed to His. God is the source of all authority, the fountain of justice.

<p><strong> who is able: </strong> who has both the authority to command and the power to execute
	</p>
<p><strong> to save and to destroy. Who art thou</strong>: expressing the insignificance of man: thou, who art so ignorant and so erring, so sinful and so liable to fall; thou, who hast no power and no authority; thou, who art thyself guilty and as a <strong> </strong> sinner obnoxious to the judgment of God: how darest thou invade the office of this supreme and universal Lawgiver and Judge, and expose thyself to His condemnation?

<p><strong> that judgest another? </strong> Compare the words of Paul: ‘Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant?’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:4">Romans 14:4</span>).
