<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:15">James 4:15</span>. <strong> For that ye ought to say: </strong> literally, ‘instead of your saying.’ This verse is directly connected with the 13th, and the 14th verse <strong> </strong> is to be considered as a parenthesis. Ye say, ‘Today or tomorrow we shall go into such a city;’ instead of saying, ‘If the Lord will.’ Ye assert your self-dependence, instead of humbly acknowledging your dependence on God.

<p><strong> If</strong> <strong> the Lord will. </strong> Compare with this expression of dependence the <strong> </strong> words of St. Paul: ‘I will return again to you, if God will’(<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:21">Acts 18:21</span>); ‘I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will’(<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:19">1 Corinthians 4:19</span>); ‘I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:7">1 Corinthians 16:7</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> we shall live and do this or that. </strong> The words may be rendered, ‘If the Lord will and we live, we shall do this or that.’ But our version is better, as both the living and the <strong> </strong> doing are made dependent on God. The meaning being precisely the same as our common phrase: ‘God willing ( <em> Deo volente</em>) <em> , </em> I shall do so and so.’ We must, however, beware of allowing this expression of dependence to degenerate into a <strong> </strong> mere form, as is too frequently the case; it must be the real feeling of our heart. We must not only acknowledge in words, but deeply realize our dependence on God.
