James 4:15.  For that ye ought to say:  literally, ‘instead of your saying.’ This verse is directly connected with the 13th, and the 14th verse   is to be considered as a parenthesis. Ye say, ‘Today or tomorrow we shall go into such a city;’ instead of saying, ‘If the Lord will.’ Ye assert your self-dependence, instead of humbly acknowledging your dependence on God.
	 If  the Lord will.  Compare with this expression of dependence the   words of St. Paul: ‘I will return again to you, if God will’(Acts 18:21); ‘I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will’(1 Corinthians 4:19); ‘I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit’ (1 Corinthians 16:7).
	 we shall live and do this or that.  The words may be rendered, ‘If the Lord will and we live, we shall do this or that.’ But our version is better, as both the living and the   doing are made dependent on God. The meaning being precisely the same as our common phrase: ‘God willing (  Deo volente)  ,  I shall do so and so.’ We must, however, beware of allowing this expression of dependence to degenerate into a   mere form, as is too frequently the case; it must be the real feeling of our heart. We must not only acknowledge in words, but deeply realize our dependence on God.
