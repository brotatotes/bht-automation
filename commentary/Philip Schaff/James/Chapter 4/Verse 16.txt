James 4:16.  But,  in contrast to   this spirit of dependence on God; instead of acknowledging God in all your ways.
	 now,  as matters now stand; as is actually the case. ye rejoice, literally ‘ye glory,’  in your boastings,  in your vauntings, in your vainglory. Ye take a pleasure in this arrogant and presumptuous spirit, as if you were your absolute masters. By their boastings is to be understood not so much their vain talking, as their confident and groundless reliance on their own health and life; in short, a presumptuous reliance on themselves. Ye rejoice not in the Lord, as ye ought to do as Christians; but in your own vauntings.
	 all such rejoicing,  or glorying,  is evil,  is sinful and wrong. It is rebellion against God casting off your dependence upon Him. Nothing is so hateful to God as a proud and arrogant spirit.
