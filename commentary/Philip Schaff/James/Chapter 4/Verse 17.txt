<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:17">James 4:17</span>. <strong> Therefore: </strong> not a mere general inference drawn from what St. James has said in the previous part of his Epistle, but a particular inference drawn from this spirit of vain boasting.
	</p>
<p><strong> to him that knoweth to do good: </strong> not to be limited to mere benevolent actions, ‘knoweth to do good works,’ but to embrace our whole moral conduct ‘knoweth to do what is right:’ ‘good’ here is opposed to what is sinful and wrong.
	</p>
<p><strong> and doeth it not, to him it is sin. </strong> The omission of good is undoubtedly a sin, as well as the commission of evil. We have here the statement of an important principle, which is susceptible of endless applications. The application in the present case appears to be as follows: You have the unquestionable knowledge of the uncertainty of life; you know that it is your duty to realize your dependence on God; if then you do not do so, it you act as if you were your own masters, to you it <strong> </strong> is sin. You know the right and do the wrong, and therefore are <strong> </strong> convicted of sin. (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:41">John 9:41</span>.)
