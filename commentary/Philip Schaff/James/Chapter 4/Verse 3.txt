<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:3">James 4:3</span>. <strong> Ye ask, and receive not:</strong> as if to anticipate the reply of his readers that they did ask, but still did not receive the object of their desires.
	</p>
<p><strong> because ye ask amiss:</strong> or wrongly, wickedly; either in an improper spirit, without faith in God as the Hearer of prayer; or rather for improper objects, for worldly things which are pernicious in themselves or prejudicial to the petitioner for the sole purpose of self-gratification, without any thought of the glory of God. Such asking is equivalent to not asking.
	</p>
<p><strong> that ye may consume it </strong> (that which ye ask) on, or spend it in, <strong> your lusts</strong>: in order to gratify your own sinful desires. The meaning is: if you pray in a proper spirit, these selfish desires, which are the occasion of those bitter contentions among you, would cease to exist
