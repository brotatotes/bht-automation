James 4:3.  Ye ask, and receive not: as if to anticipate the reply of his readers that they did ask, but still did not receive the object of their desires.
	 because ye ask amiss: or wrongly, wickedly; either in an improper spirit, without faith in God as the Hearer of prayer; or rather for improper objects, for worldly things which are pernicious in themselves or prejudicial to the petitioner for the sole purpose of self-gratification, without any thought of the glory of God. Such asking is equivalent to not asking.
	 that ye may consume it  (that which ye ask) on, or spend it in,  your lusts: in order to gratify your own sinful desires. The meaning is: if you pray in a proper spirit, these selfish desires, which are the occasion of those bitter contentions among you, would cease to exist
