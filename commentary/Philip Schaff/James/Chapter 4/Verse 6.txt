James 4:6.  But  he,  that is, God, or rather the indwelling Spirit, the immediate antecedent.
	 giveth more, or greater,  grace.  Here also there is a difficulty in determining what ‘more’ refers to: this depends on the meaning given to the former clause. Some render it ‘greater than the world gives:’ others, ‘greater than the strength of depravity that exists within us.’ Perhaps the most correct meaning is: Just because the Spirit does not lust to envy; and yet there is a lust to envy in man: therefore, to overcome this lust, He giveth more grace.
	 Wherefore he saith: that is, God or the Spirit saith. This is better than the rendering ‘the Scripture saith.’
	 God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.  The quotation is from the Book of Proverbs, and is according to the Septuagint, except that there we have the word ‘Lord’ instead of ‘God.’ The same quotation, and with the same variation, occurs in the First Epistle of Peter (1 Peter 5:5). The words in our version are,   ‘Surely he scorneth the scorners; but he giveth grace to the lowly’ (Proverbs 3:34). By the proud here are meant the contentious those who eagerly desire worldly objects; and by the humble, those who have overcome their worldly desires and govern their passions.
