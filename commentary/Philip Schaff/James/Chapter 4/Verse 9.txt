James 4:9.  Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep  namely, over your envy and hatred, your strifes and contentions, and the miseries occasioned by them. The epithets ‘sinners’ and ‘double-minded’ imply the necessity of repentance; and true repentance must ever be accompanied with godly sorrow.
	 let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness: feelings which are more appropriate for the occasion.
