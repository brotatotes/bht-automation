<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:9">James 4:9</span>. <strong> Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep </strong> namely, over your envy and hatred, your strifes and contentions, and the miseries occasioned by them. The epithets ‘sinners’ and ‘double-minded’ imply the necessity of repentance; and true repentance must ever be accompanied with godly sorrow.
	</p>
<p><strong> let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness:</strong> feelings which are more appropriate for the occasion.
