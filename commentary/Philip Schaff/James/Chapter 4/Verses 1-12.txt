<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:1-12">James 4:1-12</span>. St. James warns his readers against those evil passions which gave rise to wars and fightings among them. They must moderate their desires, and guard against self-gratification. If they placed their chief affections on the things of the world, they were alienated from God, for no one could be a friend of the world without being the enemy of God. The declarations of Scripture against worldliness were not made for no purpose; and the promptings of the indwelling Spirit did not lead to strife and envy. They must cultivate submission to God, resistance to the devil, outward and inward purity, repentance, and humility. They must avoid all evil-speaking and censoriousness. They must not set themselves up as judges of one another; but ever remember that there is one Lawgiver and Judge, who has the power to carry His judgments into effect, and to whom all must give an account.
