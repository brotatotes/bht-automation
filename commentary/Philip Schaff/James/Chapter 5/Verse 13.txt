<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:13">James 5:13</span>. <strong> Is any afflicted?</strong> The word rendered ‘afflicted’ is a general term, denoting all kinds of affliction sickness, pain, bereavement, disappointment, persecution. Here perhaps it specially refers to inward affliction low spirits, in contrast to merry.

<p><strong> let him pray, </strong> prayer being the natural resort of the afflicted.
	</p>
<p><strong> is any merry?</strong> that is, cheerful, in good spirits. It is the same word which St. Paul employs when he exhorts his fellow-voyagers to ‘be of good cheer’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:36">Acts 27:36</span>). It literally signifies to be of good mind; hence free from care.
	</p>
<p><strong> let him sing psalms: </strong> literally, ‘let him praise.’ The primary meaning of the word is to touch, then to touch the strings of the harp, to praise. We are not to express our cheerfulness in riotous mirth, but in praise and gratitude to God. Nor ought prayer and praise to be separated; they should be combined; our prayers should often express themselves in praise, and our praise should be a prayer. Thus Paul and Silas in prison prayed and sang praises to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:25">Acts 16:25</span>); literally, ‘praying, they sang hymns to God;’ their singing of hymns was their prayer.
