<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:14">James 5:14</span>. <strong> Is any sick among you?</strong> a particular instance of the general term ‘afflicted;’ to be taken in its literal sense, denoting ‘bodily sickness,’ and not <strong> </strong> to be spiritualized as denoting ‘spiritual trouble.’

<p><strong> let him call for the elders of the church</strong>: not for the aged men, but for the presbyters of the church; that is, of the congregation to which the sick man belongs. This proves that even at the early period at which St. James wrote his Epistle there was a constituted ecclesiastical government; each congregation had its presbyters.

<p><strong> and let them pray over him. </strong> This may denote either literally ‘over his bed,’ or ‘over him’ by the imposition of hands; or figuratively ‘with reference to him,’ that is, ‘for him.’

<p><strong> anointing him with oil</strong>. This anointing with oil was and still is much employed in the East as a medicinal remedy in the case of sickness, the oil used being chiefly olive oil. Thus in our Lord’s parable, the good Samaritan is represented as pouring into the wounds of the traveller oil and wine (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:34">Luke 10:34</span>). Here, however, the anointing with oil appears to have been a religious ceremony, and to have had a symbolical meaning; it was performed by the elders of the Church in the name of the Lord. We read that the disciples, whom our Lord sent endowed with the miraculous powers of healing, ‘anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them’(<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:13">Mark 6:13</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> in the name of the Lord</strong>; that is, of Christ, and to be connected with ‘anointing.’ The natural meaning is, that the presbyters were to anoint the sick by the authority or command of Christ. There is certainly no mention of such an injunction, but our ignorance does not exclude the fact; and we have seen that the disciples sent out by our Lord anointed with oil. The name of Christ was the recognised vehicle for the communication of miraculous cures. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:6">Acts 3:6</span>: ‘In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Rise up and walk.’
