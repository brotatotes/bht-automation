<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:19">James 5:19</span>. We have in these two last verses the conclusion of the Epistle; and certainly the words form a summary of its nature, its contents, and its design. Its sole purpose was to correct the errors of the Jewish Christians, and to restore them to the truth of the Gospel.

<p><strong> Brethren, if any of you do err,</strong> literally, be seduced, <strong> from the truth,</strong> the truth of the Gospel, that word of truth by which they were begotten (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:18">James 1:18</span>). Here the reference is not to a single defection, but to an alienation of the heart from the truth. The error includes false doctrine as well as false practice, although it is chiefly with the latter that this Epistle is concerned.

<p><strong> and one convert him </strong> is the instrument in the hand of God of his restoration.
