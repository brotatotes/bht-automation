James 5:2.  Your riches are corrupted. We have here a description of the doom that was to befall the rich. Your riches, in which you prided yourselves, and in which you trusted, will be taken from you. Some suppose, on account of the term ‘corrupted,’ that riches in grain are to be understood, which are liable to corruption; but this is refining too much: the word ‘corrupted’ is evidently a figurative term used to denote the perishable nature of the riches. The fact is stated, in a prophetical manner, in the past tense, as having already occurred ‘your riches are corrupted,’ denoting the certain and impending nature of the calamity.
	 and your garments are moth-eaten. The general idea of ‘riches’ is here specialized as consisting in garments and in treasure silver and gold. Among the Orientals garments still often constitute a considerable portion of their riches(compare Matthew 6:19; Acts 20:33).
