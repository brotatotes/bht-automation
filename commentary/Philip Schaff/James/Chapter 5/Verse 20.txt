<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:20">James 5:20</span>. <strong> Let him know,</strong> as an inducement to attempt the work of restoring the erring, <strong> that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way </strong> restores him to the truth
	</p>
<p><strong> shall save a soul from death.</strong> Here, evidently, eternal death is meant, the punishment of the condemned, the death of the soul; a death compared with which the death of the body is but a trifle; thus intimating in the strongest manner the infinite importance of the restoration of the erring.

<p><strong> and shall hide a multitude of sins;</strong> that is, the sins not of the person who converts, but of the person who is converted; the multitude of his sins are blotted out; his actual sins, not the possible sins which the sinner might have committed, but of which his conversion has prevented the commission. The covering of sins is a common phrase for their remission. Thus David says: ‘Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+32:1">Psalms 32:1</span>). And certainly to aim at the conversion of our fellow-men is a far more generous motive presented to us, than if the apostle had appealed to the personal good which such a work would confer upon ourselves in promoting our own holiness, or even to the glorious reward in a future life promised to those who have turned many unto righteousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="da+12:3">Daniel 12:3</span>).
