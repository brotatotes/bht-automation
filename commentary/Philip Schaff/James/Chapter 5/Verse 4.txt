<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:4">James 5:4</span>. Now follows a statement of the sins of the rich on account of which they are punished. Three sins are mentioned injustice, luxury, and oppression. The first sin mentioned is injustice. <strong> Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud.</strong> Some connect the words ‘of you’ with ‘crieth’ ‘crieth from you;’ but our version is admissible, and the more simple. In the law of Moses, it was expressly forbidden to keep back the wages of hired labourers: ‘Thou shaft not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him; the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+19:13">Leviticus 19:13</span>). And again: ‘Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy. At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the Lord, and it be sin unto thee’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+24:14-15">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> crieth</strong>: that is, for assistance to the defrauded, or rather for vengeance on the defrauders; like as Abel’s blood crieth unto God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:10">Genesis 4:10</span>). Compare with this the words of Malachi, which some suppose St. James had here in view: ‘I will be a swift witness against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow and the fatherless, saith the Lord of hosts’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:5">Malachi 3:5</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> and the cries of them that have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.</strong> An Old Testament title of God, generally translated in our version, ‘The Lord of hosts.’ [1] It is only used here in the New Testament, and is highly appropriate, as it was an expression familiar to the Jewish Christians. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:29">Romans 9:29</span>, it occurs as a quotation from the Prophecies of Isaiah. It is expressive of the power of God; as, being the Lord of hosts, He has all agencies at His command, and therefore is able to respond to the cries of the oppressed.

<p style="margin-left:3.6em;"> [1] The Septuagint generally render the <strong> </strong> phrase by ‘Almighty:’ compare <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:8">Revelation 4:8</span>.
