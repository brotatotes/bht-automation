James 5:5. The second sin is luxury or self-indulgence.  Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton  revelled. The Jews at this time were especially addicted to luxury and debauchery.
	 ye have nourished your hearts, that is, yourselves,  as in a day of slaughter. The conjunction ‘as’ is omitted in the best manuscripts. Various meanings have been given to this expression. Some suppose that it denotes a day of feasting, indicative of the luxurious living of the rich; but the omission of the particle of comparison ‘as’ is opposed to this meaning, and besides it would be a mere repetition of the previous clause. Others think that it denotes the carelessness and infatuation of these revellers; that they were like cattle which graze and feed, on the very day of their slaughter, utterly unaware of their danger; the day of slaughter being here regarded as the day of God’s vengeance. Perhaps the correct meaning is: You have nourished yourselves like fed beasts prepared for the slaughter. Thus Neander: ‘As the ox is fattened which is led to the slaughter, so have ye by your devotion to the service of your lusts, and by enjoying yourselves in all security, made yourselves ripe for the impending judgment.’
