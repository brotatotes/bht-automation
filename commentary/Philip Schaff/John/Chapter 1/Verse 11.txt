John 1:11.  He came unto his own home, and his own accepted him not.  Is this verse practically a repetition of John 1:10, in language more solemn and emphatic? Or do we here pass from the thought of the world in general to that of the Jewish people. The question is one of some difficulty. As John 1:12 is certainly quite general in its meaning, it may seem hazardous to introduce a limitation here. But the weight of argument seems on the whole to be on the other side. There is a manifest advance of thought as we pass from the last verse to this. Instead of ‘He was in,’ we find ‘He came unto;’ for ‘the world,’ we have
	‘His own home;’ for ‘knew’ (perceived or recognised), we have ‘accepted.’ Every change seems to point to a more intimate relationship, a clearer manifestation, and a rejection that is still more without excuse. The Word, who was in the world (comp. Proverbs 8:31), had His home with the chosen people (Exodus 19:5; Psalms 76:2), to which had been given the revelation of the truth of God (Romans 9:4). It is still mainly of the Pre-incarnate Word that John speaks. In the whole history of Israel had been illustrated unfaithfulness to the truth (comp. Luke 11:49-50; Acts 7:51-53); and the tender pathos of this verse recalls the words in which Jesus speaks of the rejection of Himself (Matthew 23:37).
