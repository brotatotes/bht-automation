John 1:2.  The same was in the Beginning with God.  ‘The same’ He who has just been spoken of as God was in the beginning ‘with God’:    i.e.,   ‘He of whom I have spoken as God, was in the beginning in active, eternal communion with God, not simply the Word with God, but God with God.’ The elements of the thought have been given in John 1:1, but in their combination they acquire new force. The special object of these words seems to be to prepare for the next verse; it is only when we have been taught concerning ‘God with God’ that we are prepared to hear of the creation of all things ‘  through  ’ the Divine Word. He with whom the Divine Word ‘was in the beginning’ created all through Him.
