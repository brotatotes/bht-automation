<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:21">John 1:21</span>. <strong> And they asked him, what then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. </strong> The question was a natural one, for the thought of the coming of Elijah was intimately associated with that of the coming of Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:5">Malachi 4:5</span>). The answer seems less natural, for <strong> </strong> our Lord, when <strong> </strong> He spoke of the Baptist, described him as ‘Elijah which was for to come’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:14">Matthew 11:14</span>). It is possible that even the Baptist himself did not Know <strong> </strong> that he was ‘Elijah’ in <strong> </strong> this latter sense, and hence could reply without hesitation that he <strong> </strong> is not that prophet.

<p><strong> Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No. </strong> A third supposition is tried. Is he ‘the prophet’? A comparison of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:25">John 1:25</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:40-41">John 7:40-41</span>, with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:14-15">John 6:14-15</span>, seems to lead to the conclusion that there were at this time two currents of opinion with regard to the coming prophet (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>), the one distinguishing him from the Messiah, the other maintaining that the two characters would be united in ‘him that should come.’ But that a prophet would certainly appear at the opening of the Messianic age was expected by all. Hence the question, as now put, covered the only other supposition that could explain the important position which the Baptist had assumed, and which appeared to indicate that he was introducing a new era. But the main point with the Baptist is to show that, strictly speaking, he is simply the herald of that era. He is only to prepare the way for Him in whom it both begins and is completed (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:11-13">Matthew 11:11-13</span>). The new supposition is accordingly repudiated in terms as emphatic as before.
