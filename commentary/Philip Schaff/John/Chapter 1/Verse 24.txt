<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:24">John 1:24</span>. <strong> And some from among the Pharisees had been sent. </strong> We cannot doubt that these words are introduced to lead on to the following statement, rather than to give completeness to the account of the preceding verses. It is not necessary, however, to think of a second and entirely new deputation. The persons now introduced may have formed part of the first body of questioners. But the point of special interest to them is that which meets us in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:25">John 1:25</span>, rather than that already spoken of, They were Pharisees, and the Pharisees considered themselves the guardians of the ordinances of religious worship amongst their countrymen. Hence the significance of the statements in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:1">John 4:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:13-15">John 9:13-15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:42">John 12:42</span>; and also of the question which is now addressed to the Baptist. That question does not necessarily indicate a hostile bearing towards him; nor during the earlier part of the life of Jesus do the Pharisees in general appear to have opposed the Saviour in the same manner as the ‘Jews’ (comp. on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:1">John 3:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:32">John 7:32</span>).
