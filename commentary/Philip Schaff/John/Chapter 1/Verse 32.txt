John 1:32.  And John bare witness, saying. I have beheld the Spirit descending.  The effect of what the Baptist had seen had remained, and still remains, with him in all its power: ‘I  have   beheld.’
	 And it abode upon him.  John had not merely seen the Spirit descend with dove-like motion upon Jesus; he had also seen that it ‘abode’ upon Him, the symbol of an abiding and permanent possession.
