John 1:38.  And Jesus turned and beheld them following, and saith unto them, What seek yet?  They who thus follow Jesus shall not do so in vain. As in the sense of their own unworthiness they walked after Him, He turned, and inquired what they sought.
	 And they said unto him, Rabbi, which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher, where abidest thou? ‘Where is Thy permanent resting-place and home, that as pupils we may seek Thee there, and  may abide with Thee till we have seen the glory of which we have heard?’ By the title Rabbi (which strictly meant  my master   or    lord,   but which in the time of Jesus had already come to be applied to teachers) they had been wont to address their own master (chap. John 3:26); and they naturally give the same name of honour to Jesus. When they have done with ‘seeking,’ when they have found Him, they will say more (comp. John 13:13).
