As in the sense of their own unworthiness they walked after Him, He turned, and inquired what they sought.

<p><strong> And they said unto him, Rabbi, which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher, where abidest thou?</strong> ‘Where is Thy permanent resting-place and home, that as pupils we may seek Thee there, and <em> may</em> abide with Thee till we have seen the glory of which we have heard?’ By the title Rabbi (which strictly meant <em> my master</em> <strong> </strong> or <strong> </strong> <em> lord,</em> <strong> </strong> but which in the time of Jesus had already come to be applied to teachers) they had been wont to address their own master (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:26">John 3:26</span>); and they naturally give the same name of honour to Jesus. When they have done with ‘seeking,’ when they have found Him, they will say more (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:13">John 13:13</span>).
