<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:40">John 1:40</span>. <strong> One of the two which heard from John and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.</strong> Andrew belonged to Bethsaida (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:44">John 1:44</span>), and is again referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:8">John 6:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:22">John 12:22</span>. That he is now spoken of as the brother of Peter is an interesting indication of the importance attached by the Evangelist to the latter. There is little reason to doubt that the second of the two was the Evangelist himself. Simon Peter, who has not yet been mentioned, is introduced to us here as if he were well known to the reader an illustration of the writer’s tendency to anticipate what is hereafter to be fully explained: we have an equally striking instance in the mention of Mary in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:2">John 11:2</span>.
