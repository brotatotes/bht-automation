John 1:41.  He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ). The peculiar language of this verse leads directly to the conclusion that each of the two disciples mentioned in the previous verse had gone in search of his brother, and the fact is not without interest as confirming the supposition that the second of the two disciples was John. Andrew and his brother, John and his brother, seem to have been the only two pairs of brothers in the apostolic band. The finding was not accidental. Andrew had gone in search of Peter, John of James. When Andrew found the object of his search, his joyful announcement was, ‘We have found the Messiah.’ This Hebrew term occurring only twice in the New Testament, here and at John 3:25, in the mouth of the woman of Samaria denotes ‘the Anointed One;’ and is immediately interpreted by the Evangelist, the Greek word ‘Christ’ having the same meaning. One of the great hopes of Israel was fulfilled.
