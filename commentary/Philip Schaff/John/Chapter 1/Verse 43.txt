John 1:43.    The next day he would go forth into Galilee. On this day begins the journey consummated at John 2:1 (see note). And he findeth Philip; and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me. The first two disciples had ‘sought’ and ‘followed’ Jesus; then they had found Him. Now Jesus (seeks and) ‘finds’ Philip, and bids him follow Him (compare the two parables in Matthew 13:44; Matthew 13:46). We are left to infer that the command was immediately obeyed. The calling of Philip and of Nathanael is recorded by John alone; both Matthew and Mark relate that Jesus called to Him Andrew and Peter, James and John (Matthew 4:18-22; Mark 1:16-20; compare Luke 5:1-11); but it will be remembered that this was a second summons, later (by some months, probably) than the events of which we are reading here.
