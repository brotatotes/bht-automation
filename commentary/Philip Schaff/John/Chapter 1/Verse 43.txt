And he findeth Philip; and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me. The first two disciples had ‘sought’ and ‘followed’ Jesus; then they had found Him. Now Jesus (seeks and) ‘finds’ Philip, and bids him follow Him (compare the two parables in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:44">Matthew 13:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:46">Matthew 13:46</span>). We are left to infer that the command was immediately obeyed. The calling of Philip and of Nathanael is recorded by John alone; both Matthew and Mark relate that Jesus called to Him Andrew and Peter, James and John (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:18-22">Matthew 4:18-22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:16-20">Mark 1:16-20</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:1-11">Luke 5:1-11</span>); but it will be remembered that this was a second summons, later (by some months, probably) than the events of which we are reading here.
