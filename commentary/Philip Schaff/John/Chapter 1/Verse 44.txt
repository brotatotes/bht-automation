<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:44">John 1:44</span>. <strong> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, out of the city of Andrew and Peter. </strong> This verse appears to be inserted for the purpose of clearly showing that these three disciples were Galileans. The next verse would lead to a similar inference in regard to Nathanael, and this inference is confirmed by chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:2">John 21:2</span>. It is thus an undesigned (but not the less striking) proof of the Johannine authorship of this Gospel that a similar statement is not made with regard to the two disciples of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:37-40">John 1:37-40</span>. John is aware that he was himself well known to be a Galilean. In simple consciousness that he was so, and that no one would doubt it, he omits notice of the fact in his own case and that of his brother. But he felt it of importance to bring out the Galilean birth of the others. We might have supposed them to be Judeans; but Judas is the only Judean of the apostolic circle. The importance of the fact in the mind of the Evangelist is connected with the opinion entertained by him of ‘the Jews’ and of <strong> ‘</strong> Judas.’</p>
