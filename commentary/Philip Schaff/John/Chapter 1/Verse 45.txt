<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:45">John 1:45</span>. <strong> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</strong> It was in all probability on the journey from Bethany beyond Jordan to Cana of Galilee that Jesus had ‘found’ Philip. As on the journey recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:13">Luke 24:13</span>, the conversation turned on the things concerning the promised Saviour which were contained in ‘Moses and all the prophets;’ and to this conversation the particular form of conviction impressed upon the mind of Philip was due. He does not speak of Jesus simply as the Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:41">John 1:41</span>), but as the fulfilment of the law and the prophets. There is an advance in fulness on the confession of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:41">John 1:41</span>, and the special character of the advance is important; it helps to explain the words of the following verse. There is nothing accidental in the finding of Nathanael. Philip had gone in search of him in particular. Can we doubt that it was because he knew him to be specially fitted and ready to be a follower of Jesus?
