<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:48">John 1:48</span>. <strong> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me?</strong> The words of Jesus had been spoken while Nathanael was drawing near, and the latter heard them. He does not deny the truth of the commendation, and yet it can hardly be said, on the other hand, that he accepts it. It is enough for him that he sees that he is discerned by one whom he had not previously met, and what he asks is, Whence gettest Thou Thy knowledge of me? Who has told Thee anything about me?

<p><strong> Jesus answered and said unto </strong> <strong> him,</strong> <strong> Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee</strong>. Jesus replies by referring to a previous, probably recent, incident in his history. The heart of the guileless man had been so moved by the great thoughts stirring at that time with respect to the Saviour at hand, that he had retired under a fig tree to study the Scriptures, or meditate, or pray. It is this that (as the Greek implies) is now brought to his recollection not his <em> being</em> under the fig tree, but his <em> having gone</em> under it; and we are thus rather invited than forbidden to suppose that the emotions filling his heart at the moment, and impelling him to seek solitude, had been peculiarly strong. Then Jesus had seen him, and had recognised in him one of His sheep, just as His sheep recognise Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:16">John 10:16</span>). If the incident had taken place in Nathanaelâ€™s own Cana, it must have been all the more striking to him that it should thus be known. But, however this may have been, these wonderful words of Jesus, coming suddenly upon him after long preparation for them and after the instructions just given him by Philip, at once set his heart on fire, and drew from him the memorable confession which follows.</p>
