<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:50">John 1:50</span>. <strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.</strong> An intimation of that growth of divine revelation which this Gospel teaches us shall be made the portion of all,-of some to an ever-increasing fulness of blessing, of others to an ever-increasing fulness of judgment. For the one, see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:12">John 14:12</span>; for the other, chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:20">John 5:20</span>. These ‘greater things’ are more particularly mentioned in the next verse.</p>
