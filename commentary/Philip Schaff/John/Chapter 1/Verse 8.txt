John 1:8.  He was not the Light, but he was that he might bear witness concerning the Light.  The thought of the greatness of the witness borne by John underlies the words of this verse. Great as the Baptist was, he was not the Light. What he  was is not expressed, but only the purpose which he was to fulfil (comp. John 1:23). It is very possible that the words may have had a special application to the opinions which (as we learn from Acts 18:25; Acts 19:3) existed at Ephesus with regard to the mission of John.
