<p>We enter here upon the second great division of the Gospel, extending from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span>, and containing the presentation of Jesus, as He takes His place in the field of human history and, alike in the witness borne to Him by the Baptist and in His manifestation of Himself to His disciples, shows us what He is. When we know Him we shall be prepared to follow Him, as He enters upon and accomplishes His work in the world. That work in the proper sense of the word does not yet begin. The first section of this division extends from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:34">John 1:34</span>, and contains the witness of the Baptist. The subordinate parts of this section are (1) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19-28">John 1:19-28</span>, the witness by the Baptist on the first day spoken of; (2) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29-34">John 1:29-34</span>, His witness on the second day.
