We enter here upon the second great division of the Gospel, extending from John 1:19 to John 2:11, and containing the presentation of Jesus, as He takes His place in the field of human history and, alike in the witness borne to Him by the Baptist and in His manifestation of Himself to His disciples, shows us what He is. When we know Him we shall be prepared to follow Him, as He enters upon and accomplishes His work in the world. That work in the proper sense of the word does not yet begin. The first section of this division extends from John 1:19 to John 1:34, and contains the witness of the Baptist. The subordinate parts of this section are (1) John 1:19-28, the witness by the Baptist on the first day spoken of; (2) John 1:29-34, His witness on the second day.
