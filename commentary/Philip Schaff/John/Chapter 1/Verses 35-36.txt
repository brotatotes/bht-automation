John 1:35-36.  In these verses we have a new testimony borne by the Baptist to Jesus.  In John 1:29 we were simply told that John ‘seeth Jesus coining unto him and saith;’  to whom   the words were spoken we know not. There is therefore great importance in the definite statement of John 1:35, that John now spoke in the presence of disciples. The Baptist came to deliver a general witness respecting Jesus; but he also came to direct to Jesus all over whom he had gained influence. The words which he utters are few, so that the second testimony may seem inferior to the first. We may perhaps say that it is not really inferior. When the earlier words (John 1:29) had once made clear what was signified by the announcement of ‘the Lamb of God,’ this title by itself, in its own simplicity, really conveyed a fuller meaning. ‘The Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world’ brought to mind the paschal  sacrifice;   but in pointing to Jesus as ‘the Lamb of God,’ the Baptist, implying all that he had expressed before, presents to the thought all the symbolism of the words, with the true paschal  sacrifice joining the true paschal  feast.
