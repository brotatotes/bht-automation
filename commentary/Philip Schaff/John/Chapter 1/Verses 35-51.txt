<p>The same general subject is continued in this section Jesus taking His place on the stage of history. We pass now, however, from the witness of the Baptist, given on two successive days, to the manifestation of Himself by Jesus to hearts open to receive and welcome Him. This manifestation takes place upon two successive days. The subordinate parts of the present section are (1) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:35-42">John 1:35-42</span>, witness borne on the first of the two new days (the third day from that of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>); (2) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:43-51">John 1:43-51</span>, witness borne on the second day (the fourth day).
