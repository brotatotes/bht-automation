John 10:17.  Therefore doth the  Father love me, because I lay down my life  that I may take it again.  In John 10:15 we have read of the Father’s recognition of the Good Shepherd, who gives the highest proof of His devotion to the shepherd’s work and possession of the shepherd’s character in laying down His life for the sheep. These verses take up and expand that thought, speaking not of recognition only but of love. But it is with John 10:16 that John 10:17 is immediately connected. ‘I must’ had expressed complete union with His Father’s will: the prophecy that follows brought into view the full and certain accomplishment of the Father’s purpose. On this account, because of this union of will and this devotion to His purpose, ‘the Father’ (note once more how perfect is the fitness of this name here) loveth Him, namely, because He layeth down His life that He may take it again. The two parts of this statement must be closely joined together. The perfect conformity to the Father’s will is shown not in laying down the life only, but also in taking it again. The duty of the Shepherd, as set forth in John 10:15-16, can only in this way be accomplished. He gives His life to purchase life for His sheep, but besides this He must continue to lead the flock of which He is the Only Shepherd. In the execution of His work, therefore, He could not give Himself to death without the purpose of taking His life again: He died that His own may ever live in His life. But, if the Father’s love can rest on the Son who is obedient even unto death, and unto life through death, it is essential that the obedience be entirely free. Hence the words of the next verse.
