John 10:19.  There arose a  division again among  the Jews because of  these words. The effect related in chap. John 7:43, John 9:16, is again produced. This time however (as in chap. John 8:31) ‘the Jews’ themselves are divided. The preceding parable therefore must have been spoken in the hearing of many who were hostile to Jesus, as well as of Pharisees (chap. John 9:40) who may have been half convinced.
