They had already received sufficient evidence, and to this He refers them. He again speaks of both word and deed. What He had said (see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:36">John 8:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:56">John 8:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:58">John 8:58</span>) had shown clearly who He is; what He had done had borne witness concerning Him (see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:36">John 5:36</span>).
