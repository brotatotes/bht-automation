John 10:25.  Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Fatherâ€™s name, they bear witness concerning me.  A demand so made was never granted by Jesus. They had already received sufficient evidence, and to this He refers them. He again speaks of both word and deed. What He had said (see chap. John 5:19, John 8:36; John 8:56; John 8:58) had shown clearly who He is; what He had done had borne witness concerning Him (see chap. John 5:36). But both word and works had failed to lead them to belief in Him.
