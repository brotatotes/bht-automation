<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:26">John 10:26</span>. <strong> But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep. </strong> In chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:47">John 8:47</span> He had said that they heard not His words because they were not of God: the same thought is expressed here, but with a change of figure. There is no reference to an essential or necessary state, to any ‘decree’ through the operation of <strong> </strong> which they were <strong> </strong> incapable of faith. They have not the character, the disposition, of His sheep; through this moral defect (for which they are themselves responsible, see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span>, etc.) they will not believe. This is brought out more fully in the next verse.</p>
