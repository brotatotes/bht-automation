John 10:26.  But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.  In chap. John 8:47 He had said that they heard not His words because they were not of God: the same thought is expressed here, but with a change of figure. There is no reference to an essential or necessary state, to any ‘decree’ through the operation of   which they were   incapable of faith. They have not the character, the disposition, of His sheep; through this moral defect (for which they are themselves responsible, see chap. John 3:19, etc.) they will not believe. This is brought out more fully in the next verse.
