<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:31">John 10:31</span>. <strong> The Jews took up</strong> <strong> stones again to stone him. </strong> Their view of the blasphemy of His words is given more fully in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:33">John 10:33</span>. The word ‘again’ carries us back to chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:59">John 8:59</span>, where a similar attempt is recorded, but in less definite language. There we see the Jews taking up, hastily snatching up, stones that lay near, to ‘cast on Him:’ here their resolve to inflict the penalty for blasphemy appears more distinctly in their attempt to ‘stone Him.’ The two words rendered ‘take up’ are also different, and it is possible that the Evangelist here presents the Jews as bearing up the stones on high, in the very act of preparing to bury Him beneath them. The climax ought not to pass unobserved. They are arrested by His words.</p>
