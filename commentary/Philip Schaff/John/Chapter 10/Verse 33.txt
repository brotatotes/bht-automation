John 10:33.  The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.  These words show conclusively how the saying of John 10:30 was understood by those who heard it: they perceive now who is meant by ‘the Father’ (comp. John 8:27), and see that to claim oneness with Him is to claim Deity. All recollection of ‘good works’ and indeed all evidence whatever they cast away, treating such a claim as incapable of support by any evidence.
