<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:37">John 10:37</span>. <strong> If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. </strong> In the last verse ‘the Father’ was the Name of which Jesus spoke, thus bringing together in thought God who spoke in the psalm and His Father who sent Him into the world. Here, after the mention of ‘the Son of God,’ He says <strong> </strong> ‘the works of <em> my</em> Father.’ If <strong> </strong> He does no such works they have no right to believe His word and acknowledge His claims. It is otherwise it He does them.</p>
