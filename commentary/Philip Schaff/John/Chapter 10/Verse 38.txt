John 10:38.  But if I do, even if ye believe not me, believe the works:  that ye may know, and recognise, that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.  If He does the works of His Father, then, even although they might be unwilling to accept His witness respecting Himself, the works bear a testimony they are bound to receive. Receiving this testimony and thus learning that the works of Jesus are the Father’s works, men will know that He and the Father are one, the Father abiding in Him, and He in the Father. But this is not a truth learnt once for all. The words of Jesus are: that ye may ‘know’ (being brought to conviction by the testimony of the works) and (from that point onwards continually) ‘recognise’ . . . Their eyes once opened, they will ever see in the works tokens of the Father’s presence.
