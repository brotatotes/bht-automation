John 10:39.  They sought again to seize him: and he went  forth out of their hand.  ‘Again’ seems   to point back to chap. 7 , where the same word ‘seize’ is found three times (John 7:30; John 7:32; John 7:44). We cannot suppose that the Jews had laid aside their design of stoning Him in consequence of the words just spoken, for these words would either lead to faith or repel to greater enmity. For some reason not mentioned they now seek not to stone Him on the spot, but to seize Him and carry Him away. As in chap. John 8:59, ‘He went forth’ out of their hand, thus illustrating again His own words in John 10:18.
