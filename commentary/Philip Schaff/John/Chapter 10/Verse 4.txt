<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:4">John 10:4</span>. <strong> When he hath put out all his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. </strong> The first words take up the thought contained in the words that immediately precede (‘and leadeth them out’), but <strong> </strong> express it with greater force. The shepherd leads forth <em> all</em> his own sheep, not one is left behind. But the change from <em> leading out</em> to <em> putting out</em> is remarkable. In the figure it may refer to the solicitude of the shepherd to remove every sheep under his care from the fold in which it is not well that any should longer remain: some may be slow in following his lead, but he sees that none shall be overlooked. The real significance of this word, however, is connected with the interpretation of the parable (see below): for we cannot doubt that our Lord designedly uses here that very word which was employed to denote expulsion from the synagogue, and which has already met us in two consecutive verses of the previous chapter ( 34 , 35 ), when the treatment received from the Jews by the man born blind is described. In this verse again we find complete faithfulness of description. To this day the Eastern shepherd goes before his flock, leading, not driving the sheep, and keeping them near him through their recognition of his voice.</p>
