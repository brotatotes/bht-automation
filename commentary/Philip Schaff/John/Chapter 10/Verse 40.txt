<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:40">John 10:40</span>. <strong> And he went away again beyond Jordan unto the place where John was at first baptizing; and there he abode. </strong> The place in which John <em> at first</em> baptized was that mentioned in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:28">John 1:28</span> (not in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:22">John 3:22</span>), viz. Bethany beyond Jordan. But why does the Evangelist here make special mention of this fact? It would seem that we have another illustration of his tendency at the close of a period of the history to go <strong> </strong> back to the beginning of that period. He gathers together the whole ministry of Jesus up to this <strong> </strong> time under one point of view. With the next chapter we really enter on the final scene: in the raising of Lazarus the work of Jesus reaches its culminating-point; by that miracle His rejection and condemnation by the Jews is made certain. And as in a mountain ascent the traveller may pause before attempting the highest peak, and survey the long path by which he has ascended, so the Evangelist here pauses before relating the last struggle, and (by mentioning the association of the place and not the name of the place itself) leads his readers to survey with him all the period of the ministry of Him to whom John bore witness. Whatever Jesus had since done or said ratified the witness borne by the Baptist. Possibly it was because of John’s testimony that Jesus sought this spot: near it may have lived many whose hearts had been prepared for His teaching. What He did during His stay in Bethany beyond Jordan, or how long was His stay, we do not know. We may certainly suppose that He taught; and the next verse suggests that ‘signs’ were wrought.
