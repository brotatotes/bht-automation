<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:6">John 10:6</span>. <strong> This parable said Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. </strong> The word here used is not that which occurs so frequently in the other gospels in the sense of <em> parable.</em> It is found but four times in the New Testament in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:22">2 Peter 2:22</span>, and <strong> </strong> in three verses of this Gospel (here and chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:25">John 16:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:29">John 16:29</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:22">2 Peter 2:22</span> the word has its ordinary signification ‘proverb:’ in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:29">John 16:29</span> it is opposed to speaking in a way the <em> most direct</em>, the <em> highest and best</em> for the attainment of the speaker’s end (comp. on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:25">John 16:25</span>). The derivation of the word suggests that the primary meaning was <em> a saying beside</em> or <em> out of the common way</em> which had not the direct plain bearing of an ordinary saying, but either was intended to have many applications (as a <em> proverb),</em> <strong> </strong> or was in some degree circuitous in the method by which it effected its purpose, enigmatical or difficult. In this latter sense John seems to use the word, which does not therefore differ essentially from the ‘parable,’ as that word is used by the other Evangelists (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:11-15">Matthew 13:11-15</span>). It seems certain that had any one of them related the comparison of this chapter he would have employed the more familiar name. The Septuagint uses the two words with little difference of sense. On the present occasion it cannot be said that the language of Jesus was in itself difficult to understand; His description was faithful in all its parts; but His words as said ‘to them’ the Pharisees could not comprehend.</p>
