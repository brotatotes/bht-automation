The contest with the Jews is continued. The section strikingly illustrates the plan of the gospel ( 1 ) by taking up again that claim of Jesus to be the Son of God which had, more than anything else, provoked the opposition of His enemies; ( 2 ) by bringing into notice His return to Bethany beyond Jordan, where He had been first made manifest by the Baptist to Israel, and where confession is now made by ‘many’ that everything spoken of Him by the Baptist at His entrance upon His public ministry had proved true. We have here, therefore, the culminating- point of the conflict, and the pause before the highest manifestation by Jesus of Himself as the Resurrection and the Life. The subordinate parts are ( 1 ) John 10:22-39; ( 2 ) John 10:40-42.
