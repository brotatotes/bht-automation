And many believed in him there. </strong> How great the contrast between the scene presented here and those of the preceding chapters! He came to the Jews, but, in spite of works and word, they rejected Him: now, in His retirement, many come unto Him, and many believe in Him. For Jesus this period of rest is a period not of peace only, but also of joy in successful toil. Another contrast implied is between Jesus and the Baptist ‘who did no sign’ but bare witness only. He being dead yet speaketh, in that his testimony is leading men to Jesus in the very place of his own ministry: and there also witness is borne to him, in the emphatic acknowledgment that all his words concerning Jesus had proved true. Nay, even beyond the experience of these believers we may see that this saying expresses truth, for in His most memorable discourses Jesus fulfils the word of the Baptist recorded in chap. 1 of this Gospel, ‘He that cometh after me has become before me because He was before me’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:27">John 1:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:30">John 1:30</span>).
