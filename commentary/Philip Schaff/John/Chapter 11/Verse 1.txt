<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:1">John 11:1</span>. <strong> Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus, of Bethany, from the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</strong> The scene of the miracle to be related in this chapter is Bethany, a village (now small and poor) about two miles south-east of Jerusalem over the southern shoulder of the Mount of Olives. Neither here nor in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:44">John 1:44</span> is the use of the two prepositions ‘of’ and ‘from’ intended to point to two different places, one the present abode, the other the original home; but Bethany itself is ‘the village of Mary and her sister Martha.’ The circumstance referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:2">John 11:2</span> probably accounts for the prior mention of Mary, for Martha appears to have been the elder sister (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:38">Luke 10:38</span>). The name Lazarus is Hebrew (a shortened form of Eleazar) but with a Greek termination.</p>
