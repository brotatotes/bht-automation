John 11:20.  Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him; but Mary sat still in the house.  Every reader must be struck with the remarkable coincidence between this narrative and that of Luke 10:38-39, in the portraiture of the two sisters. Martha, even in the midst of her sorrow occupied with attention to family concerns, sees the messenger who announces the approach of Jesus and goes forth to meet Him, outside the   village (John 11:30). Mary, absorbed in her   grief, hears nothing of the message: it is not until Martha returns to her that she learns that Jesus is near.
