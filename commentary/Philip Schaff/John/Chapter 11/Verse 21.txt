John 11:21.  Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here,  my brother  had not died.  Her first words express no reproach, but   only the   bitter thought of help come too late. In His presence her brother could not have died (comp. John 11:15  ). O f the possibility that Jesus might have   spoken the word of help, even though their message might reach Him too late to bring Him to their dying brother, she says nothing, though the   Jews, unchecked by the reverence of love, freely ask the question among themselves (John 11:37).
