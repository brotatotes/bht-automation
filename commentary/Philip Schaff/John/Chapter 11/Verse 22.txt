<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:22">John 11:22</span>. <strong> And even now I know that whatsoever things thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee. </strong> The words of this verse are very remarkable. The presence of the great Friend and Helper seems to give a sudden quickening to Martha’s faith. She had probably heard of the words of Jesus when the tidings of the sickness of Lazarus reached Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:4">John 11:4</span>); and these words (which no doubt sorrow of heart and painful waiting had almost banished from her thought) surely gave ground for hope ‘even now.’ And yet, though truly expressive of the firmest confidence in Jesus, her words are vague; and the later narrative seems to prove that no definite expectation was present to her mind. The language is rather that of one who so believes in Jesus as to be assured that, where He is, help and blessing cannot be absent.</p>
