John 11:23.  Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.  The words are designedly ambiguous, spoken to try her faith. Like our Lord’s parables, they contain that of which faith may take hold and be raised into a higher region, but which unbelief or dulness of heart will miss. Will the hope that Martha’s words have vaguely expressed now become clear and definite? At all events the answer of Jesus will make her conscious to herself of what her faith really was.
