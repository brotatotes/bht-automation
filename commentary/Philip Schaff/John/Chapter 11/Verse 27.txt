John 11:27.  She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, he that cometh into the world.  The substitution of ‘I have believed’ for ‘I believe’ is striking. It seems to imply that she goes back on her previous belief, securely founded, never shaken, in which she knows that all He requires must be contained. His last words have been in some measure new and unfamiliar, and in her present state of   mind she is incapable of comparing the old and the new. But that which she has believed and still believes contains the fullest recognition of her Lord. She has received Him as the fulfilment of Messianic hope, the revelation of the Divine to man, the long-expected Redeemer of the world.
