<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:32">John 11:32</span>. <strong> Mary, therefore, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him fell at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. </strong> Her first words are nearly the same as her sister’s: there is only in the Greek a slight difference in the place of ‘my’ which gives a touching emphasis to the expression of personal loss. Often may the sisters have repeated <strong> </strong> such words during their hours of anguish, when their <strong> </strong> brother was sinking before their eyes. Mary’s absorbing grief makes other words impossible: <strong> </strong> she falls at the feet of Jesus weeping.
