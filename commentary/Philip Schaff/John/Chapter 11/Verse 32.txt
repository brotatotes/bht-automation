John 11:32.  Mary, therefore, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him fell at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  Her first words are nearly the same as her sister’s: there is only in the Greek a slight difference in the place of ‘my’ which gives a touching emphasis to the expression of personal loss. Often may the sisters have repeated   such words during their hours of anguish, when their   brother was sinking before their eyes. Mary’s absorbing grief makes other words impossible:   she falls at the feet of Jesus weeping.
