John 11:40.  Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see  the  glory of God? Martha would have prevented the removal of the stone; but this wish was but a symbol of a real hindrance in the Saviour’s way, her decline in faith. She has for the time come completely under the influence of ‘the things seen:  ’  the reality of her loss is too much for her, and she cannot join the words of Jesus in John 11:25-26 with His present actions. In saying ‘believe’ he recalls those words of His to her thought; and not those words only, but also His first saying (John 11:4  ),  that the sickness was ‘not unto death, but for the glory of God.’
