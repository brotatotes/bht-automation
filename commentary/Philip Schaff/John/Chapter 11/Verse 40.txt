Martha would have prevented the removal of the stone; but this wish was but a symbol of a real hindrance in the Saviour’s way, her decline in faith. She has for the time come completely under the influence of ‘the things seen: <strong> ’ </strong> the reality of her loss is too much for her, and she cannot join the words of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:25-26">John 11:25-26</span> with His present actions. In saying ‘believe’ he recalls those words of His to her thought; and not those words only, but also His first saying (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:4">John 11:4</span> <strong> ), </strong> that the sickness was ‘not unto death, but for the glory of God.’</p>
