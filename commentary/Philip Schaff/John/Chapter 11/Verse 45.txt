John 11:45.  Many therefore of the Jews, they which came to Mary, and beheld the things which Jesus did, believed in  him.  The statement is very remarkable, but the language of the original is so clear as to leave no doubt as to the meaning. The great manifestations of our Lord to the people, whether in word or in miracle, were usually, as we have several times seen, followed by a marked division of opinion and feeling among His hearers. There is such a division in the present instance, as the next verse shows; but the effect of the miracle is great beyond precedent, for all those of ‘the Jews  ’  who had come to the house of Mary (John 11:19), and who with her witnessed the actions of Jesus, became believers in Him.
