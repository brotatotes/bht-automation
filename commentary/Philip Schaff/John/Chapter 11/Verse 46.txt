<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:46">John 11:46</span>. <strong> But some</strong> <strong> of them went away</strong> <strong> to the</strong> <strong> Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus</strong> <strong> had done. </strong> It is impossible, we think, that what is here related can have been done with friendly motives, or from a mere sense of duty to men whose <strong> </strong> office made them spiritual guides of the people. The analogy of many passages in which John <strong> </strong> similarly records diverging opinions makes it plain that the giving of this information to the Pharisees was an act of hostility to Jesus. If so, the word ‘them’ <strong> </strong> at the beginning of the verse must refer to ‘the Jews <strong> ’ </strong> in general, not to those who are described in the preceding verse. Some of ‘the Jews’ may have been found amongst the multitude which, as we know, stood round (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:42">John 11:42</span>), having no connection with the mourning of the sisters, and therefore not included in the description of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:45">John 11:45</span>. At this period of our Lord’s history the Pharisees have as a body declared against Him; to this large and powerful sect, therefore, the news of the event is brought.</p>
