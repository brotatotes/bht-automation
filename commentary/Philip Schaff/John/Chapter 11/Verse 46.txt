John 11:46.  But some  of them went away  to the  Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus  had done.  It is impossible, we think, that what is here related can have been done with friendly motives, or from a mere sense of duty to men whose   office made them spiritual guides of the people. The analogy of many passages in which John   similarly records diverging opinions makes it plain that the giving of this information to the Pharisees was an act of hostility to Jesus. If so, the word ‘them’   at the beginning of the verse must refer to ‘the Jews  ’  in general, not to those who are described in the preceding verse. Some of ‘the Jews’ may have been found amongst the multitude which, as we know, stood round (John 11:42), having no connection with the mourning of the sisters, and therefore not included in the description of John 11:45. At this period of our Lord’s history the Pharisees have as a body declared against Him; to this large and powerful sect, therefore, the news of the event is brought.
