<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:5">John 11:5</span>. <strong> Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. </strong> This simple record of His love for this family (note how significant is the separate mention of each one of the three) connects itself both with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:4">John 11:4</span> and also with the statement of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:5-6">John 11:5-6</span>, these verses really constituting one sentence. The object of the Evangelist is to set before us the mind of Jesus: in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:4">John 11:4</span> we see the first principle of all, supreme regard to the glory of God; here His love for those on whom the affliction must fall, and whom (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:6">John 11:6</span>) He cannot help save at the hour appointed by His Father. But when that hour has come, His obedience to His Father’s will and His love for His sorrowing friends unite in leading Him to Bethany (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:7">John 11:7</span>). The word ‘loved’ used in this verse is different from that which we find in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:3">John 11:3</span>. The sisters use that which belongs to tender human friendship (see note on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:20">John 5:20</span>); the Evangelist the more lofty word, which so often expresses the relation of Jesus to His disciples. He loved them with a love with which the thought of His Father’s love to Himself is mingled.</p>
