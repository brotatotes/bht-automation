<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:54">John 11:54</span>. <strong> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went away thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there abode with the disciples. </strong> The time of ‘free speech’ (see note on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:4">John 7:4</span>) was at an end: from this time Jesus avoided communication with ‘the Jews,’ no longer vouchsafing to them the word which they heard only to reject. The place to which He withdrew afforded a deeper solitude than that sought by Him a little while before (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:40">John 10:40</span>). The crisis in His life is graver; the retirement which he seeks is more profound. There is no mention now (as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:41">John 10:41</span>) of many who resorted unto Him: the town to which He retired is described as ‘near to the wilderness.’ Ephraim, possibly the same as Ophrah (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1sa+13:17">1 Samuel 13:17</span>), is commonly identified with el-Taiyibeh, a village 16 miles from Jerusalem and 4 or 5 east of Bethel, situated on a hill <strong> </strong> which commands the valley of the Jordan. The wilderness will be ‘the wild uncultivated hill country north-east of Jerusalem, lying between the central towns and the Jordan valley’ ( <em> Dict. </em> of <strong> </strong> Bible, i. 569 . See also Stanley, Sinai <strong> </strong> and Palestine, pp. 214 , 419 ).
