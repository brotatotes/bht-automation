John 11:55.  And the passover of the Jews was  nigh at hand.  On these words see   the notes on   chap. John 2:13, John 6:4. No one who has followed the narrative of this Gospel with care up to the   present point can doubt that the expression is used with deep, indeed with terrible significance.
	 And many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to purify themselves.  It does not appear that there was any special injunction with regard to purification before the Passover; for such passages as Numbers 9:6-11, 2 Chronicles 30:17-20, would rather indicate that from   the peculiar importance of this feast it was to be observed even where the purification required before all great events could not be obtained. There can be no doubt, however, that it fell under the general law of purification, and that defiled persons did not feel themselves qualified to partake   of the Passover (comp. chap. John 18:28). These   strangers from the country, therefore, assembled in Jerusalem several days before the festival, that in the holy city they might seek the preparation that was requisite.
