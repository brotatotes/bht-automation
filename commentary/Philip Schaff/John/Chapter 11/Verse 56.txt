John 11:56.  They sought therefore for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple-courts, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?  The language is that of   earnest and interested inquiry. Those who are talking together are friendly to Jesus, and hopeful and expectant that He will appear at the   festival. The groups assemble in the temple-courts, where many of them may have come to bring offerings for purification (John 11:55), and where Jesus had been wont to teach. The word ‘therefore’ at the beginning of this verse seems to point to the privacy into which Jesus had retired (John 11:54). These pilgrims came to Jerusalem, hoping to meet with Jesus, but they saw Him not: they sought Him therefore, etc. (comp. chap. John 7:11).
