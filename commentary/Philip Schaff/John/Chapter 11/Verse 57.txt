John 11:57.  Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandments, that if any man knew where he were, he should shew it that they might seize him.  As the last verse has described the eager interest of the friends of Jesus, this verse presents a picture of His enemies. In pursuance of the resolve related above (John 11:53) commandments had been issued the plural seems to point to orders sent to all parts of the land that all the faithful should aid the rulers in apprehending Jesus. These latter verses show us the friends and the foes of Jesus alike occupying the field in preparation for the end.
