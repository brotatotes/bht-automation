John 11:7.  Then after that he saith to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again?  Jesus does not say ‘to Bethany,’ but to ‘Judea;’ for He knows that this visit to Bethany will bring Him again into the midst of His enemies, ‘the Jews,’ and will lead to a development of their hatred and malice which will find satisfaction only in His death. In the full consciousness of what awaits Him He prepares to depart for Bethany.
