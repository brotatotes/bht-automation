John 11:34-35.  And he said, where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see. Jesus wept.  The question is addressed to the sisters, and ‘the Jews’ give place to them in thought, for it is in sympathy with the bitter anguish of those whom He loves (well though He knows that He is about to assuage their grief) that the tears of Jesus are shed. The word differs from that used in John 11:31; John 11:33, where the meaning is not calm weeping, but lamentation and wailing.
