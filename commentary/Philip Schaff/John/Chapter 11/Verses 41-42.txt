<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:41-42">John 11:41-42</span>. <strong> They took away the stone therefore. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me. And I myself knew that thou hearest me always; but because of the multitude which standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me. </strong> The words are not a prayer, but a thanksgiving for prayer answered. What He is about to do is given by the Father in answer to His prayer. But had Jesus said no more than this, though the miracle would have ministered to ‘the glory of God <strong> ’ </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:4">John 11:4</span>), <strong> </strong> yet even this purpose would have been attained in an inferior degree: the Father receives true glory when Jesus is acknowledged, not merely as a Prophet, whose prayer is heard, but as the Son of God. To His thanksgiving Jesus adds words which implicitly declare the whole relation of the Father to the Son. The hearing of prayer for which He has given thanks is no isolated act, but is one manifestation of an unceasing communion. Whilst uttering the words of prayer or of thanksgiving, He knew that the Father heard Him always: the words were spoken for the sake of the multitude, that they might believe the truth of His mission. Had they witnessed the miracle unaccompanied by this appeal to His Father, they might well have glorified God who had given such power unto men, and acknowledged that as a wonder-working Prophet Jesus was sent and empowered by God. But if the power of God is manifested now, when this solemn claim is made of constant communion with God, with God as ‘Father,’ the seal of the Father is set upon Him as the Son and the Sent of God. The word ‘multitude’ <strong> </strong> is remarkable. It cannot signify number only and refer to ‘the Jews <strong> ’ </strong> before spoken of. John always employs this word in another sense, and indeed in marked distinction from the ruling class, ‘the Jews.’ It is clear then that many were now present, persons who had accompanied Jesus from Perea and friends and neighbours of the family of Bethany.
