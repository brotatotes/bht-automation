John 11:43-44.  And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth; and he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with gravebands: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them. Loose him, and let him go.  The words   ‘bound hand and   foot’ perhaps   convey a   wrong   impression: as the more literal meaning is ‘his hands and his feet bound with gravebands,’ it is very possible that the limbs were separately bound, so that, life having returned, free movement was permitted to them. The miracle wrought, the Evangelist adds nothing concerning Lazarus or his sisters. It is Jesus Himself who is   the centre of the scene, who has shown Himself the Resurrection and the Life. Even the impression which this most wonderful of miracles produces i  s  recorded only in its relation to Jesus and to belief in Him.
