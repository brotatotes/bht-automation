The most striking of all the miracles of Jesus has been performed, and His manifestation of Himself to the world has ended. The effect   is proportionate.

It is the pause before the last journey to Jerusalem, to which He is to go as the Paschal Lamb selected for the true Paschal sacrifice and feast. The subordinate parts are ( 1 ) John 11:45-46; ( 2 ) John 11:47-53; ( 3 ) John 11:54-57.
