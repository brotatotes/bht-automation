John 11:51-52.  But this spake he not of himself: but being high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation, and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad. The words are a prophecy: heartless and unscrupulous in meaning and intention, they are so controlled as to express profound and blessed truth. In the earlier days of the nation a prophetic spirit was ever believed to rest upon the high priest (comp. Exodus 28:30, Numbers 27:21, Hosea 3:4). When the office became degraded, and the high priest the servant of ambition and covetousness, prophetic guidance was no longer sought from him; but, as in the Old Testament we read of false prophets who in spite of themselves were compelled to be the medium of proclaiming God’s will, so is it here. We see now the significance of the words ‘people’ and ‘nation.’ He prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation,  i.e., for the Jews, henceforth but one of the nations of the world, ranked with the Gentiles whom they scorned. The object of this death should also be, ‘that He might gather into one the children of God that are scattered abroad.’ This latter prophecy is found by the Evangelist in the word ‘people’ of John 11:50, ‘that one man should die for the people.’ No longer does this name belong to Jews alone. The sacrifice is offered in behalf of all the children of God, all to whom the Father offers sonship, gathered henceforth into one under the new name of ‘the people’ of God. Compare the striking parallels in chap. John 7:35, John 10:16, John 17:20.
