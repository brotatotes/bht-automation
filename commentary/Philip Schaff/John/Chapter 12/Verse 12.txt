John 12:12.  The next day,  that is, the day following the feast in Bethany (see on John 12:2), and therefore our Sunday; the day, it may be observed, fixed in the tradition of the Church for the triumphal entry, tradition thus confirming the exegesis of the text, and finding in the latter support for its own correctness. This first day of the Jewish week was the 10 th Nisan, the clay on which the typical Paschal lamb was selected and set apart for sacrifice (Exodus 12:3).
	 The common people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.  ‘The common people’ here spoken of are not ‘the Jews’ (John 12:9), but the multitude that had assembled at Jerusalem at the time in order to celebrate the Passover. It would seem that this crowd was afterwards joined by those belonging to Jerusalem itself who had gone out previously to Bethany to see Jesus (John 12:17). Of the impression produced upon the latter we have already heard. The feelings animating the former appear both in their actions and in their words.
