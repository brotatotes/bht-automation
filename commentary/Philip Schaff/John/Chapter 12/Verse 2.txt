<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:2">John 12:2</span>. <strong> There therefore they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them</strong> <strong> that sat at the table with him. </strong> Two points only are mentioned by John, that a feast was given in honour of Jesus, and that every member of the family so signally blessed was present. By whom, when, and where, the feast was given, are questions to which he returns no answer. Different conclusions may be drawn from the words of this verse; but they seem most naturally to imply that the entertainment was not given in the house or by the family of Lazarus. It is true that ‘Martha served,’ yet we may well suppose that, wherever the feast took place, this was an office she would claim; and the insertion of the clause relating to Lazarus is hardly to be accounted for if Jesus were a guest in his house. As to the question of time, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:12">John 12:12</span> seems to show that the evening of the feast must have been that following the sabbath rather than the evening with which the sabbath commenced. Between this verse therefore and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1">John 12:1</span> we must interpose the rest of the sabbath. We are now at liberty to turn to the account of the Synoptists. Luke relates nothing (in connection with this period) that is similar to the narrative before us; but the other two Evangelists describe a supper and an anointing which manifestly are identical with what John records here. Some slight differences in detail will be called up as the narrative proceeds: the only serious question is one relating to time. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:2">Matthew 26:2</span> we are brought to a date two days before the Passover, whereas the feast in question is related in later verses (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:6-13">John 12:6-13</span>). (Compare also the parallel section in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:0">Mark 14:0</span>) But there is nothing whatever in Matthew’s account to fix the <em> time</em> of the feast; and both the structure of his gospel and the apparent links of connection in this particular narrative are consistent with the view ordinarily taken, that at <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:6">John 12:6</span> he goes back to relate an earlier event, which furnished occasion to Judas for furthering the design of the rulers, as recorded in the first verses of the chapter. If then there is no doubt of the identity of the events mentioned by the Synoptists and by John, we learn that the feast was given in the house of Simon the leper, a person of whom we know nothing more.</p>
