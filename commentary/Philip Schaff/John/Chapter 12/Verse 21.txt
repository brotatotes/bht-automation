John 12:21.  These came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.  To suppose that their object is to ask Jesus to institute a mission to the Gentiles, or to come to them Himself, is to misapprehend the nature of the situation. It is their own personal faith that John desires to bring out.
