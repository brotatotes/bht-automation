John 12:24.  Verily, verily, I say unto you.  There is a general principle lying at the root of the glorification of the ‘  Son of man,’ This is now to be explained and illustrated.
	 Except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth itself alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.  Absolute death, destruction of the principle of life, is not implied. The seed does not actually die: its old covering dies that the germ of life within may spring up in higher forms of beauty, and with many grains instead of one. Such is the law of nature, and to this great law Jesus as ‘Son of man’ must conform: He does not simply lay down a rule for others; as representative of our humanity the rule must first find its application in Himself.
