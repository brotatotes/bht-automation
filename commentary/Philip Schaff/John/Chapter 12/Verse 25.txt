It is a law of the moral world then that he who so loves his soul loses it. By simply living for himself and without thought of others, he ‘loses’ that very thing which he desires to preserve and make happy. On the other hand, he that in this world ‘hateth his soul,’ his soul not brought into subjection to that law of love which is the law of God, and, so hating, denies and crucifies it in order that love may gain the mastery in him, that man shall ‘keep’ it, shall keep it too unto the higher life which is not merely future, but which is even now filled with the Divine and deathless (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:26">Luke 14:26</span>).</p>
