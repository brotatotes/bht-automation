<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:26">John 12:26</span>. <strong> If any</strong> <strong> one serve me, let him follow</strong> <strong> me. </strong> The words apply the law just spoken of as the law of nature and of man, and therefore also as the law of Jesus, to every individual. The ‘following’ is neither general nor outward, but specific and inward, a following in that path of <strong> </strong> suffering and sacrifice even to the cross, the thought of which was at the moment peculiarly present to the mind of Jesus (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:36">John 13:36</span>), and it supposes the possession of His spirit (comp. 12 ). A special emphasis lies upon the first ‘Me,’ as if our Lord would say, ‘If it be Me that any man would serve’

<p><strong> And where I am, there shall also my servant be, </strong> in that glory to which I am immediately to be exalted (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span>).

<p><strong> If any one serve me, him will the Father honour. ‘</strong> Any one,’ Jesus says, for the thought of the universality of His salvation now fills His breast; and ‘ <em> the</em> <strong> </strong> Father,’ even He who will be to all His sons what he is to the Son. We ought not to pass these last two clauses without observing how, amidst all that equality of sonship which-runs through this part of the Gospel, the wide distinction between the Son and the sons is still preserved. In that future home of which Jesus speaks He <strong> is, </strong> it corresponds to His nature to be there; they shall only be brought to share it: He, too, is the Master, they ‘serve.’</p>
