<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:28">John 12:28</span>. <strong> Father, glorify thy name. </strong> ‘Let Thy glory <strong> </strong> shine forth in Thy name, in Thy character, as Father and in all that is involved in establishing <strong> </strong> Thy fatherly relation to men.’
	</p>
<p><strong> There came therefore a voice out of heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. </strong> The <strong> </strong> answer is a voice from heaven which is supposed (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:29">John 12:29</span>) by some to be thunder, by others to be that of an angel. Both these suppositions disclose the character of the voice. It was loud and terrible, a voice of awe and majesty. Such is always the meaning of thunder both in the Old Testament and the New (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:16">Exodus 19:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="job+26:14">Job 26:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+104:7">Psalms 104:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+4:5">Revelation 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+8:5">Revelation 8:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+11:19">Revelation 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+14:2">Revelation 14:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+19:6">Revelation 19:6</span>). Such also is the voice of an angel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+5:2">Revelation 5:2</span>). The mixed ‘thunderings and voices,’ too, of the Apocalypse are an instructive comment on this voice, while the connection that it has with judgment is clearly indicated by our Lord Himself in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:30-31">John 12:30-31</span>. If <strong> </strong> this was the manner of the voice, its contents must correspond, and it seems therefore altogether inappropriate to refer the first part of the words to the ministry of Jesus in Israel now drawing to its close, the second part to the approaching proclamation of salvation to the Gentiles. In reality these two things are one, and both of them are already ideally complete. The words rather express the unchangeableness of the purpose of Him ‘which is and which was and is to come,’ and intimate that the great work whereby God’s name was to be especially glorified would certainly, as resolved on in eternity, be accomplished.
