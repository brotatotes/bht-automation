<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:29">John 12:29</span>. <strong> The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him. </strong> That a real voice had been heard is obvious from the fact that the words are actually given by the Evangelist in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:28">John 12:28</span>, and that some at least of the multitude imagined that an angel had spoken. It had not, however, been understood by all: and John’s object in stating this appears to be his desire to bring still more clearly out the mysterious nature of the voice, one the apprehension of which belonged to the higher regions of the spiritual life, and which was necessarily dark to those who had not entered into the Father’s plans. Jesus understood it. The Evangelist did so too. But ‘the multitude’ felt only that God was there.</p>
