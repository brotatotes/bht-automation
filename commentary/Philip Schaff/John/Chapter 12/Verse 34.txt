<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:34">John 12:34</span>. <strong> The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted on high? </strong> The <strong> </strong> ‘multitude,’ who are Jews not Greeks, have rightly understood the words of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:32">John 12:32</span> to mean a lifting on high by death. But they have learned from the Scriptures (here, as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:34">John 10:34</span>, called ‘the law’) probably from such passages as Sam. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:13-15">John 7:13-15</span>; Psalms 72, 89, 110; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:7">Isaiah 6:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="da+7:14">Daniel 7:14</span> that ‘the Christ abideth for ever,’ that, according to their interpretation, He should have a glorious and eternal reign on earth. There is thus an irreconcilable contradiction between the fate expected by Jesus and the claims which they might perhaps have otherwise allowed.

<p><strong> Who is this Son of</strong> <strong> man</strong>? The words are not an honest inquiry who this Son of man can be, and how he can be the Christ. They are really a rejection of the claims of Jesus. ‘Who is this? We have nothing and shall have nothing to do with Him.’ The interpretation thus given is greatly confirmed by the fact that the words are immediately followed not by explanation, but by solemn warning on the part of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:35-36">John 12:35-36</span>), and by the Evangelist’s own reflections on the hardness and perversity of man (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:37-41">John 12:37-41</span>); while, at the same time, it is in a high degree suitable to the place occupied by them in the Gospel. ‘Son of man’ had been the favourite designation by Jesus of Himself. How appropriate is it that, when finally rejected, He should be rejected in that character! Have we not here also another illustration of the Evangelist’s love of commemorating instances when, against themselves and as if under the guidance of an irresistible power, men were compelled to ascribe to Jesus in contempt epithets which, rightly understood, were His highest glory?</p>
