John 12:35.  Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you.  Not so much words of pity and tenderness in order to clear away the doubts of a sincere desire to learn, as words of solemn warning that they had a day of grace granted them, but that it was now drawing to a close, and that, if they did not pass beyond all doubts to faith, they would be   overtaken by darkness.
	 Walk as ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not.  That is, ‘Walk in accordance with the fact that the light now shines around you.’
	 And he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.  If they do not thus walk, thus come to the light (chap. John 3:21), the darkness will overtake them; and instead of going to the glory to which Jesus ‘goeth,’ they will go blindly to destruction.
