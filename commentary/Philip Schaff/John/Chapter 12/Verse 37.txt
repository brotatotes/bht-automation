<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:37">John 12:37</span>. <strong> But though he had done so many signs before them, they believed not in him.</strong> The words of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:10-11">John 1:10-11</span> seem to echo in our cars, ‘He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, and the world knew Him not He came unto His own home, and His own accepted Him not.’ All the particulars of the statement heighten the effect. In the original there is a certain degree of emphasis on ‘He,’ One so full of power and grace, so divine in majesty, so human in tenderness. Then it was ‘signs’ that He had wrought, not mere miracles, but things that were the very expression of the Son and in Him of the Father. . These signs, too, had been ‘so many’ (see note on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:2">John 6:2</span>); for it is number, not greatness, that in our Gospel is always referred to in this word (chaps, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:9">John 6:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:9">John 14:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:11">John 21:11</span>). And, once more, the signs had been wrought ‘before them,’ so that they could not be mistaken (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:4">John 10:4</span>). Yet, notwithstanding all this, their unbelief had been continued, wilful, as constant as the call addressed to them <strong> .
