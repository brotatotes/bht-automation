John 12:4.  But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, he that  was  about to betray him, saith.  After the picture of the highest loving homage to Him whom the Jewish rulers had adjudged to death, the Evangelist gives the contrasted view of an apostle, who, apostle as he was, would shortly be seeking to betray his Lord, and who showed the present workings of his heart by grudging the lavish expression of Maryâ€™s faith and love.
