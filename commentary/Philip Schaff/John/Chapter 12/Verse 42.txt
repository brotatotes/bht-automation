John 12:42.  Nevertheless, even from among the rulers many believed in him.  The language which John has used is general: as a nation Israel has rejected Jesus. But His mission has not been without effect on many individuals (comp. chaps. John 1:11-12, John 3:32-33): even from among the members of the Sanhedrin (see chap. John 7:48) many believed in Him. Persons believed, belonging to a body in which the bitterest foes of Jesus bore rule; and greatness of unbelief is thus in some degree counterbalanced by greatness of faith.

We can hardly suppose that these words are added in order to show that the faith spoken of on the part of many of the rulers formed no real exception to the general statement of Israel’s unbelief. They simply tell us that, although that faith was genuine, it needed strength and growth. It was not powerful enough to surmount the obstacles placed in its way by the resolution of chap. John 9:22; and it had not reached the point at which alone it could be said that, in ‘leading out’ its possessors after the true Shepherd, its complete victory was gained (chap. 3 , 4 ). On the prominence now given to the Pharisees among the enemies of Jesus, see note on chap. John 7:32.
