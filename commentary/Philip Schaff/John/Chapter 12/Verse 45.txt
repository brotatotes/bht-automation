John 12:45.  And he that beholdeth me, beholdeth him that sent me.  In chap. John 6:40 (see note) we have the same combination as in these verses: ‘He that beholdeth the Son and believeth in Him.’ A little later the same thought finds fuller expression in words addressed to disciples (chap. John 14:9). Compare chap. John 1:18, John 15:24.
