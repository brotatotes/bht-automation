<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:46">John 12:46</span>. <strong> As light I have come into the world, that every one that believeth in me may not abide in the darkness. </strong> Here we have the substance of the Saviour’s last words to the multitude (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:35-36">John 12:35-36</span>) and the earlier sayings of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:9">2 John 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:9">2 John 1:9</span>:5 ; but nowhere has it been as clearly taught that all are ‘in the darkness’ until by faith in Jesus they receive light. Comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+1:13">Colossians 1:13</span>), and especially <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:4-5">John 12:4-5</span>, in the Prologue. It is easy to trace a certain connection of thought in these verses, though from the nature of the case the connection is not always very close. The first two (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:4">John 12:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:45">John 12:45</span>) <strong> </strong> are occupied with the relation between the disciples of Jesus and the Father who sent Him; the next three (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:46-48">John 12:46-48</span>), <strong> </strong> with the relation of Jesus to the world; the last two, with His relation to the Father. From beholding (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:45">John 12:45</span>) <strong> </strong> to light is a natural transition; from this point each verse directly leads the way to that which follows it. The thought is at first expressed in the language of figure (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:46">John 12:46</span> <strong> ), </strong> then with studious plainness and simplicity.</p>
