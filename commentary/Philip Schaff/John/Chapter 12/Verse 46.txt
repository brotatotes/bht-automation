John 12:46.  As light I have come into the world, that every one that believeth in me may not abide in the darkness.  Here we have the substance of the Saviour’s last words to the multitude (John 12:35-36) and the earlier sayings of chap. 2 John 1:9; 2 John 1:9:5 ; but nowhere has it been as clearly taught that all are ‘in the darkness’ until by faith in Jesus they receive light. Comp. chap. John 3:19 (Acts 26:18; Colossians 1:13), and especially John 12:4-5, in the Prologue. It is easy to trace a certain connection of thought in these verses, though from the nature of the case the connection is not always very close. The first two (John 12:4; John 12:45)   are occupied with the relation between the disciples of Jesus and the Father who sent Him; the next three (John 12:46-48),   with the relation of Jesus to the world; the last two, with His relation to the Father. From beholding (John 12:45)   to light is a natural transition; from this point each verse directly leads the way to that which follows it. The thought is at first expressed in the language of figure (John 12:46  ),  then with studious plainness and simplicity.
