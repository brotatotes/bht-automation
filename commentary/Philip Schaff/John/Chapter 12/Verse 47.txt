John 12:47.  And if any one shall have heard my sayings and have guarded them not.  It is necessary here to introduce an unusual word in the translation. To ‘keep’ the sayings or words of Jesus is a phrase which often meets us in this Gospel (chap. John 8:51, etc.): ‘guard’ is an un common word with the Evangelist, found only here and in John 12:25, and (in conjunction with ‘keep’) in chap. John 17:12. That the sayings may be kept and not lost from memory and life, they must be guarded with all care, and  watchfully   observed. Comp. Matthew 7:26; Luke 6:49.  I  judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.  Comp. chap. John 3:17; John 8:15.
