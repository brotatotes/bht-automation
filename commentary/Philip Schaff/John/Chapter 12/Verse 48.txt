<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:48">John 12:48</span>. <strong> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge </strong> him <strong> in the last day. </strong> From the ‘forgetful hearer’ whose carelessness or indifference has let slip the words he should have ‘guarded,’ Jesus passes to the man who sets at nought both His word and Himself. Even to him that word shall come, but as a judge. As Moses was the accuser of the people (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:45">John 5:45</span>) because his word, though honoured in profession, was disregarded in its spirit and design, so the very word of Jesus which they have rejected shall declare their doom. The word bore with it evidence that it was God’s word: they heard not because they were not of God (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:14">John 8:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:47">John 8:47</span>).</p>
