John 12:49.  Because I  spake not of myself;  but the Father which sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.  With the first words compare chap. John 3:34, John 5:19, John 7:16-17, John 8:28, John 14:24. Of receiving a ‘commandment’ from the Father Jesus has spoken once only (chap. John 10:18), but in later chapters we have the same thought (John 14:31, John 15:10), which indeed is implied wherever He has spoken of Himself as sent by the Father into the world. This commandment is the expression of the Divine plan for the salvation of the world (chap. John 3:14-16). The combination of ‘say’ and ‘speak’ in the last clause is remarkable: see the note on chap. John 8:43.
