John 12:50.  And I know that his commandment is eternal life: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.  The substance of the Divine commandment is contained in the word of Jesus, and His word gives life eternal, His word is life (chap. John 5:24, John 6:63; John 6:68).
