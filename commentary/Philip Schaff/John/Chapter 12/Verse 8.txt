John 12:8.  For the poor always ye have with you, but me ye have not always.  The duty of giving to the poor is fully recognised: it must never be forgotten. But there are moments when what may seem lavish waste upon objects visible only to the eye of faith are to be commended for the faith that is present in them. How often has the history of the world borne testimony to the truth thus declared by Jesus! The very charity that cares for the poor whom we see has been kept alive by   faith in, and devotion to, the crucified Redeemer   whom we cannot see.
