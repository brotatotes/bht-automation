<p>Jesus has been doomed to death (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:53">John 11:53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:57">John 11:57</span>), and the hour is at hand when He shall be seized, and the sentence executed. But the malice of man cannot interfere with the purposes of God. In the midst of dangers, under sentence of death, the redeemer pursues His path of glory. Three pictures illustrating this are presented in the section of the twelfth chapter now before us. The subordinate parts of this section are ( 1 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1-11">John 12:1-11</span>, <strong> </strong> the anointing in Bethany; ( 2 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:12-19">John 12:12-19</span>, the triumphal entry into Jerusalem; ( 3 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:20-36">John 12:20-36</span>, the homage of the Greeks to Jesus.</p>
