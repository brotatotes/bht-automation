Jesus has been doomed to death (John 11:53; John 11:57), and the hour is at hand when He shall be seized, and the sentence executed. But the malice of man cannot interfere with the purposes of God. In the midst of dangers, under sentence of death, the redeemer pursues His path of glory. Three pictures illustrating this are presented in the section of the twelfth chapter now before us. The subordinate parts of this section are ( 1 ) John 12:1-11,   the anointing in Bethany; ( 2 ) John 12:12-19, the triumphal entry into Jerusalem; ( 3 ) John 12:20-36, the homage of the Greeks to Jesus.
