<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:10-11">John 12:10-11</span>. <strong> But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed in Jesus. </strong> When the rulers found that even their own adherents were deserting them (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:48">John 11:48</span>), their rage knew no bounds. Lazarus had not incurred their displeasure, but everything that ministered to the success of the cause of Jesus must be swept out of <strong> </strong> the way. It is easy to see that the conflict of <strong> </strong> Jesus with the Jews is continually growing in intensity, and has well-nigh reached its climax. The effect produced by the recent miracle has been great beyond all previous example. Yet we cannot but feel that to the Evangelist himself the miracle would be most precious as a ‘sign;’ and that what he intends us to feel most deeply is the contrast between the rulers bent on His death and the calm majesty of Him who is ‘the Resurrection and the Life,’ in whose presence are Lazarus, the trophy and emblem of His power over life physical, and believers come from the very ranks of His adversaries to receive life spiritual through believing in Him.
