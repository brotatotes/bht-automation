<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:14-15">John 12:14-15</span>. <strong> And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon: as it is written, Fear not, daughter of Sion, behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt. </strong> Jesus ‘found’ the ass, having taken means to find it (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:2">Matthew 21:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:1">Mark 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:30">Luke 19:30</span>; comp. also chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:43">John 1:43</span> <strong> ). </strong> It is a ‘young’ ass, expression being thus given to the fact that it had not been previously used for any burden (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:2">Mark 11:2</span>). The whole passage brings out a view of Jesus in this entry into Jerusalem that we may readily forget. We see at once the glory of the Saviour. He who thus approaches Jerusalem is a King, the King of Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:14">John 12:14</span>) <strong> , </strong> the King of Zion (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:15">John 12:15</span>): the pi ogress is royal: the entry is triumphant. But the main thought of the Evangelist is that humiliation, suffering, and death characterize this King: He is a sacrifice: and in being a sacrifice His true glory lies. The change from ‘Rejoice greatly’ to ‘Fear not’ (no doubt made by the Evangelist himself, see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:17">John 2:17</span> <strong> ) </strong> is remarkable. It may spring from his profound sense of the majesty of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+1:17">Revelation 1:17</span>): there is fear to be dispelled before the joy of His presence can be felt. The context in Zechariah, however, suggests another sense. The King comes to defend His people; He comes ‘having salvation:’ let Zion fear no more. So understood, John’s words contain the meaning of the whole passage quoted. The prayer ‘Hosanna’ is answered.</p>
