John 12:14-15.  And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon: as it is written, Fear not, daughter of Sion, behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.  Jesus ‘found’ the ass, having taken means to find it (comp. Matthew 21:2; Mark 11:1; Luke 19:30; comp. also chap. John 1:43  ).  It is a ‘young’ ass, expression being thus given to the fact that it had not been previously used for any burden (Mark 11:2). The whole passage brings out a view of Jesus in this entry into Jerusalem that we may readily forget. We see at once the glory of the Saviour. He who thus approaches Jerusalem is a King, the King of Israel (John 12:14)  ,  the King of Zion (John 12:15): the pi ogress is royal: the entry is triumphant. But the main thought of the Evangelist is that humiliation, suffering, and death characterize this King: He is a sacrifice: and in being a sacrifice His true glory lies. The change from ‘Rejoice greatly’ to ‘Fear not’ (no doubt made by the Evangelist himself, see chap. John 2:17  )  is remarkable. It may spring from his profound sense of the majesty of Jesus (Revelation 1:17): there is fear to be dispelled before the joy of His presence can be felt. The context in Zechariah, however, suggests another sense. The King comes to defend His people; He comes ‘having salvation:’ let Zion fear no more. So understood, John’s words contain the meaning of the whole passage quoted. The prayer ‘Hosanna’ is answered.
