<p>The public ministry of Jesus has been <strong> </strong> brought to a close, and the moment has been marked by words the melancholy pathos of which can hardly be mistaken, ‘Having gone away, He was hidden from then’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:36">John 12:36</span>). These words, applied in the first instance to the outward circumstances of the Saviour, receive now at the hands of the Evangelist all the depth of their meaning, when he gives us his last reflections on the hardness <strong> </strong> and unbelief displayed by Israel in rejecting the glorious self-manifestation of its Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:37-43">John 12:37-43</span>). After this we have in the second part of the section, closing the fourth and leading division of the Gospel, a short summary of that teaching of Jesus to which Israel had refused to listen (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:44-50">John 12:44-50</span>).
