<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:11">John 13:11</span>. <strong> For he knew him that was betraying him: therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. </strong> What a contrast to the eleven do these words present: they full of faith and love, ‘clean;’ Judas with his heart full of evil passions, at that very moment his treachery not a thing of the future, but of the present. And yet more! Jesus knew this. The eye that sees what is in man, saw what was in the heart of the traitor while he yet washed his feet. It may be asked, What is the import of the foot-washing in such a case? We can only answer, It is nothing but an outward rite. The complete bath must have been accepted, before the subsequent washing of the feet can bring its blessing to us, or be other than a carnal form.</p>
