<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:13">John 13:13</span>. <strong> Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye my well; for so I am. </strong> It was in the full consciousness of the dignity belonging to Him that (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:3">John 13:3</span>) Jesus had entered upon this scene. It is in a similar consciousness that He now urges its lesson. The word used for ‘Master’ is John’s Greek rendering for the Hebrew ‘Rabbi’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:16">John 20:16</span>). No special meaning therefore, such as ‘Teacher,’ is to be given it.</p>
