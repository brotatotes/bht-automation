John 13:13.  Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye my well; for so I am.  It was in the full consciousness of the dignity belonging to Him that (John 13:3) Jesus had entered upon this scene. It is in a similar consciousness that He now urges its lesson. The word used for ‘Master’ is John’s Greek rendering for the Hebrew ‘Rabbi’ (John 1:29, John 20:16). No special meaning therefore, such as ‘Teacher,’ is to be given it.
