John 13:14.  If I therefore, the Lord and the Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.  The order of the titles which Jesus assumes to Himself is changed in this as compared with the preceding verse. The object appears to be to give prominence to that title of ‘Lord’ in the thought of which lay the strength of the obligation resting upon His disciples to do as He had done. They, then, were to wash one another’s feet when He would no longer be beside them to do so: they could not bathe one another, make one another ‘clean;’ but this they could do in self-denying love and fellowship, they could restore one another’s failing faith and love by ever-renewed manifestations of that love to one another which, springing from the love of Jesus, leads back to Him.
