John 13:16.  Verily, verily, I say unto you, No servant is greater than his lord; neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him.  How often does Jesus speak of Himself in this gospel as the ‘Sent’ of God! It is impossible to dissociate this usage from the words here, so that the same word is applied to the disciple in reference to his Lord as is applied to the Lord Himself in reference to God (comp. John 17:18). The disciples are the ‘sent,’ taking the place of Him who was first ‘sent’ but is now gone to the Father.
