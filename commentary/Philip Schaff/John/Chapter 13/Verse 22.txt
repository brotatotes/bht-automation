<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:22">John 13:22</span>. <strong> The disciples looked one on another, in perplexity of whom he spake. </strong> From the parallel passages of the earlier Gospels (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:22">Matthew 26:22</span>, etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:19">Mark 14:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:23">Luke 22:23</span>) we learn that they expressed their perplexity to one another in words.
