<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:23">John 13:23</span>. <strong> There was reclining at meat in Jesusâ€™ bosom one of his disciples. </strong> It had been originally enjoined that the Passover should be eaten standing (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:11">Exodus 12:11</span>), but after the return from the captivity the custom had been changed; the guests now reclined upon couches. The reason for the original injunction no longer existing, it had been permitted to fall aside; and our Lord recognised the propriety of the change. At this moment indeed the feast, properly so called, had not yet begun; but there is no reason to doubt that the altitude of reclining would not be changed when it did so.

<p><strong> Whom Jesus loved. </strong> The universal tradition of the Church, as well as the information afforded by the gospel itself when various intimations contained in it are put together, leave no doubt that this disciple was John himself.</p>
