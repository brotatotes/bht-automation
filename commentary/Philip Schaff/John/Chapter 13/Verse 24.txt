John 13:24.  Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to this one, and saith unto him, Say who it is of whom he speaketh.  Peter, as usual the first to act, is the spokesman of the rest. Nothing is said to explain why either he or any other of the apostolic band should have supposed that John would know what they themselves were ignorant of. It may have arisen simply from their having witnessed many tokens of love and confidence on the part of Jesus towards him.
