John 13:25.  He leaning back thus on Jesus’ breast, saith unto him, Lord, who is it?  Nothing can be more graphic than the account here given of the movement made by John. He had been reclining on the bosom of Jesus: he now throws back his head upon His breast, looking up into His face that he may ask his question. It is worthy of notice that this little act is fixed on by the beloved disciple in John 21:20, to characterize himself: not ‘which also leaned,’ but ‘which also leaned back on his breast’ at the supper. Perhaps, too, we may justly infer that the question was neither asked nor answered in undertones, but that all could hear.
