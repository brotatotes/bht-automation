John 13:27.  And after the sop then Satan entered into him.  After the sop had been given, Satan took such full possession of the traitor, that he is no longer only Judas, but one possessed by Satan.
	 Jesus therefore saith unto him, That thou doest, do more quickly.  Judas may now be addressed as ‘doing ‘what he was to do. It was too late to expect any change. Mercy, grace, offered to the last, have been to the last rejected. The sin must be committed now. Let him therefore not stay, as in all probability he would have wished to partake of the feast; let him be even more active than he is inclined to be; Jesus not only desires to be alone with His true disciples, but He is eager to take that last step which is now at hand; He is ‘straitened’ until His ‘baptism is accomplished’ (Luke 12:50).
