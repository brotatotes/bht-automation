John 13:3.  Jesus knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and goeth unto  God.  We have now that state of mind in Jesus which leads to the act about to be described. ‘Knowing’ takes up again the same word in John 13:1, and has the same meaning, ‘because he knows.’ The knowledge is summed up in three particulars ( 1 ) That ‘the Father had given all things into His hands;’ the tense expressing no presentiment of coming power, but an act already past ( 2 ) That ‘He came forth from God;’ the words expressing not His Divine original, which would have required another form of expression, but that He had left the presence of God as the ‘Sent’ of God. ( 3 ) That ‘He goeth unto God,’ as one who has executed His commission. The three clauses thus refer not to power or glory belonging Jesus as the Son of God: they connect themselves with His work of redeeming love.
