<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:3">John 13:3</span>. <strong> Jesus knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and goeth unto</strong> <strong> God. </strong> We have now that state of mind in Jesus which leads to the act about to be described. ‘Knowing’ takes up again the same word in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span>, and has the same meaning, ‘because he knows.’ The knowledge is summed up in three particulars ( 1 ) That ‘the Father had given all things into His hands;’ the tense expressing no presentiment of coming power, but an act already past ( 2 ) That ‘He came forth from God;’ the words expressing not His Divine original, which would have required another form of expression, but that He had left the presence of God as the ‘Sent’ of God. ( 3 ) That ‘He goeth unto God,’ as one who has executed His commission. The three clauses thus refer not to power or glory belonging Jesus as the Son of God: they connect themselves with His work of redeeming love.</p>
