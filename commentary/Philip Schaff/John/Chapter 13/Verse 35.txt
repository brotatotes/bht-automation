<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:35">John 13:35</span>. <strong> By this shall all men know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love one with another. </strong> The expression ‘disciples of mine’ is worthy of notice. It seems to show that the meaning is not exhausted by the thought of that language so often quoted in connection with it, ‘Behold how these Christians love one another.’ It directs our thoughts, not to the disciples only, but to Jesus Himself. He was love: in the love of the Christian community, the love of its members ‘with’ one another, it was to be seen not merely what they were, but what He was, and more particularly that He was love. Thus, then, the disciples have their great charge committed to them, to be in the season now at hand what He had been who had washed their feet.
