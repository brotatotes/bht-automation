<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:37">John 13:37</span>. <strong> Peter saith unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee even now? I will lay down my life for thee. </strong> Peter sees that in the words,’ Thou canst not follow me now,’ there lies the meaning that he is not yet morally prepared for following Jesus. His self-confidence is hurt by the suggestion; and not in devotion only, but in too high an estimate of his own readiness to meet every trial for the sake of the Master whom he loved, he cries out that he is ready to follow Him ‘even now,’ nay, that he is ready to lay down his life for Him. Such want of self-knowledge must be corrected.
