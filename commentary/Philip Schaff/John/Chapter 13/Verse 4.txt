<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:4">John 13:4</span>. <strong> He riseth from the supper, and layeth down his garments, and having taken a towel girded himself. </strong> How wonderful the act when compared with the circumstances (mentioned in the previous verse) by which it is introduced! In the fullest consciousness of <strong> </strong> the glory of that work of redeeming love which He had undertaken, He who was in the ‘form of God’ assumed the ‘form,’ and did the work, of <strong> </strong> ‘a servant,’ a slave, nay, felt that to do this was glory. What He does, too, is rendered all the more striking by the fact that the remarkable scene described in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:24">Luke 22:24</span>, the strife among the disciples which should be the greatest, may have just occurred. In contrast with that eager desire among His servants for superior station in the world, the Master ‘riseth,’ ‘layeth down’ His outer garments, and ‘girdeth’ Himself, becomes as ‘he that serveth (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:27">Luke 22:27</span>).
