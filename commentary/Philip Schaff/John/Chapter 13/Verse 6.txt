<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:6">John 13:6</span>. <strong> He cometh therefore to Simon Peter: he saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? </strong> If the narrative of the actual foot-washing begins here, and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:5">John 13:5</span> is to be regarded as a general description of what is now related in detail, we must infer from the words before us that our Lord began with Peter. If, on the other hand, the washing begins with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:5">John 13:5</span>, we learn now that our Lord only came to Peter in due course, so that whatever place that apostle had it was not the first. The point is of little moment. It is more important to mark the strong emphasis belonging to ‘thou’ and ‘my:’ ‘Lord, dost <em> thou</em> <strong> </strong> wash <em> my</em> feet?’ There may be hastiness and self-will on Peter’s part, but surely there is also deep reverence for his Lord and a spirit of genuine humility. We must bear in mind that as yet he looks at the matter only with the outward eye, and that he can hardly be expected to think of the deeper spiritual significance which the act possesses.</p>
