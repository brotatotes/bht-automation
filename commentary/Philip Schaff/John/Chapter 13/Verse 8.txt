<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:8">John 13:8</span>. <strong> Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. </strong> Peter is too much amazed to comprehend at once the lesson of the previous words of Jesus. He does not even heed them; and his impulsiveness, checked for a moment, leads him to break over the barrier that has been opposed to it with greater force than before: ‘Thou shalt never wash my feet.’

<p><strong> Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. </strong> Now, our Lord begins to unfold the true spiritual meaning of what He is about to do. We must carefully mark the words, first, the word ‘wash,’ not ‘cleanse ‘or ‘bathe,’ referring to the whole body, but simply ‘wash,’ referring to the act which Jesus has immediately in hand, the washing of the feet alone; secondly, ‘with me,’ not ‘in me,’ referring, not to the entire dependence of the believer upon his Lord and his completeness in Him, but to his share along with Him in a work of self-sacrificing love, triumphant over the world and crowned with glory. If we keep these two points in view, it will be at once seen that the words of Jesus before us have little reference to any mere spirit of self-will, for which Peter must substitute the childlike disposition that alone can enter into the kingdom of heaven, and also that they relate as little to our first cleansing from sin in the atoning blood of Christ. They refer to something different from either of these two great truths, and express, what we shall have to explain more fully (on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:20">John 13:20</span>), that unless Peter enters into the spirit of that self-sacrificing work of love which Jesus performs, makes that spirit his own spirit, sees the beauty and owns the glory of the Master’s becoming the servant for His people’s sake (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:24-27">Luke 22:24-27</span>), and becomes in like manner ready to sacrifice himself if he may thereby help the humblest member of the flock of Christ, then he is going his own way, not the way of Jesus; he is choosing his own portion, not the portion of his Lord; he must be content to separate from One whom he loved with all his heart, and to have no more a part with Him either in His sufferings or His reward. It is this thought, even though it may be as yet imperfectly apprehended by the apostle, that leads to the sudden revulsion of feeling in the following verse.</p>
