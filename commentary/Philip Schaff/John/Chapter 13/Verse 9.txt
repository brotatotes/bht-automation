John 13:9.  Simon Peter saith unto Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Peter sees that in whatever way the result maybe produced, suffering Jesus to wash his feet will bring him nearer to his Master, will make him to be more ‘with Him.’ The thought of the hands and the head as the uncovered parts of the body naturally occurs to him; and his reasoning is that, if the washing of one part will give him a deeper interest in the Master whom he loved, much more will this be effected by the washing of more parts than one. To   everything he will submit, so that it bring him nearer to Jesus and His reward.
