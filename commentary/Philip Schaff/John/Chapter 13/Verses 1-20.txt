<p>We enter here upon the fifth of those sections into which we have seen that the Gospel is divided; and the section extends to the close of chap. 17 . The scene and the circumstances of the actors in it are altogether different from what we have witnessed in chaps, 5 to 12 . There is a transition from the ‘world’ and the ‘Jews,’ its leading representatives, to the circle of the most intimate friends of Jesus, from struggle to quietness and peace, from denunciation of sin to an outpouring of the most tender affection in act, discourse, and prayer. The consequence is that nowhere in the Gospel have we so full a revelation of the Father’s put pose and work, of the Son’s relation to it, of the great New Covenant gift of the Spirit, and of the duties, privileges <strong> , </strong> and hopes of that Church of Christ which, after He went away, was to take His place, as we find in these chapters. The first scene in the section is the Foot-washing. The subordinate parts are <strong> </strong> ( 1 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1-11">John 13:1-11</span>; ( 2 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:12-20">John 13:12-20</span>.</p>
