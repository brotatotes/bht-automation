<p>Judas has now gone out; Jesus is alone with the disciples whom He loved; and the last disturbing element has been removed from the midst of the little company. But the hour is come when the servants must be left without the immediate presence of their Master, and when they are to take that place, amidst the trials of the world, which He was about to leave for the immediate presence of the Father. It is the moment, therefore, for the Redeemer to pour forth all the inmost feelings of His soul on their behalf; and He does this in the discourse extending to the close of chap. 16, and in the intercessory prayer of chap. 17. We shall mistake the object of these chapters, however, if we suppose that they are intended mainly to console: they are still more to instruct and train those by whom the work of Christ in the world is to be carried on. The subordinate parts of the section before us are (1) chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:31-35">John 13:31-35</span>; (2) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:36-38">John 13:36-38</span>; (3) chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:1-4">John 14:1-4</span>; (4) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:5-7">John 13:5-7</span>; (5) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:8-11">John 13:8-11</span>; (6) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:12-21">John 13:12-21</span>; (7) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:22-24">John 13:22-24</span>; (8) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:25-31">John 13:25-31</span>.
