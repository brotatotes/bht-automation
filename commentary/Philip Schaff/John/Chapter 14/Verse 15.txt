<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:15">John 14:15</span>. <strong> If ye love me, ye will keep my commandments. </strong> An abiding communion between the glorified Redeemer and His disciples on earth has been spoken of as established, a communion, as we have already seen, not to be broken by the ‘going away’ of Jesus to the Father. The object of the present verse (which is no interruption of the discourse by a direct precept) is to point out the condition by which alone this communion can be preserved and its greatest blessing, the presence of the Advocate, enjoyed love. This love, too, consists in a loving self-surrender of ourselves to the sole object of glorifying the Father, analogous to the loving self-surrender of Jesus; for ‘my commandments’ are not merely commandments which He gives, but which He has Himself first received and made His own (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:27">John 14:27</span>).
