John 14:18.  I will not leave you desolate:  I come  to you.  The disciples were the ‘little children’ of Jesus (chap. John 13:33), and He may therefore well speak to them as a father. Not from Pentecost, but from the moment of His reunion to the Father, and by means of the Spirit of the truth, He comes to them (see John 14:20).
