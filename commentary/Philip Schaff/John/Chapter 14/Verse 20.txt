John 14:20.  In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in  me, and I in you.  Not the particular day of the resurrection, or of Pentecost, or of the Second Coming, but the day   beginning with the return of Jesus to His Father, when He shall send to His disciples the promised Advocate, the Spirit of the truth. Then in the knowledge of ever-deepening experience they shall know that the Son of man whom they had thought ‘gone away’ is really in the bosom of His Father, glorified in the Father (comp. chap. John 13:31), that they are in Him thus glorified, and that He thus glorified is in them. So shall the end of all be attained, the perfect union in glory of Father, Son, and all believers, in one uninterrupted, unchanging, eternal unity (comp. John 17:21; John 17:23). It is of great importance to note the expression, ‘Ye in me, and I in you.’ We cannot here follow out the thought, but we must not fail to notice that the fulness of the union referred to belongs only to the time of Jesus glorified. The limiting influences of the world, of the flesh, must be overpassed before that perfect union of all existence is reached which can be established only (for ‘God is Spirit,’ chap. John 4:24) where the Spirit is the dominating, all-embracing, all-controlling element of being. Jesus says ‘my Father,’ not ‘the Father,’ because His personal union with the Father forms the basis of the wider and more glorious union here referred to.
