<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:21">John 14:21</span>. <strong> He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. </strong> The thought of privilege in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:14">John 14:14</span> led to that condition on which alone privilege can be preserved (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:15">John 14:15</span>). We have a similar transition now. Here, as there, one thing must be distinctly remembered, that this unity is one of love. There is love on the part of the believer to his Lord, love on the part of the Father to the believer, love on the part of Jesus to the believer. In this fellowship of love the result of all will be the manifestation by Himself of the glorified Redeemer to His people. He will ‘manifest’ Himself <em> from H</em> is <em> glory, </em> and in knowing and seeing Him by the power of the Spirit they will know and see the Father. A third difficulty arises in the breast of Judas.
