John 14:22.  Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how hath it come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?  Judas is distinguished from the traitor, that we may have kept distinctly before us that the latter had gone out (chap. John 13:30). His  error  consists in not seeing that the spiritual can only be apprehended by the spiritual. Filled with the thought of the external kingdom, he cannot understand why   the glorious revelation of Christ to be made to himself and his fellow-disciples should not be male to all, so that all may believe and be blessed.
