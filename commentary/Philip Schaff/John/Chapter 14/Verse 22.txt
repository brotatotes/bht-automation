<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:22">John 14:22</span>. <strong> Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how hath it come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? </strong> Judas is distinguished from the traitor, that we may have kept distinctly before us that the latter had gone out (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:30">John 13:30</span>). His <strong> error </strong> consists in not seeing that the spiritual can only be apprehended by the spiritual. Filled with the thought of the external kingdom, he cannot understand why <strong> </strong> the glorious revelation of Christ to be made to himself and his fellow-disciples should not be male to all, so that all may believe and be blessed.
