John 14:24.  He that loveth me not keepeth cot my words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me.  A fuller explanation than before why the world cannot receive the manifestation of the Father and the Son, but given now from the negative rather   than the positive side. It will be observed that in John 14:23-24, we have first ‘word,’ then ‘words,’ and then, again, a return to the singular ‘word.’ The explanation may in part be that to him who receives in faith the ‘words’ of Jesus are one; he   sees their unity; they are a ‘word:’ to him who receives not in faith they are scattered and unconnected, ‘words’ not a ‘word.’ It may be   found also in another consideration, that he   who keeps keeps a whole, he who disobeys disobeys the several precepts. We remark only further that our Lord, while implying in John 14:23-24 that the world cannot receive such a manifestation of the Father and of Himself as had been promised to His own, shows with equal distinctness that there is no class favoured in an arbitrary manner. All  make themselves  what they are. If ‘any one,’ He says, ‘love me;’ and, again, ‘he that loveth me.’ The world need not be the ‘world.’ Every one may come and have the promise in all its fulness.
