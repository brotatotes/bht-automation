John 14:25.  These things have I spoken unto you while abiding with you.  We now enter upon a new part of the discourse, in which the leading idea is the strength to be afforded to the disciples after the departure of their Lord. It is important to notice that this is bestowed upon them not   merely as disciples, but as disciples about to be sent forth to occupy their Masterâ€™s place, and to do His work. During the absence of their Master the Advocate shall be with them.
