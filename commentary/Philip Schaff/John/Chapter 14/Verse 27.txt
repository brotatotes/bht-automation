<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:27">John 14:27</span>. <strong> Peace I leave unto you; a peace that if mine I give onto you: not as the world giveth give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. </strong> The peace spoken of here is not the legacy of a dying father, but the salutation of a departing Master. It is thus not mere peace of heart, a pacified conscience, the result of a personal resting in the love of God. It is peace in the midst of the trials which the world brings on the followers of Jesus while they perform their task; peace that is the result of His having ‘overcome the world’ (comp. on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:33">John 16:33</span>). ‘My’ peace, again, is the peace which Jesus Himself enjoys, as well as that which He alone can give: this peace becomes the true possession of the receiver (comp. on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:14">John 17:14</span>). The effect is that the disciples shall neither be ‘troubled’ from within, nor ‘afraid’ with a coward terror in the presence of outward foes.
