John 14:30.  I will no longer talk much with you, for the prince of the world cometh.  (Comp. on chap. John 12:31.) Here it is particularly to be noted that ‘the prince of this world’ is equivalent to the world in its essence. He embodies the spirit of the world, so that what is said of it may be said of him, what is said of him may be said of it. Observe the ‘cometh,’ the contrast of the ‘coming’ of Jesus.  And he hath nothing in me.
