<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:4">John 14:4</span>. <strong> And whither I go away ye know the way. </strong> These words convey to the disciples the assurance that they already had the pledge and earnest of all that Jesus had spoken of; for their interpretation depends on the same principle as that formerly applied at chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:32">John 4:32</span>. To ‘know’ is not merely to know of; it is to have inward experience of. As, therefore,’ whither I go ‘is the Father’s presence; as Jesus is the way to the <strong> </strong> Father; and as they have experimental knowledge of Him, they ‘know the way.’ They might have feared that it was not so, that they had still much to be taught before they could anticipate with confidence the possession of their hope; and who was to teach them now? But Jesus says, ‘Ye know me; and, in knowing me, ye know the way; it is already yours.’ Difficulties arise in their minds, the first of which is started by Thomas, and has reference to the way to the goal.
