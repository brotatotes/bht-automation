John 14:5.  Thomas saith unto him, Lord,  we know not whither thou goest away: how do we know the way?  In John 14:4,   Jesus had spoken of ‘going away,’ not of ‘going,’ as in John 14:3. The idea of separation is thus again brought prominently forward, and Thomas is overborne by the thought of it (comp. chap. John 11:16). His discouragement, which blinds his eyes, is uttered in the words before us.
