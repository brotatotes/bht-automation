<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:5">John 14:5</span>. <strong> Thomas saith unto him, Lord,</strong> <strong> we know not whither thou goest away: how do we know the way? </strong> In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:4">John 14:4</span>, <strong> </strong> Jesus had spoken of ‘going away,’ not of ‘going,’ as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:3">John 14:3</span>. The idea of separation is thus again brought prominently forward, and Thomas is overborne by the thought of it (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:16">John 11:16</span>). His discouragement, which blinds his eyes, is uttered in the words before us.
