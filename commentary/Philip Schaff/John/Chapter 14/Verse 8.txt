<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:8">John 14:8</span>. <strong> Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us</strong>. The same bluntness of spiritual sight (that is, really the same weakness of faith) that had been exhibited by Thomas is now exhibited by Philip, though in relation to another point. Jesus had said (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:7">John 14:7</span>) that the disciples had seen the Father, meaning that they had seen the Father in Him. Philip fails to understand; and, thinking perhaps of the revelation given to Moses in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:18-19">Exodus 33:18-19</span>, misusing also those words of our Lord which alone made his request possible, he asks that he and his fellow-disciples may have granted them some actual vision of the Father (comp. his spirit in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:7">John 6:7</span>). The reply of Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:9-21">John 14:9-21</span>, falls into three leading parts, of which the first is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:9-11">John 14:9-11</span>.
