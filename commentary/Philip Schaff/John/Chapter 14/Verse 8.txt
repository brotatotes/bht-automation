John 14:8.  Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. The same bluntness of spiritual sight (that is, really the same weakness of faith) that had been exhibited by Thomas is now exhibited by Philip, though in relation to another point. Jesus had said (John 14:7) that the disciples had seen the Father, meaning that they had seen the Father in Him. Philip fails to understand; and, thinking perhaps of the revelation given to Moses in Exodus 33:18-19, misusing also those words of our Lord which alone made his request possible, he asks that he and his fellow-disciples may have granted them some actual vision of the Father (comp. his spirit in chap. John 6:7). The reply of Jesus, John 14:9-21, falls into three leading parts, of which the first is found in John 14:9-11.
