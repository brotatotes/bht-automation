John 15:11.  These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be fulfilled. ‘My joy’ must be interpreted in the same way as ‘My peace’ at chap, John 14:27. It is the joy which Jesus possessed as ‘anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows,’ which flowed from His uninterrupted possession of His Father’s love (John 15:9), which was ever   and again renewed as He felt that He was accomplishing His Father’s will (John 15:10), which was   crowned in that uninterrupted intercourse with His Father in which He asked and received whatsoever He desired (chap. John 11:42), and which filled His heart amidst all the trials and sorrows of His work on earth (comp. Luke 10:21). That very joy He will communicate to His disciples, and their joy will be then ‘fulfilled.’ Like Him who went before them, they shall ‘see of the travail of their soul and shall be satisfied.’ The arrangement of the words in the original of this verse, by which ‘my’ is brought into the closest juxtaposition with ‘in you,’ is worthy of notice (comp. chap. John 14:1; John 14:3).
