John 15:12.  This is my commandment, That ye love one another, even as I loved you.  The sum of what was to be said in this part of the discourse has been spoken. One point needs further elucidation love. It is here enjoined and explained anew. The singular ‘commandment’ does not differ materially from the plural of John 15:10 (see on that verse, and comp. on chap. John 14:23-24). Jesus had loved them with a self-sacrificing love; and  because  He had so loved them He charges them to live in self-sacrificing love for one another. The ‘I loved you’ is not to be resolved into ‘I have loved you.’ As at chap. John 13:34, it is of His love brought back to their minds in His absence that He speaks.
