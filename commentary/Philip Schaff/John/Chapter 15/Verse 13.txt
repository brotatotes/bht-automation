John 15:13.  Greater love hath no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.  How great His love which showed itself even unto death for them! They must imitate such love if they will ‘keep His commandment’ and exhibit His spirit. There is no contradiction between this statement and that in Romans 5:6-8. Enemies are not here in question. Jesus is alone with His friends, and one friend can give no greater proof of love to another than to die for him. The emphasis rests upon ‘lay down his life,’ not upon ‘friends.’
