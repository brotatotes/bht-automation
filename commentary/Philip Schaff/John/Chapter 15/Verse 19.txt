John 15:19.  If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this the world hateth you.  The word ‘of’ here calls attention to the root from which one springs. Did the world behold in them its own offspring, it would love them; they would be its own. The rule is universal and needed no farther exposition; but they were not ‘of’ the world, they were born of a new and higher birth, they had even like their Master to bear witness of the world that its works were evil, and therefore it must hate them as it hated Him (comp. John 7:7, and  1 Kings 22:8).
