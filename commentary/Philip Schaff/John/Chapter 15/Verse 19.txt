Did the world behold in them its own offspring, it would love them; they would be its own. The rule is universal and needed no farther exposition; but they were not ‘of’ the world, they were born of a new and higher birth, they had even like their Master to bear witness of the world that its works were evil, and therefore it must hate them as it hated Him (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:7">John 7:7</span>, and <strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:8">1 Kings 22:8</span></strong>).
