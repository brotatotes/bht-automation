John 15:20.  Remember the word that I said unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord: if they persecuted me,  they will persecute you also; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.  The word referred to had been spoken at chap. John 13:16, in an apparently different sense, but really, alike there and here, with the same deep oneness of meaning. The disciples are in the position of their Master, are one with Him; therefore are they bound to the same  duties  and exposed to the same  trials.  The parallelism between the ‘word’ of Jesus and that of His disciples is instructive. Lying at the bottom of all the language here employed is the great truth that what He has been they are to be.
