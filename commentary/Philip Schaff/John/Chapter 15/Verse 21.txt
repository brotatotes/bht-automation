John 15:21.  But all these things will they do unto you because of my name, because they know not him that sent me.  Their sufferings shall not only be like those of Jesus, but ‘because of His name,’ because of all that is involved in His Person and work the Person and the work which they continually hold forth to men. The latter part of the verse contains at once an explanation of the world’s folly and guilt, and a striking comment upon the fulness of meaning involved in the word ‘name.’ It is because the world knows not God that it hates alike the Son and His disciples. It thinks that it knows God, it has even a zeal for His worship; but the spirituality of His nature, the love which is the essence of His being, it does not know; it turns from them and hates them when they are revealed in their true character; how can it do otherwise than hate One who is the very expression of that spirituality and love; and, hating Him, how can it fail to hate those who continue His work?
