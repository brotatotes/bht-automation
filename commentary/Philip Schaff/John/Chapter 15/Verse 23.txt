<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:23">John 15:23</span>. <strong> He that hateth me hateth my Father also. </strong> Nay more, in hating Jesus the world was also setting itself against that very God whom it professed to honour. It was really hating not the Son only but His Father whom He revealed. This was the disastrous issue of its course of action! Not they who inflicted suffering, but they who suffered, were the conquerors.
