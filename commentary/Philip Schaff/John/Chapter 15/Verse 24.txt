John 15:24.  If I had not done among them the works which none other did, they would not have sin; but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.  Jesus had spoken in John 15:22 of his ‘words’ as sufficient to deprive the world of all excuse in rejecting and hating Him. He now turns to His ‘works’ as effecting the same end. The words of Jesus were the Father’s words as well as His own (chap. John 3:34); of the same character are the ‘works,’ which here, as elsewhere, are not to be confined to miracles. They include all that Jesus did, and their appeal had been to the same internal eye which ought to have seen the force and beauty of   the ‘word.’ But that eye the world had closed, and for the same reason as before, so that it was again without excuse.
