<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:3">John 15:3</span>. <strong> Already are ye clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you. </strong> On ‘word,’ not ‘words,’ see on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:24">John 14:24</span>. The ‘ye’ is emphatic. <em> They </em> were pruned, <em> they </em> were ‘clean;’ and that ‘already,’ because they had already received the word which they were now, in their turn, to communicate. Jesus does not say that they are clean ‘through,’ but ‘because of the word which He had spoken unto them. They have heard (and received) the word of the Holy One of God,’ and because His word is in them they are clean. Thus are they fitted for imparting the means of a like cleansing to others. Not personal piety but Christian action is still in view, and still the ‘cleanness’ which they possess does not exclude the future and continuous cleansing.
