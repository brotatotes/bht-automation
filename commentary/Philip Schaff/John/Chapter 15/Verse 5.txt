John 15:5.  I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth  much  fruit; because apart from me ye can do nothing.  The transition from John 15:4 to John 15:5 appears to be similar to that from chap. John 5:19-23 to chap. John 5:24, a transition from the principle to its application to men. In substance the lesson is the same as before; and it has only to be distinctly observed that the words ‘ye can do nothing’ refer to the efforts of one already a   believer. The state of faith is presupposed.
