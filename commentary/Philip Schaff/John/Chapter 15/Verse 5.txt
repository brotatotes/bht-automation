<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:5">John 15:5</span>. <strong> I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth </strong> much <strong> fruit; because apart from me ye can do nothing. </strong> The transition from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:4">John 15:4</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:5">John 15:5</span> appears to be similar to that from chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19-23">John 5:19-23</span> to chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>, a transition from the principle to its application to men. In substance the lesson is the same as before; and it has only to be distinctly observed that the words ‘ye can do nothing’ refer to the efforts of one already a <strong> </strong> believer. The state of faith is presupposed.
