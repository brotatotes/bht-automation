John 15:9.  Even as the Father loved me, I also loved you: abide in my love.  By keeping in view what has been said on John 15:8 we shall understand the transition here to the thought of love. The main thought of that verse was, as we have seen, that of union and communion with the Father and the Son; but the main element of that communion is love, love which flows forth from the Father to the Son, and then from the Son to the members of His body, thus forming that community of love so often spoken of in these chapters. In this love, then (it follows as a necessary consequence), we must ‘abide’ if we would experience its fruits. It is hardly necessary to say that ‘My love’ is the Lord’s love to His people, not theirs to Him.
