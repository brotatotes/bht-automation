<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:1">John 16:1</span>. <strong> These things have I spoken unto you, that ye may not be made to stumble. </strong> The ‘things’ referred to are especially those described in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:18-27">John 15:18-27</span>, and the verse is a pause (not the introduction of a new idea) before the same subject is resumed: there is no change either of circumstances or of topic: the difference between this passage and the earlier is simply one climax. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:1-6">John 16:1-6</span> correspond to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:18-25">John 15:18-25</span>: <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7-11">John 16:7-11</span>, to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:26-27">John 16:26-27</span> of the same chapter. The word ‘make to stumble’ is used in this Gospel only in one other passage, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:61">John 6:61</span>. It points to the danger of having faith and constancy shaken by trial instead of standing firm in allegiance to Jesus, whatever might be the difficulties encountered in His service.
