John 16:1.  These things have I spoken unto you, that ye may not be made to stumble.  The ‘things’ referred to are especially those described in chap. John 15:18-27, and the verse is a pause (not the introduction of a new idea) before the same subject is resumed: there is no change either of circumstances or of topic: the difference between this passage and the earlier is simply one climax. John 16:1-6 correspond to John 15:18-25: John 16:7-11, to John 16:26-27 of the same chapter. The word ‘make to stumble’ is used in this Gospel only in one other passage, John 6:61. It points to the danger of having faith and constancy shaken by trial instead of standing firm in allegiance to Jesus, whatever might be the difficulties encountered in His service.
