John 16:14.  He shall glorify me, because of that which is mine will  he receive  and will declare it unto you.  On the glorifying of Jesus here spoken of, see on chap. John 13:31. This glory will be given Him by the powerful working of the Holy Spirit in the Church,  because  that which the Spirit applies for the ever increasing growth and efficiency of the Church is only a fuller unfolding of ‘the unsearchable riches of Christ.’ To Him as the Alpha and Omega of our faith, and never beyond Him, the Spirit leads us.
