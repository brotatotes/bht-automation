<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:15">John 16:15</span>. <strong> All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine:</strong> <strong> therefore said I that he</strong> <strong> receiveth of that which</strong> <strong> is mine, and will declare it unto you. </strong> It is of Himself as Son of man as well as Son of God, not of Himself only as the Eternal Son, that Jesus speaks. In that capacity ‘all things whatsoever’ had been given Him by the Father. Therefore might He well say in the previous verse that, in leading His disciples onward to the ultimate goal of the Divine purposes, the Spirit would do this by receiving and declaring of that which was <em> His. </em> What was so received and declared would not fall short, therefore, of leading them into the highest truth the truth as to ‘the Father.’
