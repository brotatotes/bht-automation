<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:16">John 16:16</span>. <strong> A little while, and ye behold me no longer; and again a little while, and ye shall see me. </strong> Trial has been spoken of and encouragement given. That both shall <em> soon </em> be known is the transition to the present verse. The difference between the verbs ‘behold’ and ‘see’ must determine the meaning of the words, the former here denoting (as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:19">John 14:19</span>) vision with the bodily, the latter vision with the spiritual, eye. The time closing the first ‘little while’ is the death of Christ, when ‘not beholding’ begins; the time closing the second ‘little while’ dates from the resurrection, when the ‘seeing’ begins and continues for ever (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:19">John 14:19</span>). After the death of their Lord the disciples shall be in the position of the world (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:13">John 13:13</span>); under the saddening influence of that event their faith shall wane, and all the joy experienced in His presence shall disappear. But He whom they had thought lost for ever shall enter at His resurrection on a glorified existence, from which He shall send to them that Advocate in whom and through whom He shall be always with them, and they with Him.
