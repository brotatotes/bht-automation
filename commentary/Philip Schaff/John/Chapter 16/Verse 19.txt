<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:19">John 16:19</span>. <strong> Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not: and again a little while, and ye shall see me?</strong> He entered at once into their difficulties, and proceeded to explain more fully what he meant, not indeed dwelling most upon the ‘little while,’ but upon the great and sudden contrasts of mind to be <strong> </strong> experienced by them, and previously hinted at in <strong> </strong> the words ‘behold’ and ‘see.’
