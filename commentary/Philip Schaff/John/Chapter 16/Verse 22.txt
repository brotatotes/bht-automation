<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:22">John 16:22</span>. <strong> And ye therefore now have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh away from you. </strong> At <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:19">John 16:19</span> <strong> </strong> Jesus had said ‘ye shall see me,’ but now He says ‘I will see you.’ It is the blessed reciprocity of intercourse between Him and His own. From the moment of the resurrection He will see them, and they shall see Him, and shall rise to the full brightness of that position to which He elevates His people. Nor will this ‘seeing’ terminate with the ascension, for it is their spiritual vision that is mainly thought of. In the power of the Spirit He will see them and they Him, and they shall rejoice with a triumphant and abiding joy.
