<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:8">John 16:8</span>. <strong> And he, when he is come, will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment</strong>. The Agent has been spoken of; we now enter upon His work, and the climax from chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span>, where the same aspect of the Spirit ‘s work is spoken of, is clearly perceptible. We are not to understand by the word ‘convict’ either simply ‘reprove’ or ‘convince.’ It is much more than both, and implies that answer of conscience to the reproving convincing voice, by which a man condemns himself (chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:20">John 3:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:26">John 8:26</span>). The word ‘concerning’ also is not the same as ‘of.’ The inference to be drawn from these considerations (comp. also on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:30-31">John 14:30-31</span>) is that in the conviction of the world here spoken of its conversion is not necessarily implied. Conversion may or may not follow for anything here stated. The promise now given to the disciples is not that they shall convert the world, but that it shall be silenced, self - condemned, overwhelmed with shame and confusion of face. The Judge of all the earth is upon their side; He will judge for them.
