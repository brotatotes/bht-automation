<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:17-18">John 16:17-18</span>. <strong> Some of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while and ye behold me not: and again a little while, and ye shall see me: and, I go away to the Father?</strong> <em> </em> <strong> They said therefore. What is this which he calleth, A little while? We know not what he speaketh. </strong> Their perplexity is natural, and it is occasioned not only by the last words actually used by Jesus, but <em> by </em> what had been so prominent a point in the previous part of His discourse, that He was going away to the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:10">John 16:10</span>). They fear, however, to ask a direct explanation from their Lord, and some of them discuss the matter among themselves.
