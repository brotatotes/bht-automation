John 16:17-18.  Some of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while and ye behold me not: and again a little while, and ye shall see me: and, I go away to the Father?    They said therefore. What is this which he calleth, A little while? We know not what he speaketh.  Their perplexity is natural, and it is occasioned not only by the last words actually used by Jesus, but  by  what had been so prominent a point in the previous part of His discourse, that He was going away to the Father (John 16:10). They fear, however, to ask a direct explanation from their Lord, and some of them discuss the matter among themselves.
