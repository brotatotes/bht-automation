<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:23-24">John 16:23-24</span>. <strong> And in that day ye shall ask me no question. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If ye shall ask anything of the Father, he will give it you in my name. Hitherto ye asked nothing in my name; ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be fulfilled. </strong> The two verbs here rendered ‘ask a question’ and ‘ask’ are different; and though the former may be used of prayer when <em> our Lord ‘</em> asks’ the Father (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:9">John 17:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:20">John 17:20</span>), it seems impossible to separate the use of ‘ask a <strong> </strong> question’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:23">John 16:23</span> from its use in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:19">John 16:19</span> and again in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:30">John 16:30</span>, in both which passages it refers to asking information upon points occasioning perplexity <strong> </strong> to the mind. The declaration of Jesus thus is, that in the day when the joy of the disciples is perfected they will not need to feel that they must have Him beside them to solve their difficulties. They will then be so entirely in Him, one with Him, that along with Him they will have such a full knowledge from the Holy Spirit a knowledge belonging to His ‘day’ as will exclude the need of such questions. But this full knowledge will do more. If it restrains the questioning of ignorance, it at the same time opens their eyes to see better all their true need, and the source from which it shall be supplied. Therefore, not in a spirit of curious questioning but in a spirit of perfect trust let them approach the Father, for He will give to them ‘in the name’ of Jesus. He has revealed Himself to them in Jesus as their Father; He has made them in Him His own sons; therefore shall they receive as sons, and nothing shall be awanting to the fulfilment of their joy.
