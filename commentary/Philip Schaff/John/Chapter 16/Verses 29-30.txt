<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:29-30">John 16:29-30</span>. <strong> His disciples say, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and sayest no proverb: now we know that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any one should ask thee questions: by</strong> <em> </em> <strong> this we believe that thou earnest forth from God. </strong> Two entirely different views may be taken of the feelings and <strong> </strong> language of the <strong> </strong> disciples as here described. Either they are really led into a sudden knowledge of the truth, thus affording a striking illustration of darkness dispelled and of heavenly light shining into the heart from the teaching of Jesus, while He again joyfully recognises their faith and beholds in it an earnest of completed victory: or the disciples misunderstand themselves, and confess their faith in a manner which, though sincere, is so imperfect that Jesus is constrained to speak to them in words of warning. The latter view is that which deserves acceptance. The disciples ‘words,’ ‘now we know,’ contrasting with the promise of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:23">John 16:23</span>, a promise relating to the future, are obviously hasty; there was nothing clearer in the latest words of Jesus than in words often uttered by Him before; and, above all, the confession proves itself by its very terms to be imperfect, inadequate, inferior to that of a true faith. ‘From God,’ the disciples say in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:30">John 16:30</span>; not the ‘from’ of either <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:27">John 16:27</span> or <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:28">John 16:28</span>, but one expressing a less intimate relationship with the Father than that of which Jesus had just spoken. The disciples think that they believe, but they do not believe in such a way as will alone enable them to stand in the midst of coming trial. They are not content to take Jesus at His word, that <em> by and by </em> their faith will be experimental, deep, victorious. They persuade themselves that even ‘now’ it is all that it need be; and they must be warned and reproved.
