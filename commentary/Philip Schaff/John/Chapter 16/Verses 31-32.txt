<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:31-32">John 16:31-32</span>. <strong> Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? Behold, an hour cometh and is come, that ye should be scattered, each one to his own, and leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me</strong>. The view taken of the preceding verse leads to the conclusion that the first clause of this verse is interrogative, not affirmative, and the conclusion is favoured by chaps, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:70">John 6:70</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:38">John 13:38</span>. The meaning of the reply is, ‘You anticipate the time, you deceive yourselves; this faith of yours, sincere and real up to a certain point though it be, needs deepening and perfecting. It will be deepened and perfected in such a way that no trial will be too hard for it but not yet: rather the hour cometh, and is come, when you shall all forsake Me in the time of My greatest need, and shall think only selfishly of yourselves. Yet, notwithstanding, even then, when to all appearance alone, I am not alone, for the Father is with Me.’
