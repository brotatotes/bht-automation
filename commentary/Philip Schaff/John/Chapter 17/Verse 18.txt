John 17:18.  Even as thou didst send me into the world, I also sent them into the world.  Jesus has prayed for the consecration of His disciples in the truth, and He now   speaks of the necessity that existed for it. They have been sent into the world (the sending is viewed as already accomplished) ‘even as’ He had been sent into the world. Not merely is the  fact of sending similar, but they are sent by the Son with the same commission as that with which the Son Himself had been sent by the Father. They are to ‘declare ’ the Father as He had done, and to make the same revelation of eternal truth, of eternal love, to a sinful world. How much, then, did they need a consecration like His! But not only so. There is a further ground upon which His prayer ‘or their consecration rests. ’
