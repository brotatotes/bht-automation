<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:20">John 17:20</span>. <strong> But not concerning these only do I ask, but also concerning them which believe in me through their word.</strong> From the thought of the disciples whom He was sending forth to carry on His work, Jesus now turns, in the third and last section of His prayer, to the thought of all who through their word shall be brought to faith, to the thought of believers in every country and in every age. They are spoken of as those ‘which ’ believe, not indeed in actual fact, for none had as yet believed through the instrumentality of the disciples; but in idea they rise before the mind of Jesus, His Church down to the very end of time. The ‘word’ spoken of is that of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:14">John 17:14</span>, the special word which is the revelation of the Father, and which brings man to recognise the love of the Father as it appears in the Son, and in the Son to them.</p>
