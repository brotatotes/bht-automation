John 17:26.  And I made known unto them thy name, and will make it known, that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them.  The thought of John 17:25 is now more fully expressed, and, with it, the result to which the knowledge spoken of conducts all believers is summed up in the one word inclusive of   every blessing, both for time and for eternity, love. How exhaustive is the mode in which Jesus teaches the ‘name’ of God, the revelation of the Father in the Son, ‘I made it known to them; they know; I shall make it known to them! ’ It is the expression of complete revelation, similar so far as in such a matter we may speak of similarity to ‘Which was, and is, and is to come.’ Therefore there naturally follows to all who embrace this revelation a perfect entering into that of which it tells, into that love which unites the Father and the Son, and which shall be in them, as Jesus Himself shall be in them, the unbroken rest of ‘peace ’ after the toils, the eternal sunshine of ‘joy’ after the sorrows, of the world.
	Thus the third section of the prayer closes, its main burden having been that the whole Church of God, believers of every age and country, may be so brought to and kept in the unity of the Father and the Son that the glory of the Son in the Father may be theirs. For then, the conflicts of this world ended, they shall be partakers of the fulness of that love of the Father which shall encompass them as it encompassed the Son before the foundation of the world, pure, undimmed, undisturbed by the presence of either sin or sorrow, the Father in the Son and the Son in them, all in perfect holiness and blessedness consummated into One. Thus, too, shall the end of all be attained, the glorifying of Him ‘of whom and through whom and to whom are all things.’
