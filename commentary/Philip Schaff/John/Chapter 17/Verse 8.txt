<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:8">John 17:8</span>. <strong> Because the words which thou gavest me I have given them, and they received them, and learned to know truly that I came forth from thee, and believed that thou didst send me. </strong> These words explain the fact stated immediately before. The disciples had received a consciousness similar to that of Jesus, because He, on His part, had implanted His words in them; and they, on their part, had responded, receiving what He gave. They ‘received,’ ‘learned to know,’ ‘believed:’ the three verbs, closely following each other in the same tense, correspond to the solemnity of the statement. Again, however, we see that far more is meant than the reception of particular truths: the main thought is, that He has transferred His own mind to His disciples, that He has taught them His own truths and thoughts, and that they, while retaining their own proper individuality (the word <em> they </em> before ‘received’ being equivalent to ‘they themselves’), have fully made them their own.
