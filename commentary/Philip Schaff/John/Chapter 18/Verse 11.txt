<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:11">John 18:11</span>. <strong> Jesus therefore said unto Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given me, should I not drink it? </strong> The aid of all violence is disclaimed. Jesus speaks not of ‘thy’ sword but of ‘the’ sword, and thus shows that He can Himself resort to no measure of outward self-defence. It is His Father’s will that He should suffer and die, and to that will He unhesitatingly resigns Himself. The particular form in which the submission is expressed reminds us of the prayer in Gethsemane (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:39">Matthew 26:39</span>), and the same form of expression occurs at <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:22">Matthew 20:22</span>. It appears to have been frequent on the lips of the Son of man. Jesus is now of His own accord at the disposal of His enemies. His words have put a stop to all further steps for His defence.
