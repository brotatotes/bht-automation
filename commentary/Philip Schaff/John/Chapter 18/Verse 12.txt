John 18:12.  The band of soldiers therefore, and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, took Jesus and bound him.  The words addressed by Jesus to Peter   lend boldness to His cowardly foes. They see that no further resistance is to be offered. A passive victim is before them; and they seize and bind Him.
