It may be used only with reference to the narrative that follows; but it is also possible that we have here another instance, similar to that which we have already met in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:24">John 3:24</span>, <strong> </strong> of the clear and decided manner in which the writer of the Fourth Gospel corrects impressions drawn from the incomplete statements of the earlier Gospels. In the latter we read only of a hearing before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin, and no mention is made of Annas. That Jesus <em> was</em> taken before Annas ‘first’ is the statement of John, and the very distinctness with which it is made is no small evidence that we are dealing with real history.</p>
