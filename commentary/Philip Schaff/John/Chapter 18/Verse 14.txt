<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:14">John 18:14</span>. <strong> Now Caiaphas was he who had given counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. </strong> The introduction of these words obviously indicates that the reason why Jesus was taken to Annas first is not to be found in the mere <em> fact</em> of his relationship to Caiaphas, but that it is to be sought also in that <em> character</em> of the latter which, it was hoped, would influence the former. By the reference made to chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:50">John 11:50</span> we are reminded that, in his hostility to Jesus, Caiaphas had lost self-control, and had become a mere instrument in the hands of higher powers who were urging him onward to fill up the measure of his guilt. Either, therefore, the Jews thought that the hostility to Jesus raging in his breast must have already influenced his whole family circle (comp. chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:71">John 6:71</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:26">John 13:26</span>), or they hoped that Annas, if not as yet so deeply implicated in the plot as his son-in-law, might now be persuaded to throw himself heartily into their plans. It was at the same time of the utmost importance to secure the co-operation of Annas, whose influence, as we learn from Josephus, was very great in Jerusalem. Before this powerful man then Jesus stands, bound, submissive, knowing the fate that is before Him. Resting upon this as its background, we have now what the Evangelist, as we shall yet more clearly see, is greatly concerned to describe, the faithlessness of Peter.
