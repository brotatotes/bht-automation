John 18:16.  But Peter stood at the door without.  Peter is stopped at the door; and, while   he stands there, Jesus is lost to his view.
	 The other disciple therefore, which was known unto the high priest, went forth and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.  The circumstance thus related   is in the highest degree natural, and it is related in the most simple manner.
