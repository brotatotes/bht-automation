<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:25">John 18:25</span>. <strong> And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. </strong> The remarkable taking up again in these words of the fact already mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:18">John 18:18</span> cannot fail to arrest attention. As far as mere history is concerned, the words are unnecessary. Nor does there seem to be any explanation of their presence here but that they are designed to elucidate the idea of the scene about to be described. Peter is no longer only near the door; he is within the court. He is no longer only in the cold; he is warming himself at the charcoal fire. He is no longer only with John; he is along with the servants and officers of the Jews. Everything corresponds to that more determined, that double, denial of our Lord now to be described.

<p><strong> They said therefore unto him, Art thou also one of his disciples? He denied and said, I am not. </strong> We are not told who asked the question. The general pronoun ‘they’ is used. In the narratives of the earlier Evangelists we find that, according to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:71">Matthew 26:71</span>, this denial was drawn forth by ‘another maid;’ according to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:69">Mark 14:69</span> by ‘the maid,’ probably the maid of the porch; according to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:58">Luke 22:58</span> by ‘another man.’ In John we have what seems the solution of these apparent discrepancies. It was not one person only that thus spoke to Peter. The remark was made by many, in the excitement of the moment by many at the same time; and Peter (as is even implied in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:70">Mark 14:70</span>) repeated his answer to one after another. The ‘they’ thus suggests what was the true course of events. The second denial, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:72">Matthew 26:72</span>, was in boldness and recklessness an advance upon the first. At <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:17">John 18:17</span> only the word ‘saith’ is used; now ‘denied and said.’
