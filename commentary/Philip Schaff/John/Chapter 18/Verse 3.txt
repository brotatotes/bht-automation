<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:3">John 18:3</span>. <strong> Judas therefore having received the band of soldiers, and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.</strong> The circumstances here mentioned are in contrast with those of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:1">John 18:1</span>, constituting the obverse side of the picture, before the ‘went forth’ of that verse is again taken up in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:4">John 18:4</span>, and thus illustrating the same principles of structure as those which met us in the opening verses of chap. 13. The general situation is set before us from its two different sides: the first consisting of (1) Jesus, (2) His disciples; the second, of (I) Judas, (2) the band of soldiers, etc. The mention of ‘the band’ has been made an object of ridicule, as if it could only mean ‘half a Roman army.’ The ridicule is groundless, for (1) Even if we allow, what it is extremely possible was not the case, that the band was of its full strength, it was after all only the same as the ‘cohort,’ the tenth part of a legion. (2) The Romans in all probability did not think of one man only to be made prisoner, but of the danger of a popular tumult. (3) In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:23">Acts 23:23</span> we have a remarkable instance of the number of soldiers used upon a similar occasion. As the band now mentioned was obtained from the Roman authorities, we see that, from an early period of the night, they must have been led to interest themselves in the transactions taking place. The ‘officers’ were the servants of the chief priests and Pharisees. The trees of the garden made ‘lanterns and torches’ necessary. Although the moon was near the full, the Jews would imagine that Jesus might hide Himself in the covert and so escape.</p>
