John 18:31.  Pilate therefore said unto them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.  Pilate has already seen enough to satisfy him that no offence against civil order, calling for his interposition, has been committed. He will have nothing to do with merely religious squabbles, and he remits the whole matter to the Jews themselves. Thus the Jews are compelled to declare their purpose, and their  self-confessed   humiliation begins.
	 The Jews said unto him,  It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.  Shortly before this time the Jews had lost the power of putting criminals to death. But the point now is, that they have to  confess it. In their answer the Evangelist seems to see a mockery of their high pretensions. The bitter irony of circumstances forces from them an acknowledgment of their shame. But, while they are thus degraded, the Divine purpose proceeds calmly to its accomplishment.
