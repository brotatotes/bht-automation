<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:38">John 18:38</span>. <strong> Pilate saith unto him, What</strong> <strong> is truth?</strong> Not surely the question of one seriously searching after truth, for in that case he would have waited for a reply; nor that of one in despair, which would presuppose a moral depth in Pilate’s character inconsistent with the light in which he comes before us both here and elsewhere; nor of mere frivolity, as if he were treating the whole subject lightly, for in that case he would probably have made fewer efforts to release Jesus; but simply the question of one who, having no correct ideas as to truth, and no conviction even that there was such a thing, found in this frame of mind a hindrance to the faith to which he might otherwise have risen. ‘Were there such a thing as truth,’ he says, ‘then I might believe Thee, but truth is nothing, and therefore Thy kingly position, if in this respect only Thou art a <em> King, </em> need not <em> command </em> my homage.’

<p><strong> And when he had said this, he went forth again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no crime. </strong> It is a distinct sentence of acquittal; and the point of the whole, <em> as </em> it presented itself to the eye of the Evangelist, seems to be in <strong> </strong> this, that a Roman governor, a Gentile, declares the innocence and even feels to some extent the true majesty of Him who, though King of the Jews, is rejected and doomed to death by that blinded and guilty people. This guilt of theirs, however, has to be brought out more fully. Another opportunity of retracing their steps has to be offered them, and to be cast away.</p>
