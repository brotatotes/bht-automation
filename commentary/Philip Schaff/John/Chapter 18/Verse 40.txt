<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:40">John 18:40</span>. <strong> They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas.</strong> The word <strong> </strong> ‘again’ is here peculiarly worthy of notice. No previous cry of the Jews had been mentioned by the Evangelist; and, had his story been constructed merely to illustrate an idea, he certainly would not have spoken of a second cry when he had said nothing of a first. The word can only be a historical reminiscence in the writer’s own mind. He knew that the Jews had cried out before, although he had not thought it necessary to mention it. Now, therefore, when a cry was to be spoken of, which he remembers was a second one, an indication that it was so comes naturally from his pen, ‘They cried out therefore <em> again</em>.’ The cry was, ‘Not this man but Barabbas;’ and the guilty nature of the cry is immediately intensified by a brief but emphatic statement, designed far more to bring out this guilt than to make us acquainted with a fact of history.

<p><strong> Now Barabbas was a robber. </strong> A robber! and yet they preferred him to the holy Jesus, to the Only-Begotten of the Father, to their King!
