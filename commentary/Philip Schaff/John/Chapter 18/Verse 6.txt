John 18:6.  When therefore he said unto them,  I am he, they went backward and fell to the ground.  It is   the Divine majesty and innocence of Jesus that produced the effect. Like the buyers and sellers in   the temple, the history of whose terror at the presence of the Redeemer is   vouched for by the testimony of the earlier gospels as much as by that of the fourth, they are overwhelmed with awe, and fall before Him (comp. on  John 2:16). As soon as they recover, Jesus repeats His question.
