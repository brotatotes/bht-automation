<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:10">John 19:10</span>. <strong> Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and that I have power to crucify thee</strong>? There is no trace of spiritual feeling in these words; nothing but the sense of offended dignity, that to one in his position, and possessed of his power, a poor prisoner should decline to reply. Hence the position of ‘to me,’ at the head of the sentence, and hence the <strong> </strong> twice repeated ‘power,’ to emphasize the authority which he possessed. The mention of ‘release’ comes first, as the consideration most likely to <strong> </strong> tell upon one in the danger in which Jesus stood. To this remark of Pilate an answer is given.</p>
