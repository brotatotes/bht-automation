John 19:20.  This title then read many of the Jews, for the place of the city where Jesus was crucified was nigh.  The language in which this proximity of Golgotha to the city is spoken of   is in a high degree remarkable: not ‘the place was nigh to the city,’ but ‘the place of the city was nigh.’ We are not to   imagine that by these words the Evangelist means to say that the place of   the crucifixion was   within the city.
