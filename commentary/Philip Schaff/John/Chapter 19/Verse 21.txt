<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:21">John 19:21</span>. <strong> The chief priests of the Jews</strong> <strong> therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews, but, That man said, I am King of the Jews. </strong> The offence taken might have been, and probably was, expected by Pilate; but the mode in which it is described is again highly worthy of our notice. This is the only occasion on which we meet with the expression ‘the chief priests of the Jews;’ and as it occurs in such close connection with the words ‘the King of the Jews,’ we can hardly doubt that the latter words determined the form of the phrase before us. On the one side we see the King of the Jews defeated, yet victorious; suspended on the cross, yet proclaimed to be what He is in all the great languages of the world; set before us as universal King. On the other side we see the chief priests of the Jews victorious, yet defeated; their object apparently accomplished, yet its accomplishment turned to their own shame, and their Victim’s glory. Their request was denied in the most curt and contemptuous language.</p>
