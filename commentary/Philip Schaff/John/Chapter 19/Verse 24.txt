<p><strong> That the scripture might be fulfilled, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they cast lots. </strong> The quotation is from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:18">Psalms 22:18</span>, and is accurately reproduced from the Septuagint.

<p><strong> These things therefore the soldiers did. </strong> The words may either be intended to emphasize the presence of God in the scene, as He made the Roman soldiers fulfil His Scripture; or may simply arise out of the intense interest with which John narrates each particular of these eventful hours. Another scene is now presented to us.</p>
