John 19:24.  They said therefore to one another. Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be.  Both in the dividing and in the casting of lots the Evangelist sees Scripture fulfilled.
	 That the scripture might be fulfilled, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they cast lots.  The quotation is from Psalms 22:18, and is accurately reproduced from the Septuagint.
	 These things therefore the soldiers did.  The words may either be intended to emphasize the presence of God in the scene, as He made the Roman soldiers fulfil His Scripture; or may simply arise out of the intense interest with which John narrates each particular of these eventful hours. Another scene is now presented to us.
