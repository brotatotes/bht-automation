<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:28">John 19:28</span>. <strong> After this. Jesus knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst. </strong> It is a question whether the words ‘that the Scripture might be accomplished’ are to be connected with what precedes or with what follows. In favour of the former connection it may be said ( 1 ) It is John’s practice to point out the fulfilment of Scripture after, not before, the event fulfilling it. ( 2 ) It is his usual practice to notice the fulfilment of Scripture in what is done <em> to</em> Jesus, rather than in what is done <em> by</em> Him to fulfil it. ( 3 ) The use of the word ‘now’ seems to show that we have already reached a complete accomplishment of Scripture. It would thus appear that it is the intention of the Evangelist to present to us a word spoken by Jesus at a moment when He knew that Scripture had been already fulfilled. He is in the position of One whose work is done, and for whom nothing remains but to depart. The strong counter-argument is that everywhere else in this Gospel (see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:22">John 2:22</span>) ‘the scripture’ denotes some <em> special passage</em>. As, however, we cannot doubt that John regarded the utterance here recorded as fulfilling <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:21">Psalms 69:21</span> (see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:17">John 2:17</span>), the difference between the two interpretations is less than it at first appears. That thirst was a great part of the agony of the cross we know; nor in all probability should we think of more, were it not the manner of John to relate minor incidents, not for themselves alone, but for the sake of the deeper meaning which he always sees to be involved in them. This <em> manner</em> of the Evangelist, therefore, compels us to ask whether there may not be a deeper meaning in this cry? Let us turn to chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:7">John 4:7</span>. There, immediately after mention of ‘the sixth hour,’ Jesus says to the woman of Samaria, ‘Give me to drink.’ Here <strong> , </strong> in close contiguity with another ‘sixth hour’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:14">John 19:14</span>), He says, ‘I thirst.’ But we have already seen in the language of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:7">John 4:7</span> the longing of the Redeemer for the fruits of that work which He was then accomplishing in toil and weariness; and we are thus led to think of something of the same kind here. It was not merely to temper suffering that Jesus cried, but it was for refreshment to the body symbolizing a deeper refreshment to the soul. The request thus made was answered.</p>
