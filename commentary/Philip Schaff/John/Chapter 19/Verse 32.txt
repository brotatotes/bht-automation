John 19:32.  The soldiers therefore came and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.  The bodies had been suspended on the cross with Jesus in the midst. It is natural to suppose that the soldiers, approaching from two opposite sides, would proceed in the order thus mentioned: each would strike his blow on one malefactorâ€™s body; then they would come to Jesus.
