<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:35">John 19:35</span>. <strong> And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true; and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe.</strong> It is of himself that the Evangelist speaks: compare <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1-3">1 John 1:1-3</span>. The witness that he bears is ‘true.’ The word differs from that which is used in the second member of this verse and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:24">John 21:24</span> (‘We know that his witness is true’). It designates the testimony as <em> genuine</em> and <em> real</em>. <strong> </strong> Not only is it <em> truthful</em>, but it is all that testimony can be: the witness will not deceive, but more than this in regard to the matter which he here attests he cannot have been deceived or mistaken. See the notes on chaps, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:37">John 4:37</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:16">John 8:16</span>. The object of this solemn testimony is that they may ‘believe;’ not simply may believe the facts, but may rest in a true and settled faith upon Him of whom these wonders can be related. The significance belonging to the facts thus solemnly commemorated is now further illustrated (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:36-37">John 19:36-37</span>): they are the fulfilment of the Divine counsels expressed in Scripture.</p>
