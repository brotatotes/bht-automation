<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:39">John 19:39</span>. <strong> And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</strong> The <strong> </strong> quantity of spices thus brought by Nicodemus is certainly remarkable; and hence some have shrunk from taking the words in their literal sense, holding that ‘a hundred pound’ (especially as here qualified by ‘about’) may be an expression merely denoting a great quantity. Others, following the suggestion of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ch+16:14">2 Chronicles 16:14</span>, have supposed that, when part of <strong> </strong> the mixture of <strong> </strong> spices had been spread on the linen cloths in which the body was to be wrapped, the remainder was destined for ‘a burning.’ Whether this be accepted or not, the passage referred to is interesting as bringing before us the burial of a King <strong> .</strong> The distinct identification of this Nicodemus with the ruler who came to Jesus by night (chap. 3) is undoubtedly significant. The humiliation of the King of Israel (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:3">John 3:3</span>, <strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:13">John 12:13</span></strong>), <strong> </strong> so far from discouraging, does but strengthen the once weak faith of the true disciple; and in contrast with (and may we not add in expression of shame and penitence for) timorous hesitation, we read of the lavish offering of a love open and avowed. The declaration of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:32">John 12:32</span> begins to receive its fulfilment.
