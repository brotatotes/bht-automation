<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:7">John 19:7</span>. <strong> The Jews answered him. We have a law, and by the law he ought to die, because he made himself Son of God. </strong> The ‘We’ is emphatic. ‘Thou, Pilate, mayest pronounce Him innocent; and He may be innocent of all such crimes as are wont to be tried at thy bar. But <em> We</em> have a law, and that law denounces death to persons like Him; for He made Himself Son of God.’ The law referred to is <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+24:16">Leviticus 24:16</span>, and the crime is that Jesus represented Himself to be what He really was. Such was the guilt of the Jews. Not upon false pretences, but upon the greatest of all falsehoods, the misinterpretation of <strong> </strong> the truth, in the thickest of all darkness, the light itself made darkness, they hurried Jesus to His doom. The effect upon Pilate of this charge they had not anticipated.</p>
