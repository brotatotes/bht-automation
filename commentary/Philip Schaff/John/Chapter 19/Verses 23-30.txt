<p>This paragraph details some of the events of the crucifixion, but not in strict historical sequence to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:21-22">John 19:21-22</span>. The conference with Pilate there alluded to following as it did the reading of the inscription spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:20">John 19:20</span>, must have been later than the moment when the division of the raiment of Jesus by the soldiers began. We can hardly doubt that this latter would begin as soon as the cross was erected and Jesus nailed to it.</p>
