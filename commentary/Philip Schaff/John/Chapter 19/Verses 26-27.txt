<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:26-27">John 19:26-27</span>. <strong> When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom be loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold, thy son. Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother; and from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home. </strong> The act thus recorded has been variously interpreted; by some as in its main purpose an act of filial care for the mother whose soul was now about to be pierced by the sword spoken of in the prophetic word of Simeon (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:35">Luke 2:35</span>); by others as a formal renunciation of her, that He may surrender Himself wholly to the will of His heavenly Father. It is in the first of these two lights that we must chiefly regard it. Then we can best explain the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:27">John 19:27</span>, which are evidently the Evangelistâ€™s commentary upon what had just passed; and the renunciation spoken of had really taken place at chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:4">John 2:4</span>.</p>
