<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:33-34">John 19:33-34</span>. <strong> But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs; but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came</strong> <strong> forth blood and water. </strong> The explanation of the fact here recorded has always been felt to be attended with peculiar difficulty. The idea that Jesus was not dead, but that death was produced by the spear-wound, must at once be set aside. It is inconsistent with the distinct language of the Evangelist, which states the fact, and not merely what the soldier thought, that Jesus was ‘dead already.’ It is inconsistent with what we have been previously told, that Jesus had ‘delivered up’ His spirit into the hands of His Father. And it is not less inconsistent with the symbolism of the passage, which would have been inadmissible had not John believed that death was past. But the impossibility that blood and water should issue from the side of a person already dead is urged on physiological grounds. It might be possible to adopt the explanation of some eminent commentators, that we have here a unique appearance based upon a unique situation. If it be a general truth that the moment death comes corruption begins, and if, notwithstanding, Jesus ‘saw no corruption,’ we are prepared to expect that the phenomena accompanying His death will transcend our experience; and it may well be that we have such phenomena before us here. Before we resort, however, to such an explanation, we ought to ask whether, when we take all the circumstances into account, it is really necessary. We remark therefore that ( 1 ) There is nothing to prevent our assuming that the spear- wound was inflicted the <em> instant after death.</em> The Evangelist does not convey the slightest hint to us that any interval elapsed between the two events, and the nature of death by crucifixion is such as to call us to think of the latest possible moment as that of death. ‘Pilate marvelled if He were already dead’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:44">Mark 15:44</span>). ( 2 ) In conformity with the opinion of all expositors, the region of the heart must be looked upon as that penetrated by the spear. ( 3 ) The ‘blood and water’ derive <em> all</em> their importance from that symbolical meaning which they have in the eyes of John. The circumstance which more than any other has led inquirers astray in judging of what we have here before us is, that they have supposed it to be the aim of the Evangelist to establish the fact that Jesus was really put to death. But, as we shall see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:35">John 19:35</span>, this is certainly not the point before him. The fact now spoken of has no connection whatever with <em> proof</em> that death had taken place; and it is mentioned solely for the sake of the deeper meaning which it involves. ( 4 ) These things being so, it is obviously a matter of no moment what the <em> quantity</em> of ‘blood and water’ that issued from the wound may have been. The smallest quantity will suffice; and will suggest the truth intended as well as the largest.
	</p>
<p>But it has never been proved that such a <em> small</em> <strong> </strong> quantity might not issue from a wound thus inflicted. The wound would be a large one; the iron point of the spear, we may be sure, was both heavy and rough; and if the instant after death the pericardium and heart were pierced, there is no difficulty in supposing such an effusion of blood and of water, or <em> serum</em>, as could not fail to attract the attention of the beholder, and suggest to his mind lessons of deep spiritual significance. If this be so, the literal interpretation of the passage may be retained. What the water and blood symbolized to John must be learned from the general tenor of his writings. The ‘blood’ brings to mind the sacrifice for the world’s sin (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>), the life laid down for the life of the world (chaps, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:15">John 10:15</span>), the cleansing of and by atonement (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span>). The ‘water’ recalls the teaching of chaps, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:5">John 3:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:38">John 7:38</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:8">John 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:10">John 13:10</span>; and symbolizes the abiding gift of the Spirit of holiness. Thus in His death Jesus is presented as the Source of Life, in all its purity and spiritual power. That this section of the Gospel stands in closest connection with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:6">1 John 5:6</span> seems to us beyond doubt: what is the exact nature of the relation between the passages is a question which belongs to the exposition of the Epistle, and cannot be investigated here.</p>
