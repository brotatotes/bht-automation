<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:4-5">John 19:4-5</span>. <strong> And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may perceive that I find no crime in him. Jesus therefore came forth, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And he saith unto them, Behold, the man! </strong> The difference between the <strong> </strong> situation here and that at chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:39">John 18:39</span> does not lie so <strong> </strong> much in the actual words in which Pilate proclaims the innocence of Jesus, although it is possible that the change of order is not a matter of entire indifference. It lies rather in the fact that on the former occasion he left Jesus in the palace, and came out alone to the Jews with his verdict of acquittal; while here he <strong> </strong> leads Jesus forth, exhibiting such a bearing towards Him that the Jews may themselves perceive that he considers Him to be innocent. It is further evident from the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:8">John 19:8</span>, ‘he was the more afraid,’ that a mysterious awe had already taken possession of his soul, an awe increased no doubt by the message of his wife (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:19">Matthew 27:19</span>) which had just before reached him. In his words ‘Behold, the man!’ we have a clear trace of the sympathy and pity existing in his breast. He speaks of the ‘man,’ not of the ‘king.’ It is the human sufferer to whom he draws attention, one whose sufferings and whole aspect would have melted any <strong> </strong> heart not dehumanised by personal envy or that fierce spirit of revenge which has marked ecclesiastical fanaticism in every age. So far, however, as he expected to touch the hearts of the Jews by the spectacle presented to them, he is doomed to be disappointed.
