<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:8-9">John 19:8-9</span>. <strong> When Pilate therefore heard this word, he was the more afraid; and he went again into the palace, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? </strong> The remarkable expression by which the Evangelist designates the language of the Jews deserves our notice, ‘this word.’ It is not a mere saying that the Jews have uttered. It is a ‘word.’ The Divine is in it. At the very time when they are pursuing the Lord of glory to <strong> </strong> His death, they are unconsciously impelled by a <strong> </strong> Divine power to ascribe to Him the glory that is His due. We are not indeed to suppose that <strong> </strong> Pilate felt this. But the strange awe the sense of mystery that had come over him before is deepened in his mind. He must renew his investigation with all seriousness; and for this purpose he goes again into the palace, taking Jesus with him, and asks Him, ‘Whence art thou?’ The question has certainly no reference to the place where Jesus had been born, or from which He had come to Jerusalem. It is a deeper origin that is asked after. Art Thou from this world, or from another? a <strong> </strong> man, or from the gods?

<p><strong> But Jesus gave him no answer. </strong> The question had not been asked in the spirit to which an answer was never refused. Pilate had no sense either of sin or need. Even had he been answered and received the answer as true, he would only have bestowed freedom upon One who sought nothing for Himself: he would not have ‘believed.’ That this was the state of his mind is clearly indicated in the words next spoken by him.</p>
