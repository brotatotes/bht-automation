<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:16">John 2:16</span>. <strong> And said unto them that sold the doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise. </strong> We must not suppose that the sellers of doves were more leniently dealt with. The oxen might be driven away, the tables overturned, but the cages of birds must be carried out by their owners: hence it is to these alone that Jesus directly addresses words which were really spoken to all, and which explained his action. Any zealous reformer, who understood the faith of Israel, might have done as much: indeed, the first treatise in the Talmud contains regulations for the due reverence of the temple which utterly condemn such profanations as are related here. But though the action of Jesus might imply no more, His words declare that He vindicates the honour of <em> His Father’s </em> house. Thus He at once honours His Father and declares Himself. He offers Himself to Israel as the Son of God. In this deed, as in all His acts and words (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:11-15">Matthew 13:11-15</span>), there is a mingling of revelation and reserve: the declaration of Sonship is combined with an act which no true Israelite could fail to approve. Those who, yielding to the impulse of right, and listening to the voice of conscience, accepted the <em> act</em>, would be led to ponder the <em> words;</em> in them would be fulfilled the promise, ‘To him that hath shall more be given.’ Those who hardened their heart against the act lost the revelation which was given with it, and were in danger of losing all. John does not speak of the cleansing of the temple as miraculous, but the Saviour’s words themselves mark it as a ‘sign;’ and it is only by thinking of a divine awe attending the words (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:6">John 18:6</span>) that we can explain the immediate submission of the traffickers. The following verses describe the twofold effect of the act of Jesus on the disciples and on ‘the Jews.’</p>
