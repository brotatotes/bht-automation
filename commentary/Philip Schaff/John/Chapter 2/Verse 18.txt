John 2:18.  The Jews therefore answered.  The effect on the disciples has been related; what will be the response of the rulers to the self-revelation of Jesus? The word ‘therefore’ answers to the Evangelist’s knowledge of the fact. Their position of inward antagonism is present to his thought, though it has not yet found expression in their deeds.  And said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us because thou doest these things? This answer (replying to the act rather than the words) is in the tone of indignation, not of sincere inquiry: ‘Because Thou doest these things Thou art bound to show a sign, a sign that shall justify such actions.’ The effectual cleansing was the ‘sign,’ but as such they would not receive it. Their question is a token of the failure (so far as the nation was concerned) of the manifestation which Jesus had given of Himself as Son of God. Both in the question and in the response of our Lord we have a dear parallel in the earlier Gospels: see Matthew 12:38-40.
