John 2:2.  And Jesus also was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. The form of the sentence shows that our chief attention is to be fixed on Jesus, not on the disciples. They were invited as His disciples. Those who came were probably the five or six mentioned in chap. 1 , viz. Andrew, Simon Peter, Philip, Nathanael, and John himself (and probably James).
