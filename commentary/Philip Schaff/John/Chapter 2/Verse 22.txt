<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:22">John 2:22</span>. <strong> When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this. </strong> Again (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:10">John 2:10</span>) we are struck by the suddenness with which the narrative breaks off. It has been related mainly to bring out the rejection of Jesus by the Jews; the Evangelist pauses upon it only for a moment to speak of the effect on the disciples, as after the former miracle he records that the ‘disciples believed in’ Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span>). We do not find the same statement here, but are told (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:16">John 12:16</span>) that the words which baffled the Jews were mysterious to the disciples likewise. Whilst, however, the Jews rejected the ‘hard saying,’ the disciples kept all these things and pondered them in their ‘heart,’ not understanding them until the prophecy was fulfilled. This record of words not understood at the time, even by the inner circle of the followers of Jesus, is a striking indication of the simple truthfulness of the narration (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span>). </p>
<p><strong> And they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.</strong> The recollection of the words after the resurrection led the disciples (we cannot doubt that John is speaking chiefly of his own experience) to a fuller and richer faith in ‘the scripture’ and ‘the word ‘of Jesus. The ‘word’ must be that of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span>; but it is not so easy to explain ‘the scripture.’ It cannot mean the Old Testament as a whole, for in this sense John always uses the plural, ‘the Scriptures.’ It would be easier to suppose that the Evangelist has in mind some passages of the Old Testament predictive of the <strong> </strong> resurrection from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:0">Psalms 16:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:0">Isaiah 53:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:0">Hosea 6:0</span>), or the rebuilding of the true temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="zec+6:12-15">Zechariah 6:12-15</span>). however, we include several passages, the difficulty in the use of the singular remains as before; and if we seek for a single prediction, we cannot meet with any one that agrees so closely with <strong> </strong> our Lord’s saying as to be thus definitely pointed out as ‘the scripture.’ We seem bound to refer the word to the only ‘scripture’ that (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:17">John 2:17</span>) has been quoted in the context, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:9">Psalms 69:9</span>. This verse, speaking of the consuming and of its cause, formed the groundwork of the first part of our Lord’s saying (‘Destroy this temple’). Hence this passage of the psalm and ‘the word which Jesus had said’ form one whole, and as such are mentioned here. The disciples, guided to deeper faith by that which was at the time wholly mysterious (and which was a ‘stone of stumbling’ to those who believed not), recognised the fulfilment of Old Testament prophecy and of the prediction of Jesus Himself in the death and resurrection of their Lord. Thus in the first scene of His public ministry, we have Jesus before us in the light in which the whole Gospel is to present Him, at once the crucified and the risen Lord.
	</p>
<p>The whole narrative has been subjected to keen scrutiny both by friends and foes, but its importance has hardly yet been properly acknowledged. A few words must still be said as to its relation to the other Gospels, and as to its place in this.
	</p>
<p>Each of the earlier Gospels records a cleansing of the temple, accomplished, however, not at the outset but at the close of our Lord’s public ministry, on the Monday (probably) preceding the crucifixion. To some it has seemed altogether improbable that there should have been two acts of precisely similar character at the extreme points of the official life of our Lord. But is the character of the two the same? We would not lay too much stress on some of the differences of detail, for apparent divergences sometimes present themselves in connection with narratives which no one would be inclined to explain as relating to different events. There are, however, not a few touches in the account before us which show the hand of an eyewitness; such as the making of the scourge of cords, the scattering of the money of exchange, the words addressed to the sellers of doves alone, the form of the rebuke, the conversation with the Jews, the incidental notice of the forty-six years (a statement which only elaborate calculation shows to be in harmony with independent statements of another Evangelist). Finally, there is the remarkable perversion before Caiaphas of the words regarding the rebuilding of the temple, on which nothing contained in the earlier Gospels throws any light, and which (especially as given in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:58">Mark 14:58</span>) bears all the marks of having been exaggerated in the popular mind through lapse of time. Such considerations as these seem to show that, if the cleansing can have occurred once only, its place in the history is that assigned by John. But is it really at all improbable that two cleansings should have taken place, separated by such an interval of time as the Gospel narrative presupposes? No one will think that the action of our Lord, as here related, would put an end to the traffic, when this very narrative brings before us an official challenge of His authority so to act. At the last Passover Jesus would find the temple-court as much the scene of worldly trading as it was at the first. Did He then, it will be asked, condone the evil when in intervening years He went up to the same feast? This question must be met by another: Have we reason to believe that Jesus attended any other Passover than these two? The feast of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1">John 5:1</span> was in all probability not a Passover, and at the Passover mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:4">John 6:4</span>. He certainly was not present. If then he attended two Passovers only, is it at all improbable that on the second occasion, as on the first, He would vindicate the purity and sanctity of the temple?
	</p>
<p>The purpose, too, of the two cleansings is different. At the close of His ministry He is hailed as King of Israel, and He indignantly expels from God’s house those who practically denied to Gentiles any share in that place of prayer. Now He acts as the Son of God, offering Himself in this character to rulers and to people, that they may acknowledge His Sonship and obey His word. ‘He came unto His own home,’ His home as Son, ‘and they that were His own received Him not.’ This is the turning-point of His ministry: henceforth He is the rejected of the Jews. This is the significance of the narrative before us. The cleansing and the mysterious words spoken by Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span>) are alike ‘signs.’ The first was a sign of His Sonship, a sign which they refused to accept. That refused, He gives the second; just as, when the Pharisees asked of Him a sign from heaven, He refused to give any save the sign of the prophet Jonah. If they will not listen to the former, the latter alone remains. He would have renewed the life of the temple, but they would not have it so. Let them, then, go on in their ways, and destroy the temple; let them go on in their rejection of Him, and destroy His life. The result will be the raising of a spiritual temple which shall be none of theirs a temple in which God Himself shall dwell, manifested to all men in the Son.</p>
