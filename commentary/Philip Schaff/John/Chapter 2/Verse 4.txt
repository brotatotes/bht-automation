John 2:4.  And Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee?  The English words convey an   impression of disrespect and harshness which is absent from the original. This use of the Greek word for ‘woman’ is consistent with the utmost respect. In Homer, for example (  Iliad, xxiv. 300 ), Priam thus addresses Hecuba, his queen, and other examples of the same kind might easily be given. This Gospel itself shows that the word is not out of place where the deepest love and compassion are expressed: see chap. John 19:26, John 20:13; John 20:15. Yet the contrast of ‘woman’ and ‘mother’ must strike every one who reads with attention. The relation of mother, however precious in its own sphere, cannot be allowed to enter into that in which Jesus now stands. John does not relate the incident recorded in Matthew 12:46-50; Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21; but the same thought is present here. Still more distinctly is this lesson taught in the   words that follow, ‘What have I to do with thee?’ The rendering defended by some Roman Catholic writers (though not found in the Vulgate, or in the Rhemish Testament of 1582 ), ‘What is that to thee and me?’ that is, ‘Why should we   concern ourselves with this failure of the wine?’ is altogether impossible. The phrase is a common one, occurring in Judges 11:12; 2Sa 16:10 ; 2 Samuel 19:22; 1 Kings 17:18; 2Ki 3:13 ; 2 Chronicles 35:21; Matthew 8:29; Mark 1:24; Mark 5:7; Luke 4:34; Luke 8:28: comp. also Joshua 22:24; 2 Kings 9:18; Ezra 4:3; Matthew 27:19. These passages show beyond doubt the meaning of the words: whoever makes use of the phrase rejects the interference of another, declines association with him on the matter spoken of. Hence the words reprove, though mildly. They do more; in them Jesus warns even His mother against attempting henceforth to prescribe or suggest what He is to do. Thus understood, the words are an irresistible argument against the Mariolatry of Rome.
	 Mine hour  is not yet come.  In two other places in this Gospel Jesus refers to the coming of ‘the hour’ (John 12:23, John 17:1); and three times John speaks of His hour as not yet come (John 7:30, John 8:20) or as now come (John 13:1). The other passages throw light on this, showing the peculiar solemnity which belongs to the words before us. In every instance ‘the hour’ is fraught with momentous issues: ‘the hour’ when the restraint put upon His foes shall continue no longer; when He shall pass away from the world to His Father; when He shall be glorified. So here the hour is that of the manifestation of His glory. The language used in chap. John 13:1; John 13:1, together with the general teaching of the Gospel, shows that the hour is not self-chosen, but is that appointed by the Father. He came to do the will of Him that sent Him, the appointed work at the appointed time. That time none may hasten or delay by a single instant. If, then, the miracle quickly followed upon these words, which would seem to have been the case, this can present no difficulty; the Son waited for the very  moment  chosen by the Father’s will.
