<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:5">John 2:5</span>. <strong> His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</strong> The answer of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:4">John 2:4</span>) plainly implied that His hour would come. Mary, therefore, turns to the servants, and bids them be ready. The words are indefinite, and we have no right to suppose either that she now looked for miraculous help, or that she had received some private intimation of her Son’s purpose. She waits for the ‘hour:’ whatsoever the hour may bring, let the servants be prepared to do His bidding. Mary here retires from the scene.</p>
