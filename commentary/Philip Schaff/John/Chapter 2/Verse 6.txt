<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:6">John 2:6</span>. <strong> And there were there six waterpots of stone, placed after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</strong> The waterpots were near at hand,-in the court or at the entrance to the house, not in the house itself. Considering the many washings and purifyings of the Jews, there is nothing to surprise us in the number or in the size of the waterpots. Even a small family might easily possess six, and when the number of guests was large, each of them would naturally be in use. There is much uncertainty as to the value of Hebrew measures, whether of length or of capacity. Most probably the measure here mentioned was equivalent to between eight and nine of our imperial gallons, so that the ‘firkin’ of our version is not far wrong. If each waterpot contained two ‘firkins’ and a half, the whole quantity of water would be about 130 gallons.

<p>On the words, ‘of the Jews,’ see the note on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>. Even here the phrase is not without significance. When we have set ourselves free from our prevailing habit of using this term simply as a national designation, we cannot but feel that the Evangelist is writing of that with which he has entirely broken, and is characterizing the ordinary religion of his day as one that consisted in ceremonies and external purifications.</p>
