<p>The general subject of the second great division of the Gospel is continued in this section. It contains an account of the miracle at Cana of Galilee, in which, as we are told at <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span>, Jesus ‘manifested His glory.’ The Redeemer is still in the circle of His disciples and friends, and there are no traces of His approaching conflict with the world. Our thoughts are directed solely to Himself, and to the glorious nature of that dispensation which He is to introduce.</p>
