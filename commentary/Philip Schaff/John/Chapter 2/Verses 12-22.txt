<p>In the passage before us we have the first section of the third great division of our Gospel. Jesus leaves the circle of His disciples, and begins His public work. This is done at Jerusalem, after a few days spent in Capernaum. In the metropolis of Israel He appears as the Son in His Fatherâ€™s house; and in the cleansing of the old temple and the promise of the raising up of a new one He illustrates the nature of the work He is to do. The first symptoms of opposition accordingly appear in this passage. Jesus is rejected by the theocracy of Israel, and the foundation is laid for His entering upon wider fields of labour. The subordinate parts of this section are ( 1 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:12">John 2:12</span>; ( 2 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:13-22">John 2:13-22</span>.</p>
