<p>It is of much importance to keep the closing verses of chap. 2 in close connection with the opening verses of chap. 3 (see the commentary on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:1">John 3:1</span>). Rejected by the theocracy of Israel Jesus turns to individuals, but these are not confined to Israel. The woman of Samaria and the kingâ€™s officer of Galilee are beyond the theocratic pale. Nicodemus, however, who is first introduced to us, does belong to the chosen people; and the conversation of Jesus with him, as it leads him from an imperfect to a perfect faith, illustrates the power which Jesus, though rejected by Israel and doomed to die, shall exercise over the hearts of men. The subordinate parts of this section are ( 1 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23-25">John 2:23-25</span>; ( 2 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:1-15">John 3:1-15</span>; ( 3 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16-21">John 3:16-21</span>.</p>
