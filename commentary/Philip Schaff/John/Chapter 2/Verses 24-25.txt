<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:24-25">John 2:24-25</span>. <strong> But Jesus did not trust himself unto them on account of his discerning all men, and because he needed not that any should bear witness concerning a man; for he himself discerned what was in the man. </strong> The effect produced upon Jesus Himself by this imperfection of faith is described in very remarkable language. Many ‘believed in His name,’ and so took the first step towards that surrender of the heart to Him which in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span> we read of as made by His disciples. Had they thus fully trusted themselves to Him, then would He have trusted Himself to them. This is one of the illustrations of the teaching, so characteristic of the Fourth Gospel, with regard to the union and communion of Jesus with His people; if they abide in Him, He abides in them. That these believers have not reached such maturity of faith Jesus Himself discerns. No witness from another is needed by Him, for the thoughts of every man with whom He speaks are ‘naked and opened’ unto Him. The words of John do not in their literal sense go beyond this; but, in declaring that Jesus read the heart of all who came to Him, they imply that other truth with which the rendering in our Bibles has made us familiar: ‘He knew what was in man.’
