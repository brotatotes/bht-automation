Mary had followed them when they first <strong> </strong> ran to the sepulchre; but (probably in consequence of their eager haste) she had not reached it before they departed. Nothing at least is said of her having met them and been addressed by them. She stands there with no thought of a resurrection in her mind, but believing only that the body has been taken away, and therefore weeping with loud lamentation (comp. on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:34-35">John 11:34-35</span>).

<p><strong> As she wept therefore she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre. </strong> Nothing could be more natural than that she should desire to view the spot associated with all <strong> </strong> that was so dear to her. </p>
