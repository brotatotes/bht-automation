John 20:11.  But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping.  Peter and John had returned to their homes. Mary had followed them when they first   ran to the sepulchre; but (probably in consequence of their eager haste) she had not reached it before they departed. Nothing at least is said of her having met them and been addressed by them. She stands there with no thought of a resurrection in her mind, but believing only that the body has been taken away, and therefore weeping with loud lamentation (comp. on chap. John 11:34-35).
	 As she wept therefore she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre.  Nothing could be more natural than that she should desire to view the spot associated with all   that was so dear to her.
