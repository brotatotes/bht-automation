<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:16">John 20:16</span>. <strong> Jesus saith unto her, Mary. </strong> That single word completes her present training. Nor is this wonderful. She is calmer now: the intervening conversation has produced this effect. Then again we cannot doubt that there would be more of the old tenderness of Jesus in the pronunciation of her name than in the words as yet spoken to her. The very mark, indeed, of the relation between Jesus and His people, when that relation is conceived of in its most tender form, is that ‘He calleth His own sheep by name’ (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:3">John 10:3</span>). We are not to imagine that it is only the sound of the voice that is now recognised by Mary, by the name, by the tone in which the name is uttered, a whole flood of recollections is brought up. All the deepest and most solemn impressions that had been produced upon her by her former intercourse with Jesus are re-awakened in power. She recalls not merely what was most human but what was most Divine in Him. Yet it would seem, from the epithet that she immediately applies to our Lord, that she thinks of Him as standing to her in some at least of the old relations. It is not strange that it should be so: any experience that she had had of resurrections through the power of Christ had been of resurrections to the former conditions of life. But now she is prepared for more, and therefore she shall be taught to know Jesus fully.

<p><strong> She turneth herself, and saith unto Him in Hebrew, Rabboni, which is to say, Teacher. </strong> The title thus used by Mary is probably the provincial form Rabban or Rabbi, and it is found in the New Testament only here, and in the Gospel of Mark (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:51">Mark 10:51</span>), noted, as is well known, for its use of expressions from the common tongue. It means properly ‘My Master,’ and is thus expressive of love and devotedness as well as of respect and reverence. As Mary uttered the word, she must have endeavoured to fall down at the feet of her Lord, embracing them (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:9">Matthew 28:9</span>).</p>
