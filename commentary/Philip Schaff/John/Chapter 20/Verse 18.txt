<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:18">John 20:18</span>. <strong> Mary Magdalene cometh, bringing word to the disciples, I have seen the Lord, and that he said these things unto her. </strong> Mary has now recognized her Lord. We have seen her longing, with weeping eyes and breaking heart, for the Friend whom she had loved on earth. She was prepared for more, and more was given. Her Master was revealed to her, not as the human Friend alone, but in all that awakened at the same time her reverence and awe, in all that reminded her of the Divine in Him. Thus she was ready for another step, and she was led that step forward. She saw before her the risen and glorified Lord; and she could look forward to the future, inviting at the same time the disciples to join her in the prospect, as a future in which He who is for ever with the Father should be for ever, by His Spirit, with her and them, weeping changed into joy, and defeat into victory). With a message of this kind she goes to the disciples, and they are prepared for what is now to follow.

<p>The relation between the appearance of Jesus to Mary and that to the women spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:9">Matthew 28:9</span>, can hardly be discussed here. The question belongs to the First Gospel, involving, as it does, considerations connected with the general structure of that Gospel upon which we are not able here to enter. It may be enough to say that we cannot regard the two appearances as identical: they differ in almost every circumstance.</p>
