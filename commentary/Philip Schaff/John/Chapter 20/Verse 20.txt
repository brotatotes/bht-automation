<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:20">John 20:20</span>. <strong> And when he had said this, he showed unto them both his hands and his side. </strong> If the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:40">Luke 24:40</span> are genuine, the feet were also shown; but the genuineness of that passage is too doubtful to permit us to argue from it with confidence. In whatever respects the glorified body of Jesus differed from what it had been before His death, there was at least enough of resemblance to make identification not only possible but the necessary result of careful observation; and it is worthy of notice that the very Evangelist who has given us the most striking conception of the change which it had undergone, is the one by whom the identification is also most clearly established. We shall err, however, if we think that the <em> only</em> object which Jesus had in view in showing His hands and His side was identification. He would also connect His present glorification with His past <em> sufferings.</em> Even now, amidst His glory, His people must not forget that His path to it had been the Cross. He is the Lamb that was ‘slain’ (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+5:12">Revelation 5:12</span>).

<p><strong> The disciples therefore rejoiced when they saw the Lord. </strong> These words describe the effect of the manifestation upon the disciples (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:22">John 16:22</span>). They who thus rejoice when they see Him are prepared for further manifestations of His grace.</p>
