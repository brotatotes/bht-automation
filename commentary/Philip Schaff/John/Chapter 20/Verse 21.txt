<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:21">John 20:21</span>. <strong> Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace be unto you. </strong> The words are exactly the same as before (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:19">John 20:19</span>), but they must have gone home with a deeper power to the hearts of the disciples, who now understood more fully the Person from whom they came. They prepare the way <strong> </strong> for the great commission to be given, a commission which, amidst all the trials it would bring with it from the world, the disciples are to execute in peace.

<p><strong> Even as the Father hath sent me, I</strong> <strong> also send you. </strong> The words ‘even as’ bring out the close correspondence between the mission of Jesus Himself and that upon which He sends His disciples. In both cases it was a <strong> </strong> mission of self-denying love to men; in both one of <strong> </strong> labour, suffering, and death, followed by glory; in both we have the thought of willing service imposed by an authority that is supreme. We have already met with words expressing a very similar thought in our Lord’s intercessory prayer: ‘Even as Thou didst send Me into the world, I also sent them into the world’ (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:18">John 17:18</span>). But there is one important point of difference, which an English translation fails to exhibit. In chap. 17 the Greek word for ‘sent’ is the same in both members of the sentence; in the verse before us it is otherwise. Here the former clause (‘Even as the Father hath <em> sent</em> Me’) contains the word of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:18">John 17:18</span> ( <em> apostello</em>), but in the latter clause (‘I also <em> send</em> you’) the verb is different ( <em> pempo</em>) <em> .</em> The distinction in meaning seems to be that the second word expresses <em> mission,</em> the first more properly <em> commission.</em> When the first is used, our thoughts turn to a special embassy, and special instructions which the ambassador receives; the second brings into view rather the authority of the sender and the obedience of the sent. Both words, therefore, may be used either of our Lord or of His disciples. Thus in more than twenty verses of this Gospel Jesus applies the second word to Himself (see especially chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:34">John 4:34</span>, ‘My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me’); whilst in such passages as chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:29">John 6:29</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:8">John 17:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:18">John 17:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21">John 17:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:23">John 17:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:25">John 17:25</span>), we find instead the more expressive word. In chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:36-37">John 5:36-37</span>, and again in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:28-29">John 7:28-29</span>, the two are brought together, as they are here; and the appropriateness of each word in its place may readily be seen. In chaps, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:37">John 5:37</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:28">John 7:28</span> our thought must rest chiefly on the Sender; but in chaps, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:36">John 5:36</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:29">John 7:29</span> on the commission which the Father has given to His Son. On the other hand, the word <em> apostello</em> is used by Jesus in regard to His disciples in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:38">John 4:38</span> (‘I sent you to reap’) as well as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:18">John 17:18</span>; and is indeed the word from which the distinctive name of the Twelve, ‘apostles,’ is derived. Various thoughts are suggested here by the marked and sudden transition from one word to the other. It may be said with truth that, as chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:18">John 17:18</span> has its primary application to apostles, the word which designates their special office was naturally chosen there; here, on the contrary (see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:19">John 20:19</span>), the disciples in general are addressed, the disciples who are the representatives of the whole Church of Christ. Again, the word by which Jesus here expresses the mission of His disciples <em> (pempo),</em> is one which brings into relief their <em> separation</em> from His bodily presence: formerly they were continually at His side, but now they must be dismissed for their labour throughout the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>). One other thought it is impossible to overlook. There is peculiar dignity in the avoidance on the part of the Risen Lord of that form of speech which would seem to identify two relations which (however closely they may sometimes be associated) are essentially distinct. No human disciples can really bear the commission of Jesus <em> as</em> Jesus bears that which He <strong> </strong> has received from the Father (comp. note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:17">John 20:17</span>). By design, therefore, the Lord here, reserving for Himself the higher word, speaks of the disciples as His envoys to the world. The commission which they hold from Him receives separate mention in a later verse (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:23">John 20:23</span>).</p>
