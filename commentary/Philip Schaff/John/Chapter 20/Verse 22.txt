<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:22">John 20:22</span>. <strong> And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive the Holy Spirit. </strong> Not only did the Risen Lord thus send His disciples on their mission to the world, He gave them also the preparation which should enable them to fulfill their trust. The literal and correct rendering of the original Greek is not ‘Receive the Holy Spirit,’ but ‘Receive Holy Spirit;’ the difference being, as was pointed out on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span>, that by the latter expression we are to understand not the personal Holy Ghost, but His power or influence over the hearts of men. It was in the power of Holy Spirit that Jesus had entered upon His own ministry (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:1">Luke 4:1</span>, where the same expression is used as here); with the like preparation shall His Church enter upon the work to which she is called. The gift now bestowed is, therefore, not simply symbolical but real: at that moment the Spirit was given. All this is in perfect harmony with the words of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span>, <strong> </strong> because at this moment the glorification of Jesus has begun (see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:17">John 20:17</span>). The gift, too, was imparted not to apostles only, but to all the disciples present; it is a gift not for the ministry alone, but for the whole Church of Christ. If so, the interesting question immediately arises, What is the relation of the gift spoken of here to that bestowed at Pentecost? The answer would seem to be that here the gift relates to the inner life of the disciples, there to the more outward equipment for their work; here to the enlightenment and quickening of their own souls, there to preparation for producing an effect on others. Perhaps we may seek an illustration (to be applied, as always, with reserve) from the life of the Saviour Himself. As His public ministry began when the Holy Spirit descended on Him at His baptism, so did His apostles receive their full commission and power on the day of Pentecost. But as before His baptism the Holy Spirit had rested on Him continually, so now, before Pentecost, the same holy influence is bestowed on His disciples, preparing them for the day of final consecration to their work. It has, indeed, often been maintained that we have before us a promise and not a present gift. But such cannot be the meaning of the language which is here used. Even were it granted that the word ‘Receive’ might be understood as an assurance of a future gift, the action which accompanies the word must imply much more than this. ‘He breathed on them:’ this surely was the outward symbol of an actual impartation of His <em> breathing into</em> them (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:7">Genesis 2:7</span>, where the same word is used) the power and influence of which He spoke. And yet it is true that this gift was both present (actual) and also future (a promise). As present, it brought with it the quickening of spiritual life; as future, it included in itself all that Pentecost gave. The former thought is important in relation to the development of the disciples: the latter in its connection with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:23">John 20:23</span>, and especially in its presentation of the Redeemer as Himself the Giver of the Holy Spirit (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:26">John 16:26</span>).</p>
