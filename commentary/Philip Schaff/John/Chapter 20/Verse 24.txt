John 20:24.  But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.  On the object of thus interpreting the name Thomas, see on chap. John 11:16. It is impossible to think that the Evangelist translates the word for the mere purpose of mentioning that Thomas had a   Greek as well as an Aramaic name. The man appears in the name.
