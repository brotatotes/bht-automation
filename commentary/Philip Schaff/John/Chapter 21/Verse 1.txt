John 21:1.  After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias, and he manifested himself thus.  The words ‘after these things’ are indefinite, and throw no light upon the length of the interval that elapsed between the last and the present appearance of Jesus. The point to which the Evangelist calls attention is that we have here another ‘manifestation’ of Himself by the Risen Saviour, similar to the two mentioned in the previous chapter (comp. chap. John 21:14). What we have before us, therefore, is not merely the fact that Jesus showed Himself to the disciples, but that He exhibited Himself in a glory which the natural eye could not have discerned (see chap. John 2:11). It was ‘at the sea of Tiberias,’ that is, the sea of Galilee, that the manifestation took place. The earlier Evangelists do not relate it, but they give the message of our Lord to His disciples instructing them to go into Galilee, for there they should see Him (Matthew 28:10; Matthew 28:16; Mark 16:7). John does not tell us of the message, but he relates the meeting. Surely such notices on the part of different historians are supplementary, not discordant.
