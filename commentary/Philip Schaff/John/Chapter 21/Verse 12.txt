John 21:12.  Jesus saith unto them, Go me and breakfast.  The bringing of the fish from the net to the fire is not recorded. The Evangelist hastens to the chief point in his narrative. Jesus gives the invitation to the meal, and it is accepted.
	 None of the disciples durst make inquiry of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.  Awe and reverence prevented their asking Jesus who He was (comp. chap. John 4:27). They did what they were told.
