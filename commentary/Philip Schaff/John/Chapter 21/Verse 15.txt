<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15">John 21:15</span>. <strong> When therefore they had breakfasted, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. </strong> The question (‘lovest thou’ ) contains the second of the two Greek verbs for loving, of which we have already spoken at chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:20">John 5:20</span>. This verb is less expressive of emotions of tenderness, of personal feeling and affection, than that verb used by Peter in his reply. The words ‘more than these’ in our Lord’s question can hardly spring from any thing else than the remembrance of the apostle’s hasty assertion before his denial of his Master, ‘Though all men shall be offended because of Thee, yet will I never be offended.’ They were thus especially designed to expose to Peter’s view the pride and self-sufficiency by which his fall had been hastened; and that they effected this object we may infer from the absence of these words in his reply. He will make no mention of others now: one step in his education has been gained. Not only so; it is to be further noticed that the <strong> </strong> apostle does not use the same word for ‘love’ as <strong> </strong> had been employed by Jesus. He uses one that <strong> </strong> speaks of a more familiar and friendly affection, implying less depth of serious thought. The change may be connected with his recollection of his fall; but it is to be mainly traced to the <strong> </strong> genuine sincerity, the real warmth, of his love for Jesus. Jesus accepts the declaration of his love and recognizes its genuineness, hence the charge now given to the apostle.

<p><strong> He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. </strong> This charge will be more fully noticed when we have dealt with the exposition of the following verses.</p>
