John 21:2.  There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of  Cane of Galilee, and the sons of  Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.  It is doubtful whether the seven persons here referred to are arranged, as is often supposed, in two groups, one consisting of three, and the other of four members. There may be significance in the mention of Thomas as now (after chap. 20 ) completely at one with his brother Apostles, and in the fact that Nathanael (comp. chap. John 1:51) is associated with the miracle.
