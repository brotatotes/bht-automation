John 21:4.  But when morning was now coming, Jesus stood on the shore; the disciples however knew not that it was Jesus.  Night passed away, and the day began to break. Then Jesus stood on the shore, but they did not recognise Him, it may be that the light was insufficient, it may be that it was not yet His wish that He should be known.
