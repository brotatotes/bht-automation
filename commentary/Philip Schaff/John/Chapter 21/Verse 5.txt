<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:5">John 21:5</span>. <strong> Jesus therefore saith unto them, Children, have ye anything to eat? They answered him, No. </strong> It is hardly possible to imagine that the word ‘children’ is here used because Jesus is addressing Himself as ‘a master to his workmen,’ or because He is. Speaking with the dignity of a superior. It is a word of tenderness and affection. At the same time it may perhaps have a deeper meaning, for the word ‘brethren’ of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:17">John 20:17</span>, which now expresses the relation of Jesus to His disciples, rather leads directly to the supposition that, in a certain sense, He speaks as One standing on a footing of equality with themselves. There is at least a striking coincidence between the word (‘children’) here used and that used in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:13">Hebrews 2:13</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:18">Isaiah 8:18</span>). He who speaks is engaged in the same occupation, takes the same position, is called to the same work as they. The question which He asks is important, especially the word which is rendered in the Authorised Version ‘meat,’ but which we have rendered by ‘to eat.’ For thus we observe the true point of the question, not, ‘Have you <em> caught</em> fish?’ but, ‘Have you fish <em> to eat?’</em> The term, however, was commonly used of fish. Here it seems to refer to provision of fish taken by them for eating when they started. It ought to be carefully noted also that, as is shown by the particular form of the question, it is the <em> meal</em> that is before the mind of Jesus: only when we see this do we gain the true point of view from which to contemplate the whole narrative. To the question of Jesus the disciples answer, ‘No.’ They thus acknowledge the fruitlessness of their labours, and their need of further light and guidance.</p>
