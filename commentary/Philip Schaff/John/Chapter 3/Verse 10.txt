<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:10">John 3:10</span>. <strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Thou art the teacher of Israel; and perceivest thou not these things?</strong> The question which expressed the bewilderment of Nicodemus is answered by another question. He has assumed the office of teacher, teacher of God’s people Israel, and yet he does not recognise these truths. ‘Israel’ is a word used only four times in this Gospel, and never without special meaning. We have seen its significance in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:31">John 1:31</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:49">John 1:49</span>; and chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:13">John 12:13</span> is similar. The only remaining passage is that before us. No word so clearly brings into view the nation of God’s special choice. The name carries us back from a time of degeneracy and decadence to past days of hope and promise. It was to Israel that God showed His statutes and His judgments (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+147:19">Psalms 147:19</span>), and this thought is very prominent here. Of Israel thus possessed of the very truths to which Jesus had made reference (see above, on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:5">John 3:5</span>) Nicodemus is ‘the teacher.’ It is not simply ‘a teacher,’ though it is not very easy to say what the presence of the article denotes. It is possible that Nicodemus occupied a superior position, or was held in especial honour amongst the doctors of the law; or the words may merely imply that he magnified his office and was proud to be teacher of God’s people. Surely from him might have been expected such knowledge of the Scriptures and insight into their meaning that the truth of the words just spoken by Jesus would at once be recognised. For our Lord does not say ‘and <em> knowest</em> not;’ Nicodemus is not blamed for any want of <em> previous</em> knowledge of these things, but because he does not perceive the truth of the teaching when presented to him, and presented, moreover, by One whose right to teach with authority he had himself confessed. It will be observed that Jesus does not answer the ‘How’ of the preceding question; that had been answered by anticipation. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:8">John 3:8</span> Jesus had declared that the <em> manner</em> must be a mystery to man, whereas the <em> fact</em> was beyond all doubt. The fact was known to every one that had been born of the Spirit, but to such only. Hence in the following verse we have a renewed and more emphatic affirmation of the truth and certainty of what has been said. If Nicodemus would really know the fact, it must be by the knowledge of experience. He appears no further in this narrative. The last words have reduced him to silence,-thoughtful silence, we cannot doubt,-but have not brought him to complete belief.</p>
