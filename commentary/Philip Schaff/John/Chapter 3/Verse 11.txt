<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:11">John 3:11</span>. <strong> Verily, verily, I say unto thee. </strong> These words form the solemn introduction to a new division, a higher stage, of the discourse. The connecting link between <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:10-11">John 3:10-11</span> is reproof. The last verse laid stress on the knowledge which should have prepared the teacher of Israel for the reception of the word of Jesus; in this the emphasis lies on the dignity of the Teacher whose word he had been so slow to receive.

<p><strong> We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen. </strong> The sudden transition to the plural ‘we know’ is remarkable. We cannot suppose that our Lord here joins with <strong> </strong> Himself the prophets of the Old Covenant, or John the Baptist, or that He is speaking of the testimony of the Father and the Holy Spirit. The key to the plural is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:8">John 3:8</span>. Every one who dwells in the spiritual world of which Jesus has been speaking is a witness to its reality and its wonders. Here then Jesus associates with Himself in this emphatic testimony all who have been born of the Spirit. It is further to be observed that the change of expression is peculiarly appropriate, since he is about to pass away from the direct address to Nicodemus himself, and to speak through him to the class to which he belonged. Nicodemus had at first said ‘we know’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:2">John 3:2</span>), as representative of others like-minded with himself, who by the signs had been led to faith in the name of Jesus, but were ignorant of His spiritual work. Jesus now contrasts with these another class, consisting of all who from their own experience could join Him in His testimony to the reality of the spiritual kingdom. The words of Jesus in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:4">John 9:4</span> are equally remarkable in their association of His people with Himself.-The two parallel members of this verse bring the truth expressed into bold relief. The words closely correspond ( <em> knowing</em> to <em> speaking</em>; <em> seeing</em> to <em> bearing witness</em>), while there is at the same time an advance in the thought, since <em> bearing witness</em> rises above <em> speaking</em>, and <em> we have seen</em> is more expressive than w <em> e know.</em> In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:8">John 3:8</span>, where the wind was taken as the emblem of the Spirit, the sense which bore witness was that of hearing. This verse speaks of something more convincing still, the sense of sight.

<p><strong> And ye receive not our witness. </strong> To such sayings of his Master we may trace the mournful reflections which are again and again made by the Evangelist (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:32">John 3:32</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:37">John 12:37</span>). Though the reference is to a class (‘ye receive’), yet the words seem to imply that some unbelief still lingered in the heart of Nicodemus himself.</p>
