<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:18">John 3:18</span>. <strong> He that believeth in him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. </strong> The two preceding verses express the Divine purpose in itself, and that purpose passing into accomplishment; this verse speaks of the actual result. Two of the terms of these verses, the <em> believing in Jesus </em> of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span> and the <em> judging</em> of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:17">John 3:17</span>, are here brought together. He that abides in faith in Christ abides in a state to which judging belongs not; whilst the faith remains, the idea of judgment is excluded, for the believer is one with the Lord in whom he has placed his trust. Not so with the unbeliever; on him the sentence of judgment is already pronounced. As long as the unbelief is persisted in, so long does the sentence which the rejection of Jesus brings with it remain in force against him. The great idea of the Gospel, the division of all men into two classes severed from each other, is very clearly presented here; but no <em> unchangeable</em> division is thought of. The separation is the result of deliberate choice; and whilst the choice is adhered to, the severance abides. As the faith of the believer is faith ‘in Him,’ faith that brings personal union, the unbelief is the rejection of His Person revealed in all its dignity, the only begotten Son of God.</p>
