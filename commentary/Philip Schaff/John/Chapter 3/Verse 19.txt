<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span>. <strong> And this is the judgment,</strong> the judgment is of this kind, takes place thus, <strong> because the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were wicked. </strong> These words bring out clearly that the ‘not believing’ spoken of in the last <strong> </strong> verse signifies an active rejection, and not the mere absence of belief a rejection of the true light which in the person of Jesus came into the world, and <strong> </strong> henceforth ever is in the world. Men loved the darkness, for their works not single deeds, but the whole expression and manifestation of their life-were wicked. The word used (‘wicked’) is that which elsewhere expresses the character of the arch-enemy as ‘the wicked one’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:12">1 John 3:12</span>). It denotes active evil, positive and pronounced wickedness.</p>
