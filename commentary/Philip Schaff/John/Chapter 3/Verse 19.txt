John 3:19.  And this is the judgment, the judgment is of this kind, takes place thus,  because the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were wicked.  These words bring out clearly that the ‘not believing’ spoken of in the last   verse signifies an active rejection, and not the mere absence of belief a rejection of the true light which in the person of Jesus came into the world, and   henceforth ever is in the world. Men loved the darkness, for their works not single deeds, but the whole expression and manifestation of their life-were wicked. The word used (‘wicked’) is that which elsewhere expresses the character of the arch-enemy as ‘the wicked one’ (John 17:15; 1 John 3:12). It denotes active evil, positive and pronounced wickedness.
