<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:20">John 3:20</span>. <strong> For every one that committeth evil hateth the light, and he cometh not to the light lest his works should be convicted. </strong> This verse explains the last, and refers the action there described to a general principle. The universal law is, that he who committeth evil hateth the light. Not ‘he that <em> hath committed</em>,’ for what is spoken of is the bent and the spirit of the man’s life. The word ‘evil’ here is not the same as that rendered ‘wicked’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span>, but is more, general. The one word means evil in active manifestation; the other what is worthless, good for nothing. No doubt the second word is used in this verse partly for the sake of vivid contrast with the real and abiding ‘truth’ of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:21">John 3:21</span>, partly because what is worthless and unsubstantial will not stand the test of coming to that very light which shows in all its reality whatever is substantial and true. Every one whose life is thus evil knows that in the presence of the light he must stand self-condemned. The experience is painful, and he endeavours to avoid it by turning from the light, till, as conscience still asserts its power, he seeks defence against himself by hating the light (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:8">1 Kings 22:8</span>). We must not forget the application that is in John’s mind. The light that is come is Jesus Himself. He is come; but men also must come to Him. If they came not, the cause was a moral one. Before He came, some light had been in the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:5">John 1:5</span>); those who, living a life of evil (whether open wickedness or a worthless self-righteousness), hated this light, were thus prepared to reject the Light Himself. The last word of the verse is remarkable, as it is more naturally applied to the doer than to his deed. Not only will the works be shown by the light be exposed in their true character: the works are looked on as of themselves the criminals they will be self-convicted, self-condemned. The thought of <em> self-conviction </em> has in this Gospel an importance that can hardly be over-estimated.</p>
