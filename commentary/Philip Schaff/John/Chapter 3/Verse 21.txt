<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:21">John 3:21</span>. <strong> But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, because they have been wrought in God. </strong> In contrast with those who commit evil is another class those who do the truth. The words expressing <em> action</em> in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:20-21">John 3:20-21</span>, are different: that in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:20">John 3:20</span> (‘committeth’) refers directly to the particular acts, that which is used here (which properly denotes <em> to make</em>, <em> to produce</em>) brings into view rather the result. The man here spoken of is (so to speak) at work in raising the abiding structure of ‘the truth.’ So far as the truth has been revealed to him, his life is faithful to it; his works are an expression of the truth that is in his heart. As Jesus says (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:37">John 18:37</span>), ‘Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice; ‘so here we <strong> </strong> read, ’He that doeth the truth cometh to the light.’ There is a natural affinity between truth and light; he who is faithful to truth received is, through the very nature of the truth within him, impelled towards Him who is the Truth. He does not come to the light that his works may be made known to others: there is no self-seeking, perhaps even it is not the conscious purpose of the man himself that is spoken of, but rather the instinctive aim of the truth within him, and thus in reality the purpose of God, that all the works of God be made manifest. The works of this doer of truth have been wrought in God. The discipline by which he is led to the Son is of the Father (see chap. 6 especially). For this cause he comes, and must needs come, at the bidding of the truth, that the works of God in him may be brought out of all concealment and made manifest. His coming to Christ is itself a manifestation of the preceding work of God in him.</p>
