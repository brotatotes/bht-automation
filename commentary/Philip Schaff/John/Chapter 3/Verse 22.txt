<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:22">John 3:22</span>. <strong> Alter these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. </strong> The introductory words ‘After these things’ may possibly include a considerable period. Apparently several months intervened between the Passover of chap. 3 and the visit to Samaria (chap. 4 ); but only two events belonging to this period are related. The words of this verse, however <em> (tarried</em> and <em> bap-timed),</em> show that after leaving Jerusalem Jesus remained for some length of time in the country parts of Judea. In <strong> </strong> no other passage than this is there any mention of the Saviour’s baptizing, and chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:2">John 4:2</span> explains that this baptism was only indirectly His. Still, however, it is clear that the baptism was <strong> </strong> by the authority of Jesus, the disciples acting only as His ministers. Yet they did not baptize with Christian baptism in the full sense of the term. They were engaged in preparatory work like that of the Baptist, just as the Twelve were sent forth by Jesus to declare the very message which John had preached (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:7">Matthew 10:7</span>). The baptism of the Spirit was still future (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span>). The next verse shows the main design of this section. When Jesus baptized in Judea, He came into direct and necessary comparison with John.</p>
