<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:24">John 3:24</span>. <strong> For John was not yet east into prison. </strong> Words in which the Evangelist vindicates the accuracy of his narrative, and corrects a mistake apparently prevailing in the Church when he wrote. The earlier Gospels, dealing mainly with the Galilean work of Jesus, do not mention His <strong> </strong> entering upon His public ministry until after the Baptist had been delivered up. This seems to have led to an impression that the Baptist was imprisoned before our Lord entered on His public work. The false inference is here corrected.
