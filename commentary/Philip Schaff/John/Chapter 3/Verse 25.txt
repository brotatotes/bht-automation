<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:25">John 3:25</span>. <strong> There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purifying. </strong> In the circumstances just described, discussion would inevitably arise as to the relative position and value of the two baptisms. A ‘Jew’ (see note on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>) had placed the baptism of Jesus above that of John in regard to its purifying power. Although the Jews in general were <strong> </strong> hostile to Jesus, this man may have shared the convictions of Nicodemus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:1-2">John 3:1-2</span>). The disciples of John refused to regard their master’s baptism as less efficacious than that of another, who had been himself baptized by him. Unable either to set the question at rest, or to ignore the opposition of the Jew, they brought the matter of contention before John. On the symbolic character of John’s baptism, see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:5">John 3:5</span>; on ‘purification,’ see ii 6 , <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:10">John 13:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:3">John 15:3</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:9">1 John 1:9</span>.</p>
