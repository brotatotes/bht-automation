<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:26">John 3:26</span>. <strong> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</strong> Their description of Jesus (whom they do not name) shows their feelings. This man came to thee beyond Jordan, it has been thy great object to magnify his fame; and yet he is now thy rival, he baptizes, and all are flocking to him rather than to thee. Their last words are in their lips but a natural exaggeration; to the Evangelist, however, they are an unconscious prophecy (see an exactly similar instance in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:19-20">John 12:19-20</span>). This is the last trial of the Baptistâ€™s fidelity to his mission, and nobly is it sustained.</p>
