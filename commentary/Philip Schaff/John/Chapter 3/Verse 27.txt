<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:27">John 3:27</span>. <strong> John answered and said, </strong> A <strong> man can receive nothing, except it have been given him out of heaven. </strong> Not for a moment does he enter into <strong> </strong> their jealous advocacy of his claims. Understanding the true force of their hasty words, ‘All men come to him,’ he tells them that such honour, such position, Jesus cannot receive unless it have been given Him from heaven. He says this in words so general that they seem certainly intended to point to himself also. ‘Each of us, in accomplishing God’s work, will receive the place appointed to him from heaven.’</p>
