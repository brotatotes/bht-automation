<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:3">John 3:3</span>. <strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one have been born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</strong> Jesus answers his thoughts rather than his words, but the connection between the address and the answer is not hard to find. John the Baptist had familiarised all with the thought that the kingdom of God was at hand, that the reign of the Messiah, so long expected, would soon begin. Whatever meaning may be assigned to the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:2">John 3:2</span>, we may certainly say that every thoughtful Jew who believed what Nicodemus believed was ‘waiting for the kingdom of God.’ But the Pharisee’s conception of the Messianic promise was false. In great measure, at least, his ‘kingdom of God’ was outward and carnal, not inward and spiritual, a privilege of birth, belonging of right to Israel. This false conception Jesus would at once correct, and the gravity of the error is reflected in the solemnity of the language, ‘Verily, verily, I say unto thee.’ ‘Any one.’ This more literal rendering is necessary here because of the next verse. Our Lord says simply <em> any one.</em> Nicodemus brings in the word ‘man,’ to give more expressiveness to his reply.

<p>‘Have been born anew.’ It has been, and still is, a much controverted question whether the Greek word here used should be rendered <em> again,</em> or <em> anew</em>, or <em> from above.</em> ‘Again’ is certainly inadequate; for, though the word may denote <em> beginning over again</em>, <em> commencing the action afresh</em>, it cannot express mere repetition. Much may be said in favour of the third rendering, ‘from above.’ This is the undoubted meaning of the same word as used below (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:31">John 3:31</span>); and a similar idea is expressed in the passages of the Gospel (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:13">John 1:13</span>) and First Epistle of John (chap. 1Jn 2:29 , <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:1">1 John 5:1</span>, etc.) which speak of those who are begotten of God. It may also be urged that, as Christ is ‘He that cometh from above’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:31">John 3:31</span>), those who through faith are one with Christ must derive their being from the same source, and may well be spoken of as ‘born from above.’ Notwithstanding these arguments, it is probable that <em> anew</em> is the true rendering. Had the other thought been intended, we might surely have expected ‘of God’ instead of ‘from above.’ The correspondence between the two members of the sentence would then have been complete; only those who have been born <em> of God</em> can see the <em> kingdom of God.</em> Further, <em> born</em> (or <em> begotten) of God</em> is a very easy and natural expression, but this can hardly be said of <em> born</em> (or <em> begotten) from above: ‘</em> coming from above’ is perfectly clear; ‘born from above’ is not so. The chief argument, however, is afforded by the next verse, which clearly shows that Nicodemus understood a second birth to be intended. But the words ‘except any one have been born from above’ would not necessarily imply a second birth. The Jews maintained that they were born of God (see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:41">John 8:41</span>), and would have had no difficulty whatever in believing that those only who received their being from above could inherit the blessings of Messiah’s kingdom. Our Lord’s words, then, teach the fundamental truth, that not natural birth, descent from the stock of Israel, but a second birth, the being begotten anew, a complete spiritual change (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:5">John 3:5</span>), admits into the kingdom of God.

<p>On the general expectation of a king and a kingdom, see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:49">John 1:49</span>. It is remarkable that the kingdom of God is expressly mentioned by John in this chapter only (compare, however, chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:36">John 18:36</span>).-‘Cannot’ is by no means the same as ‘shall not.’ It expresses an impossibility in the very nature of things. To a state of outward earthly privilege rights of natural birth might give admittance. In declaring that without a complete inward change none can possibly see (have a true perception of) ‘the kingdom of God,’ Jesus declares the spiritual character of His kingdom. In it none but the spiritual can have any part.</p>
