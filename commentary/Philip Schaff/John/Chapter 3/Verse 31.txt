<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:31">John 3:31</span>. <strong> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is out of the earth is out of the earth, and out of the earth he speaketh. </strong> The claim of the Baptist’s disciples that to their master should be accorded a higher place than to Jesus, and John’s emphatic testimony to his own lower station, lead the Evangelist to reflect upon the words of Jesus to Nicodemus as decisive of all such questions. ‘He that cometh from above’ and ‘He that cometh out of heaven’ are clearly the same as ‘He that came down out of heaven’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:13">John 3:13</span>), and all three expressions are designations of Jesus. There is but One who thus ‘cometh from above’ (though many others have received their mission from above), and He therefore is above all. In comparison with Him, every other prophet or teacher has his origin out of the earth; and as is his origin, so is his nature, so is his utterance.</p>
