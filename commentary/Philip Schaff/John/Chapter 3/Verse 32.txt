<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:32">John 3:32</span>. <strong> He that cometh out of heaven beareth witness of what he hath seen and heard; and no man receiveth his witness. </strong> In <strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:12">John 3:12</span></strong> we have seen that heaven is spoken of as the place of immediate divine knowledge and light. Jesus alone belongs to this sphere: all the prophets before His coming, though divinely commissioned, had ‘the earth’ as the starting-point of their utterances, spoke of what they had received on earth, spoke truly but not perfectly. The Divine light was reflected from the prophets to the world around. In Jesus the heavenly light itself came into the world. Jesus alone, then, beareth witness to that which He hath seen and which He heard, and (here again is the mournful cadence of this Gospel) no one receiveth His witness. So few receive, that they seem as nothing in comparison with those who reject. That the rejection is not in strictness universal the next verse declares.</p>
