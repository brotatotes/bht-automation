<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:33">John 3:33</span>. <strong> He that received his witness set his seal to this, that God is true. </strong> Every man who accepts His witness and thus declares that Jesus is true, in that very act attests, sets his seal to, the declaration that God is true. (For the opposite, see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:10">1 John 5:10</span>. A mere prophet might be unfaithful or might err. Jesus ‘comes out of heaven,’ declares ‘what He has seen,’ and ‘what He heard’ from God: to disbelieve Him is to disbelieve God, to declare Him true is to declare God true. This is further explained and confirmed by the next verse.</p>
