John 3:34.  For he whom God sent speaketh the words of God.  The last verse rests on the thought that the words of Jesus are the words of God. Here it is shown that this is involved in the very proposition that Jesus is the Sent of God. Strictly, there have been many whom God has sent,-for example, John the Baptist (chap. John 1:6): his words were true, and were words of   God. But where one is thus isolated as sent   by God (and this is repeatedly done in this Gospel), he is  the Sent in a peculiar and pre-eminent sense   He speaketh not ‘words of God’ only, but ‘the words of God,’ giving  all the revelation that God gives. The enabling power thus to speak is the gift of the Spirit. Every one whom God sends is enabled to speak God’s words words that, for the portion of the revelation he is commissioned to give, are truly God’s words.
	 For not by measure giveth he the Spirit. He gives the Spirit not partially, but completely, for the purpose of enabling him who is sent to speak words of God. Rising from the partial and incomplete to that which is full and perfect, we find but One who has thus been sent by God, and but One who receives the Spirit in unmeasured fulness, enabling not for the complete declaration of a part only, but for the perfect revelation of the whole of the words of God.
