<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:35">John 3:35</span>. <strong> The Father loveth the Son. </strong> There is a continual heightening of the thought and expression. We read of Him ‘that cometh from above,’ Him ‘that cometh out of heaven,’ Him ‘whom God <strong> </strong> sent,’ ‘the Son,’ whom ‘the Father loveth.’ In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:17">John 3:17</span> we read that the Father sent the Son to save the world, because He ‘so loved the world’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>): here we read of the love of the Father towards the Son who thus gave Himself for the accomplishment of the purpose of the Father. From chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:17">John 10:17</span> it seems probable that it is of this love that we must understand the verse of a love, therefore, referring to the work of redemption, not to the essential relation of the Son to the Father (comp. note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:20">John 5:20</span>).

<p><strong> And hath given all things into his hand. </strong> From perfect love follows perfect communication not of ‘the words of God only (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:34">John 3:34</span>), but of <em> all things</em> possessed. The Father has given all things into the Son’s hand. Whatsoever the Son speaks or gives or does, is spoken, given, done, by the Father.</p>
