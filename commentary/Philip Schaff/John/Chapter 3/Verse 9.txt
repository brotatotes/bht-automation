<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:9">John 3:9</span>. <strong> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things come to pass?</strong> The tone of this answer is very different from that of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:4">John 3:4</span>. Here, as there, the question is, <em> How can</em> …? But there the added words show that the meaning is, ‘It is impossible’(comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:18">Luke 1:18</span>); whereas in this verse the chief stress lies on the first word ‘How’(comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:34">Luke 1:34</span>). The offended astonishment of Nicodemus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:7">John 3:7</span>) has yielded to the words of Jesus. He now understands that Jesus really means that there is such a <strong> </strong> thing as a new spiritual birth, in contrast with that natural birth which had ever seemed to him the only necessary condition of entrance into the kingdom of Messiah. Still, as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:12">John 3:12</span> <strong> </strong> shows, the victory over unbelief is not yet complete.</p>
