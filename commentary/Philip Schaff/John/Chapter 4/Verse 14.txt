<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:14">John 4:14</span>. <strong> But whosoever hath drunk of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of springing water, unto eternal life.</strong> The living water of which Jesus speaks becomes in him who hath drunk of it a perennial fountain, a fountain of water that is ever springing up in freshness and life, of water that not only is itself living, but that brings and gives eternal life. As before, this water is the Holy Spirit. The whole thought closely approaches that of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:38">John 7:38</span>. There the promise is, that out of the heart of him who comes unto Jesus that he may drink, who believes in Jesus, there shall flow rivers of living water; ‘And this spake He of the Spirit.’ The Holy Spirit is the special gift of Jesus; and, reciprocally, it is through the Holy Spirit that the believer remains united to his Lord in an abiding fellowship (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:14-15">John 16:14-15</span>), and that Jesus lives in him (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:23">John 17:23</span>). These truths of the later discourses are really present here: Jesus, who first gives the living water, becomes in him that hath received it the fountain which supplies the same stream of life for ever. The end is life eternal, not attained in the remote future, but begun and actually present in every one who has received the water that Jesus gives; for all those to whom the Spirit is given experience that union with God which is eternal life (see the note on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:14">John 3:14</span>).</p>
