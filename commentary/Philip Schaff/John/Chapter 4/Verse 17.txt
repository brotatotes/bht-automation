John 4:17.  The woman answered and said, I have no husband. The effect is produced. The woman’s words are a genuine confession, an acknowledgment, perhaps of wretchedness, certainly of guilt.
	 Jesus saith unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband. He accepts the truthfulness of her statement, but shows her how fully her life is known to Him. In this answer the emphasis lies on  ‘husband’ the woman’s words are repeated with their order changed. ‘I have no husband:’ ‘Well saidst thou,  Husband   I have not.’
