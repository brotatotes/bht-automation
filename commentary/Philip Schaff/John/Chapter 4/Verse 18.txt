	</p>
<p><strong> And he whom thou now hast is not</strong> <strong> thy</strong> <strong> husband: this thou hast said truly.</strong> In contrast with the lawful marriages is set the present unlawful union with one who was no husband. Her life was sinful: in what degree we cannot learn from this brief statement. An age in which divorce was freely allowed cannot be judged by the same rules as one of stricter principles. Whatever may have led her to an evil life, it is plain that her heart was not yet hardened.</p>
