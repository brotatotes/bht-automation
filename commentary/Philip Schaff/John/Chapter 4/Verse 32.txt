John 4:32.  But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not. Literally, I have an ‘eating’ to eat. The word for ‘meat’ is in John 4:34 is different from that used here, which rather denotes the meal, the partaking of the food, than the food itself. This ‘eating’ the disciples ‘knew not. The common rendering entirely obscures the meaning: our Lord does not say’ know not of, but ‘know not,’ ye have no experience of it. As yet, they had not learned the power of such work as His (the complete fulfilment of His Father’s will, John 4:34) to satisfy every want.
