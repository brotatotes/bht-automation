<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:34">John 4:34</span>. <strong> Jesus saith unto them, My meat if that I should do the will of him that sent me, and accomplish his work.</strong> This is the first of many similar sayings in this Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:30">John 5:30</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:38">John 6:38</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:18">John 7:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:50">John 8:50</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:4">John 9:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:49-50">John 12:49-50</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:31">John 14:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:10">John 15:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:4">John 17:4</span>), expressing our Lord’s perfect loyalty to His Father’s will, and complete devotion to the accomplishment of His Father’s work.

<p>The pursuit of this is not His joy, His purpose, His refreshment only, but His very food, that without which He cannot live.
