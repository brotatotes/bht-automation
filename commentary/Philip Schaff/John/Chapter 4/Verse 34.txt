John 4:34.  Jesus saith unto them, My meat if that I should do the will of him that sent me, and accomplish his work. This is the first of many similar sayings in this Gospel (John 5:30, John 6:38, John 7:18, John 8:50, John 9:4, John 12:49-50, John 14:31; John 15:10, John 17:4), expressing our Lord’s perfect loyalty to His Father’s will, and complete devotion to the accomplishment of His Father’s work.
	The pursuit of this is not His joy, His purpose, His refreshment only, but His very food, that without which He cannot live. The ‘will’ to be ‘done’ may perhaps remind us of the action of the hour or the moment; the ‘work’ to be ‘accomplished,’ of the complete expression and fulfilment of the ‘will.’
