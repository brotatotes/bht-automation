<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:35">John 4:35</span>. <strong> Say not ye,</strong> Has not your language this day been, <strong> There are yet four</strong> <strong> months, and</strong> <strong> then cometh the harvest? </strong> As harvest began in the middle of April it was now the middle of December.

<p><strong> Lo!</strong> <strong> I say unto</strong> <strong> you, Lift up your eyes, and</strong> <strong> behold the fields, that they are white for</strong> <strong> harvesting. </strong> As in this chapter we have heard of a natural and a spiritual eating or drinking, water (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:10">John 4:10</span>), food (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:32">John 4:32</span>), so here, introduced with equal suddenness, we have the thought of a spiritual harvest. Yet, distant as must have seemed the harvest to the disciples when they looked upon the fields, far more distant would seem the day when Samaritans could be gathered in to the garner of the Lord. But, lo! they are bid see, the fields are already white for harvesting. These words, we cannot doubt, were spoken by Jesus in sight of the Samaritans flocking towards Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:30">John 4:30</span>): He saw the preparation of their hearts, the impression made by the woman’s message, the faith which His own words would immediately bring forth; nay, He saw a harvest far more glorious than that of this day’s labours, even that of the salvation of the world (comp. note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:42">John 4:42</span>).</p>
