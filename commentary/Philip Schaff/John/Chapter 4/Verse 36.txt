John 4:36.  Already he that reapeth receiveth reward, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. The figure is continued and amplified. Not only are the fields ready for harvesting, but the reaper is even now at work, and receiving his reward; and how glorious a reward! Not a lifeless store, but (as in the case of the springing water, John 4:14, and the eating that abideth, chap. John 6:27) fruit gathered for life eternal, fruit that shall endure for ever in the fruition of the new life which Jesus brings. And all this takes place ‘already’ (the word even standing emphatically at the head of the sentence), that in the spiritual field so quickly does the harvest follow the sowing of the seed sower and reaper may rejoice together.
