<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:37">John 4:37</span>. <strong> For herein is the word true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</strong> For, in the spiritual field of which Jesus speaks, the familiar saying is true, has full reality (the word used signifying ‘true,’ as opposed not merely to what is false, but to all that is partial and imperfect), that one has the labour of the sower, another the joy of the reaper.</p>
