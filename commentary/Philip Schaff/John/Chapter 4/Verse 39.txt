John 4:39.  And from that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, bearing witness, He told me all things that ever I did. The arrangement of the words shows the prominence which John would give to the thought that many  Samaritans believed in Jesus. Their faith, too, was only mediately called forth by the woman’s word, for the Evangelist describes her by his favourite and most expressive term, as one ‘bearing witness’ concerning Jesus.
