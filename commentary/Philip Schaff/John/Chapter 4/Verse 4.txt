<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:4">John 4:4</span>. <strong> And he</strong> <strong> must needs go through Samaria. </strong> The natural route from Judea to Galilee lay through Samaria. The other route, through the country on the east of Jordan, was so much longer that no one would choose it unless desirous of avoiding Samaria. The necessity here spoken of, therefore, may simply have reference to geographical position, and to the present urgent motive for reaching Galilee without delay. Still the use of ‘must’ in this Gospel compels us to lay an emphasis on the word, and to interpret it as denoting more than merely usage or convenience. If <strong> </strong> the Evangelist’s thought is that the hostility of <strong> </strong> the Pharisees (partly actually existing, partly foreseen) made it necessary for the Saviour to hasten into Galilee, then he would have us understand that the Jews themselves brought about this visit to the hated nation of the Samaritans. But above and beyond all this, there seems a clear intimation of the truth brought before us in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:34">John 4:34</span>, chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:4">John 9:4</span> ， etc: here, as always, Jesus acts according to His knowledge of His Father’s will.
