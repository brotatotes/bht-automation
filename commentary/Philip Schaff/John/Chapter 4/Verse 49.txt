John 4:49.  The kingâ€™s officer saith unto   him,  Lord, come down ere my child die. The answer of Jesus, which had seemed perhaps to imply cold neglect, calls forth an impassioned appeal for pity and help; there were no moments to be lost, even now the help may come too late. Jesus was but educating refining and deepening his faith.
