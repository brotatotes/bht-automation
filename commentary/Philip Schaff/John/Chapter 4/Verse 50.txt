<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:50">John 4:50</span>. <strong> Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way</strong> <strong> ; </strong> <strong> thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.</strong> Jesus does not need the passionate appeal: the prayer has been already granted. ‘Thy son liveth’ does not mean, ‘is made to live now after thy second petition’; but, ‘even while the word is in thy mouth, or before it was so, thy son liveth.’ The meaning, in short, is not <strong> , </strong> I perform the cure at this instant; but rather, I have performed it, the work is done, thy son is recovered. He will not come to heal the child; there is no need that He should do so, the child is already whole. Will the father believe the word? He will, for his faith is purified and changed: it is now faith in the <em> word</em> of Jesus, though no sign or wonder has been seen.</p>
