<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:52">John 4:52</span>. <strong> He enquired of them therefore the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</strong> As the distance between Cana and Capernaum is not above five-and-twenty miles, it may seem strange that the officer should not have reached his home the same day. If the ‘seventh hour’ were reckoned from sunrise, the time of the cure would be a little later than noon; in that case it would be necessary to suppose that the servants were following the familiar Jewish reckoning of time, and regarding sunset as the commencement of a new day. It seems, however, much more probable (see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:6">John 4:6</span>) that by the ‘seventh hour’ we must understand 6 to 7 P.M. <strong> </strong> Even without the supposition that the father had been detained in Cana, this will suit all the circumstances of the narrative. The words ‘began to amend’ do not suggest any hesitation on the father’s part as to the completeness of the cure. He had believed the word ‘thy son liveth’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:50">John 4:50</span>), and what he asks now is as to the hour at which his child had been stopped upon the road to death, and turned back upon that to full health and strength.</p>
