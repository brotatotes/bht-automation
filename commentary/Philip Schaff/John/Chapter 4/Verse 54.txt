John 4:54.  This Jesus again did, as a second sign, having come out of Judea into Galilee. The order of the original is remarkable, and we endeavour to represent it by a translation which, if literal, is yet sufficiently idiomatical. ‘This’ stands alone; ‘a second sign’ is in apposition with it. There is thus by means of ‘again’ and ‘second’ a double statement as to the position of the miracle; and as we know that other miracles, not numbered, were wrought in Galilee (chap. 6 ), and that there had already been ‘signs’ also in Judea (chap. John 2:23), the two points upon which our attention is fixed seem to be ( 1 ) that this miracle was wrought in  Galilee; ( 2 ) that it was a  second miracle there. The first of these points receives importance from the fact that the ‘sign’ now related was done after Jesus had left ‘His own country,’ rejected by ‘His own’ to be accepted by Galileans: the second magnifies the sign itself, for the mention of it as a ‘second’ appears to flow from the tendency of the Evangelist to give double pictures of any truth which possesses in his eyes peculiar weight. This is the case here. From the first Jesus showed that His mission was not confined to Judea. It included Galilee, a province representative not of Jews only but of Gentiles, out of which the Jews thought that no prophet could come (John 7:52): it was not a local but a universal mission.
	It is not necessary to discuss the question whether this miracle is identical with that related in Matthew 8:5-13; Luke 7:2-10. We may wonder that such a question was ever raised. One point of similarity exists, in that in each case the cure was performed at a distance: in all other respects the narratives are wholly different, agreeing neither in time, nor in place, nor in the station of the persons concerned, nor in the character of the faith evinced.
