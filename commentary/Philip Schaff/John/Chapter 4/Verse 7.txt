<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:7">John 4:7</span>. <strong> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water.</strong> By Samaria here we are of course to understand the country not the city of Samaria. The woman belonged to Sychar; by race and religion she was a Samaritan, and it is to this fact, as is shown by the preposition employed in the original, that the Evangelist would direct our special attention. It was very natural that she should come at this time to draw water at the well; but from the narrative that follows it seems probable that something more than the excellence of the water drew her to it day by day. One so strongly imbued with the ancient traditions of her countrymen could not but turn with deepest interest to ‘Jacob’s well.
