<p>This section of the Gospel brings Jesus before us in Galilee, in His intercourse with the Galileans, and in particular with the king’s officer, who may be regarded as in a certain sense their representative. The object is still the same as that which we have traced from chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:12">John 2:12</span>. Examples have been given of the manner in which Judea and Samaria submit to the word of Jesus, and these are now crowned by an instance of similar submission on the part of Galilee. The section divides itself into two subordinate parts ( 1 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:43-45">John 4:43-45</span>, introductory, after the manner of the introduction to the story of Nicodemus in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23-25">John 2:23-25</span>, and of that to the visit to Samaria in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:1-4">John 4:1-4</span>; ( 2 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:46-54">John 4:46-54</span>, the account of the intercourse of Jesus with the king’s officer.</p>
