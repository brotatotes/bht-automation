John 4:7-8.  Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.   (For his disciples were gone away unto the   city to buy food.) The departure of the disciples had left Jesus thus dependent on the woman’s kindness; for they had left no vessel by which the water could be drawn from the deep well It has been conjectured that the recorder of this narrative had not gone on to Sychar with his fellow-disciples, but himself heard the Saviour’s conversation with the Samaritan woman. The conjecture is most improbable, if not altogether contrary to the statement of the Evangelist. We cannot doubt that it was from our Lord’s own lips that the beloved disciple received the whole account.
