<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:10">John 5:10</span>. <strong> The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day, and it is not lawful for thee to take up the bed.</strong> The Jews some of the rulers of the people (see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>) who had not been present at the miracle met the man as he departed carrying his bed. As guardians of the law they challenge him, and condemn the bearing of burdens on the sabbath. It is very important for us to determine whether in so doing they were right or wrong. Were they faithfully carrying out the letter of the law of Moses, or were they enforcing one of those traditions by which they destroyed its spirit? We have no hesitation in adopting the former view. The question must be decided apart from the miracle, of which at this moment the Jews seem to have had no knowledge. It is true that, even had it been known by them, their judgment would not have been altered; they would have equally condemned the healing on the sabbath (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:14">Luke 13:14</span>), since there had been no question of life and death. When, too, they afterwards hear what has been done (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:11">John 5:11</span>) there is no change in their tone and spirit; and our Lord’s own reference to this miracle (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:23">John 7:23</span>) seems to show that, so far from convincing them, it had roused their special indignation. But at the point of time now before us the lawfulness of healing on the sabbath was not in question. They met a man carrying his bed in the streets of Jerusalem on the sacred day. The law of Moses forbade any work on that day; and the special enactments in the Pentateuch (the command to kindle no fire, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+35:3">Exodus 35:3</span>, and the judgment on the man who gathered sticks, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="nu+15:35">Numbers 15:35</span>) show how this law was to be interpreted. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:21-23">Jeremiah 17:21-23</span>, moreover (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ne+13:19">Nehemiah 13:19</span>), this very act, the bearing of burdens, is explicitly condemned. What could they do but condemn it? Would the same act be regarded otherwise in England at the present hour? One other consideration remains, and it is decisive. Our Lord’s answer to the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:17">John 5:17</span>) makes no reference to their casuistical distinctions or to traditions by which the law was overlaid. It differs altogether in tone and spirit from the reproofs which we read in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:15">Luke 13:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:5">Luke 14:5</span>. Had their objection lain against the healing, we cannot doubt that they would have brought on themselves the like rebuke: here however they were right in holding the man’s action, so far as they understood it at the moment, to be an infraction of their law.
