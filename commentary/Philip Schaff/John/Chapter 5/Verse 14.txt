<p><strong> And said unto him, Behold, thou hast been made whole: sin no longer, that some worse thing come not unto thee. </strong> The words of Jesus imply much more than the general connection of sin and suffering; they show that in this case the sickness had in some way been the result and the punishment of sin.
