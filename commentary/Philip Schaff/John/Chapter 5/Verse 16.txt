<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:16">John 5:16</span>. <strong> And for this cause did the Jews persecute Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath day.</strong> The man whose cure had been the occasion of the action taken by the Jews now <strong> </strong> passes from view. For the second time Jesus and ‘the Jews’ are brought face to face. He had appeared in the temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:14">John 2:14</span>) to put an end to the abuses they bad permitted or fostered, and to vindicate the holiness of His Father’s house. Then He offered Himself to Israel as the Son of God; He declared Himself the antitype of their temple, the idea of which (as God’s dwelling-place) had its fulfilment in Himself alone. As by supernatural influence on those who trafficked in the Holy Place He had then challenged the attention of the rulers of Israel, so now by a wonderful sign He fixed on Himself the eyes of all (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:21">John 7:21</span>). This time it is not on the temple that He lays His hand, but on the law, the cherished commandment of the sabbath. It is not as one who with authority checks abuses which none could defend, though from them many derived gain,’ that our Lord now appears in Jerusalem: He comes as one who claims to be above the law, having the right, as Lawgiver, to set aside its letter. As the temple had its idea fulfilled in Himself, so was it with the sabbath. As to the Son of God God’s house belonged, so to the Son of God belonged that Rest of God of which the sabbath was a type; and the sabbath cannot be broken by the Son of God. This is the light in which the following verses teach us to regard the whole narrative. The choice of the sabbath day for the miracle is the kernel of the paragraph. Had the Jews been teachable and free from prejudice, had they taken the miracle as the starting-point of their reasonings, they would have been prepared for hearing the ground of the claims of Jesus thus to regulate their law. ‘How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:16">John 9:16</span>) was in truth a convincing argument, and by yielding to its force they would have been led to Jesus as humble seekers after truth. But because He ‘did these things,’ wrought such works and showed that He would persevere with them, they became and continued to be His persecutors.</p>
