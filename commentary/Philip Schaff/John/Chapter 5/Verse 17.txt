<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:17">John 5:17</span>. <strong> But he answered them, My Father worketh until now: I also work.</strong> In three different ways does our Lord rebut the charge which His foes so often brought against Him, that He broke the sabbath. At one time He showed that it was not the law but the vain tradition that He set aside (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:11">Matthew 12:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:15">Luke 13:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:5">Luke 14:5</span>); at another He declared Himself as the Son of man Lord of the sabbath, and taught that the law of the sabbath must be determined from its aim and object (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:27-28">Mark 2:27-28</span>); here only does He take even higher ground. God rested from His works of creation on the seventh day; this day was hallowed and set apart for man’s rest from labour, a rest which was the shadow of the rest of God, and which was designed to remove from man everything that might hinder him from entering in spirit into that fellowship with God which is perfect rest. From the creation to this very moment the Father hath been working; in His very rest upholding all things by the word of His power, providing all things for His creatures, working out the purpose of His love in their redemption. ‘My Father worketh until now,’ with no pause or intermission: ‘I also work.’ He who can thus call God His Father finds in the works of His Father the law of His own works. No works of the Father can interrupt the sabbath rest: no works of the Son on earth can break the sabbath law. The 19 th and 20 th verses more fully explain what is expressed in these majestic words.</p>
