<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span>. <strong> For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</strong> The Jews do not fail to see that the argument rested on the first words, ‘My Father.’ He who could thus speak, and who justified His works by the works of God, was calling God His own Father in the highest sense which these words can bear, and was claiming equality with God. It has been objected that, though the brief assertion of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:17">John 5:17</span> does really imply all this, it is not probable that so momentous an inference would have been drawn from words so few. But it is sufficient to reply that, whilst John gives to us the exact substance of the words of Jesus and the impression which they made upon the hearers, we have no reason to suppose that <em> all</em> the words spoken are recorded. The meaning which we gather from those that stand written before us probably could not be conveyed by <em> spoken</em> words without repetition and enlargement. The thought of the condensation which must have taken place in the record of these discourses of our Lord is that which fully justifies the devout reader’s effort to catch every shade of meaning and follow every turn of expression. The answer Jesus has given does but repel the Jews. We are told what the persecution of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:16">John 5:16</span> meant, even then they had sought His life, for now they sought <em> the more</em> to kill Him. From this point onwards we have the conflict that nothing could reconcile, the enmity of the Jews which would not and could not rest until they had compassed the death of Him who had come to save them. </p>
