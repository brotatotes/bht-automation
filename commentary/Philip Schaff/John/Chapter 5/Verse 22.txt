<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:22">John 5:22</span>. <strong> For moreover the Father judgeth no one, but hath given all judgment unto the Son. </strong> This verse must be taken in connection with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span>, ‘The Son can of Himself do nothing save what He seeth the Father doing.’ By thus connecting the two verses, it becomes plain that our Lord does not assert that judgment is not in a certain sense exercised by the Father, but that the Father has not reserved judgment to Himself, that with all other things, it too is given unto the Son. The Father showeth the Son all things that Himself doeth: from this complete manifestation nothing is excepted, not even that final arbitrament which is the prerogative of the Supreme. Hence there is no contradiction between this verse and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:30">John 5:30</span> below, where Jesus says, ‘I can of mine own self do nothing; as I hear, I judge;’ nor will <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:50">John 8:50</span> present any difficulty. By ‘judgment,’ as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:17-19">John 3:17-19</span>, we must certainly understand a judgment that issues in condemnation: the parallelism between <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:18">John 3:18</span>, ‘He that believeth in Him is not judged,’ and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>, ‘He that heareth my word and believeth Him that sent me hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment,’ is remarkably close. All judgment future and present, the final award with all that foreshadows it, the Father hath given, by a bestowal which can never be revoked, unto the Son. The connection between the <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:22">John 5:22</span> and the <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21">John 5:21</span> verses is now plain. The Son maketh to live whom He will; but there are some on whom He does not bestow life (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:40">John 5:40</span>); them therefore He judges, He condemns, for not even is this Divine prerogative withholden from Him; nay, all judgment hath been given unto the Son.</p>
