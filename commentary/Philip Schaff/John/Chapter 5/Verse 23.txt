<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:23">John 5:23</span>. <strong> That all may honour the Son even as they honour the Father. </strong> These words express the purpose of the Father in giving all judgment to the Son. They remind us of the closing words of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:20">John 5:20</span>, which also express His purpose, but there is a significant difference between the two verses. There we read ‘that ye may marvel,’ here ‘that <em> all</em> may honour:’ there it is the confusion and amazement of foes, here it is the honour rendered by all whether foes or friends. It is true, indeed, that the ‘judgment’ of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:22">John 5:22</span> implies condemnation, and that, by consequence, this verse might seem to relate to foes only and not obedient subjects in the kingdom of God. But the ‘all’ is rightly introduced, for when judgment has compelled the honour of unwilling adoration, much more may it be expected that willing hearts will see the unity of the Father and the Son, and will honour the Son even as they honour the Father.

<p><strong> He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father which sent him. </strong> It was in their zeal for the honour of the Father, as they supposed, that the Jews refused to honour Him who was God’s Son. But so truly one are the Father and the Son, that all who dishonour the Son dishonour the Father. The Father orders all things as the does that He whom He sent into the world may receive equal honour with Himself; and all who refuse honour to the Son resist the Father’s purpose. Similar words are found in one of the earlier Gospels (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:16">Luke 10:16</span>), yet no teaching is more characteristic of the fourth.</p>
