<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>. <strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you.</strong> The second ‘Verily, verily,’ introducing the second step in the argument.

<p><strong> He that heareth my word, and believeth Him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life.</strong> This verse has a close connection with the last, the words ‘Him that sent me’ taking up the similar words in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:23">John 5:23</span>; and those who by hearing Christ’s words give honour to the Father being set over against those who were there spoken of as dishonouring the Father. But the verse has also a very important connection with the three preceding verses. They have stated the work of the Son <em> as it has been given Him by the Father;</em> <strong> </strong> this states the same work <em> in its effect upon believers</em>. The comparison of the terms employed in the several verses is very instructive, and the <em> advance</em> from a principle asserted of the Son to the same principle viewed in its application to men is most perceptible. The Son maketh to live the dead, even those whom He will (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21">John 5:21</span>): he that heareth His word hath eternal life, and hath passed out of his state of death into life (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>). All judgment is given unto the Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:22">John 5:22</span>): into this judgment he that believeth does not come (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>). There is special significance in the words ‘believeth Him that sent me:’ our Lord does not say ‘believeth <em> in</em> Him,’ for that which He has in view is the acceptance of God’s testimony concerning the Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:10">1 John 5:10</span>). Such hearing and believing imply the full acceptance of Christ, and thus lead directly to that ‘believing in the Son’ which (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span>) gives the present possession of eternal life. The believer has passed into a state to which judgment does not apply; he has received into himself that word which (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:48">John 12:48</span>) will at the last day judge all who reject it. Believing in Christ, he has life in Him, and to all that are in Christ Jesus there is no condemnation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1">Romans 8:1</span>).</p>
