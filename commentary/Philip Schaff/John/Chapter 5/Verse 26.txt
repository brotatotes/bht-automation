<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:26">John 5:26</span>. <strong> For even as the Father hath life in himself; so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself. </strong> The dead shall hear the voice of the Son and live, for the Son hath life and can impart life. This is the connection between <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25-26">John 5:25-26</span>. The Father who is the primal fountain of life gave to the Son to have life in Himself. As in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19-21">John 5:19-21</span>, that which belongs to the Father and that which belongs to the Son are designated by the same words, while the subordination expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19-20">John 5:19-20</span>, by the figurative words ‘showing’ and ‘seeing,’ is here (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:22">John 5:22</span>) expressed by the word ‘gave.’ It is therefore the essential nature of the Son that is spoken of, and not His work in redemption. ‘To have life in Himself’ is the loftiest expression that can be used: the unchangeable possession of life exactly similar and parallel to that of the Father, such possession as enables Him to be the Giver of life to others, belongs to the Son.</p>
