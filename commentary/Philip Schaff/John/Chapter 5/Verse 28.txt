<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:28">John 5:28</span>. <strong> Marvel not at this.</strong> Jesus has been speaking of works at which they may well marvel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:20">John 5:20</span>); but great as these may be, there is yet a greater.
	</p>
<p><strong> Because an hour cometh, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice.</strong> That the future alone is spoken of is clear from the omission of the words ‘and now is’ found in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>. The resurrection is not spiritual and figurative, for the words are ‘all that are in the graves, ‘not’ all that have heard,’ shall go forth, not ‘shall live.’ The consummation of the work of Jesus is the general resurrection both of the righteous and the wicked. Now all shall hear His voice, to which before (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>) some only had given heed. All shall go forth, but not all to a resurrection of life.</p>
