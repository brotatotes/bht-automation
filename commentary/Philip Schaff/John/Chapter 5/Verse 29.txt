John 5:29.  And they that have done good shall go forth unto a resurrection of life; but they that have committed evil unto a resurrection of judgment.  Those who have committed evil, whose deeds have not been the abiding fruit and work of the truth, but merely the repeated manifestation of evil in its vanity and worthlessness (see John 3:20), shall go forth to a resurrection to which belongs abiding judgment. And these alone come into judgment (compare John 5:24). As in John 3:18 it is said that ‘he that  believeth in Him   is not judged,’ so here, ‘they that  have done good   shall go forth unto a resurrection of life.’ The difference between the two passages is, that in the one the faith is named; in the other, the works which are the expression of the life that follows faith, the abiding fruit of faith. It will be observed that the expressions ‘resurrection of life’ and resurrection of judgment denote  states, not  acts, of resurrection. No general  judgment, therefore, is here mentioned: all that is spoken of is a general  resurrection, on the part of some to a continuing life, of others to a continuing judgment.
