<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29">John 5:29</span>. <strong> And they that have done good shall go forth unto a resurrection of life; but they that have committed evil unto a resurrection of judgment. </strong> Those who have committed evil, whose deeds have not been the abiding fruit and work of the truth, but merely the repeated manifestation of evil in its vanity and worthlessness (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:20">John 3:20</span>), shall go forth to a resurrection to which belongs abiding judgment. And these alone come into judgment (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:18">John 3:18</span> it is said that ‘he that <em> believeth in Him</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> is not judged,’ so here, ‘they that <em> have done good</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> shall go forth unto a resurrection of life.’ The difference between the two passages is, that in the one the faith is named; in the other, the works which are the expression of the life that follows faith, the abiding fruit of faith. It will be observed that the expressions ‘resurrection of life’ and resurrection of judgment denote <em> states,</em> not <em> acts</em>, of resurrection. No general <em> judgment</em>, therefore, is here mentioned: all that is spoken of is a general <em> resurrection</em>, on the part of some to a continuing life, of others to a continuing judgment.</p>
