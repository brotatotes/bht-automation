<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:32">John 5:32</span>. <strong> It is another that beareth witness concerning me. </strong> Not ‘There is another,’ as if He would merely cite an additional witness. He would lay the <em> whole</em> stress of the witnessing upon this ‘other witness.’ This witness is the Father, not John the Baptist, who is mentioned in the next verse only that it may be shown that his testimony is <em> not</em> that on which Jesus relies.

<p><strong> And I know that the witness which he witnesseth concerning me is true. </strong> These words are not said in attestation of the Father’s truth, a point admitted by all: they are the utterance of the Son’s profound consciousness of His own dignity and union with the Father.</p>
