<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:33">John 5:33</span>. <strong> Ye have sent unto John, and he hath borne witness unto the truth. </strong> As if He said: Had I not this all-sufficient witness, were it possible for me to appeal to any human witness, I might rest on your own act. Ye yourselves have made appeal to John, and he hath borne witness to the truth (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19-27">John 1:19-27</span>). Your mission and his answer are unalterable and abiding facts, which press upon you still and cannot be set aside. What he attested is the truth. Jesus does not say ‘hath borne witness to me,’ perhaps because that to which John bore witness was only a revelation from God (compare chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:34">John 1:34</span>), a declaration of the truth which he had received from God; perhaps because the whole lesson of this passage is that there is only <em> one</em> real witness to Jesus, even the Father speaking in the Son and drawing out the answer of the heart to Him.</p>
