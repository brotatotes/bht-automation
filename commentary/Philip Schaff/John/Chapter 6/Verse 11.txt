<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:11">John 6:11</span>. <strong> Jesus therefore took the loaves: and when he had given thanks he distributed to them that had sat down; likewise also of the fishes as much as they would.</strong> Jesus alone is mentioned, but there is no doubt that He employed the agency of His disciples. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:41">Mark 6:41</span> we read that Jesus <em> gave the loaves to His disciples</em> to set before the multitude; but, in the very same verse, that the ‘two fishes <em> divided</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> <em> He</em> amongst them all;’ yet we cannot doubt that the mode of distribution would be the same in both cases. However done, the work of distribution was really His, and the Evangelist would fix our thoughts on Him alone. This miracle, as has often been remarked, is (with the exception of our Lord’s resurrection) the only one related by all four Evangelists. The differences in the accounts are very slight. It is curious to note that in all the other narratives of it our Lord is said to have ‘blessed’ before He brake the loaves, whereas in the two accounts of the feeding of the four thousand He ‘gave thanks’ before breaking the bread: here, however, <em> giving thanks</em> takes the place of <em> blessing.</em> When the miracle is referred to below (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:23">John 6:23</span>), the Lord’s ‘giving thanks’ is brought into prominence. This would seem to show that the word is here used with intentional significance, probably with marked reference to the Paschal meal, at which thanksgiving played so important a part. There is a striking resemblance indeed between the description before us and the accounts of the last supper, especially that given in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:0">1 Corinthians 11:0</span>.</p>
