<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:13">John 6:13</span>. <strong> Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with pieces from the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten. </strong> The repetition of the words, ‘the five barley loaves,’ is remarkable; the writer wishes to lay emphasis on the identity of the fragments with the loaves of the original supply. Mark speaks of the collection of the fragments of the fishes (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:43">John 6:43</span>); John, intent on the idea to be unfolded, alike in the scene and in the discourse that followed it, passes by this circumstance. The number of baskets was twelve. We can hardly doubt that each Apostle had his own ‘basket,’ and that each of these was filled. Nor is it fanciful to see in this a token that what was symbolized by the precious bread was destined for each tribe of Israel. In every narrative of this miracle the same word <em> (cophinus)</em> is used for basket; in the accounts of the feeding of the four thousand (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:37">Matthew 15:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:8">Mark 8:8</span>) the word is entirely different; and where the two miracles are referred to together, each retains the word that belongs to it; so that in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:9-10">Matthew 16:9-10</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:19-20">Mark 8:19-20</span>, the word ‘baskets,’ repeated in our translation, answers to different words. John’s agreement with the other Evangelists in so minute a point as the use of <em> cophinus</em> in connection with this miracle is interesting and important.</p>
