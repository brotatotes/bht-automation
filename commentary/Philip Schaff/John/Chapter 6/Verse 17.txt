John 6:17.  And entered into a boat, and were coming over the sea unto Capernaum. And darkness had already come on, and Jesus was not yet come to them. Probably they were intending to coast along the shore of the lake between Bethsaida-Julias and Capernaum: in this   they were no doubt following their Masterâ€™s directions. The words that follow show clearly that they expected Him to rejoin them at some point on the coast.
