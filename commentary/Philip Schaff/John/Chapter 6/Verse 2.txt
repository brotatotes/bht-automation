<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:2">John 6:2</span>. <strong> And a great multitude followed him, because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick.</strong> The Greek words are very expressive pointing clearly to repeated miracles of healing, on account of which crowds followed him continually from place to place. This is the only verse in John’s Gospel corresponding with the many passages in the Synoptic Gospels that briefly record a multitude of such works (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:16">Matthew 8:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:35">Matthew 9:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:30">Matthew 15:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:56">Mark 6:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:11">Luke 9:11</span>, etc.); and it refers to that very Galilean ministry to which those records belong. In Judea, as in unbelieving Nazareth (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:5">Mark 6:5</span>), ‘He could not do many mighty works.’
