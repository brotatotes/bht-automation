John 6:23.  Howbeit there came boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat the bread, after that the Lord had given thanks.  Whilst they were still in wonder and doubt, other boats came across the sea near to the scene of the miracle of the preceding day. These boats were from Tiberias, and from the boatmen who brought them the multitude would learn at once that neither Jesus nor His disciples had gone thither.
