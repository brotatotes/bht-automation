<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:25">John 6:25</span>. <strong> And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him. Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</strong> The ‘other side’ denotes the western coast. Their question on finding Jesus in Capernaum but partly expresses their thoughts, which would rest as much on the <em> how</em> as on the ‘ <em> when’</em> of His coming to this place. He had not left the eastern shore with His disciples; the storm of the night must have forbidden any attempt to make the passage then; and, as they well knew, He had not come to the western shore in their company. The question is not answered, but the eager search which it implied is made to lead the way to deeper instruction as to the miracle which had drawn them to follow Him.
