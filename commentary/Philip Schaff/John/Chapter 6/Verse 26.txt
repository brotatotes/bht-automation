<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:26">John 6:26</span>. <strong> Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were satisfied. </strong> This solemn declaration is only seemingly discordant with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:2">John 6:2</span> or <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:14">John 6:14</span>. Those who witnessed a miracle of Jesus, and did not understand its significance, might be said to see the sign and yet not to see it. Indeed, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:14">John 6:14</span> seems to imply a third condition of mind, intermediate between these. Those who had eaten of the loaves saw in the miracle the proof that Jesus was the Prophet who should come: they saw that the wonder was significant, but the words before us show that even this stood below the true perception of the ‘sign.’ The miracle had led the thoughts of the multitude to the power and dignity of the miracle-worker, but had suggested nothing of a higher and a spiritual work, symbolized by the material bounty that had been bestowed. The design of the work in its relation to the Saviour was to manifest His glory as the Giver of the highest blessings; in its relation to the people, to fix their eyes on Him and to awaken their desire for that of which the bread had been the sign. Part of this purpose has been attained, they have sought Him eagerly, with toil and trouble: He must now so complete their training that they may be led to leave the carnal and seek the spiritual, that they may be brought to behold in His deeds not merely the tokens of His power to satisfy every earthly desire of His followers, but the impress of His Divine character and work.
