John 6:3.  And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.  He retired for the purpose of rest and prayer, and that he might instruct his disciples, the twelve who had just returned from their mission (Mark 6:30). ‘The mountain’ we must probably understand in a general sense as meaning the high ground near Bethsaida. In this part the eastern hills closely approach the lake.
