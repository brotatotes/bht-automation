<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:30">John 6:30</span>. <strong> They said therefore unto him, What then doest thou as a sign, that we may see, and believe thee? What dost thou work? </strong> The words of Jesus had now become too plain to be misunderstood. It was clear that He would turn them away from such works as they had had in view, and fix all thought upon Himself; while at the same time His words breathed no spirit of mere self-assertion, but claimed to be an expression of the Divine will. Such a claim no other prophet had ever made; such a claim can only be justified by some special sign which no one can challenge or mistake; and the sign must correspond with the claim. The day before Jesus had been with them as a Teacher only: the miracle had constrained them to acknowledge Him as ‘the Prophet who should come.’ But the words He has just used can only suit One who is higher even than Moses. Before they can believe Him when He thus speaks (note the significant change from ‘believe in Him,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:29">John 6:29</span>, to ‘believe thee,’ <em> i.e.</em> accept thy claims) some sign equal to the greatest wrought by Moses, or even some greater sign, must be displayed.</p>
