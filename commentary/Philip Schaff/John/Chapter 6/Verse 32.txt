<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:32">John 6:32</span>. <strong> Jesus therefore</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> <strong> said unto them</strong> <strong><em> , </em></strong> <strong> Verily, verily, I say unto</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> <strong> you. </strong> The gravity of the truth declared in this verse is indicated by the solemn ‘Verily, verily,’ which now occurs for the second time in this discourse.

<p><strong> Moses gave you not the bread out of heaven; but my Father giveth you the bread out of heaven, the true bread.</strong> If we compare these words with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:26">John 6:26</span>, <em> </em> in which the formula ‘Verily, verily’ is first used, we easily trace the advance in the thought. There, in general terms, the people are enjoined not to set their thought on the perishable food; here Jesus declares that the true bread given out of heaven is not the manna, but that which His Father is at this moment offering them. In the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:31">John 6:31</span>, ‘he gave them bread,’ the multitude may have had Moses in their thoughts; but that is not the meaning of the psalmist, the context having the clearest reference to God. It is probable that our Lord here mentions Moses only to point out more distinctly the past and inferior gift of the manna by the servant of God, in contrast with the true bread now offered to them by the Father. It was not Moses who gave the manna; still less had their fathers received from him the true bread of heaven. The Father, who gave to their fathers the symbol, offers the reality now. ‘My Father,’ Jesus says, because He is leading His hearers onwards to the truth declared in the next two verses, that the ‘true bread’ given out of heaven is Himself, the Son.</p>
