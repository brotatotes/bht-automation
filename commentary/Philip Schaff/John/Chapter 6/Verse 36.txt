<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:36">John 6:36</span>. <strong> But I said unto you, that ye have indeed seen me, and believe not.</strong> When had such words been uttered? Certainly the reference is not to chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:37">John 5:37</span>, spoken in Jerusalem to the Jews, not to the multitude in Galilee. It is not likely that Jesus is speaking of words of censure not recorded in this Gospel; and it is hardly possible to understand the simple expression ‘I said unto you’ in the sense, I would have you know, ‘this is what I would say.’ We must take the words as referring to the substance, to the spirit if not the letter, of something previously said in this chapter, and we can do this without any violence of interpretation. It is remarkable that the people themselves have used words almost identical (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:30">John 6:30</span>): ‘What doest Thou as a sign, that we may <em> see and believe Thee?’</em> <em> that </em> is, may see Thee in Thy working, and believe Thee. This is a confession on their part that as yet they had seen no sign that had led them to see and believe Him. The words of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:26">John 6:26</span> imply that in truth they had not seen ‘signs:’ they had seen His miracles, but these had not so proved themselves to be’ signs ‘as to lead the people to see and believe Him. The charge, therefore, that ‘they seeing saw not’ is perfectly equivalent to what is said in that verse; they had indeed seen Him in the works which were the manifestation of Himself, but they had not been led to faith. The charge is very grave, but it is not made in anger, nor does it leave the accused in hopelessness: not judgment, but encouragement, is the spirit that pervades this part of the discourse. Perhaps it is for this very reason that the word is ‘I said,’ not ‘I say.’ The fact was so; it may be so still; but the state is one that need not last, even now it may pass away.</p>
