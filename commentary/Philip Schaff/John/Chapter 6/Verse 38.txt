<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:38">John 6:38</span>. <strong> Because I have come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</strong> The previous verse was full of the power and energy of love; but even then Jesus expresses no feeling or purpose of His own as the motive of His acts. He will cast out none, because such is the Father’s will, and to do this will He has come down from heaven (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:33">John 6:33</span>).

<p>It may be well, however, to observe that a different preposition from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:33">John 6:33</span> is here used: here ‘from,’ for it is the work of Jesus; there ‘out of,’ for it is the heavenliness of His origin that is the prominent thought.</p>
