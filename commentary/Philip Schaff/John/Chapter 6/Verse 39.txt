<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:39">John 6:39</span>. <strong> And this is the will of him that sent me, that all that which he hath given me, of it I should lose nothing. </strong> Here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:37">John 6:37</span>, the gift of the Father is represented in its totality, ‘all that which.’ As no part of the precious gift to the multitude, the gift which symbolized Himself, must be left to perish (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:12">John 6:12</span>), so no part of the still more precious gift of the Father may be lost by the Son. <strong> But should raise it up at the last day. </strong> Should raise ‘it,’ the whole, all that is comprehended in the gift. The ‘last day’ can denote only one great period of resurrection for the whole Church of God, again a proof, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:28-29">John 5:28-29</span>, that the teaching of our Lord in this Gospel is not confined to the spiritual aspect of death and resurrection. It is not the gift of eternal life that belongs to the last day. Whosoever receives the Son at once receives in Him life eternal (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:33-35">John 6:33-35</span>); but the day of the resurrection of the body witnesses the completion of that gift of eternal life which is now bestowed. In the next verse the present and the future gifts are combined.</p>
