<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:42">John 6:42</span>. <strong> And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how doth he now say, I have come down out of heaven? </strong> At this time, then, it is clear that Jesus was generally regarded as Joseph’s son: the calumnies which at a later period were current amongst the Jews had not yet been resorted to. The words of the Jews do not imply that Joseph was still living, <strong><em> </em></strong> as the word rendered ‘know’ may simply denote their being acquainted with a fact, they knew that Joseph and Mary were His parents. We need not wonder that they are ignorant of the miraculous conception.</p>
