John 6:42.  And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how doth he now say, I have come down out of heaven?  At this time, then, it is clear that Jesus was generally regarded as Joseph’s son: the calumnies which at a later period were current amongst the Jews had not yet been resorted to. The words of the Jews do not imply that Joseph was still living,   as the word rendered ‘know’ may simply denote their being acquainted with a fact, they knew that Joseph and Mary were His parents. We need not wonder that they are ignorant of the miraculous conception.
