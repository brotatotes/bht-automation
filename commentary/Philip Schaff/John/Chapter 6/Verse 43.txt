<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:43">John 6:43</span>. <strong> Jesus answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.</strong> For such murmurers Jesus has only reproof. It is very strange that in our day some writers on this Gospel should have had difficulty in understanding why Jesus did not refute the objection raised by declaring the truth of the miraculous conception. Men who could so mutilate His words as practically to pervert their meaning would have been brought no nearer to conviction by such a statement, however made, but would have gathered from it material for still more malicious accusation. At first the reply of Jesus deals only with the spirit His opponents manifest.</p>
