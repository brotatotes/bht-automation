<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44">John 6:44</span>. <strong> No one can come to me except the Father which sent me shall have drawn him. </strong> In these words He would tell them that (as their unbelief and resistance show) they have not that <em> special</em> divine teaching without which they cannot understand Him. Hence He speaks not of the ‘drawing’ of God, but of that of the ‘Father which sent’ Him. Only like can understand like. It is as the Father of the Son that God works in us that spirit in which the Son can be received by us. The ‘drawing’ is not precisely the same as the ‘giving’ of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:37">John 6:37</span>, but describes, so to speak, the first stage of the ‘giving;’ he that ‘hath been drawn’ by the Father is he that is given to the Son.

<p><strong> And I will raise him up at the last day.</strong> As the initiative of salvation belongs to the Father, the completion is the work of the Son. The Father draws and entrusts; the Son receives, keeps, imparts life, until the glorious consummation, the final resurrection. Between these two extreme terms ‘draw’ and ‘raise up’ is included all the development of the spiritual life (Godet).</p>
