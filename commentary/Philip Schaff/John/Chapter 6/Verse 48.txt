John 6:48.  I am the bread of life.  Having prepared the way by the declaration of the necessity of faith, He reaffirms what (in John 6:35) He had said of Himself. He is the bread which contains life in itself, and which therefore can give and does give life to all who receive and assimilate it. It is interesting to observe, at a point where the discourse is really higher than it was before, a  shortening of the formula employed, similar to that already met by us in John 1:29; John 1:36 (see note on John 1:35-36).
