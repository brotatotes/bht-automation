<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:49">John 6:49</span>. <strong> Your</strong> <strong> fathers did eat the manna in the wilderness, and died. </strong> No other bread has given life eternal. Even the manna, the bread given out of heaven, did not bestow life on their fathers, who (as the people themselves had said) ate the manna in the wilderness. It seems very probable that the addition ‘in the <strong> </strong> wilderness’ is more than a mere repetition of the <strong> </strong> words of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:31">John 6:31</span>. It recalls <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:35">Numbers 14:35</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:8-11">Psalms 95:8-11</span>, and other passages in which ‘the wilderness’ is specially mentioned as the scene of disobedience and of death; and thus the fathers, who (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+1:32">Deuteronomy 1:32</span>) ‘did not believe the Lord’ and died, are contrasted with the believer who ‘hath eternal life’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:47">John 6:47</span>).</p>
