John 6:56.  He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me, and I in him.  The fellowship consists in this, that the believer abides in the Life, and that He who is the Life abides in the believer. Note that here it is not ‘hath eaten;’ the ‘abiding’ is dependent on the continuance of the appropriating act.
