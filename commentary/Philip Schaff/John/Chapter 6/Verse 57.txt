<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:57">John 6:57</span>. <strong> As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live because of me. </strong> He that sent the Son into the world is the living Father, the Being who is eternally and absolutely the Living One. The Son lives because the Father lives. This reception of life (see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:26">John 5:26</span>) is the characteristic of the Son. So, with a relation to the Son similar to the Sonâ€™s relation to the Father, the believer who receives and appropriates the Son lives because the Son, who is Life, abides in him. This is the climax of the whole discourse: for even more exalted language expressive of the same truth, that the relation between Jesus and His own has its pattern in the relation between the Father and the Son, see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21">John 17:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:23">John 17:23</span>.</p>
