<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:58">John 6:58</span>. <strong> This is that bread which came down out of heaven. </strong> Here Jesus returns to the first theme. Since He has now set forth all that the true bread gives, the contrast with the manna is complete. ‘This’ of this nature, such as I have described it to you ‘is the bread that came down out of heaven.’ These last words illustrate the first clause of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:57">John 6:57</span>, ‘the living Father <em> sent me.’

<p><strong> Not as your fathers did eat and died: he that eateth this bread shall live for ever. </strong> The rest of the verse is in the main a forcible repetition of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:49-50">John 6:49-50</span>.</p>
