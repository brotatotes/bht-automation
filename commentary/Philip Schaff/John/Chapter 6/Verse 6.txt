<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:6">John 6:6</span>. <strong> Now this he said proving him: for he himself knew what he was about to do.</strong> Why Philip was addressed is a question often raised. The mention of the circumstance may be only the graphic touch of an eye-witness, and there may be nothing important in the Master’s choice of the disciple whose faith He is to try. Yet it is more likely that some special reason did exist. Philip may have had something to do with making provision for the wants of the company of disciples: this is not inconsistent with chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:6">John 12:6</span>. Or there may have been something in the character of Philip’s mind that led to the special selection of him for trial; and the incident related in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:22">John 12:22</span> has been appealed to as showing a tendency on his part to a caution that might become excessive and obstructive to the development of faith. A more correct explanation may be that, intending to manifest Himself as the fulfilment of what is written in the law, Jesus turns first to one who had confessed Him as the subject of ‘the law and the prophets’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:45">John 1:45</span>). He would test him, and <em> try</em> whether he had entered into the full meaning of his own confession.</p>
