The ‘saying’ can only be that of the preceding verses (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:53-57">John 6:53-57</span>), and its hardness consisted in the fact that it pointed out one only way to life, eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of man. These words the disciples did not spiritually comprehend, and therefore they were repelled by them.</p>
