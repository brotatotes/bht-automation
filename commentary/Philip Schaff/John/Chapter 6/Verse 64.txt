John 6:64.  But there are some of you that believe not.  Even of these who had heard the last words, so mercifully spoken for the removal of their difficulties, there were some who continued in unbelief.
	 For Jesus knew   from    the beginning who they were that believed not, and who it was that would betray him. Another remarkable declaration by the Evangelist of the Saviourâ€™s penetrating discernment of all hearts (compare chap. John 2:24-25), and of His knowledge from the very beginning what would be the end of His earthly course. The words seem to imply that the germ of the traitor-spirit was already in the heart of Judas, who, like many others, loved rather the glory and honour which Jesus set aside (John 6:14-15) than the spirit and the life of His words.
