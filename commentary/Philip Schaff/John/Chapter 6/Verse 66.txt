<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:66">John 6:66</span>. <strong><em> </em></strong> <strong> Upon this many of his disciples went beck, and walked no longer with him. </strong> Another sad reflection, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:64">John 6:64</span>: the Evangelist cannot but record the repelling influence which the light exerted on those who were not of the light. These disciples seemed to have left all that they might be followers of Christ, but now they return to the homes and the occupations they had forsaken. (The usual rendering ‘walked no more’ is in itself perfectly correct, but may be possibly understood in the sense of ‘never more,’ a sense certainly not designed.)</p>
