<p>The sixth chapter continues the conflict of Jesus with the Jews, under the same point of view as that which we found to be prominent in chap. 5 . As in that chapter Jesus was the fulfilment of the sabbath, so in this He is the fulfilment of the Passover; He is the true bread, the true substance of our Paschal feast. The section now before us, contained in the first part of the chapter, may be divided into three subordinate parts ( 1 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:1-13">John 6:1-13</span>, the miracle of the multiplying of the bread; ( 2 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:14-15">John 6:14-15</span>, the effect produced by the miracle upon the Galilean multitude, leading Jesus to withdraw to the other side of the sea; ( 3 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:16-21">John 6:16-21</span>, the storm and the reassuring of the disciples.</p>
