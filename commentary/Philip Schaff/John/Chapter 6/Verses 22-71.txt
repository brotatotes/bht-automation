<p>In the miracle of the multiplying of the bread Jesus has symbolically presented Himself as the true bread of life. This thought is now unfolded in the various discourses with which the remainder of the chapter is occupied, while at the same time the effect of these discourses is traced upon the different classes of hearers introduced to us. The subordinate parts of this section are determined by the mention of these ( 1 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:22-40">John 6:22-40</span>, a discourse addressed to the ‘multitude,’ which must here, as elsewhere, be carefully distinguished from the ‘Jews;’( 2 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:41-51">John 6:41-51</span>, a discourse to the ‘Jews’ who had ‘murmured’ at the words spoken to the multitude. The discourse contains the same great truths as those previously dwelt upon, but in a sharper and more pointed form; ( 3 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:52-59">John 6:52-59</span>, a discourse by which the ‘Jews’ are still further irritated. Formerly they murmured; now they strive among themselves, and the discourse becomes still sharper and more pointed than before; ( 4 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:60-66">John 6:60-66</span>, in which the effect of the truths spoken by Jesus shows itself even upon the disciples, many of whom are so offended that they walk no more with Him; ( 5 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:67-71">John 6:67-71</span>, while many of the disciples are thus offended, the Twelve, with the exception of Judas, are drawn more closely to Jesus, and Peter in their name makes confession of his faith.
