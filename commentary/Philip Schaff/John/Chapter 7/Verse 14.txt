John 7:14.  And when it was already the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple-courts, and taught. It is evident that the Evangelist means to impress us with the suddenness of this appearance of Jesus in the temple-courts. The Lord suddenly comes to His temple, and, at this feast of peculiar joy and hope, He brings with Him a special message and promise of the new covenant (John 7:38; Malachi 3:1). His teaching during the latter half of the sacred week is to prepare for His words on the last day of the feast.
