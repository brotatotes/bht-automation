<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:17">John 7:17</span>. <strong> If any one will to do his will, he will perceive of the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> <strong> speak from myself.</strong> Many a time did the Jews refuse to recognise the teaching of Jesus unless He could prove by a miracle that God was working with Him. Here He tells them that, had they the will to do God’s will, they would need no miracle in evidence that in His teaching they heard the words of God: as the child at once recognises his father’s voice, so would they, if living in harmony with God’s will and purpose, recognise in His voice the voice of God. Such recognition of the words of Jesus is the test, therefore, of a will bent on doing the will of God, and every such effort of will is consciously strengthened by His words; while, on the other hand, the heart which seeks its own glory and not the glory of God is repelled by them (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:44">John 5:44</span>). No words can more clearly show that the very end of the teaching of Jesus as set forth in this Gospel is not empty speculation but practical righteousness. It may be asked, Is our Lord merely stating a truth (‘he <em> will</em> perceive’), or is He also giving a promise (he <em> shall</em> perceive, shall come to know)? Both thoughts are implied. Jesus does not say that the clear conception comes at once, but come it will, come it shall. The last words must be carefully distinguished from those of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:31">John 5:31</span>, etc., ‘bearing witness concerning Myself.’ Here the word used refers to the origin, the source, of the speaking; and the meaning exactly agrees with chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:30">John 5:30</span>, there ‘doing, here’ speaking, from or of Himself.

<p>The words of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:17">John 7:17</span> are especially remarkable when we call to mind that they were addressed to persons all whose thoughts of revelation as a thing demonstrated to man were connected with tokens of the Divine presence appealing to the senses. What a new world did it open up to tell <em> them</em> that perception of the Divine origin of any teaching depends upon our seeing that it strengthens and perfects that moral nature which is within us the counterpart of the Divine nature!</p>
