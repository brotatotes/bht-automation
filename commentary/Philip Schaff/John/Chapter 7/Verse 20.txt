<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:20">John 7:20</span>. <strong><em> </em></strong> <strong> The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon; who seeketh to kill thee?</strong> It is important to observe that this answer is returned by the <em> multitude</em>, not by those to whom <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:19">John 7:19</span> is addressed, and the multitude is apparently in entire ignorance of the designs of ‘the Jews.’ That the people should have thought possession by a demon the only possible explanation of the presence of such a thought in the mind of Jesus places in boldest relief the guilt of ‘the Jews.’ To bring this out is probably the explanation of the insertion of a remark for which it is otherwise difficult to account.</p>
