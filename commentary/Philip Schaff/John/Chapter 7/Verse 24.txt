<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:24">John 7:24</span>. <strong> Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</strong> Righteously had they judged in regard to themselves. So let them judge His work, and they will see that, where they had suspected only the presence of iniquity, there was the highest righteousness.</p>
