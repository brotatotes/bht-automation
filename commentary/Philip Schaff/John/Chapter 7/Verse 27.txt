John 7:27.  Howbeit we know this man whence he is; but when the Christ cometh, no one perceiveth whence he is.  In John 7:42 we read of the expectation that the Christ would come from Bethlehem (see also Matthew 2:5). But there is no inconsistency between this verse and that, for it seems to have been the belief of the Jews that the Redeemer would indeed first appear in Bethlehem ; but would then be snatched away and hidden, and finally would afterwards suddenly manifest Himself, from what place and at what time no one could tell. So Jesus warns His disciples that the cry will be heard, ‘Lo, here is the Christ; or, Lo, he is there’ (Mark 13:21).
