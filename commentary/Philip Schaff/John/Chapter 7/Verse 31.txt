John 7:31.  But of the multitude many believed  in him  ,  and said, When the Christ cometh, will he do more signs than these which this man hath done?  The last verse showed how the hostility to Jesus was growing; this verse presents the brighter side. The division of the people goes on continually increasing: they who are of the light are attracted towards Jesus, they who are of darkness are repelled. The faith of these believers is real (‘they believed in Him’), though not so firm and sure as that which rests less on ‘signs’ than on His own word.
