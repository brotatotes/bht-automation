<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:36">John 7:36</span>. <strong> What is this word which he spake, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come? </strong> This verse contains little more than a repetition of the Saviour’s former statement, but is useful in reminding us that the Jews, whose bitter words we have just been considering, were themselves perplexed by what they heard. We must not suppose that they pondered and <em> then</em> rejected the teaching of Jesus: their enmity rendered impossible that patient thought which would have found the key to His mysterious language; they understood enough to have been attracted, had they only been willing listeners, by the light and the life of His words. Their ignorance resulted from the absence of the will to learn and do God’s will (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:17">John 7:17</span>).
