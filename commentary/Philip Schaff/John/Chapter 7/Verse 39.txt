<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span>. <strong> And this spake he concerning the Spirit, which they that believed in him were to receive: for the spirit was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.</strong> To this authoritative explanation of the ‘living water’ we have more than once referred (see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:10">John 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:14">John 4:14</span>). The word is a promise still, speaking of a future not a present gift (‘were to receive’). The verse before us is one which it is impossible to express in English without a paraphrase. In the first clause we find ‘the Spirit,’ but in the second the article is absent, and the words literally mean ‘for spirit was not yet,’ the word ‘spirit’ meaning, not the Holy Spirit as a Person, but a bestowal or reception of His influence and power. Only when Jesus was glorified, that is, only when He had died, had risen, had ascended on high, had been invested with the glory which was His own at the right hand of the Father, would man receive that spiritual power which is the condition of all spiritual life. When Jesus Himself, the God-man, is perfected, then and not till then does He receive power to bestow the Holy Spirit on mankind. This mysterious subject mainly belongs, however, to later chapters of this Gospel (see especially chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span>).

<p>Here our Lord’s revelation of Himself as the fulfilment of the Old Testament culminates. The feast of Tabernacles was the last great feast of the year. It was also the feast which raised sacred rejoicing to its highest point; which shadowed forth the full bestowal of Messianic blessings (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:16">Zechariah 14:16</span>); and which spoke most of the Holy Spirit, the supreme gift of Jesus to His people. With its fulfilment all the brightest anticipations of ancient prophecy are realised. The effect of this revelation of Jesus by Himself is now traced.</p>
