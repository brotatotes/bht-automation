<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:45">John 7:45</span>. <strong> The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? </strong> The sending of the officers is mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:32">John 7:32</span>. From <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span> we may gather that they had been lingering near Him for a day or more: His last words seem to have deprived them of all power to lay hands on Him. There is a minute difference between the senders as described in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:32">John 7:32</span> (‘the chief priests and the Pharisees’ ) <em> </em> and here, where the second article is dropped. The slight change serves to emphasize the union of the two elements (so to speak) into one for the purpose in hand, but is not sufficient to suggest that here reference is made to the Sanhedrin as a body. It does not appear that there is formal action of the Sanhedrin earlier than the record in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:47">John 11:47</span>.</p>
