John 7:52.  They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search and see that out of    Galilee ariseth no prophet.  No answer to the argument was possible: they can but turn on Nicodemus himself. They assume that no one but a Galilean can take the side of Jesus. The last words are difficult, because at least one of the ancient prophets (Jonah) was of Galilee. But the words do not seem to be intended to include all the past, so much as to express what Jews held to be, and to have long been, a stated rule of Divine Providence: in their scorn of Galilee, and their arrogant assumption of complete knowledge of  ‘ the law,’ they regard it as impossible that out of that land any prophet should arise; least of all can it be the birthplace of the Messiah.
