<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:6">John 7:6</span>. <strong> Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet present, but your time is alway ready. </strong> The answer is remarkably akin to that addressed to His mother in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:4">John 2:4</span>. Very different, probably, were the mother and the brethren in their measure of faith and in the motive of their words; but in each case there betrayed itself a conviction that Jesus might be influenced by human counsel in the manifestations of Himself. Here as there His time was at hand, but not yet ‘present;’ and until the moment appointed by the Father He whose will is one with that of the Father can do nothing. Such limitation did not apply to His brethren; they were not separated from the ‘world,’ and with that world they might at any time associate.</p>
