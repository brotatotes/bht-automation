<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:50-51">John 7:50-51</span>. <strong> Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them), Doth our law Judge a man, except it have first heard from himself and learned what he doeth? </strong> Twice already in this section have we read of the restraint placed on the enemies of Jesus. Those amongst the multitude who were ill affected towards Him were kept back from doing Him harm (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:44">John 7:44</span>); the officers likewise were restrained (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:46">John 7:46</span>); now the Sanhedrists themselves are to be foiled, and this through one of themselves. Nicodemus has so far overcome his fear that he defends Jesus against the glaring injustice of his fellow-rulers, undeterred by the expression of their scorn just uttered. He appeals to the law, all knowledge of which they have proudly arrogated to themselves, and shows that of this very law they are themselves transgressors.</p>
