<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:1">John 8:1</span>. <strong> But Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</strong> No mention is made of the Mount of Olives in any other passage of the Fourth Gospel, but it is more than once spoken of in the Gospel of Luke as a place to which Jesus was wont to retire at the close of His daily labours in Jerusalem during the Passion week. He could thus pass from the hurry and confusion of a large city to the solitude of a hillside or of its retiring hollows, where the sense of peace is deepened by the thought of the busy life which is so near at hand. It is probable that our Lord intended to spend the whole night upon the Mount; and it may be that He would spend it as He did before making choice of His twelve apostles, ‘in prayer to God’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:12">Luke 6:12</span>).</p>
