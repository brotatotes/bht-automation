<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:11">John 8:11</span>. <strong> And she said. No man, Lord.</strong> Her answer is a simple statement of the fact. Perhaps the word ‘Lord’ may indicate the deep impression of the greatness of Jesus that had been made upon her mind.

<p><strong> And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from this time sin no more</strong>. The word ‘I’ is peculiarly emphatic. The language, it will be observed, is not a sentence of acquittal: it is rather an intimation to the woman that she has still space given her for repentance and faith. Let her use her opportunities, and profit by the tender compassion of Him who drew publicans and sinners to His side, then will still more gracious words be addressed to her. Instead of ‘Go thy way, from this time sin no more,’ she will receive the joyful assurance, ‘Daughter, thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace.’ We are told nothing of the effect produced upon the woman by the remarkable scene in which she had borne a part. But every reader must feel how worthy of Him who ‘came not to destroy men’s lives but to save them were the words of Jesus upon this occasion. The narrative has lived on through all ages of the Church as an illustration, not less striking than any other recorded in the Gospels, of that Divine wisdom with which Jesus knew how to combine what human wisdom has never been able to unite, condemnation of sin, and free and unrestricted mercy to the sinner.
