<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:14">John 8:14</span>. <strong> Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is true: because I know whence I came, and whither I go;</strong> but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go. A little later (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:17">John 8:17</span>), Jesus gives an answer similar to the purport of His words in chap. 5 . His Father beareth witness of Him, and His Father’s testimony is ever present. But here He rebukes their judgment of Him. In a sense (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:17">John 8:17</span>), their requirement of other testimony is valid; but first He must reject their application to Him of a principle of judgment which is valid in regard to men like themselves. Amongst men of like nature those who are but men such judgment is true: when applied to Jesus it fails. Men who know but in part may be self-deceivers, even if they are true men; hence their word needs support. He who knows with unerring certainty that He comes from the Father and is going to the Father may bear witness of Himself, and His testimony is valid and true. He who thus comes from God cannot but speak with a self-evidencing power, self-evidencing to all who are willing to see and hear. This willingness the Pharisees had not, and hence He adds, ‘Ye know not whence come, or whither I go.’ The change from ‘I <strong><em> </em></strong> came’ to ‘I come’ is remarkable, but is easily explained. The past fact (‘I came’) is not one which the Pharisees could know, except by inference: His present mission from the Father (‘I come’) should have been discerned by all who saw His works and heard His words; and every one who recognised that He cometh from the Father must understand His meaning when He says ‘I go’ to Him that sent me.
