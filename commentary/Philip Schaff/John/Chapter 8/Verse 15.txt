<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:15">John 8:15</span>. <strong> Ye judge after the flesh. </strong> They had judged Him by mere outward appearance, and according to their own merely human thoughts and wishes. Having formed for themselves without patient study of the Scriptures, and thus without the guidance of the Spirit of God, their conception of Messiah and of His kingdom, they rejected Jesus because He did not answer their expectation. But for this, the Divine witness in Him would have reached their hearts.

<p><strong> I judge</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> <strong> no one. </strong> They judged according to their own nature, standing alone, without the guidance of the Father, not taking the Father along with them in judging, and thus not judging ‘righteous judgment’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:24">John 7:24</span>). Jesus judgeth no man. The fifth chapter has prepared us for such words as these. Here, as there, they do not exclude all judgment, but all <em> sole</em> judgment (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:16">John 8:16</span>): it is not He that judgeth, but rather the Father who judgeth in Him. Chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:22">John 5:22</span> and this verse are not discordant: between the Father, the ultimate source of judgment, and those who are judged is the Son, to whom the Father hath given authority to do judgment, but who doeth nothing save in and with the Father. The ‘I’ is thus emphatic, equivalent to ‘I by myself’ or ‘I without the Father.’</p>
