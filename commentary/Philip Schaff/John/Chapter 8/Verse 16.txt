John 8:16.  But even if I judge, my judgment is true: because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.  Because in no action is He alone, even if He judges His judgment is true; it is a  real judgment, a judgment corresponding, not to outward appearance, but to the eternal reality of things, because according to the Father’s will. The assertion of this verse, that the Father is ever with Him, corresponds to the words, ‘I know whence I came,’ in John 8:14: the link which binds together all these verses is His constant and perfect knowledge that the Father is with Him and in Him. In this lies the validity of His witness: in this is involved the condemnation of His foes.
