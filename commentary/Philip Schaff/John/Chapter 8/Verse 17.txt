John 8:17.  But in your own law also it is written that the witness of two men is true. In the very law which they magnified, on which they take their stand, as they accuse Him of breaking the law, and declare that all who follow him are ignorant of the law (chap. John 7:49, etc.), this principle is laid down (Deuteronomy 17:6; Deuteronomy 19:15). An emphasis is made to rest on ‘men’ to prepare for the next verse. The words ‘your own law’ have been understood as a proof that Jesus feels that He is not a Jew but without reason. The words flow from the fact that it is His purpose to show that the principle upon which He proceeded was founded in the law which they themselves so highly honoured, and the rules of which they were not entitled to neglect. They thus at once magnify the law and are an  argumentum ad hominem.
