John 8:2.  And at dawn he came again into the temple courts, and all the people came unto him, and he sat down and taught them.  With the return of day Jesus resumed His teaching of the people; and they, on their part, seem to have been powerfully attracted by His words. According to the custom of the time, He sat with His hearers gathered round Him. The custom may be observed in Turkish mosques at the present day. The sitting of Jesus while teaching is not mentioned elsewhere in this Gospel. (Comp. for it, Matthew 5:1; Mark 9:35)
