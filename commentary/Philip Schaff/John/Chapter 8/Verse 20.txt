John 8:20.  These words spake he in the treasury, teaching in the temple-courts: and no man seized him, because his hour was not yet come.  Again His adversaries were overawed: though He was teaching within the precincts of the temple, in the very place of their power, no one laid hands on Him. The Treasury was in the court of the women, the very place in which the rejoicings we have described (see chap. John 7:37) took place. This gives some confirmation to the view we have taken of John 8:12, as referring to the illumination in this court.
