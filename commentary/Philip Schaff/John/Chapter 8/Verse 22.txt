<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:22">John 8:22</span>. <strong> The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go ye cannot come. </strong> Before (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:35">John 7:35</span>) their answer had been, Will He go to Gentiles? The change here shows how much farther the conflict has advanced. Will He go to the realms of the dead, they ask, to that darkest and most dreadful region reserved for those who take their own life, a region where true Israelites cannot come? Their ignorance of themselves is as profound as their ignorance of Jesus. Jesus had made His meaning plain (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:33">John 7:33</span>), but they wilfully blind themselves. Hence only one answer is possible now.</p>
