<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:26">John 8:26</span>. <strong> I</strong> <strong> have many things to speak and to judge concerning you.</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> It is unavailing to speak to them, for they will not believe. Many things has He to speak concerning them, and (since every word regarding them in the condition they had chosen must be one of judgment) to judge also.

<p><strong> Nevertheless he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I speak unto the world.</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> To all that He says they may turn a deaf ear; ‘Nevertheless,’ Jesus adds, ‘He that sent me is true, and the words which I have heard from Him, these and no others do I <em> </em> speak unto the world, the <em> world</em>, to which you belong’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:23">John 8:23</span>). The Jews may disbelieve; His judgment may seem severe; but the words are God’s words, and they are true.
	</p>
<p>This seems the simplest view of this difficult verse; for the prominence which the second clause (‘Nevertheless . . . true’) gives to the thought of truth <strong> </strong> seems to imply that the contrast is with the preceding thought of unbelief (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:24-25">John 8:24-25</span>). Three other explanations are worthy of consideration (i) I have many things . . . but, many as they are, they are true. ( 2 ) I have many things . . . but I will not keep them back, for I faithfully declare the words which ... ( 3 ) I have many things .... but I will not say them now: the things which I have heard from Him that sent me must be first declared. The first of these seems to miss the sharp emphasis of the ‘Nevertheless;’ the second and third to miss (though in different degrees) the force of the middle clause, ‘Nevertheless He that sent me is true.’</p>
