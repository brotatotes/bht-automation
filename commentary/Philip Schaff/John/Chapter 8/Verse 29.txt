<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:29">John 8:29</span>. <strong> And he that sent me is with me: he left me not alone, because I do always the things that are pleasing to him. </strong> The words, ‘I heard’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:26">John 8:26</span>), ‘taught’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:28">John 8:28</span>), point back to the past, laying stress on the Divine commission received: they must not be so understood as to exclude a present fellowship with the Father, ‘He that sent me is with me.’ When He sent the Son, He sent Him not away from Himself, not for a moment did He leave Him alone. The abiding presence of the Father is the consequence and the sign of the Son’s habitual performance of the Father’s will. In all this Jesus is speaking as the Son of man, as the Sent of the Father. It is most interesting to compare the corresponding words of chap. 5 , where the subject throughout is the Son of God. It will be seen how prominent are two thoughts in this chapter, the association of Jesus with the Father who sent Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:16">John 8:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:18">John 8:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:23">John 8:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:26">John 8:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:28-29">John 8:28-29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:38">John 8:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:40">John 8:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:42">John 8:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:47">John 8:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:54-55">John 8:54-55</span>), and the strong moral contrast between Jesus and the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:15">John 8:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:21">John 8:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:23-24">John 8:23-24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:37-38">John 8:37-38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:40">John 8:40</span>, etc <strong> .</strong>). <strong> </strong> The <strong> </strong> observance of this will make clearer the links connecting the several parts.</p>
