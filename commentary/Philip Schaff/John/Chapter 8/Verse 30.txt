John 8:30.    As he spake these things, many believed in him.  We are not told to what class these belonged. The latter part of the chapter shows how completely ‘the Jews’ had hardened themselves: probably therefore these believers mainly belonged to the general body of the hearers, and not (in any large proportion) to ‘the Jews.’ Once more then we have an illustration of that twofold effect of our Lord’s teaching which John so frequently portrays.
