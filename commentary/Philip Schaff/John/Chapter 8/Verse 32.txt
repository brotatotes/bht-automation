<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:32">John 8:32</span>. <strong> And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. </strong> If they shall abide in the word of Jesus, it will be shown that they have begun a true discipleship, and the word in which they abide shall make known to them the truth. So far, there is nothing that these imperfect disciples will not gladly hear. But Jesus read in their hearts a false interpretation of His work and their own needs. He came as Saviour (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:42">John 4:42</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:40">John 5:40</span>), not as Teacher only: in this very chapter He has spoken of faith in Himself as delivering from death in sins (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:24">John 8:24</span>). Here the figure is changed from that of future death to that of present and continued bondage: ‘the truth’ shall be the means of giving freedom. There is no difficulty in these words: such appropriation of the truth found in <strong> </strong> the words of Jesus is but another representation of faith in Him who is the Giver of freedom.</p>
