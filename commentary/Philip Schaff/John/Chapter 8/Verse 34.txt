John 8:34.  Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you. Every one that doeth sin is a slave of sin.  Jesus directs them to a slavery of which they have not thought, slavery to sin. Every one who is living a life of sin is a slave; each act of sin is no mere accident of his life, but a token of its nature, a mark of a bondage in which he is continually held. The word ‘doeth’ is not the same as that which is used in chap. John 3:20, John 5:29 in connection with evil: that had reference to the commission of particular acts, this to the general course of life, when sin  is chosen, ‘Evil be thou my good.’ The thought is best illustrated by Romans 6:0 and (especially) Romans 7:0.
