John 8:37.  I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word maketh no way in you.  Again our Lord takes up their assertion that they are Abraham’s seed. He has answered it by a parable: He speaks now in plainer words, repeating their familiar boast, that He may place in strongest contrast the spirit they had shown themselves to possess. ‘Ye seek to kill me,’ He says, uniting them with the whole body from which a little before they seemed to be severed; for too clearly did He see that the severance was but partial and altogether transient. His word had entered their hearts, and for a moment they had moved towards Him; but it made no way there, its progress was immediately stayed, and they were numbered again with ‘the Jews,’ His foes. Hence the increasing severity of what is immediately to follow.
