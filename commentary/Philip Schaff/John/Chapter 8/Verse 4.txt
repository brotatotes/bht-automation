<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:4">John 8:4</span>. <strong> They say unto him, Teacher, this woman hath been taken committing adultery, in the very act. </strong> Not only was the sin grievous: the point is that there was no possibility of denying it. No process of proof was necessary: there was no need to summon witnesses. We may even well believe that the very countenance of the woman would betray her own consciousness of her shame.
