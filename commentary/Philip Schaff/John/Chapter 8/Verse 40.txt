John 8:40.  But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath spoken to you the truth, which I heard from God:  this did not Abraham.  The assertions of John 8:37-38 are reiterated, but now with a simple directness that cannot be misunderstood (thus Jesus no longer speaks of ‘the Father’ but   of God), and with a distinct expression of the   contrast (‘this did not Abraham’) which in John 8:37 has been merely implied. True kindred to Abraham is therefore impossible in their case.
