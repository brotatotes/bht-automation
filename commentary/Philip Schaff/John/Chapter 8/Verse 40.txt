<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:40">John 8:40</span>. <strong> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath spoken to you the truth, which I heard from God:</strong> <strong> this did not Abraham. </strong> The assertions of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:37-38">John 8:37-38</span> are reiterated, but now with a simple directness that cannot be misunderstood (thus Jesus no longer speaks of ‘the Father’ but <strong> </strong> of God), and with a distinct expression of the <strong> </strong> contrast (‘this did not Abraham’) which in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:37">John 8:37</span> has been merely implied. True kindred to Abraham is therefore impossible in their case.</p>
