<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:42">John 8:42</span>. <strong> Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for from God I came forth, and am here, for also I have not come of myself, but he sent me. </strong> Again Jesus applies the same principle to test their claim. Were they true children of God, then they would love whomsoever God loves. But this they do <strong> </strong> not, for they love not Him who came forth from God and whom God sent. The words in which Jesus speaks of His relation to God are remarkable. Alike in His <em> Incarnation</em>, in His whole <em> manifestation</em> to the world, and in His <em> mission</em>, He sustains <em> the same</em> relation to the Father: all is from and of the Father. This intimate relation implies the love on which the argument is made to rest.</p>
