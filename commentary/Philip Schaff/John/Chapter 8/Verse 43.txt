<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:43">John 8:43</span>. <strong> Why do ye not know my speech? Because ye cannot hear my word. </strong> There is a subtle difference between ‘word’ and ‘speech,’ the former properly referring to substance, the latter to the form. (Thus in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:73">Matthew 26:73</span>, when the same word is used, it is said that Peter’s Galilean ‘speech’ betrayed him.) Did they hear His word, were they really sons of God, they would recognise his speech, and the indications (if we may so speak) contained in it of the speech of that heavenly realm from which He came. But they could not bear to hear His word: what He taught was hateful to them, though it was the truth which He heard from God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:40">John 8:40</span>). This antipathy to the substance of what He said made any recognition of the teaching as bearing on itself manifest tokens of Divine origin impossible.</p>
