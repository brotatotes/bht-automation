John 8:45.  But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.  They loved the lie, because their father was a liar, and his desires it was their will to do. Such was their love for falsehood (even as their father ‘stood not in the truth’), that, because Jesus said the truth, they believed Him not. The word ‘I’ is emphatic, marking again the contrast between them and Him.
