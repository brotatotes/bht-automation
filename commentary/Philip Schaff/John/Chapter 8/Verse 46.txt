John 8:46.  Which of you convicteth me of sin?  No charge of sin could any one of them bring home to Him, no responsive consciousness of sin could any one awaken in His breast. These words are implicitly an assertion of His perfect sinlessness; and His enemies are silent.
	 If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?  Their knowledge of His sinless life took from them all pretext for their disbelief. We know that His words brought their own evidence to those who loved the truth. The true answer to this question then must be that they loved falsehood. But this answer they would never give. The tone of this verse clearly shows that what has been said of their father the devil related not to necessity of nature, but to deliberate choice (see note on John 8:23), for such an   appeal was   intended, and would be understood, to imply condemnation of those who thus wilfully refused to believe. The same thought is present in the following verse.
