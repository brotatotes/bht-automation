John 8:47.  He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear not, because ye are not of God.  As in John 8:43,   the word  hear   has the meaning  listen to, so that the thought of receiving and believing is implied. He that is of God, and he alone, thus listens to the words of God: recognising their origin, willing to receive their teaching, he takes them into his heart.
