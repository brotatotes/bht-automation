<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:47">John 8:47</span>. <strong> He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear not, because ye are not of God. </strong> As in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:43">John 8:43</span>, <strong> </strong> the word <em> hear</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> has the meaning <em> listen to</em>, so that the thought of receiving and believing is implied. He that is of God, and he alone, thus listens to the words of God: recognising their origin, willing to receive their teaching, he takes them into his heart.</p>
