<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:49">John 8:49</span>. <strong> Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. </strong> His answer is <strong> a </strong> simple denial of the graver accusation of the two, and also such an assertion regarding His thought and purpose as was equivalent to a denial of all such charges. He honours His Father, even in the very words which had seemed to them an insult to God Himself. ‘It is ye,’ He adds, ‘that are dishonouring me:’ it is not I who (like Samaritans) dishonour you.</p>
