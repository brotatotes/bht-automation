John 8:50.  But  I  seek not my glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.  He will not protest against the dishonour they offer Him: His cause is in the Fatherâ€™s hand. That glory which He seeks not for Himself, the Father seeks to give Him. The Father is deciding, and will decide between His enemies and Himself.
