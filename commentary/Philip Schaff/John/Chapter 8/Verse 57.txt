John 8:57.  The Jews therefore said unto him. Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?  The Jews understand ‘my day’ to mean the time of His life; and His knowing that Abraham has witnessed this with joy must certainly imply that He has seen Abraham. How can this be, since He is not yet fifty years of age? It seems most probable that ‘fifty’ is chosen as  a  round number, as a number certainly beyond that of our Lord’s years of life. Some have supposed from this verse that sorrow had given to Him the appearance of premature age.
