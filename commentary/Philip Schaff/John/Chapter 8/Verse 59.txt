John 8:59.  They took up stones therefore that they might cast them upon him; but Jesus hid himself, and went forth from the temple-courts. The Jews were enraged at what they considered blasphemy, and in their rage they would have stoned Him (compare chap. John 10:31). But His hour was not yet come. He hid Himself (whether miraculously or not we cannot tell) and went forth from the temple.
