<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:54-55">John 8:54-55</span> a <strong> .</strong> <strong> Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom ye say that he is your God, and have not got knowledge of him.</strong> First, Jesus answers the direct question, ‘Whom makest Thou Thyself?’ and the general charge of self-exaltation which those words contain. The specific reference to Abraham He speaks of afterwards (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:56">John 8:56</span>). The tenor of His reply resembles that of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:50">John 8:50</span>; but, as elsewhere, the second statement has the greater force and clearness. The reality of the glory of Jesus consists in this, that it comes from His Father, whom they called their God, but of whom they had gained no knowledge.

<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:55">John 8:55</span> b <em> .</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> <strong> But I know him</strong> <em> ; </em> <strong> and if I should say. I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.</strong> Jesus can say, ‘I know God,’ by direct, intuitive, perfect knowledge. The word which He uses in reference to Himself (‘I know’) is different from that used in the preceding clause, this latter (‘ye have got knowledge’) referring to the result of experience, to knowledge gained by many acts of perception. Were Jesus to deny His immediate knowledge, He would be as false as they have been in professing to know God. The last words are interesting as bringing out once more the truth which we have seen presented in earlier verses: His own work in the execution of the Father’s will is the model of the work which He requires from man. His people ‘keep His word’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:51">John 8:51</span>): He Himself keeps the Father’s word. So, in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:21">John 20:21</span>, He says to the apostles, ‘As my Father hath sent me, I also send you.’</p>
