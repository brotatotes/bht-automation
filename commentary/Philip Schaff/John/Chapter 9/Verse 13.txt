John 9:13.  They bring to the Pharisees him that once was blind.  They bring him to the Pharisees as   the especial guardians of the religious institutions of Israel. It is not at all likely that the man was   brought before any formal court or assembly, but only before leading men amongst the Pharisees, who would at all times be ready to examine into such a charge as is implied in the next clause. The less formal and judicial their action was, the better does it illustrate the conflict of Jesus with the  spirit of Judaism.
