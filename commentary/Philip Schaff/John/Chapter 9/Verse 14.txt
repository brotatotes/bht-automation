<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:14">John 9:14</span>. <strong> Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. </strong> It is very interesting to compare this verse with the similar words in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:9-10">John 5:9-10</span>. The only offence expressly mentioned there was the carrying of the bed, though there is no doubt that the charge against Jesus related not to this only but also to the performance of the cure (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:22">John 7:22</span>). Here the two counts of the accusation are distinctly presented in their separation from each other, ( 1 ) Jesus had made the clay; ( 2 ) He had opened the man’s eyes. Another verse of the fifth chapter is likewise necessarily recalled to mind: speaking of the charge of labouring on the sabbath, Jesus said (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:17">John 9:17</span>), ‘My Father worketh until now: I also work.’ So here in reference to the same day He says, ‘We must work the works of Him that sent me.’</p>
