John 9:16.  Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.  The man’s answer had been short and simple, but it   had substantiated the two charges (see John 9:14) that   had been brought. The testimony produced the effect   which usually followed whenever Jesus manifested Himself, some were attracted, some repelled. Godet remarks here, with peculiar force and propriety, ‘The one party, taking as their starting-point the inviolability of the sabbatic law, deny to Jesus as a   transgressor of this law any divine mission whatever; and from this logically follows the denial of   the miracle. The others, setting out   from the fact   of the miracle, infer the holy character of Jesus, and implicitly deny the breaking of the sabbath. The choice of premiss depends in this case, as   in all cases, upon the moral freedom; it   is at   this point of departure that the friends of light and the friends of darkness separate; the rest is simply a matter of logic.’
