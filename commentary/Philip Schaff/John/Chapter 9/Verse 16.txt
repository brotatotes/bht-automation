<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:16">John 9:16</span>. <strong> Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them. </strong> The man’s answer had been short and simple, but it <strong> </strong> had substantiated the two charges (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:14">John 9:14</span>) that <strong> </strong> had been brought. The testimony produced the effect <strong> </strong> which usually followed whenever Jesus manifested Himself, some were attracted, some repelled. Godet remarks here, with peculiar force and propriety, ‘The one party, taking as their starting-point the inviolability of the sabbatic law, deny to Jesus as a <strong> </strong> transgressor of this law any divine mission whatever; and from this logically follows the denial of <strong> </strong> the miracle. The others, setting out <strong> </strong> from the fact <strong> </strong> of the miracle, infer the holy character of Jesus, and implicitly deny the breaking of the sabbath. The choice of premiss depends in this case, as <strong> </strong> in all cases, upon the moral freedom; it <strong> </strong> is at <strong> </strong> this point of departure that the friends of light and the friends of darkness separate; the rest is simply a matter of logic.’</p>
