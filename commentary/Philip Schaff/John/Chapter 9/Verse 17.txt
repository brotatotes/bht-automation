John 9:17.  They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, because he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.  The fact is admitted, perhaps honestly, for it will be observed that, when we come to the next verse, we have a   new set of questioners, and not simply persons who, having made a   concession in the words before us, immediately withdraw it. The word ‘thou’ is emphatic: unable to decide the matter themselves, they seek to draw from the blind man some statement which may enable them more effectually to condemn Jesus. But his answer only deals an unexpected blow.
