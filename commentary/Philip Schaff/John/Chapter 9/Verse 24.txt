This appears first in their <strong> </strong> words, ‘Give glory to God’ (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jos+7:19">Joshua 7:19</span>), a formula used when a criminal who was thought to be concealing the truth was urged to make a full confession. Remembering that the eye of God was upon him, let him give honour to God by speaking truth. Another significant point is the emphasis laid on ‘ <em> we</em> know;’ the authorities to whom he has been wont <strong> </strong> to yield implicit respect and deference in all <strong> </strong> religious matters, possessed of deeper insight and wider <strong> </strong> knowledge than himself, (do not <em> think</em> merely <strong> , </strong> but) <em> know</em> that Jesus is a breaker of the law, <strong> </strong> and therefore cannot have wrought a miracle.</p>
