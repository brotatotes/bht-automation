John 9:24.  They called therefore a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.  In this second hearing the   aim of the   Jews is to overawe the man, and then force from him a confession that there had been   some deception or mistake. This appears first in their   words, ‘Give glory to God’ (see Joshua 7:19), a formula used when a criminal who was thought to be concealing the truth was urged to make a full confession. Remembering that the eye of God was upon him, let him give honour to God by speaking truth. Another significant point is the emphasis laid on ‘  we know;’ the authorities to whom he has been wont   to yield implicit respect and deference in all   religious matters, possessed of deeper insight and wider   knowledge than himself, (do not  think merely  ,  but)  know that Jesus is a breaker of the law,   and therefore cannot have wrought a miracle.
