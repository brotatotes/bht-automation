<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:27">John 9:27</span>. <strong> He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples? </strong> The words ‘ye did not hear’ manifestly mean that they had not received and believed what they heard. The last clause is a little ambiguous in English. The meaning is not, Would ye in that case become His disciples? but, Is it your mind, do ye also desire, to become His disciples? ‘Ye also’ <em> may</em> mean ‘ye as <strong> </strong> well as others;’ but it most naturally signifies ‘as well as <em> myself,’ </em> the blind beggar. The obstinate enmity of <strong> </strong> the Jews impels him to <strong> </strong> avow his own discipleship.</p>
