John 9:29.    We know that God hath spoken unto Moses; but as for this man we know not from  whence he is. In holding by the law of Moses, then, they are safe and are assured that they are doing the will of God. If  they do not know the origin of ‘this man,’ he can be worthy of no regard, certainly he cannot be from God!
