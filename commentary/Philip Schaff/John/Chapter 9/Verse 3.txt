<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:3">John 9:3</span>. <strong> Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</strong> It is obvious at once that Jesus does not deny the presence of sin in the man himself or in his parents: His words must be read in close connection with the question to which they form a reply. The meaning of the whole verse (which is unusually elliptical) may be given thus: ‘Neither did this man sin nor his parents that he should be born blind, but (he was born blind, he is as he is) that the works of God may be manifested in him.’ Not to suggest or unravel speculative questions, but to present a sphere for the manifestation of the works of God, hath this man borne this infirmity. The last clause of the verse does not simply mean that a miracle is to be wrought on him: ‘ <em> in</em> him’ alike in his physical (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:6-7">John 9:6-7</span>) and in his spiritual healing (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:36-38">John 9:36-38</span>) the love and grace of God are to be made manifest.</p>
