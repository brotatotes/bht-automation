<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:34">John 9:34</span>. <strong> They answered and said unto him, thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they put him out. </strong> The original is very <strong> </strong> graphic: In sins wast <em> thou</em> born, all of thee, and <em> thou</em> <strong><em> ,</em></strong> dost thou teach us? There is probably a distinct reference to the belief which is expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:2">John 9:2</span>: the fact that in their passion they are thus acknowledging the reality of the miracle is no argument <strong> </strong> against such a reference: the manâ€™s whole condition, as evinced by his spirit and his words, bears yet stronger testimony than his blindness, and shows that he was <em> altogether</em> born in sins. The meaning of the last clause is not quite clear. It probably refers to ejection from the place in which the inquiry was held; but the next verse seems to prove that excommunication followed this. Cast out by the rulers from their place of meeting, he was cast out from all intercourse with them, and (so far as their influence extended) from the community over which they ruled. Such was the only reasoning which could be opposed to the triumphant argument of the man born blind!</p>
