John 9:36.  He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?  These are not words of a doubter, but of one who seeks to be led to a complete faith. In Jesus he has fullest confidence, and he waits only to hear His declaration respecting the ‘Son of man:’ as such Jesus has not yet manifested Himself to him.
