John 9:37.  Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaketh with thee is he.  This manifestation is now given; both in word (‘he that speaketh’ . .) and in the half-veiled, yet clear, reference to the work that had been wrought on him (‘thou hast  seen Him’) in the gift of physical (and we may certainly add spiritual) eyesight.
