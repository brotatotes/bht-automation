<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:40">John 9:40</span>. <strong> Those of the Pharisees which were with him heard these things. </strong> The whole cast of the language here used shows that those who speak are not representatives of the Pharisees as a body, or of the Pharisaic spirit in its worst cha racteristics. But lately there has been a division of feeling among the Pharisees in regard to Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:16">John 9:16</span>). Some who were then impressed by His signs may have already become disciples; others may have remained in a state of uncertainty, impressed but not convinced, not brought to the point of ‘leaving all’ their possessions of ‘wisdom and prudence’ and following Him. It may be that those spoken of here were of such a description. No one, probably, who duly apprehends the difference in the usage of John between ‘the Pharisees’ and ‘the Jews,’ will think that necessarily these words were uttered in derision, or that these men were ‘with Him’ as enemies and spies. And said unto him, Are we blind also? There had been an apparent difficulty in the words of Jesus. They spoke of two classes, distinguished in their character as not seeing and seeing, in their future lot, as receiving sight and becoming blind. The future lot <strong> </strong> is the result of the coming of Jesus into this <strong> </strong> world, It is <strong> </strong> very clear that He means that those who see not (like the despised blind man who has just been ‘put out’) will come to Him and obtain sight from Him. But what of the Pharisees whom He invites to come? Does He class them also amongst those who ‘see not’? Surely (they think) this cannot be His meaning? And yet, if not, Pharisees are excluded from all hope of blessing, for His words speak of but two classes.
