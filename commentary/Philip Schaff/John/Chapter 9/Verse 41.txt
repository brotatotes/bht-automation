<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:41">John 9:41</span>. <strong> Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would not have sin: but now ye say, We see; your sin abideth. </strong> If, Jesus says, ye were really blind, unable to open your eyes to, and indeed unconscious of, the existence of the light now shining round you, you would not have sin, the sin of rejection of the light would not lie at your door. But it is not so. They are their own judges. They themselves say, We see; and yet they come not to Him. Their sin abideth; they are guilty of that sin, and so long as they refuse to come to Him the sin must abide. So <strong> </strong> at the close of chap. 3 we read: ‘he that disobeyeth the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God <strong> </strong> <em> abideth</em> on him.’
