<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:5">John 9:5</span>. <strong> Whensoever I am in the world,</strong> <strong> I am the light of the world. </strong> The work of Jesus in the world is to be the world’s light. This thought, expressed in words in the last chapter (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>), and in this by deeds, binds together the different portions in this section of the Gospel. ‘I am the light,’ Jesus says, but even in this figure the ‘we’ of the last verse may be remembered, for his disciples also ‘are the light of the world’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:14">Matthew 5:14</span>). The first word of the verse is worthy of all attention, pointing as it does to all periods at which ‘the light’ hath shined amid the darkness of this world (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:5">John 1:5</span>).</p>
