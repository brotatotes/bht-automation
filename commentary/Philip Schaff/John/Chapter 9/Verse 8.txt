John 9:8.  The neighbours therefore, and they which beheld him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?  The fact that he was a beggar has not been mentioned before. Stress is laid on it here rather than on his blindness, because it was from his frequenting the spot for the purpose of begging that he had become well known.
