We know that God heareth not sinners; but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth. Since the world began was it not heard that any one opened the eyes of a man that was born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing. </strong> Herein lies the very marvel, that even <em> ye</em>, ( 1 ) knowing that no man ever receives power to do any miracle unless he be a worshipper of God and one that does His will; and ( 2 ) having proof that this man has done a miracle yes, and such a miracle a <strong> s </strong> has never before been wrought <strong> </strong> will not see the conclusion that must follow, viz., that this man does the will of God, that he is no sinner, but <strong> </strong> comes from God (see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:16">John 9:16</span>). The man has assumed the office of a teacher, and has so taught that they have no counter argument to offer; ‘the wise are taken in their own craftiness’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="job+5:13">Job 5:13</span>).
