John 9:30-33.  The man answered, and said unto them, why, herein is the marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he opened mine eyes. We know that God heareth not sinners; but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth. Since the world began was it not heard that any one opened the eyes of a man that was born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.  Herein lies the very marvel, that even  ye, ( 1 ) knowing that no man ever receives power to do any miracle unless he be a worshipper of God and one that does His will; and ( 2 ) having proof that this man has done a miracle yes, and such a miracle a  s  has never before been wrought   will not see the conclusion that must follow, viz., that this man does the will of God, that he is no sinner, but   comes from God (see the note on John 9:16). The man has assumed the office of a teacher, and has so taught that they have no counter argument to offer; ‘the wise are taken in their own craftiness’ (Job 5:13).
