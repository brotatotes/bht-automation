Jude 1:10.  But these, who ‘defile the flesh,’ as they ‘rail at dignities’ (Jude 1:8),  at whatever they know not  the whole range of invisible and heavenly things, and even the nobler sentiments of our nature  they rail; and  whatever they know naturally as brute beasts (‘irrational animals’), their instincts and propensities, even these they abuse, for they surrender themselves to them, and in these  destroy (or  corrupt)  themselves; and so they are worse than brutes. ‘As drunk as a beast’ is, in truth, a libel on the lower creation. Drunkenness and like abuses of natural appetite are sins of man only. The two verbs used in this verse, ‘know’ and ‘know,’ are different, but it is not easy to express the distinction between them.  What they know not  admits some knowledge, though it denies the accuracy and the completeness of it:  what they know  describes such knowledge as thought and use of faculty may give; though from the added word ‘naturally,’ it is clear that the knowledge is largely of a sensual kind.
