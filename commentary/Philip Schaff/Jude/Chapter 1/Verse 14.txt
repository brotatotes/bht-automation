Jude 1:14. Nor is this warning the warning of Jude only.  And to these also (literally, with respect to these also)  prophesied Enoch the seventh from Adam,  i.e  the seventh including Adam; a description added probably to mark his importance by the coincidence of the sacred number seven. To   Adam was given the promise of the advent of our Lord as Helper and Saviour; to Enoch, the first promise of the advent of the same Lord as Judge. Jewish writers are ever noting the recurrence of this number. Moses was the seventh from Abraham, Phinehas from Jacob, etc.
	 The Lord cometh (  Greek,  came or as come; describing, as not unfrequently, an occurrence in the midst of which the prophet sees himself standing)  with (surrounded by)  ten thousands of his holy ones (literally His holy myriads, the ‘innumerable company’ of Hebrews 12:22; ‘saints’ restricts the meaning to saved men).
