<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:2">Jude 1:2</span>. <strong> Mercy unto you, and peace, and love. </strong> ‘Mercy’ is used in the salutation of the pastoral epistles only except here. In Paul’s view, those who minister in holy things specially need it, as in Jude’s view do those whom he addresses. ‘Mercy’ is God’s feeling towards them; ‘peace’ is their condition as the result of it; ‘love’ is either their feeling Godward and manward <strong> </strong> as the effect of God’s grace (so it is in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:23">Ephesians 6:23</span>), or it is God’s love to them that are called, in the manifold expressions of it (so it is in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:21">Jude 1:21</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span>). This last view seems preferable; it is for the fulness of love he prays, as it is for abundance of mercy and peace.
