<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:8">Jude 1:8</span>. <strong> And yet these men</strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:4">Jude 1:4</span>) actually do the same things as the people of Sodom and the fallen angels.

<p><strong> in their dreamings they defile the flesh</strong>, that of others as well as their own; they live in the feelings of their own perverted sense, and they corrupt others as well as themselves (others sharing in their sin); <strong> and they set at nought</strong> lordship, ownership, <strong> dominion</strong> (the supremacy that belongs to one who is lord), <strong> and rail at dignities</strong> ( <em> Greek</em>, glories the splendour that belongs to those who are exalted). The statement may be general, or it may refer to Christ and to the authority of His kingdom. In favour of the former view is the fact noted by many moralists that licentiousness is closely connected with contempt for all authority: no other vice, indeed, so easily demoralizes the entire nature. The second view is more in harmony with the context. Some refer the ‘dignities’ here spoken of to evil angels, under whose power these teachers had fallen, and whom nevertheless they mocked as powerless, or even as imaginary beings, and they appeal in proof to the next verse. But the connection of the two verses is of another kind. We are not to rail at even Satan, nor at earthly princes or dignities, though they be his instruments: he and they are to be left in God’s hands.
