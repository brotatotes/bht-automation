Michael (‘who is like God’) was regarded as the guardian angel of the nation of Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1">Daniel 12:1</span>; cp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="da+10:13">Daniel 10:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="da+10:21">Daniel 10:21</span>).

<p><strong> about the body of Moses.</strong> The Jews had various traditions about the burial of Moses. According to Jonathan (on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+34:6">Deuteronomy 34:6</span>), the grave of Moses was given to the special care of Michael; and to this tradition most commentators ascribe the introduction of the circumstance here. Others suppose that Christ Himself, in connection with the appearance of Moses at the Transfiguration, may have sanctioned the tradition. Nothing is said of it in the Book of Enoch. . . . Origen speaks of a book extant in his day (the <em> Assumption or Removal of Moses</em>) as the source whence Jude derived his account; but there is no evidence that the book was in existence when Jude wrote. The most probable explanation is that there was a Jewish tradition to which Jude appeals.

<p><strong> when contending he disputed</strong> shows that it was verbal altercation not unlike that recorded in the case of Job (chap. 1) and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:1-3">Zechariah 3:1-3</span>. The solution that God revealed these facts to Jude is of course possible, but it is not likely. That the facts should be previously known is of the very essence of the argument.
