<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:13">Luke 1:13</span>. <strong> For thy prayer is heard</strong>. The doubt of Zacharias (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:18">Luke 1:18</span>) indicates that he had ceased to pray for a son. The prayer was doubtless a Messianic one, even if he still cherished some hope of a son in his old age. The answer includes both the public and private blessing. The Messiah will appear in his days, and the forerunner promised of old (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:0">Malachi 4:0</span>) shall be his son.
