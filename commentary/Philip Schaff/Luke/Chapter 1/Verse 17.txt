Luke 1:17.  Before him in his presence.  ‘Go before’ implies the coming of the Messiah, but ‘in his presence’ refers to ‘the Lord their God.’
	 In the spirit and power of Elijah. An evident allusion to Malachi 3:1; Malachi 4:5-6. See on Matthew 11:14; Matthew 17:11.
	 To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children.  Parental affection had grown cold amidst the moral corruption; the reformer would strengthen these ties. This is better than the explanation: ‘to restore to the children the devout disposition of their fathers.’ True reformation strengthens family ties. This is the principle, prophesied by the last Old Testament prophet, announced by an angel in the first ray of light ushering in the New Dispensation, fulfilled in John’s ministry, in the whole history of Christianity. Whatever weakens family ties cannot be ‘reform.’

	 To the wisdom of the just. Lit, ‘in the wisdom.’ This is the sphere in which the results will occur: some take ‘in’ as meaning ‘by,’ but this is less usual.
	 To make ready for the Lord,  i.e., for God. A preparation for the coming of the Messiah is undoubtedly meant, but the thought of God’s appearing when the Messiah appeared underlies the prediction.
	 A prepared people.  Not the people of Israel, but a people prepared out of Israel.
