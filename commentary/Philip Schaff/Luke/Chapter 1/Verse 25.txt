Luke 1:25.  Thus  hath the Lord, etc. This suggests the reason she hid herself. Since God had graciously removed her barrenness, she would leave it to Him to make this mercy manifest to others, and thus to take away her reproach among men. But she doubtless thus sought greater opportunity for devotion. The connection between her retirement and John’s solitary life cannot be altogether overlooked. The views that she hid herself from shame, or to avoid defilement, or as a measure of bodily precaution, or to wait until it was certain, or from unbelief, are incorrect. In comparing this story with the similar one of Abraham and Sarah, we must emphasize the  difference. In the O. T. narrative, it is the man who is strong in faith, the woman who is weak; here the reverse is true. In the case of Mary this becomes still more prominent. The blessing on women, especially as mothers, appears thus early in the story of the ‘seed of the woman.’ (Comp. Genesis 3:15.)
