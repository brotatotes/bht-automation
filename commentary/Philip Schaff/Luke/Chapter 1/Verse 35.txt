<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:35">Luke 1:35</span>. <strong> Holy Ghost,</strong> the Third Person of the Trinity. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:18">Matthew 1:18</span>.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The power of the Most High.</strong> The Holy Spirit is here represented as ‘power,’ not strictly ‘the power’ (as if He were not a Person, but merely the power of God). Some distinguish between the two expressions, but they explain each other; the Holy Spirit is the creative power of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:2">Genesis 1:2</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Overshadow thee.</strong> The figure is probably taken from a cloud. The two clauses represent, the latter figuratively, the former without a figure, ‘the supernatural operation of the Holy Spirit, in bringing to pass that which ordinarily occurs only through conjugal intercourse.’ ‘No more is here to be attributed to the Spirit, than what is necessary to cause the Virgin to perform the actions of a mother’ (Pearson).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Therefore also</strong>. For this reason, but not for this one only, as ‘also’ indicates. The words ‘of thee,’ are to be rejected.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> That holy thing which is begotten</strong>. The reference is to the unborn babe, which when born, <strong> shall be called the Son of God.</strong> Others translate the passage: ‘That which is to be born (or, is begotten) shall be called holy, the Son of God.’ But the son of Mary was to be called ‘Son of God,’ not because holy, but because begotten by the power of the Most High. This <em> proves</em> the right to the title, but the right itself rests on higher grounds, as is hinted by the word ‘also.’ Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1-14">John 1:1-14</span>. Although the creative Holy Spirit is here introduced, the Holy Spirit is never spoken of as begetting the Son, or as His Father. The early Church engaged in exhaustive discussions on these points. The result is a statement in the Nicene Creed, as clear as the mysterious nature of the subject allows.
