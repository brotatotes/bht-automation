Luke 1:39.  In    these days. Mary returned after three months (Luke 1:56), yet  before the birth of John (Luke 1:57). Her visit must therefore have been less than a month after the Annunciation.

The more usual form in the New Testament is ‘Judea,’ but in Matthew 2:6, the same word occurs twice with the same meaning in a quotation from the Old Testament (comp. Joshua 21:11), where ‘the hill-country of Judah’ is spoken of. Hence the possibility that this is translated from some Hebrew document. Jerusalem is not meant, for that was  the city, and Zacharias did not live at Jerusalem (Luke 1:23; Luke 1:65). Most think it was Hebron, which was given to the sons of Aaron in the hill-country of Judah (Joshua 19:11), but this cannot certainly be inferred. Thomson  (Land and Book) accepts ’Ain Karim, the traditional birth-place of John the Baptist. (See cut.) The view that the name of the place is here given, namely, ‘Juttah’ (Joshua 21:16), is a conjecture to which there are positive objections.
