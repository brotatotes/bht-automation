Luke 1:4.  Know, as the result of acquaintance with the accurate account now sent him.
	 The certainty. The emphatic word; certainty as the result of positive, accurate statements of truth. From faith to knowledge, from knowledge to still firmer faith.
	 Concerning the things, Greek ‘words,’ i.e.  , the statements of living, divine-human  facts of salvation which centre in the Person of Christ. Christianity is a religion that is  everlasting, for facts cannot be altered;  universal, for facts appeal to all;  mighty, for facts are stronger than arguments.
	 Wherein thou wast instructed. Theophilus had been regularly instructed in regard to the main truths of Christianity. The history of our Lord formed the basis of this instruction, but the Epistles of Paul, some of which were written before this Gospel, show that the meaning of the facts was plainly taught Christian instruction is religious, not purely historical. Our word ‘catechise’ is derived from the term here used.
