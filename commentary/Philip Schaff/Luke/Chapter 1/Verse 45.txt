<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:45">Luke 1:45</span>. <strong> For there shall be</strong>, or, ‘believed that there shall be,’ etc. The former rendering introduces an encouragement for Mary’s faith, tells of the blessing of entire fulfilment which will be given to her faith, an idea in keeping with these first dawnings of the New Dispensation. The latter refers more to the promise as already fulfilled. Elisabeth, without hearing Mary’s story, knows of the angelic message. ‘Elizabeth, while extolling the blessedness of Mary on account of her faith and obedience, was undoubtedly reflecting with compassion on the condition of Zacharias, whose unbelief had been reproved with loss of speech, while the believing Mary was entering her house with joyful salutations.’ Van Ooster-zee.
