The <em> eighth</em> of the twenty-four classes, into which the descendants of Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron, were divided (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ch+24:0">1 Chronicles 24:0</span>). Each of these ministered in the temple for one week, from the days of Solomon until the destruction of the first temple, and from the restoration of the courses by Judas Maccabæus until the final destruction of Jerusalem by Titus. In the latter period the names and order of the courses were preserved, but not the descent. At the destruction of the temple by the Romans, the course in waiting was that of Jehoiarib (the <em> first),</em> and date was the 9 th day of the Jewish month <em> Ab.</em> But these data do not determine the ‘date of the occurrence before us, since each course must serve at least twice in a year, and ‘after those days’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:24">Luke 1:24</span>) is indefinite.
