<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:6">Luke 1:6</span>. <strong> Righteous before God.</strong> Not outwardly, but really, pious.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Commandments and ordinances. </strong> The former probably refers to special commandments, the latter, as its derivation hints, to that by which God defines what is ‘righteous’ for men.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Blameless</strong>. The full sense may be thus expressed: ‘walking,’ etc. so that they were ‘blameless.’ They were ‘saints’ after the Old Testament pattern. The promise made to Abraham (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:18">Genesis 22:18</span>) was about to be fulfilled, and the first revelation was made to one of the Abrahamic character.
