Luke 1:6.  Righteous before God. Not outwardly, but really, pious.
	 Commandments and ordinances.  The former probably refers to special commandments, the latter, as its derivation hints, to that by which God defines what is ‘righteous’ for men.
	 Blameless. The full sense may be thus expressed: ‘walking,’ etc. so that they were ‘blameless.’ They were ‘saints’ after the Old Testament pattern. The promise made to Abraham (Genesis 22:18) was about to be fulfilled, and the first revelation was made to one of the Abrahamic character.
