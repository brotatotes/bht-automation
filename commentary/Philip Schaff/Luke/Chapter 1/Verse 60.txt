<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:60">Luke 1:60</span>. <strong> Not so</strong> <em> ; </em> <strong> but he shall be called John</strong>. Elisabeth may have been informed by Zacharias of the appointed name of the child. But possibly the name had been revealed to her also: ( 1 ) if she had known beforehand what the name should be, she would have told of it <em> before</em> the name Zacharias was formally suggested; ( 2 ) the wonder mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:63">Luke 1:63</span> seems to have arisen from the agreement of the parents on this point; <em> </em> which implies no previous communication between them on the subject.
