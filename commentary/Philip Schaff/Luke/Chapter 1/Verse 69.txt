Luke 1:69.  A horn of salvation for us. This well-known figure of the Old Testament (1 Samuel 2:10; Psalms 132:17), alluding to the horns of beasts as their formidable weapon of defence, points out here a strong, powerful defender, to rise  in the house of his servant David. An allusion to the horns of the altar is unlikely.
	 Luke 1:70 is parenthetical.
	 By the month of his holy prophets.  The same thought which was expressed by Mary (Luke 1:55). They believed that God had made special promises respecting the coming of Christ (Messianic prophecies), that this application of prophecy was not something added to their meaning, but their real meaning. Of old. This is more literal and more correct than the E. V. The expression implies that the promise of the Messiah was from ‘the beginning.’
