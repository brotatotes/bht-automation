Luke 1:71.  Salvation from our enemies. The word ‘salvation ‘is taken up again from Luke 1:69, the intervening verse being parenthetical (like the first clause of Luke 1:55, which expresses the same thought). That political deliverance was in the mind of Zacharias cannot be doubted, but certainly not that alone. ‘But he chiefly prizes this political liberation as the means to a higher end, the reformation of Divine worship; Luke 1:74-75.’ Van Oosterzee.
