<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:77">Luke 1:77</span>. <strong> Knowledge of salvation</strong>. This was the end of the preparation just spoken of.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> In</strong> <strong> the remission of their sins</strong>. The main idea is not that salvation consists in remission of sins, but the whole verse means: that they might know that Messianic salvation comes in and through the remission of their sins. John led to this knowledge by his preaching of repentance, awakening the consciousness of sin, and of needed remission.</p>
