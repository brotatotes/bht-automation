This PREFACE   is a model of brevity, simplicity, and modesty, as well as of purity and dignity of style. It does not contain expressions of Hebrew origin, and, like most prefaces, it is formal and highly finished. It differs from the Introduction to the Gospel of John (John 1:1-5), which is more doctrinal, each preface being strictly characteristic of the Gospel which follows. Luke, who depicts most fully the Son of Man, appearing indeed in Israel, but for the benefit of the whole race of man, brings out here the  human side in the origin of the sacred writings. This preface claims truthfulness for the narrative which follows,  on the ground of the author ’  s patient investigation (Luke 1:3), and presents itself as a  certain foundation (Luke 1:4) for faith in the facts of the Saviour’s birth, life, death, and resurrection.
