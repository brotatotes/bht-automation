<p>ON THE HARMONY with the account in Matthew. Views: 1 . That the events recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:18-25">Matthew 1:18-25</span> took place before the visit to Elisabeth. It is urged that a betrothed virgin would not be permitted to travel alone. Objections: This restriction is doubtful; ‘with haste’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:39">Luke 1:39</span>) gives no time for so many intervening events; had Joseph been already convinced, the journey would have been unnecessary, since the purpose of it was to receive the confirmation pointed out by the angel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:36">Luke 1:36</span>). 2 . That the discovery was made before (perhaps by Mary’s own statement), and the revelation to Joseph after this visit. Objections: It is unlikely that he would be left in doubt so long; his state of mind was such (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:19">Matthew 1:19</span>) that while he would not have driven her away, he would scarcely have permitted her to go, had he known of her condition. 3 . That the discovery and revelation took place after the visit. This is open to no serious objection. The discovery must have taken place shortly after her return, and it is probable she then told of the angelic visit Joseph’s state of perplexity, cleared up by special revelation, was the result. Matthew distinctly asserts the conception by the Holy Ghost, of which Luke speaks with more detail.
