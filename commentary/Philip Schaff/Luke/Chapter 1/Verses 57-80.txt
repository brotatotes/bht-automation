The fulfilment of the angelic promise to Zacharias in the birth of John, the obedience of the parents in calling the child by the appointed name, and the removal of the dumbness of Zacharias at the time specified (Luke 1:20), with his prophetic yet priestly song of thanks-giving. On the  Benedictus (as it is called from the first word in the Latin version), see Luke 1:67. Luke 1:80 sums up the story of Johnâ€™s youth, giving a formal conclusion to this part of the narrative (comp. chap. Luke 2:40; Luke 2:52, where similar conclusions are found).
