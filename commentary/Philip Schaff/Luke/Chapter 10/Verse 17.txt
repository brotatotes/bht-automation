Luke 10:17. THE RETURN OF THE SEVENTY.  Returned with joy.  They were probably not absent long. It is unlikely, though not impossible, that they all returned at the same time and place, unless a time and place of rendezvous had been previously appointed. The Evangelist gives a summary account. How much of permanent good they accomplished we are not told, but in labors of healing they must have had great success; hence their ‘joy,’ and their language:  Even the demons are subject to us in thy name.  This power had not been expressly given to them, as to the Twelve (chap. Luke 9:1), and they rejoice that their success exceeded the promise. Other successes are only implied; this point is brought prominently forward by the Evangelist.
