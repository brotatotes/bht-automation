Luke 10:20.  Rejoice not in this.  This is an absolute prohibition of rejoicing  solely  in the power spoken of. The power is great, and joy in such delegated power is  dangerous,  may be joined with pride and self-seeking. Besides the power over evil is a negative blessing, and does not furnish so proper a ground of joy as the positive blessings of God’s infinite mercy and goodness.
	 But rejoice.  Here there is no such danger.
	 That your names are written in heaven.  The figure is not uncommon in the Scriptures (Exodus 32:32-33; Malachi 3:16; Revelation 3:5, etc.). The common reading points to a single past act: ‘were written;’ but the better established one refers to the continued place which these names have in the book of life: ‘have been and are written.’ God’s spiritual blessing is personal and permanent. The ground of the commanded joy is not our power, delegated as it is, but God’s mercy and love in Christ He will rejoice most, and most properly, who finds the sole ground there.
