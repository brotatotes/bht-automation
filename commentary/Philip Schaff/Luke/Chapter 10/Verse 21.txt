Our Lord probably uttered these weighty words on both occasions. In Matthew, moreover, they form a <em> confession, </em> here a ground of rejoicing in connection with the triumph of the ‘babes.’ The language reminds us of the profound passages in the Gospel of John. The important truth respecting our Lord’s relation to the Father, here set forth, underlies <em> all </em> the Gospels.
