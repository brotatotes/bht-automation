<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:22">Luke 10:22</span>. Some older manuscripts and versions insert: ‘And turning to the disciples He said’ This would give what follows the character of a direct address. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:23">Luke 10:23</span> the same form occurs, but ‘privately’ is added. The statements of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21-22">Luke 10:21-22</span>, very appropriate in their connection with the successful preaching of the Seventy. In this success our Lord rejoiced, for in it He saw the future glory of God to be manifested in the revelation of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven to those of childlike spirit. ‘The future conquest of the world by Jesus and His disciples rests on the relation which He sustains to God, and with which He identifies His people. The perfect knowledge of God is, in the end, the sceptre of the universe.’ (Godet.)
