Luke 10:23.  Privately.  Observe ‘here the gradual narrowing of the circle to which our Lord addresses Himself’ (Alford). See notes on the similar saying in Matthew 13:16-17. The occasion and connection are different there, but just such a beatitude would be likely to be repeated at important points in the training of the disciples.
	 Luke 10:24.  And kings.  Peculiar to Luke. Such persons as David, Solomon, and Hezekiah, some of whom were both prophets and kings. Comp. Genesis 49:18, and the last words of David, a royal prophecy of Christ, 2 Samuel 23:1-5, especially the close: ‘For this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although He make it not to grow.’ The blessing was not in what the disciples obtained, but in what they saw. The true knowledge of God the Father, and of Jesus Christ His Son, was the pledge of all other blessings.
