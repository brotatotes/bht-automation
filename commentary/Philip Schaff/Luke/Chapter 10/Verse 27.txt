<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:27">Luke 10:27</span>. This answer of the lawyer showed intelligence; he gives the sum of the whole law. But his knowledge of the-law exceeded his self-knowledge. In fact he shows, by adding from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+19:18">Leviticus 19:18</span>: <strong> and thy neighbor as thyself, </strong> that he had some conception of our Lord’s teachings. For in addition to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+6:5">Deuteronomy 6:5</span>, which he quotes first, the Jews had written upon the phylacteries and recited night and morning, not this passage, but <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+11:13">Deuteronomy 11:13</span>, etc. Hence it is incorrect to suppose that our Lord pointed to the man’s phylactery, when He said: ‘How readest thou.’
