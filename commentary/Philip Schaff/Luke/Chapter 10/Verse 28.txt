Luke 10:28.  This do and thou shalt live.  True in all cases: any one who can and does love God and his neighbor thus, has already begun to live, has an earnest of eternal life. The parable which follows is but an explanation of how much is meant by ‘this.’ But the next verse shows that the lawyer understood our Lord to imply that  he had not thus done.  As the failure is universal, the all-important question is, Who will enable us to do this? This question is not answered by the parable which follows. Like the Sermon on the Mount, it is an  exposition of the law and a preparation for the gospel, but not the gospel itself.  In John 6:29, our Lord answers a similar question by speaking of faith, but this lawyer was not prepared for that. He must be first taught his failure by an explanation of the requirements of the law.
