Luke 10:36.  Which became neighbor to him  that fell among the robbers?  The original implies a permanent condition; the result of what had been done. Our Lord takes the matter out of the reach of previous circumstances of nationality and religion, and compels a reply on the ground of what had been done. Further, the lawyer had asked ‘Who is my neighbor,’  i.e.,  whom I should love. A direct counter-question would have been: Whom did the Samaritan regard as his neighbor? But our Lord inverts the question, because the relation of ‘neighbor’ is a mutual one, and also, because He wished to hold up the active duty of the despised Samaritan.
