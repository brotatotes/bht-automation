<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:36">Luke 10:36</span>. <strong> Which became neighbor to him</strong> <strong> that fell among the robbers? </strong> The original implies a permanent condition; the result of what had been done. Our Lord takes the matter out of the reach of previous circumstances of nationality and religion, and compels a reply on the ground of what had been done. Further, the lawyer had asked ‘Who is my neighbor,’ <em> i.e., </em> whom I should love. A direct counter-question would have been: Whom did the Samaritan regard as his neighbor? But our Lord inverts the question, because the relation of ‘neighbor’ is a mutual one, and also, because He wished to hold up the active duty of the despised Samaritan.
