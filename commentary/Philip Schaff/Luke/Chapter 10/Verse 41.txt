<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:41">Luke 10:41</span>. <strong> Martha, Martha. </strong> The repetition indicates reproof, but the tone is still one of affection.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Thou art anxious and troubled. </strong> The first word refers more to internal anxiety, the second to the external bustle; both together describe the habit of such a character.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> About many things. </strong> This may have been <em> suggested </em> by Marthaâ€™s wish to present a variety on her table; our Lord hinting that a simpler preparation was all that was needful. But this is not the <em> meaning </em> of the passage, which, as the next verse shows, refers to spiritual things. Yet the bustling about the many things in the kitchen was but a sign of the bustling about many things in her religious life.
