<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:13-15">Luke 10:13-15</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:21-23">Matthew 11:21-23</span>. The connection here is different. It is highly probable that our Lord uttered such words twice. In this case these towns furnished an example of the rejection spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:10-11">Luke 10:10-11</span>. This was His solemn farewell of these favored places, and the connection implies that they had already rejected Him and been forsaken by Him. The accompanying cut shows the utter desolation at the probable site of Capernaum. Even the locality is disputed. The view that these awful woes were uttered at a distance from the places themselves, furnishes new proof how heavily this judgment lay on the heart of Jesus.
