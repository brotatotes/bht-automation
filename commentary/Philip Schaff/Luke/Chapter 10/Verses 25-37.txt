<p>THIS incident, peculiar to Luke, must be distinguished from a later one, mentioned by Matthew, Mark, and Luke, namely, that of the rich young ruler whom Jesus loved. A similar question was put in that case, receiving at first a similar answer. But otherwise the occurrences differ, especially in the second question put to our Lord and in His reply. It is impossible to suppose that Luke gives two different accounts of the same occurrence (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:18-23">Luke 18:18-23</span>). The fact that the same question was put on two different occasions by two different persons, eliciting in each case the same reply, shows that in cases where two Evangelists narrate similar occurrences or sayings in different connections, both may be strictly accurate (see instances in the last section). The time and place of this incident are uncertain; but it probably occurred not long after the mission of the Seventy, between the Feast of Tabernacles and that of the Dedication, somewhere between Jerusalem and Perea.
