<p>CIRCUMSTANCES. There can be little doubt that the persons here spoken of were the <em> sisters of Lazarus, </em> that the place was <em> Bethany, </em> and the time near the feast of Dedication. The two persons have not only the same names but the same characters, as the two sisters described in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:12">John 11:12</span>. It is no objection that so well known a person as Lazarus is not mentioned. Against placing the incident at Bethany, it has been urged that Luke represents it as taking place on a journey from Galilee to Jerusalem, and before Jericho was reached (chap, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:35">Luke 18:35</span>). But from John’s Gospel, which tells us that these sisters lived in Bethany (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:1">John 11:1</span>), we also learn that about this time our Lord visited Jerusalem (at the feast of Dedication). Bethany was near to Jerusalem (about an hour’s walk), and a frequent place of resort far our Lord; doubtless this family often received Him there.
