CIRCUMSTANCES. There can be little doubt that the persons here spoken of were the  sisters of Lazarus,  that the place was  Bethany,  and the time near the feast of Dedication. The two persons have not only the same names but the same characters, as the two sisters described in John 11:12. It is no objection that so well known a person as Lazarus is not mentioned. Against placing the incident at Bethany, it has been urged that Luke represents it as taking place on a journey from Galilee to Jerusalem, and before Jericho was reached (chap, Luke 18:35). But from John’s Gospel, which tells us that these sisters lived in Bethany (John 11:1), we also learn that about this time our Lord visited Jerusalem (at the feast of Dedication). Bethany was near to Jerusalem (about an hour’s walk), and a frequent place of resort far our Lord; doubtless this family often received Him there.
