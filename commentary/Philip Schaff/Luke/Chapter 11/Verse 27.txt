Luke 11:27.  A certain woman.  Herself a mother, we infer from her language. Tradition calls her ‘Marcella, a maid-servant of Martha.’
	 Blessed is the womb.  A natural expression of womanly enthusiasm at the sayings and doings of Christ. As Mary herself shortly after appeared (chap. Luke 8:19) on the edge of the crowd, it is possible that this woman may have perceived her and therefore spoken this blessing. The fact that Luke places it after a severe utterance does not prove it untrustworthy. The woman’s state of mind was the effect of the whole discourse, and her ignorant enthusiasm would only be increased by the severe tone of His words. Every observant public speaker will understand this.
