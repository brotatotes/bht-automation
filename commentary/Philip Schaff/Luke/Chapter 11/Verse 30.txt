Luke 11:30.  For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites. Peculiar to the briefer account of Luke. The appearance of Jonah as a preacher  after  the three days and nights in the whaleâ€™s belly (after his resurrection), was a sign received by the Ninevites. Our Lord speaks of something yet to occur, foretelling His resurrection as a greater sign to that generation.
