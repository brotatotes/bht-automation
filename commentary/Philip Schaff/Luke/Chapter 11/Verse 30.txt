<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:30">Luke 11:30</span>. <strong> For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites.</strong> Peculiar to the briefer account of Luke. The appearance of Jonah as a preacher <em> after </em> the three days and nights in the whaleâ€™s belly (after his resurrection), was a sign received by the Ninevites. Our Lord speaks of something yet to occur, foretelling His resurrection as a greater sign to that generation.
