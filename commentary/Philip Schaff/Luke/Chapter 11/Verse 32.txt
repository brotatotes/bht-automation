Luke 11:32.  The men  of Nineveh.  If these Ninevites had not heard of the miracle, the contrast is even stronger. For in that case their repentance was simply at the  preaching of Jonah,  while the Jews remained unbelieving in the face of Christ’s resurrection as well as His preaching. There is a climax in the order of Luke; the greater sin was the rejection of Christ’s preaching of repentance.
