<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:32">Luke 11:32</span>. <strong> The men</strong> <strong> of Nineveh. </strong> If these Ninevites had not heard of the miracle, the contrast is even stronger. For in that case their repentance was simply at the <strong> preaching of Jonah, </strong> while the Jews remained unbelieving in the face of Christ’s resurrection as well as His preaching. There is a climax in the order of Luke; the greater sin was the rejection of Christ’s preaching of repentance.
