Luke 11:36.  If thy whole body, etc. Van Oosterzee thus explains: ‘Only when thy body is wholly illumined, without having even an obscure corner left therein, will it become so bright and clear as if the full brilliancy of a bright lamp illumined thee; in other words, thou wilt be placed in a normal condition of light.’ The necessity of a state of soul corresponding to and affected by the light which God so fully gives is here emphasized. ‘It is glory as the result of holiness.’ (Godet)
