<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:40">Luke 11:40</span>. <strong> Ye fools, </strong> etc. The folly of such a contradiction is shown. Such a partial cleansing is no cleansing: all such religious acts are supposed to have reference to God, to holiness before Him; since He made the inside as well as the outside, the ceremonial purification of the latter without the real sanctification of the former is folly as well as wickedness.
