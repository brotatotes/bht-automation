Luke 11:40.  Ye fools,  etc. The folly of such a contradiction is shown. Such a partial cleansing is no cleansing: all such religious acts are supposed to have reference to God, to holiness before Him; since He made the inside as well as the outside, the ceremonial purification of the latter without the real sanctification of the former is folly as well as wickedness.
