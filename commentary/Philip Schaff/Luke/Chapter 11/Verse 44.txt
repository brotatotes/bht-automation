The ‘whited sepulchres’ were those of the rich, and the application is to external beauty covering inner corruption; here humbler tombs are spoken of, which in the course of time would be unnoticed by those passing over them, thus causing defilement. There the pretence of Pharisaism is brought out; here its insidiousness. This difference is an incidental evidence that the two discourses were uttered: one in the capital (where the splendid sepulchres were more common), the other in the humbler province of Galilee.
