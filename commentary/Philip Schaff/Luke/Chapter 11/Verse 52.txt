<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:52">Luke 11:52</span>. This verse forms a fitting close to the part of the discourse occasioned by the lawyer’s remark. It expresses the same thought as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:13">Matthew 23:13</span>, but carries out the figure further.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> The key of knowledge. </strong> ‘Knowledge’ is the ‘key.’ This had been taken away by the teaching of the lawyers, which made the people incapable of understanding and accepting salvation in Christ. The verse refers to something which had already occurred. A right understanding of the law would lead to Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:24">Galatians 3:24</span>), but the lawyers had so interpreted it as to produce the opposite result. When the gospel is preached Pharisaically the effect is the same.
