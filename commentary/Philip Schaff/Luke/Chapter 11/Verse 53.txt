Luke 11:53.  when he was come out thence.  From the house of the Pharisee.
	 The scribes and Pharisees  followed Him with malicious intent aroused by His discourse.
	 To press upon him vehemently,  or, ‘to be very spiteful,’ intensely embittered against Him. The former sense is preferable, as including both their feeling towards Him and their actual following of Him with hostile purpose.
	 To provoke him to speak of many  (or ‘more’)  things.  To catechize Him on a variety of subjects, so as to take Him off His guard.
