Luke 11:54.  Laying wait for him to catch something out of his month.  This is the form of the verse. The figure is borrowed from hunting. It was not only that they waited for something to suit their purpose, but they hunted for it, since the expressions represent both the beating up of game and the lying in wait to capture it.
