Luke 11:6.  From a journey.  At night, when it was pleasanter to travel in a hot country. The request here is for  another,  hence the parable illustrates  intercessory  prayer; yet one of the loaves is for him who asks. The hungry traveller coming at night to one who cannot satisfy him  may  represent the awaking of spiritual hunger in the soul, but such an interpretation cannot be   insisted upon.
