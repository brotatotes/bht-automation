<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:6">Luke 11:6</span>. <strong> From a journey. </strong> At night, when it was pleasanter to travel in a hot country. The request here is for <em> another, </em> hence the parable illustrates <em> intercessory </em> prayer; yet one of the loaves is for him who asks. The hungry traveller coming at night to one who cannot satisfy him <em> may </em> represent the awaking of spiritual hunger in the soul, but such an interpretation cannot be <strong> </strong> insisted upon.
