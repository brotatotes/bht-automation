THE TIME and place of the following incident are indefinite, but it cannot be a part of the Sermon on the Mount, put out of its place. A definite occasion is stated in Luke 11:1, and Luke 11:5-8 are not found anywhere else. The allusion to John the Baptist (implying his death) points to a later date than that of the Sermon on the Mount. The place may have been in the neighborhood of Bethany, possibly on the Mount of Olives.
