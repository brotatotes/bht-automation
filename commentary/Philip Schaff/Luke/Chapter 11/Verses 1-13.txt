<p>THE TIME and place of the following incident are indefinite, but it cannot be a part of the Sermon on the Mount, put out of its place. A definite occasion is stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:1">Luke 11:1</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:5-8">Luke 11:5-8</span> are not found anywhere else. The allusion to John the Baptist (implying his death) points to a later date than that of the Sermon on the Mount. The place may have been in the neighborhood of Bethany, possibly on the Mount of Olives.
