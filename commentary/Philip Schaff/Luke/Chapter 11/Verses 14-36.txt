<p>CHRONOLOGY. The miracle and discourses here recorded are probably identical with those narrated in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:22-45">Matthew 12:22-45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:23-30">Mark 3:23-30</span>. Some have supposed that Luke gives the exact position, and not the other two Evangelists. But it is more difficult to reconcile the accounts on this supposition. We accept the position assigned by Matthew and Mark: between the message from John the Baptist and the discourse in parables. The incidents mentioned in chaps, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:3">Luke 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:3">Luke 8:3</span>, probably immediately preceded. The events next succeeding seem to have been those which follow in this Gospel, so that a large portion of the narrative, from chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:14">Luke 11:14</span> to chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:56">Luke 12:56</span> (according to others, to chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:9">Luke 13:9</span>), is placed by Luke <em> out of its position in the history as a whole; </em> the events, however, being properly placed within the passage itself.
