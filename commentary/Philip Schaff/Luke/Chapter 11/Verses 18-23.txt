By (literally ‘in,’ <em> i.e.,</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> in the use of) <strong> the finger of God </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:20">Luke 11:20</span>). This is the same as: ‘in the spirit of God’ (Matthew), the one expression explaining the other. His use of the power (finger) of God was a proof that He worked in union with the Spirit of God, and <em> vice versa.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> A stronger than he </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:22">Luke 11:22</span>). This term is not used by Matthew, but implied in his account. The stronger One is Christ, who had come into the world, and was spoiling Satan by means of these very miracles at which they blasphemed. There is also an intimation of final and complete victory.
