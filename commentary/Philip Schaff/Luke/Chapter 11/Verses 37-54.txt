THIS discourse closely resembles the great denunciation of the Pharisees (Matthew 23:0); but the circumstances of the two are entirely different; the one was uttered just before our Lord departed solemnly and finally from the temple, but in this case Luke definitely fixes the place in the house of a Pharisee (probably in Galilee). A repetition of these fearful words is highly probable. The Pharisees had already become His constant and bitter enemies. Hence the rebuke at this earlier date is quite as natural as that in His final discourse He would sum up and repeat the woes already pronounced.
	 From Luke 11:37 we infer that this discourse followed closely the reply to the demand for a sign. Hence it was uttered in Galilee, before the great discourse in parables, and probably just after His mother and brethren sought Him.
