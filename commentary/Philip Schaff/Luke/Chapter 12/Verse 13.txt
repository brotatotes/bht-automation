Luke 12:13.  And one out of the multitude.  An ordinary hearer in the crowd. His request may have been suggested by our Lordâ€™s previous declarations about Providential care, or by his notion that the Messiah would set all things right. So that he manifested some confidence in the Lord by thus addressing Him.
	 Bid my brother divide the inheritance with me.  The man seemed to have been wronged by his brother, and feeling this, as is so natural, he made this inopportune request. There is no evidence that he wanted more than his legal share, or that he was a younger brother, who was envious of the double portion of the first-born son. His covetousness is evident without any such conjectures. Brooding on earthly things while our Lord spoke of heavenly things; the only effect was a request for earthly things. No covetousness is so dangerous as that which listens to Christ only to use Him as a helper in increasing wealth. Yet this man was no hypocrite, was unaware of the sinfulness of such a step. So it has been since, but Christ would here shed light on this sin.
