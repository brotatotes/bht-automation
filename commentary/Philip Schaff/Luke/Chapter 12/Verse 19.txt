<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:19">Luke 12:19</span>. <strong> Soul, thou hast many goods laid up for many years. </strong> He was no unusual and hardened sinner, because he thus thought. Yet he made two mistakes: (1) He thought that his many goods could satisfy his ‘soul;’ degrading it to the level of materialism; (2) He spoke of ‘many years,’ forgetting that he had no such lease of life.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Take thine ease. </strong> His wealth had disquieted him; he would now make it the basis of rest
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Eat, drink, be merry. </strong> But idleness will not satisfy him; he must begin to revel, to have occupation. This was the natural step. The four verses (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:16-19">Matthew 12:16-19</span>) are a graphic portrayal of worldliness. In real life sometimes the father fills out the character of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:16">Luke 12:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:18">Luke 12:18</span>, and it is the sons who utter the epicurean sentiment of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:19">Luke 12:19</span>; but the picture remains true to life. Novelists expand these verses into volumes, but too often forget the spiritual lesson.
