Luke 12:19.  Soul, thou hast many goods laid up for many years.  He was no unusual and hardened sinner, because he thus thought. Yet he made two mistakes: (1) He thought that his many goods could satisfy his ‘soul;’ degrading it to the level of materialism; (2) He spoke of ‘many years,’ forgetting that he had no such lease of life.
	 Take thine ease.  His wealth had disquieted him; he would now make it the basis of rest
	 Eat, drink, be merry.  But idleness will not satisfy him; he must begin to revel, to have occupation. This was the natural step. The four verses (Matthew 12:16-19) are a graphic portrayal of worldliness. In real life sometimes the father fills out the character of Luke 12:16; Luke 12:18, and it is the sons who utter the epicurean sentiment of Luke 12:19; but the picture remains true to life. Novelists expand these verses into volumes, but too often forget the spiritual lesson.
