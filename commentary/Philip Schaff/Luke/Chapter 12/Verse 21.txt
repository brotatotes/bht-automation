<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:21">Luke 12:21</span>. <strong> So</strong>, thus foolish and destitute, even though the hour of his awaking from the dream of wisdom and wealth has not yet come, <strong> is, </strong> not ‘will be,’ for a terrible every-day fact is set forth, <strong> he that layeth up treasure for himself. </strong> The folly and sin and real destitution springs from the <em> selfishness </em> of this course. The evil is not in the treasure, nor in laying up treasure, but in laying up treasure for one’s self. A case like this, where the sinner is respectable, honest, and prosperous, shows the true nature of sin: it is a devotion to self, not to God, and laying up solely for self is therefore a sin, according to the judgment of Christ.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> And is not rich toward God. </strong> This is the same as having ‘a treasure in the heavens’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:33">Luke 12:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:20">Matthew 5:20</span>). Hence it cannot mean simply, being actually rich and using the wealth for the glory of God. It refers to the true wealth which God preserves for us and will impart to us, spiritual wealth, possessions in His grace, His kingdom, His eternal favor, that are not left behind at death. Gathering for self directly interferes with the acquiring of this true wealth; gathering for the purposes set forth in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:19">Luke 12:19</span> is a <em> robbing of the spirit. </em> But the possession of wealth does not in and of itself prevent the acquisition of the true riches. It is the desire for wealth, the trust in riches, which proves a snare (chap, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:24">Luke 18:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:24">Mark 10:24</span>). The sin of covetousness is all the more dangerous, because so respectable. But the Bible joins together covetousness, uncleanness, and idolatry (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>, and many similar passages).
