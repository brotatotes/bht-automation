Luke 12:24.  Consider the ravens.  Comp. Job 38:41; Psalms 147:9; the thought here is more general, however. The word translated ‘consider’ is stronger than that used in the sermon on the Mount; it implies observation and study. ‘In the example borrowed from nature, it is important to mark how all the figures employed  sowing, reaping, storehouse, barn  are connected with the parable of the foolish rich man. All these labors, all these provisions, in the midst of which the rich man died, the ravens knew nothing of them; and yet they live! The will of God is thus a surer guaranty of existence than the possession of superabundance.’ (Godet.) Worldly care forgets to trust God; covetousness trusts wealth more than God. Both sins are dangerous, because insidious. Many Christians obtain the mastery over other forms of evil, and yet fail to recognize the evil of these closely related practical errors.
