Luke 12:29.  Neither be ye of doubtful mind.  The word in the original is derived from ‘meteor,’ and is explained by some: do not rise in fancy to high demands, creating imagined necessities, thus making yourselves more ill-contented and more disposed to unbelieving anxiety. Others interpret (as in E. V.): do not be fluctuating,  i.e.,  anxious, tossed between hope and fear. This suits the connection, but is a less usual sense.
