<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:29">Luke 12:29</span>. <strong> Neither be ye of doubtful mind. </strong> The word in the original is derived from ‘meteor,’ and is explained by some: do not rise in fancy to high demands, creating imagined necessities, thus making yourselves more ill-contented and more disposed to unbelieving anxiety. Others interpret (as in E. V.): do not be fluctuating, <em> i.e., </em> anxious, tossed between hope and fear. This suits the connection, but is a less usual sense.
