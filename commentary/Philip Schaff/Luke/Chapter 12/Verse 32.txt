<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:32">Luke 12:32</span>. <strong> Fear not. </strong> Peculiar to Luke. The fear forbidden, is that which interferes with proper seeking of the kingdom of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:31">Luke 12:31</span>), including fear about losing earthly things and fear about not obtaining the heavenly riches. Such encouragement was needed by the disciples, who were outwardly weak: <strong> little flock, </strong> ‘little’ in contrast with the myriads of people (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:1">Luke 12:1</span>); but the <em> ‘</em> flock’ of the Good Shepherd (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:31">Matthew 26:31</span>). Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:10-14">Isaiah 11:10-14</span>, which justifies a wider application to all real Christians.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> For it is your Father’s good pleasure, </strong> etc. Because of the ‘good pleasure,’ they would obtain the heavenly riches; fear about spiritual things being thus removed, there ought to be none about temporal things.
