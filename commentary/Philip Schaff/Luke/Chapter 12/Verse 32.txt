Luke 12:32.  Fear not.  Peculiar to Luke. The fear forbidden, is that which interferes with proper seeking of the kingdom of God (Luke 12:31), including fear about losing earthly things and fear about not obtaining the heavenly riches. Such encouragement was needed by the disciples, who were outwardly weak:  little flock,  ‘little’ in contrast with the myriads of people (Luke 12:1); but the  ‘ flock’ of the Good Shepherd (John 10:11; Matthew 26:31). Comp. Isaiah 11:10-14, which justifies a wider application to all real Christians.
	 For it is your Father’s good pleasure,  etc. Because of the ‘good pleasure,’ they would obtain the heavenly riches; fear about spiritual things being thus removed, there ought to be none about temporal things.
