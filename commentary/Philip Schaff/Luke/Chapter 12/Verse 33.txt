Luke 12:33.  Sell what ye have, and give alms.  Comp. Matthew 6:19-21, but this is stronger. The connection of thought is with Luke 12:17 (‘what shall I do?’), telling how earthly riches should be invested. But there is also a close connection with what precedes: Since God provides for our temporal wants as well as our higher spiritual ones, use His temporal gifts so as to promote your spiritual welfare. The first, but not exclusive, application is to the Apostles, who must be thus unencumbered in their ministry. If this course of conduct promoted their spiritual welfare, it will that of all Christians. The precept will not be understood too literally, except by those who apply it only to ascetics who assume vows of poverty. Our Lord’s words are diametrically opposed to modern socialism. The latter would make  laws  to  take  away wealth, the former inculcate love that  gives  away.
	 Purses which wax not old.  Comp. chap. Luke 10:4, where the Seventy are forbidden to take purses.
	 A treasure in the heavens.  A comparison with Luke 12:21 and Matthew 7:2 shows that this precept is of universal application.
