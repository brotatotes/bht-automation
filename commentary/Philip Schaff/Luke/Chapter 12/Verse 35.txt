Luke 12:35.  Let your loins be girded about.  Unless the long garments of the Orientals were thus girt up, it was impossible to walk or to serve at table.
	 And your lamps burning,   i.e.,  in readiness for the master returning at night. Be in continual readiness to receive the returning Messiah, your master, as befits your relation to Him. The first figure points to the  activity, the second to the  watchfulness,  of the faithful servant.
