<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> in the third watch  (from 9 P.M. to 3 A.M.). The first and fourth watches are not mentioned (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:35">Mark 13:35</span>). The middle watches are the time of soundest sleep. Even if our Lord delays longer than the servants thought (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:45">Luke 12:45</span>), a faithful servant can thus show his fidelity.
