<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:47">Luke 12:47</span>. <strong> And that servant who knew, </strong> etc. The verse states a general principle, which serves to explain the severity of the punishment spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:46">Luke 12:46</span>. Peter’s distinction (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:41">Luke 12:41</span>) between us’ and ‘all’ corresponds with that between the ‘servant who knew,’ and the servant ‘that knew not’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:48">Luke 12:48</span>). But the application is general.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:48">Luke 12:48</span>. <strong> That knew not. </strong> With fewer privileges, less knowledge, referring first to a disciple, but applicable to all men.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> And did things worthy of stripes, </strong> etc. The ground of the punishment is not disobedience to an unknown will of the Lord, but the commission of acts worthy of punishment According to the law of conscience those here referred to will be judged and condemned (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:19-20">Romans 1:19-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:32">Romans 1:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14-15">Romans 2:14-15</span>); but their punishment will be less than that of those with more light. But all who can read this declaration are given more light.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> With few stripes. </strong> Both classes will be punished in the same way; the difference being in <em> degree, </em> not in <em> kind. </em> This shows that the punishment will be during conscious existence, but gives no hint of a difference in the duration of punishment. Nothing is said of those who know and do, or of those <em> who know not and do, </em> should the latter class exist (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14">Romans 2:14</span>). The language, here used (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:45-48">Luke 12:45-48</span>) implies <em> retribution </em> (not discipline), at and after Christ’s second coming. On the latter part of the verse, see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:29">Matthew 25:29</span>. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> The more. </strong> More than from others, not more than he received, with an allusion to the interest, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:27">Matthew 25:27</span>.
