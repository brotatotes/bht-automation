<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> I have a baptism, </strong> etc. Our Lord here refers to His own sufferings, and especially to His death. We may find in the figure either a reference to His burial, or to the depth and intensity of His sufferings, when the waters roll over His soul. Before we could be baptized with the Holy Spirit, this must come, for only thus was this new power bought for us.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> And how am I straitened, </strong> etc. ‘What a weight is on me.’ Anxiety, trouble of spirit, the human reluctance in view of fearful sufferings, here appear. It is the premonition of Gethsemane and Calvary. As this was probably uttered before the parable of the Sower, it was a long shadow the cross threw upon His soul.
