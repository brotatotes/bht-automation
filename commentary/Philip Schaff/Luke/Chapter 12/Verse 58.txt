<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> With thine adversary. </strong> The ‘adversary’ is the holy law of God, since ‘what is right’ had just been spoken of; in the parallel passage, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:25-26">Matthew 5:25-26</span>, the connection points rather to some brother offended.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> The magistrate </strong> is God.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> The prison. </strong> The place <strong> </strong> of punishment. This interpretation of the figure seems even more fitting here than in Matthew. Some prefer to regard it as a general statement of danger, without explaining the several parts. But the repetition of the detailed figure (the Sermon on the Mount certainly preceded) as well as the previous part of the discourse point to special meanings.
