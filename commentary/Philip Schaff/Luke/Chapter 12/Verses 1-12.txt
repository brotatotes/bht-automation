The connection: ‘Beware of hypocrisy (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:1">Luke 12:1</span>), for all shall be made evident in the end (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:2">Luke 12:2</span>), and ye are witnesses and sharers in this unfolding of the truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:3">Luke 12:3</span>). In this your work, ye need not fear men, for your Father has you in His keeping (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:4-7">Luke 12:4-7</span>) and the confession of my name is a glorious thing (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:8">Luke 12:8</span>), but the rejection of it (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:9">Luke 12:9</span>), and especially the ascription of my works to the evil one (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:10">Luke 12:10</span>) a fearful one. And in this confession ye shall be helped by the Holy Spirit in the hour of need (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:11-12">Luke 12:11-12</span>).’ Alford.
