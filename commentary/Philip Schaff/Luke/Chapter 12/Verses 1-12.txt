Luke 12:1-12. WARNING AGAINST HYPOCRISY. Comp. the various parallel passages in Matthew. The connection: ‘Beware of hypocrisy (Luke 12:1), for all shall be made evident in the end (Luke 12:2), and ye are witnesses and sharers in this unfolding of the truth (Luke 12:3). In this your work, ye need not fear men, for your Father has you in His keeping (Luke 12:4-7) and the confession of my name is a glorious thing (Luke 12:8), but the rejection of it (Luke 12:9), and especially the ascription of my works to the evil one (Luke 12:10) a fearful one. And in this confession ye shall be helped by the Holy Spirit in the hour of need (Luke 12:11-12).’ Alford.
