CHAPTER 12 is made up of a series of discourses following each other in immediate succession, but with less of unity and logical connection than are found in most of our Lord’s recorded sermons. Some have therefore thought that Luke here records a compilation of our Lord’s teachings, delivered on very different occasions, one section alone (Luke 12:13-21) being peculiar and in its proper place. This is possible, yet even in that case the order and arrangement of the Evangelist suggest new views of the truth elsewhere recorded. In itself the chapter seems to contain a series of discourses delivered on one definite occasion. The only evidence that it is other than what it seems is furnished by the similarity of the sayings to those found in different connections in the other Gospels. In view of the acknowledged repetitions in our Lord’s teachings, this evidence is insufficient. It is probable that the crowd was gathering again while our Lord was in the house of the Pharisee, that on coming forth He began a discourse to His disciples, following up the thoughts uttered there; and that as new occasions immediately presented themselves, He continued His discourses with a variation in the theme. The section may be thus divided: Luke 12:1-12, warning against  hypocrisy; Luke 12:13-21, against  covetousness,  occasioned by the request of one present about a division of inheritance; Luke 12:22-34, against  worldly care,  or lessons of trust in God. In the first part the tone of warning predominates, in the second instruction, in the third encouragement and com-fort.
