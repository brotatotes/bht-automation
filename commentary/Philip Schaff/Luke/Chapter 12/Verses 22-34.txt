<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:22-34">Luke 12:22-34</span>. WARNING AGAINST WORLDLY CARE, or lessons of trust in God. These verses were addressed to the disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:22">Luke 12:22</span>), and the connection with what precedes is close.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Therefore, </strong> since worldly riches are of so little use, be not anxious; God who cares for your higher life will provide for the lower, and since He provides food for the ravens and clothing for the lilies, He will certainly, being a Father, provide for you, His children.
