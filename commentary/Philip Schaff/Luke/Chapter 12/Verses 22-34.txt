Luke 12:22-34. WARNING AGAINST WORLDLY CARE, or lessons of trust in God. These verses were addressed to the disciples (Luke 12:22), and the connection with what precedes is close.
	 Therefore,  since worldly riches are of so little use, be not anxious; God who cares for your higher life will provide for the lower, and since He provides food for the ravens and clothing for the lilies, He will certainly, being a Father, provide for you, His children. See further on Matthew 6:25-33; Matthew 19-21.
