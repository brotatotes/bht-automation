<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:35-48">Luke 12:35-48</span>. EXHORTATIONS TO <strong> </strong> WATCHFULNESS. The connection is with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:32">Luke 12:32</span>: ‘It is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom,’ let that free you from anxiety; but let it be the motive to labor and watch for the coming of the King. The passage resembles <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:42-51">Matthew 24:42-51</span>, but the close connection with what precedes, forbids the view that Luke here gives us another account of that discourse.
