Luke 12:35-48. EXHORTATIONS TO   WATCHFULNESS. The connection is with Luke 12:32: ‘It is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom,’ let that free you from anxiety; but let it be the motive to labor and watch for the coming of the King. The passage resembles Matthew 24:42-51, but the close connection with what precedes, forbids the view that Luke here gives us another account of that discourse.
