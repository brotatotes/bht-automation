CONTENTS. A continuation of the discourse. Luke 12:35-48 contain exhortations to  watchfulness;  the difference between the faithful and unfaithful servant suggests a difficulty in the way of faithfulness (Luke 12:49-53), namely, the antagonism developed in the establishment and progress of Christâ€™s kingdom. The thought of this antagonism naturally leads to the rebuke addressed to the   multitude for blindness and want of prudence with respect to the signs of the times (Luke 12:54-59).
