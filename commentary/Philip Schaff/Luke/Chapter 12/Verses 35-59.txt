<p>CONTENTS. A continuation of the discourse. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:35-48">Luke 12:35-48</span> contain exhortations to <em> watchfulness; </em> the difference between the faithful and unfaithful servant suggests a difficulty in the way of faithfulness (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:49-53">Luke 12:49-53</span>), namely, the antagonism developed in the establishment and progress of Christâ€™s kingdom. The thought of this antagonism naturally leads to the rebuke addressed to the <strong> </strong> multitude for blindness and want of prudence with respect to the signs of the times (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:54-59">Luke 12:54-59</span>).
