See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:45-51">Matthew 24:45-51</span>, which corresponds exactly. ‘Jesus continues His teaching as if He took no account of Peter’s question; but in reality He gives such a turn to the warning which follows about watchfulness, that it includes the precise answer to the question.’ (Godet.) Faithfulness and unfaithfulness come into prominence, not the reward of a particular class, irrespective of their conduct Peter learned the lesson; the warning tone of these verses reappears in his epistles.
