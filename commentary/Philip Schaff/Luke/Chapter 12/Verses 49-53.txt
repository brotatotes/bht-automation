Luke 12:49-53. Having shown the awful difference between the faithful and unfaithful servant, and the great responsibility resting upon His disciples, our Lord points out that the difference begins here and is manifested in the antagonism which the establishment of His kingdom develops. While this renders faithfulness more difficult, the knowledge of it increases the sense of responsibility and urges to greater faithfulness.
