	 Division  is equivalent to ‘a sword’ (Matthew). This would be the effect of the ‘fire’ He would send. His own coming indeed resulted in antagonism, but the gift of the Holy Ghost increased it, and the measure of that antagonism has been the measure of the Spirit’s influence. In one sense the greatness of the strife is a proof of the greatness of the Lord whose coming caused it, as His prediction of it is a proof of His Divine knowledge.
