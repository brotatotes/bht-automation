<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:11">Luke 13:11</span>. <strong> A spirit of infirmity eighteen years.</strong> This suggests a form of demoniacal possession; and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:16">Luke 13:16</span> shows that Satanic influence was present in her case. Our Lord, however, did not heal demoniacs by laying on of hands, but by a word of command. Yet in this case He both speaks (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:12">Luke 13:12</span>) and lays hands upon her (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:13">Luke 13:13</span>). The effect of her disease was that <strong> she was bowed together; </strong> her muscular power was so deficient, that she <strong> could in no wise lift herself up.</strong> She had some power, but it was insufficient to allow her to straighten herself up. This view represents the woman, not as remaining passively bowed, but ever attempting and failing to stand straight.
