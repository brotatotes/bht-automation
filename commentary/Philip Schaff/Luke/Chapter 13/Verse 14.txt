<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:14">Luke 13:14</span>. <strong> Being filled with indignation. </strong> The attitude of mind was hostile; but had been manifested hitherto on such occasions. The answer was not ‘with indignation.’ The ruler was afraid to speak out so boldly, and he ‘covertly and cowardly’ addresses himself, not to the Healer or to the healed, but to the multitude. His false premise was, that works of mercy are forbidden on the Sabbath.
