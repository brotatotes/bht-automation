The contrast is marked. In the one case a dumb animal, in the other a woman, who was moreover <strong> a daughter of Abraham,</strong> one of the covenant people of God, the God of the Sabbath. The reference to her being a spiritual daughter of Abraham is not at all certain. The animal is represented as bound by a master aware of its necessities, this woman was bound by Satan. Ordinary infirmity would scarcely be thus described; some kind of possession is asserted by our Lord. In the case of the animal but a few hours would have passed since the last watering the woman had been bound for <strong> eighteen years.
