Luke 13:2.  Suppose ye?  Our Lord perceives their reasoning, and first corrects the mistake they made, adding an appropriate warning.
	 Were sinners.  Our Lord does not deny that they were sinners; but only that their fate proved them to be especially great sinners. Job’s friends made the same mistake. The verse directly opposes the very common habit of calling every calamity that befalls another a ‘judgment.’ Such a verdict has the air of piety, but it is generally the result of uncharitableness. The next verse shows that our Lord so regarded it.
