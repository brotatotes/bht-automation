<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:24">Luke 13:24</span>. <strong> Strive.</strong> ‘Instead of such a question, remember that many will not obtain salvation, strive therefore to obtain it yourselves in the right way,’ <em> i.e.</em>, <strong> to enter by the (narrow) door. </strong> To do this the greatest earnestness is required. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:13">Matthew 7:13</span>, from which passage ‘gate’ has been substituted here.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Shall seek to enter In. </strong> ‘Seek’ is not so strong as ‘strive.’ Earnest to some extent, these seek to enter in some other way. It is probably implied that more earnestness would lead to the narrow door of repentance and faith.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> And shall not be able. </strong> It is a moral impossibility to enter in any other way.
