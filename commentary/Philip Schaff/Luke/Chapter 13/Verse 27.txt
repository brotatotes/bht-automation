<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:27">Luke 13:27</span>. <strong> All ye workers of iniquity. </strong> ‘Workers’ means those in the employ of, and receiving the wages of unrighteousness. The terrible reality set forth is, that many ‘workers of iniquity’ think they will be saved, and will find out their mistake <em> too late. </em> This is a motive to ‘strive’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:24">Luke 13:24</span>), for now such striving is possible; but a time will come when the striving as well as the entrance will be impossible. The conduct of those ‘seeking’ admittance, as here described, is not striving. Many, in their thoughts of the future world, make the great mistake of supposing that those unsaved here <em> can </em> really desire salvation there, but no word of our Lord hints at such a desire, involving a desire for holiness.
