Luke 13:30. See on Matthew 19:30; Matthew 20:16. Here the saying seems to be applied to the ingathering of the guests, just spoken of; not simply to the Jews and Gentiles as such, but to individuals and churches and nations all through the ingathering. For example: the church at Jerusalem and her Gentile off-shoots, the Oriental churches. Modern history furnishes many instances.
