Our Lord’s reply intimates this. Herod may not have wished to kill Jesus, but the desire, now to see Him and now to get Him out of his territory, agrees entirely with the character of that ruler.

Others infer from chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:11">Luke 17:11</span>, that He was still in Galilee, but this we consider highly improbable.
