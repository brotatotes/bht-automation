<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:32">Luke 13:32</span>. <strong> That fox. </strong> A figure of cunning and mischief. Herod deserved the name. As the Greek word for ‘fox’ is feminine, it is possible that the term points to Herod’s loss of manliness through the influence of Herodias. But it is not certain that this was spoken in Greek.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Do, </strong> or, ‘perform,’ <strong> cures. </strong> Our Lord mentions His works, because it was these, rather than His words, which had excited Herod’s anxiety (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:7">Luke 9:7</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Today and tomorrow, and the third day come to the end, </strong> <em> i.e., </em> of these works in your country (Perea). This is the simplest sense of this much disputed passage; meaning: I shall remain in your territory three days longer. The days must then be understood in the literal sense. Some, however, refer them to His present work (‘today’), His future labors (‘tomorrow’), and His sufferings at Jerusalem (‘the third day’). Such a sense would not only be unusual, but it is opposed by the next verse, where the third day is a day of journeying, not of death. The word used is in the present tense, because our Lord would tell Herod that the future to Him is <em> certain.
