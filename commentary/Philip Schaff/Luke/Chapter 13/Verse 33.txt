<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:33">Luke 13:33</span>. N <strong> evertheless I must go on my journey. </strong> Although I will remain working in your territory for three days, I must still be journeying. The word here used is the same as that in the threat ‘depart,’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:31">Luke 13:31</span>). During these days of labor our Lord will be journeying, and He <em> must </em> do so. This journey will be out of Herod’s territory, it is true, but not because of Herod’s threat. He did not fear death, for He was going to meet death. The necessity of the journey lay in this: <strong> for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. </strong> ‘It cannot be’ (peculiar to this passage) indicates <em> moral </em> impossibility. Jerusalem had monopolized the slaughter of the prophets. John the Baptist was an apparent exception.
