<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:35">Luke 13:35</span>. The word translated ‘desolate’ is omitted by the best authorities, but ‘forsaken’ may be supplied to bring out the entire sense of the rest of the clause.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> And I say</strong>, etc. Matthew: ‘for.’ There the reason is given, since the Lord was then finally leaving the temple <strong> ;</strong> here the reference is more prophetic. ‘Henceforth,’ which in Matthew marks the beginning of the desolation at that moment, is not found here. These little things show that this was spoken at an earlier time. Some belittle the prediction by referring it to our Lord’s triumphal entry just before the Passover, when the people cried, Blessed, etc. The disciples may have misunderstood this prediction, and thought it fulfilled on that occasion, but in fact Jerusalem did not say this, but said ‘Who is this?’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:10">Matthew 21:10</span>), and objected (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:34">Luke 19:34</span>). It is far more natural to suppose that already our Lord mourned over the impending fate of the holy city.
