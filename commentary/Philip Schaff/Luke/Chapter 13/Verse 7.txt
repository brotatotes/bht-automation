<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> These three years. </strong> The planted tree would ordinarily bear within three years. Whatever be the special interpretation, this period indicates that fruit is not demanded too soon. ‘Three years are the time of a full trial, at the end of which the inference of incurable sterility may be drawn.’ (Godet) Some refer this to the three years of our Lord’s ministry, now so nearly ended. But the time is uncertain (see above).

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Why also,</strong> besides bearing no fruit, <strong> cumbereth it the ground?</strong> Why is it allowed to impoverish the soil, and interfere with the other products of the vineyard. Barrenness curses others also.
