We have no further information as to the time of the massacre mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:1">Luke 13:1</span>, tidings of which seem to have just arrived. Views: 1.

(So Robinson and others.) 2. It occurred during the last visit to Perea, and should be joined with what follows. In that case we have an unbroken chronological order in this Gospel from this point (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:11-19">Luke 17:11-19</span> excepted). In favor of (2.) it is urged that the phrase ‘these three years’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:7">Luke 13:7</span>) points to a time near the close of our Lord’s ministry. It is impossible to decide the question with much confidence.
