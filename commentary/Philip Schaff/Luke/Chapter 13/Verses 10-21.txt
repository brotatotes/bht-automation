TIME. It is generally agreed that this incident belongs to the later period of our Lordâ€™s ministry, about the time of His visit to Perea (Matthew 19:1-2; Mark 10:1). The reasons for this are (1.) that Luke 13:22 tells of a journey to Jerusalem, which must be identified with the last one; (2.) that the language of the ruler of the synagogue points to a time when the opposition to our Lord was open and pronounced; (3.) that the incident cannot be appropriately placed anywhere else. The parables (Luke 13:18-21), which are found in the great parabolic discourse (Matthew 13:0), were repeated on this occasion. Any other view involves great difficulties. Such repetitions might be expected from the wisest of teachers.
