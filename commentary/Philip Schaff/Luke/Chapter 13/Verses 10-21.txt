<p>TIME. It is generally agreed that this incident belongs to the later period of our Lordâ€™s ministry, about the time of His visit to Perea (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:1-2">Matthew 19:1-2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:1">Mark 10:1</span>). The reasons for this are (1.) that <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:22">Luke 13:22</span> tells of a journey to Jerusalem, which must be identified with the last one; (2.) that the language of the ruler of the synagogue points to a time when the opposition to our Lord was open and pronounced; (3.) that the incident cannot be appropriately placed anywhere else. The parables (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:18-21">Luke 13:18-21</span>), which are found in the great parabolic discourse (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:0">Matthew 13:0</span>), were repeated on this occasion. Any other view involves great difficulties. Such repetitions might be expected from the wisest of teachers.
