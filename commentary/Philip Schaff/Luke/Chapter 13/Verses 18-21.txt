Luke 13:18-21. PARABLES OF THE MUSTARD SEED AND THE LEAVEN. See notes on Matthew 13:31-33. On the repetition of these parables, see note at the beginning of the section. There is an appropriate connection with what precedes. The miracle had shown Christ’s power over Satan, the people were rejoicing in this power; our Lord thus teaches them that His kingdom, ‘the kingdom of God,’ should ultimately triumph over all opposition, should grow externally and internally. Such instruction was peculiarly apt just before He began His actual journey to death at Jerusalem.
