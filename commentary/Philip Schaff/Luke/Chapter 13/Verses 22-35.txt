<p>TIME. We identify the journey here spoken of (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:22">Luke 13:22</span>), with the last journey from Perea to Jerusalem, and accept the order of Luke in the following chapters as accurate. Some think that it is the journey from beyond Jordan (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:40">John 10:40</span>) in order to raise Lazarus at Bethany (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:0">John 11:0</span>), but we place that miracle and the retirement to Ephraim (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:54">John 11:54</span>) before all the events of this chapter. The thoughts here recorded and found elsewhere in different connections, were no doubt repeated as Luke records them.
