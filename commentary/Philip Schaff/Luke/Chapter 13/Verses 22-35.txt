TIME. We identify the journey here spoken of (Luke 13:22), with the last journey from Perea to Jerusalem, and accept the order of Luke in the following chapters as accurate. Some think that it is the journey from beyond Jordan (John 10:40) in order to raise Lazarus at Bethany (John 11:0), but we place that miracle and the retirement to Ephraim (John 11:54) before all the events of this chapter. The thoughts here recorded and found elsewhere in different connections, were no doubt repeated as Luke records them.
