<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Cast forth without. </strong> Those not admitted are thus spoken of, because as Jews they were born in the covenant. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:29">Luke 13:29</span> represents the ingathering of the Gentiles. It is fanciful to discover a reference to the progress of successful missionary effort from east to south is referred to. Our Lord does not say ‘many’ here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:11">Matthew 8:11</span>, since this would have been too direct an answer to the question (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:23">Luke 13:23</span>). He would make prominent, not the number, but that those addressed, confident in their Jewish position, were in the greatest danger of not being saved.
