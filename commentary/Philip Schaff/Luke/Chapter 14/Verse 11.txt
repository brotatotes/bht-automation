Luke 14:11.  Humbled.  The same word in both clauses. The principle here set forth was repeated by our Lord on a number of occasions (Matthew 23:12; Luke 18:14), and formed one of the main truths of His teaching. We are to apply it in the widest sense, but especially with reference to the kingdom of God (viewed as a feast), into which state of exaltation only the humble enter, while those who exalt themselves, not only do not enter, but are cast into a state of positive abasement.
