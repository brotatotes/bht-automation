The principle here set forth was repeated by our Lord on a number of occasions (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:12">Matthew 23:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:14">Luke 18:14</span>), and formed one of the main truths of His teaching. We are to apply it in the widest sense, but especially with reference to the kingdom of God (viewed as a feast), into which state of exaltation only the humble enter, while those who exalt themselves, not only do not enter, but are cast into a state of positive abasement.
