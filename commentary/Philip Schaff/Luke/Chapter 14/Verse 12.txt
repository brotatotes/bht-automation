It was probably in a town in Perea, neither a large city nor a rural district, but just of that intermediate kind, where questions of position are deemed so important.

All expenses for entertainments, for which we expect a return, are expenses for  self  and not for others. If such entertainments prevent real charity (Luke 14:13) they are forbidden.
