<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:13">Luke 14:13</span>. <strong> Bid. Not the</strong> <strong> word </strong> used in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:12">Luke 14:12</span>; the quiet invitation is meant. Sounding a trumpet before such a feast is forbidden in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1-2">Matthew 6:1-2</span>.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> The poor, </strong> etc. This is to be taken as including all modes of providing for the wants of the classes referred to. There is little danger that it will be understood too literally. As the same classes are spoken of in the parable (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:21">Luke 14:21</span>), it is a fair inference that in so doing we follow Godâ€™s own example.
