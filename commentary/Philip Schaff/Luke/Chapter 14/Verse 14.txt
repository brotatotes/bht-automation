Luke 14:14.  And then shalt be blessed, because they have not wherewith to recompense thee.  This implies that the benevolence has been done without hope of return, excluding the recompense from ‘the praise of men.’ The proof that the blessing will come is added:  for thou  shalt be recompensed,  etc. Earthly recompense amounts to nothing; it gives no blessing. All outlay with the hope of return is a mere squandering upon self. But providing for the poor, etc., is lending to the Lord; He will repay it, and His promise is the security for the blessedness referred to. Our Lord, of course, does not here encourage charity  for the purpose  of obtaining a future reward. The reward comes, but it is still of grace.
	 In  the resurrection of  the just.  This refers to the  first  resurrection, and implies a  second  one (comp. 1 Corinthians 15:22; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; Revelation 20:4-5). Our Lord says nothing of an intervening millennium, but the guest who spoke next evidently alludes to it.
