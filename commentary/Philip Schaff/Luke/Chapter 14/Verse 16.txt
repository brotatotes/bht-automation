<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:16">Luke 14:16</span>. <strong> A</strong> <strong> certain man. </strong> Here representing God, since the parable conveys a lesson about eating bread ‘in the kingdom of God’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:15">Luke 14:15</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> A great supper. </strong> The figure suggested by the last remark is taken up. God prepares ‘a feast of fat things’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+25:6">Isaiah 25:6</span>), which is to culminate in the marriage supper of the Lamb.

While the Lord’s Supper is not directly alluded to, it may well be regarded as the sign and seal of the privileges here represented, and as the pledge of the more glorious feast in the future.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> And bade many. </strong> The ‘many’ represent the Jewish nation, but especially the Pharisees and the rulers (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:21">Luke 14:21</span>). The first invitation was given through the ancient prophets, the feast being still in the future.
