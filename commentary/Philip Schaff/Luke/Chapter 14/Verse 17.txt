Luke 14:17.  Sent his servant.  This was usual in the East (comp. Matthew 22:3). As but one servant is spoken of, and but one such invitation, we must understand this as representing Christ Himself, who came to those invited, saying:  come, for things are now ready,  i.e.,  ‘the kingdom of heaven is at hand’ (Matthew 4:17). See further on Matthew 22:4. The immediate invitation is based on the fact, that preparation had been made. ‘All’ is to be omitted, but is a correct explanation of the full sense. The gospel, telling of the facts of salvation, repeats this announcement; it is always a message sent through Christ (‘His servant’).
