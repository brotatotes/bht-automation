<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:17">Luke 14:17</span>. <strong> Sent his servant. </strong> This was usual in the East (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:3">Matthew 22:3</span>). As but one servant is spoken of, and but one such invitation, we must understand this as representing Christ Himself, who came to those invited, saying: <strong> come, for things are now ready</strong>, <em> i.e., </em> ‘the kingdom of heaven is at hand’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:17">Matthew 4:17</span>). See further on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:4">Matthew 22:4</span>. The immediate invitation is based on the fact, that preparation had been made. ‘All’ is to be omitted, but is a correct explanation of the full sense. The gospel, telling of the facts of salvation, repeats this announcement; it is always a message sent through Christ (‘His servant’).
