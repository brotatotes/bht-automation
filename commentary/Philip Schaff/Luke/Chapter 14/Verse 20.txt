<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:20">Luke 14:20</span>. <strong> I have married a wife. </strong> According to the Mosaic law (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+24:5">Deuteronomy 24:5</span>), a newly married man was free from military duty for a year. Hence the abrupt tone: <strong> and therefore I cannot come. </strong> Home engagements are often the most pressing, as they are also when sanctified the most pious, but the excuse was not valid: the invitation had been accepted before, the wife should have been induced to go with him, etc. Back of all this lies the thought, that worldly <em> gratification </em> hindered this one.
