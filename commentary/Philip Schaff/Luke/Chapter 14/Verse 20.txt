Luke 14:20.  I have married a wife.  According to the Mosaic law (Deuteronomy 24:5), a newly married man was free from military duty for a year. Hence the abrupt tone:  and therefore I cannot come.  Home engagements are often the most pressing, as they are also when sanctified the most pious, but the excuse was not valid: the invitation had been accepted before, the wife should have been induced to go with him, etc. Back of all this lies the thought, that worldly  gratification  hindered this one.
