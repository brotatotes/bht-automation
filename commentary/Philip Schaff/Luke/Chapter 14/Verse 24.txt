Luke 14:24.  For I say to you.  It is a question whether this is the language of the giver of the feast or of Christ in His own person. Our Lord is represented as ‘servant’ throughout the parable, and ‘my supper’ seems more appropriate in the mouth of the lord of the servant; but ‘you’ is plural, and we have no mention of any one else than the servant as present during the conversation. The whole discourse gains greater vividness and point, if we regard the parable as closed in Luke 14:23, and our Lord as directly applying it here. And this is the more likely, since the whole lesson of the parable is summed up in the words:  None of those men.... shall taste of my supper. As if He would say: This is the eating Dread in the kingdom of God, to which you look forward; though it is God’s feast, to which God has invited, it is ‘my supper,’ given in my honor, though I have come ‘in the form of a servant’ to invite you; and none of you will enter, because in refusing me, you refuse to obey the second summons of God who has before invited you through His word. This discourse probably increased the already pronounced hostility.
