Luke 14:27. See on Matthew 10:38; Matthew 16:24; Mark 8:34; Luke 9:23. While our Lord had foretold His death, He had not announced that He would be crucified  ; so that this saying must have sounded strangely to the multitude. Notice that both verses speak of  being  a disciple, not simply  becoming  one. The permanent requirement of discipleship is stated.
