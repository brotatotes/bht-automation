<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:31">Luke 14:31</span>. <strong> Or what king. </strong> The former illustration gives prominence to the <em> folly, </em> this to the <em> danger, </em> of following Christ, without due consideration of the requirements of discipleship (self-renunciation). Going to battle against overwhelming odds is dangerous folly. The king <strong> with ten thousand </strong> represents the man who would become a disciple, and the original indicates that this is all the force he can muster. The other king, <strong> with twenty thousand, </strong> represents God. For the natural man is at variance with God, and when one would become a Christian the first feeling is that God with His holy law is coming against him. The original indicates that the forces of this king are simply those he chooses to employ, not all he has. Success is hopeless, if we strive with Him. Here the inadequacy of our resources comes out.
