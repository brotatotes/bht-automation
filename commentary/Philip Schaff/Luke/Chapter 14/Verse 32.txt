Luke 14:32.  Asketh conditions of peace.  This represents our throwing ourselves upon God’s mercy in view of our own insufficiency. ‘A Christian’s weakness is his strength.’ Thus the previous illustration is supplemented. This making of peace opposes the view that the conflict is with Satan or with sin. We are naturally at peace with these. When we feel that Satan is too powerful an adversary, we do not make peace, or ask for an armistice, but ask God to help us, and until we turn to Him, we never feel that Satan is an adversary. Another reason for preferring the other interpretation is that it alone brings in a gospel thought of mercy, which would scarcely be wanting even in so severe a discourse.
