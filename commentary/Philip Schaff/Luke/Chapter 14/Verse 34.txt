<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:34">Luke 14:34</span>. <strong> Salt therefore is good. </strong> ‘Therefore’ connects this favorite aphorism with what precedes. It is good then to be my disciple, in the way of self-renunciation, and thus to be the means of conserving spiritual life among men, just as salt does in the natural world <strong> ;</strong> <strong> but if even the salt, </strong> which is very unnatural and unlikely, <strong> have lost its savor, </strong> if my disciple through a return to selfishness loses this peculiarity, <strong> where-with shall it be seasoned?</strong> Our Lord is warning from a human point of view, and not giving prominence to His own Almighty sustaining power, as in passages like <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:28-29">John 10:28-29</span>. The same remark applies to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:29">Luke 14:29</span>.
