Luke 14:34.  Salt therefore is good.  ‘Therefore’ connects this favorite aphorism with what precedes. It is good then to be my disciple, in the way of self-renunciation, and thus to be the means of conserving spiritual life among men, just as salt does in the natural world  ;  but if even the salt,  which is very unnatural and unlikely,  have lost its savor,  if my disciple through a return to selfishness loses this peculiarity,  where-with shall it be seasoned? Our Lord is warning from a human point of view, and not giving prominence to His own Almighty sustaining power, as in passages like John 10:28-29. The same remark applies to Luke 14:29.
