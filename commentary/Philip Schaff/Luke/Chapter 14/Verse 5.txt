<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:5">Luke 14:5</span>. <strong> If a son or an ox.</strong> The weight of authority is for the reading ‘a son.’ The thought then is: If on the Sabbath you help what is your own, then help others (love thy neighbor as thyself). The common reading; ‘an ass or an ox,’ suggests the same argument as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:15-16">Luke 13:15-16</span>; if you would do this for a dumb animal, much more for a human being.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Fallen into</strong> <strong> a well. </strong> As in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:15-16">Luke 13:15-16</span>, we find here an analogy between the case cited and the condition of the dropsical man; the danger in the well was that of drowning.
