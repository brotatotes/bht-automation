This section, peculiar to Luke, has been aptly styled ‘the Son of man eating and drinking.’ All the incidents occurred at a feast Luke 14:1; Luke 14:7). The parable of the Great Supper Luke 14:16-24) must be carefully distinguished from the similar one in Matthew 22:2-14 (that of the marriage feast of the king’s son). If chap. Luke 13:32-33, is taken literally, this feast occurred on one of the three days.
