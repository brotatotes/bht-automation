<p>This section, peculiar to Luke, has been aptly styled ‘the Son of man eating and drinking.’ All the incidents occurred at a feast <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:1">Luke 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:7">Luke 14:7</span>). The parable of the Great Supper <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:16-24">Luke 14:16-24</span>) must be carefully distinguished from the similar one in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:2-14">Matthew 22:2-14</span> (that of the marriage feast of the king’s son). If chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:32-33">Luke 13:32-33</span>, is taken literally, this feast occurred on one of the three days.
