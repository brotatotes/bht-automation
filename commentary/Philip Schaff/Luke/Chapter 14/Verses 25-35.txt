<p>THE discourse was delivered, on the way to Jerusalem, probably very shortly after the meal in the Phariseeâ€™s house (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:1-24">Luke 14:1-24</span>). The <em> place </em> was therefore Perea, and the <em> time </em> one of the three days referred to in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:32-33">Luke 13:32-33</span>.

The nearer He approached His own passion, the more decidedly must He test those who were following Him, revealing more and more the high requirements of discipleship. The seemingly stern language was uttered out of love, to prepare those in earnest for the realities before them, and to separate the wheat from the chaff.
