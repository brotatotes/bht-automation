Luke 14:29-30.  Lest haply,  etc. The probable consequence of any other way of proceeding is described: first, failure to finish; second, the mockery of others at the failure. The leading thought here enforced is  : entire self-renunciation is necessary to  be  a disciple of Christ. The building the tower represents the purpose and wish to be such a disciple; the counting the cost, the careful consideration of the requirements of discipleship (self-renunciation); then comes the question of ability to meet them. Our Lord does not say that if the means are insufficient the design should be given up, since He invites all to become His disciples. In one sense the means will always be insufficient, since no one is able of himself to meet these requirements; in another, they will always be sufficient, since we can ever look to Christ for strength. Our Lord here presses the one point of the great necessity for earnest consideration of the requirements He had announced and proper self-examination, in view of the folly of any other course, both then and now. The world has not laughed without reason at the half-Christianity which has resulted from such spasms of piety.
