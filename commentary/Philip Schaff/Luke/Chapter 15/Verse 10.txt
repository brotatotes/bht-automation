Luke 15:10.  He that is faithful,  etc. Lest it should seem strange that so much importance is attached to the proper use of perishing and unrighteous wealth, remember the great principle: ‘He that is faithful,’ etc.
	 That which is least,  or ‘a very little.’ This refers to earthly possessions, and the faithfulness is the wise and prudent conduct suggested by the parable.
	 In much.  In this case this is equivalent to: ‘the true riches,’ ‘your own,’ the inheritance and possession of the sons of the light. But the principle is general, and capable of a great variety of applications. This verse opposes the view that the service of mammon is meant in the parable, for according to that interpretation it is by being  unfaithful  to mammon that true fidelity is to be reached.
