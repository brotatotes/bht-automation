Such unfaithfulness proves us unfaithful in much (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:10">Luke 15:10</span>), according to the judgment of God, who will not therefore entrust us with <strong> the true riches. </strong> The word ‘riches’ is properly supplied in the translation, although the literal sense is ‘the true,’ that which is real, as opposed to the deceitful nature of earthly wealth.
