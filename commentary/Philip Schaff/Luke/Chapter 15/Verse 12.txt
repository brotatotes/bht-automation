<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:12">Luke 15:12</span>. <strong> In that which is anotherâ€™s. </strong> Earthly wealth is held in trust; the true riches are described as <strong> your own. </strong> Wealth can never form a part of our being, is never permanently in our possession; we can have the use of it, but in no true sense own it. But that which God gives to us as true riches will form a part of our eternal being, is our inalienable possession. Because this is so much higher, we are urged to be faithful in the use of worldly wealth, believing that it is not ours, but entrusted to us to test our fidelity.
