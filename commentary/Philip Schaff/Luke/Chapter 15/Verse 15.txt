Luke 15:15.  Joined himself.  Attached himself, as it were by force. He makes a determined effort to help himself, as he begins to feel his want
	 To  one of the citizens of that country.  Not to be directly interpreted of Satan, for the man was ‘one of the citizens.’ His business is  to feed swine,  unclean animals, so that the employment was degrading. There may be an allusion to the publicans, as in the employ   of an alien power, and engaged in a degrading duty. The main point is that he who, under a sinful impulse, sought to be released from a father’s supervision, is brought into the most abject dependence on a foreigner, who takes no care of him whatever. The freedom into which sin leads is slavery.
