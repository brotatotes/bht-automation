The literal translation of the E. V. corresponds with the coarse craving of his hunger.

These pods have a sweetish taste; are food for swine, but poor nourishment for men, although they could be eaten. It is uncertain whether the prodigal obtained even this poor food; if he did, it was taken from swine while he tended them.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> And no man gave to him. </strong> No one provided anything for his needs. This is the reason he so desired the swine’s food. Some explain the matter thus <strong> :</strong> The swine were fed, after the prodigal had driven them home; he saw them fed, craved a share, ‘and no man gave (even this) to him.’ We prefer the other view, as more direct and suggesting the unsatisfying nature of the ‘husks.’ This state of deepest want was the turning point.
