<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:17">Luke 15:17</span>. <strong> Came to himself. </strong> This implies that he had been <em> beside himself before. </em> A life of sin is in a certain sense irrational. The free will of the sinner is brought out, as it could not be in the two other parables. The seeking and saving, though necessary to make the prodigal come to himself, are kept in the back ground. The third scene now opens: the prodigal’s penitence. Notice, that the man came to himself more readily among the swine than among the harlots (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:30">Luke 15:30</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> He</strong> <strong> said. </strong> As the result and evidence of his coming to himself. He regards matters in their true light. The facts of the case are considered <strong> ;</strong> and he does not attempt to philosophize about his father’s mercy, etc., as alas too many sinners do, when seeming to repent.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> How many hired servants.</strong> These were the temporary laborers occupying the <em> lowest </em> place on the estate. The servants (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:22">Luke 15:22</span>.) would include those more trusted and honored. He was himself now only a ‘hired servant.’

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Of my father’s. </strong> His penitent thought is based on the feeling, lost while he was beside himself, that <em> he still has a father. </em> The sinner will thus reflect and repent only when he has some ground for this feeling. The true ground is to be found in Jesus Christ

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Have bread enough, </strong> etc. These lowest servants have abundance, <strong> and I</strong> (a son still, though so unworthy) <strong> perish with hunger. </strong> The contrast is made at every point. God’s Providential care is alluded to in this part of the parable.
