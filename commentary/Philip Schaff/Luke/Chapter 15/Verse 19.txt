<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:19">Luke 15:19</span>. <strong> I am no more worthy, </strong> etc. Genuine penitence!
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Make me as one, </strong> etc. He does not give up his sonship, but asks only the treatment given to a hireling, for he does not even deserve that. Some explain that he wished by fidelity in that position to prove himself again worthy <strong> ;</strong> but the parable must not be pressed here, since the penitent sinner has at first confused ideas of the return to God. The main point is, that <em> the prodigal makes no excuse for his sins, but acknowledges his unworthiness.
