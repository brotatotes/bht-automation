Luke 15:19.  I am no more worthy,  etc. Genuine penitence!
	 Make me as one,  etc. He does not give up his sonship, but asks only the treatment given to a hireling, for he does not even deserve that. Some explain that he wished by fidelity in that position to prove himself again worthy  ; but the parable must not be pressed here, since the penitent sinner has at first confused ideas of the return to God. The main point is, that  the prodigal makes no excuse for his sins, but acknowledges his unworthiness.
