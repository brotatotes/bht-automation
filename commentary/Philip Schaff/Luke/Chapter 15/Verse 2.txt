Luke 15:2.  What is this that I hear of thee,   i.e.,  explain this report.
	 Render the account of thy stewardship.  No previous reckoning had been made  : regular statements were then unusual.
	 Canst no longer be steward.  The correctness of the report is implied. The reference is to the certainty that each must render account at death to God. Death in every case is the consequence of the wasting of the Lordâ€™s goods. The prudence on the part of the steward began when he regarded his dismissal as certain, but took place before the dismissal itself. The reference to mammon as the lord is by no means so apt.
