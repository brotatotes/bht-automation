<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:27">Luke 15:27</span>. <strong> Thy brother is come. </strong> The servant states the case as it impresses him. He says nothing of the condition in which the prodigal returned, but simply that the father had <strong> received him safe and sound. </strong> No special interpretation is to be put upon this verse.
