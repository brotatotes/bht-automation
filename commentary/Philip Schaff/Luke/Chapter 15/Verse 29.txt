Luke 15:29.  Lo, for so many years do I serve thee.  The legal idea comes out here, pleading what has been done.
	 I never transgressed a commandment of thine.  The Pharisees virtually said this. The words of the elder son prove that his obedience in the past had not been hearty, and that he was now in opposition to his fathers will.
	 And yet thou never gavest me a kid.  In contrast with ‘the fatted calf.’
	 With my friends,  ‘respectable people,’ he implies, in contrast with ‘harlots.’ This proud, self-seeking, unaffection-ate son is now the lost son. Self-righteousness is dissatisfied with the reward it receives. The essential failure of Pharisaism is its want of love to God despite its external obedience.
