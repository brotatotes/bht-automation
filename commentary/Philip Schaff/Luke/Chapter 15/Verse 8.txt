Luke 15:8.  And his lord,   i.e.,  the lord of the steward, of course, not the Lord Jesus.
	 The unjust steward,  lit., ‘the steward of unrighteousness.’ This phrase stamps the conduct of the steward as immoral; and in this aspect as unworthy of imitation. But the point to which prominence is given follows  :  because he had acted wisely,  shrewdly, prudently. The master had discovered the trick, yet praises his steward  ; for in the parable both are  sons of this world,  or ‘age.’
	 Wiser  (not absolutely, but)  for their generation  (  i.e.,  in their dealings with one another, since the whole parable is drawn from that sphere)  than the sons of the light  (those who are really Christians). Worldly men act prudently toward one another. But the sons of the light in their dealings with one another (‘for their generation’), often lack the prudence here commended. In the use of money, in the use of all those powers committed to us by God, which find in ‘this world ‘the only sphere for their use, Christians too often fail to act with prudence. The steward carefully considered his situation; but Christians very often fail to look at their duty in the light of their knowledge, and to act as common sense would dictate, when once the premises about God and Christ, things temporal and eternal, are admitted. There is no  self-confessed folly  so great as that of a son of the light who lives as if   money-getting were the end of his existence. Of course there is a still higher wisdom implied.
