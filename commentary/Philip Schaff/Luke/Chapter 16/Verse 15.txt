<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:15">Luke 16:15</span>. <strong> Ye are they that justify yourselves, </strong> declare yourselves to be righteous <strong> in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts. </strong> Plainly implying that in His sight they were not justified, accounted as righteous. <strong> For that which is lofty among men, </strong> <em> i.e., </em> considered so by men.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Is abomination in the sight of God. </strong> Because He knows the heart, He judges differently from men, and precisely what men regard most highly He regards least. This general truth applies to the special case of the Pharisees. </p>
