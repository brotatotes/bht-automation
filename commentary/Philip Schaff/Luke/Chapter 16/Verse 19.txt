Luke 16:19.  A  certain rich man.  His name is not given, but he is often called  Dives,  which is the Latin word for ‘rich man.’ Tradition gives him a name (  Nineue),  but there is no proof that an actual person was referred to.
	 In purple. The costly material for upper garments, brought from Tyre.
	 Fine linen.  For under garments, from Egypt; some such was said to be worth twice its weight in gold.
	 Faring sumptuously every day.  He was not a glutton, nor recklessly extravagant, but he lived well, as a rich man could afford to do. There is no reason for supposing that he was a Sadducee; doubtless the rich among the Pharisees also lived according to their means and position. Nor is the man represented as specially a sinner. He was a ‘son of this world’ living to himself, without trying to make friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness. The parable teaches that such a one is punished after death
