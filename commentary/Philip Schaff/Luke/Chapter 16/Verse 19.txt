<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:19">Luke 16:19</span>. <strong> A</strong> <strong> certain rich man. </strong> His name is not given, but he is often called <em> Dives, </em> which is the Latin word for ‘rich man.’ Tradition gives him a name ( <em> Nineue), </em> but there is no proof that an actual person was referred to.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> In purple</strong>. The costly material for upper garments, brought from Tyre.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Fine linen. </strong> For under garments, from Egypt; some such was said to be worth twice its weight in gold.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Faring sumptuously every day. </strong> He was not a glutton, nor recklessly extravagant, but he lived well, as a rich man could afford to do. There is no reason for supposing that he was a Sadducee; doubtless the rich among the Pharisees also lived according to their means and position. Nor is the man represented as specially a sinner. He was a ‘son of this world’ living to himself, without trying to make friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness. The parable teaches that such a one is punished after death
