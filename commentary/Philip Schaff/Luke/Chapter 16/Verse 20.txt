Luke 16:20.  A certain beggar.  Introduced in contrast with the rich man, who is the principal figure.
	 Named Lazarus.  The significant name is mentioned in this case. It means ‘God a help,’ not, as some suppose, ‘helpless.’ The Lazarus of this parable has nothing save the name in common with Lazarus of Bethany. We infer from the name, as well as from the sequel, that the beggar was one who feared God.
	 Was laid at his gate.  The rich man thus had an opportunity of making a better use of his wealth, for the ‘gate’ was the only entrance to the house itself.
	 Full of sores.  Covered with them. They might have been the result of insufficient food.
