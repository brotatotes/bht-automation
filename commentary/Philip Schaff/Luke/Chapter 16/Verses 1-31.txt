<p>THIS <strong> </strong> division of the Gospel of Luke, embracing nearly one third of the whole, contains for the most part matter peculiar to this Evangelist. A number of the incidents probably belong to an earlier period of the history. A few of these are mentioned by Matthew and Mark, though the greater number even of these are peculiar to this account. But the larger portion of this division belongs to that part of our Lord’s life <em> passed aver in silence by Matthew and Mark.</em> John indeed tells us of much that occurred during this period, but he does not give a parallel account. Many theories have been suggested; our view is as follows: This division treats in the main of that part of the life of our Lord on earth, between the close of His ministry in Galilee and the <em> last journey </em> from Perea (beyond Jordan) to Jerusalem; covering a period of nearly six months. The reasons for this opinion are: that chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span> can only refer to the <em> final</em> departure from Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:1">Matthew 19:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:1">Mark 10:1</span>), and this departure seems to have been shortly before the sudden appearance of our Lord in Jerusalem at the feast of Tabernacles (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:14">John 7:14</span>); it is indeed possible that our Lord returned to Galilee after this visit, but of this there is no positive evidence. On the other hand, the blessing of the little children (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:15">Luke 18:15</span>), where the parallel with Matthew and Mark is renewed, undoubtedly took place just before the last solemn journey from Perea to Jerusalem and to death. From John’s account we learn that during this period our Lord appeared again in Jerusalem. In fact, that Gospel alone tells us of His journeyings to avoid the hostility of the Jews. Neither Matthew nor Mark implies that the journey from Galilee to Jerusalem, alluded to in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span>, was a direct one, while both state that such a journey was undertaken about this time.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> All who love the lessons of our Lord should rejoice that we have in this Gospel so much that is not only peculiar but important. The parables of this division are especially interesting, because uttered at a time when both the hostility of the Jews and the training of the disciples called for Truth more distinctively Christian. As in one sense the journey to death begins with this division, so do we here approach more closely the central truths of the gospel which centres in that death. The special questions of chronology will be discussed under the separate sections; but certainty on these points is impossible.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> THE journey to Jerusalem spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span> was probably that to the feast of Tabernacles; but in a wider sense, it was the final departure from Galilee to death at Jerusalem, since from this time on our Lord was rejected and persecuted openly by the Jews. The direct route was through Samaria, and on the way the incident of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:52-56">Luke 9:52-56</span> occurred. Some indeed suppose that our Lord, after this rebuff, did not pass through Samaria but skirted the borders between it and Perea (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:1-12">Matthew 19:1-12</span>); of this, however, there is no positive evidence. The main question is regarding the exact chronological position of the incident of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:57-62">Luke 9:57-62</span>; which Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:18-22">Matthew 8:18-22</span>) places just before the departure to Gadara. In favor of the order of Luke is the greater fulness of his account; in favor of that of Matthew, his mention of one who was a ‘scribe.’ Such language from a ‘scribe’ was more probable at the earlier point. The theory that such an incident occurred twice is highly improbable. There was no reason why Matthew should insert it out of its place; but it is so appropriate here, where our Lord’s <em> final departure</em> from Galilee is spoken of, that Luke probably placed it here for that reason. The whole section brings before us the four leading human temperaments: the choleric, sanguine, melancholic, and phlegmatic. Our Lord Himself had no temperament, but was the perfect man. On the question whether the sending out of the Seventy preceded this departure from Galilee, see next section.</p>
