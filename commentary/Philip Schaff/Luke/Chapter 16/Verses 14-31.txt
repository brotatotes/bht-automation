The response of the Pharisees (Luke 16:14) called forth another parable, in which another phase, of the same great truth is brought out, namely, that  neglect  of the proper application of wealth becomes the source of eternal calamity. The rich man is no great sinner, but a respectable worldly man, leading a godless life of selfishness  ; the poor man was one of a class despised by the ‘covetous.’ Thus the sneer of the Pharisees was answered. The object of the parable was not to make a new revelation about the future state, yet while using the popular language of the day on this subject, our Lord’s words must reveal the truth (see on Luke 16:22). Between the parable and the occasion of it (Luke 16:14), we find a number of thoughts (Luke 16:15-18), which had been expressed by our Lord on other occasions, all appropriate to the Pharisees at this time. The connection is however difficult to trace, see on Luke 16:16-17.
