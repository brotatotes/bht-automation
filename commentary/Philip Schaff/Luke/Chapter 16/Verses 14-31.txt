<p>The response of the Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:14">Luke 16:14</span>) called forth another parable, in which another phase, of the same great truth is brought out, namely, that <em> neglect </em> of the proper application of wealth becomes the source of eternal calamity. The rich man is no great sinner, but a respectable worldly man, leading a godless life of selfishness <strong> ;</strong> the poor man was one of a class despised by the ‘covetous.’ Thus the sneer of the Pharisees was answered. The object of the parable was not to make a new revelation about the future state, yet while using the popular language of the day on this subject, our Lord’s words must reveal the truth (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:22">Luke 16:22</span>). Between the parable and the occasion of it (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:14">Luke 16:14</span>), we find a number of thoughts (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:15-18">Luke 16:15-18</span>), which had been expressed by our Lord on other occasions, all appropriate to the Pharisees at this time. The connection is however difficult to trace, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:16-17">Luke 16:16-17</span>.
