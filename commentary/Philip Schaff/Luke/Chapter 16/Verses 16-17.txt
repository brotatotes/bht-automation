Luke 16:16-17. These verses may be thus paraphrased  : ‘I have said that you are not justified in the sight of God, but are an abomination; and the standard of this judgment is one that you acknowledge.’
	 The law and the prophets were until John,  that completed the preparatory work, and  since that time the kingdom of God has been preached, and every one  (people of all classes, publicans and sinners)  forceth his way into it; but,   lest you might infer that I deny your righteousness by some new rule, I declare to you,  it  is easier,  etc., Matthew 11:12-13; Matthew 5:18.
