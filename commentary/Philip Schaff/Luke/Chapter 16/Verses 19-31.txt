<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:19-31">Luke 16:19-31</span>. THE PARABLE OF THE RICH MAN AND LAZARUS. After rebuking the Pharisees, our Lord enforces the teaching which they derided by means of this parable. The two characters simply represent the classes to which they belong. All attempts to find deeper allusions are unsuccessful, for example, that Herod and John are meant, or Judaism and heathenism.
