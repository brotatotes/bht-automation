Luke 16:27-28.  I pray thee therefore,  etc. His brethren were living as he had done. ‘This is the  believing and trembling  of James 2:9. His eyes are now opened to the truth  ; and no wonder that his natural sympathies are awakened for his brethren. That a  lost spirit  should feel and express such sympathy is not to be wondered at; the misery of such will be very much heightened by the awakened and active state of those higher faculties and feelings which selfishness and the body kept down here.’ Alford.
