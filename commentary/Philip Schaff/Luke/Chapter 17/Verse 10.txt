Luke 17:10.  Even so ye also.  The application, here plainly made, is that nothing can be claimed in God’s service on the ground of merit. Even ‘the Apostles’ (Luke 17:5) could make no such claim. The verse should guard the interpretation of the parable of the unjust steward from the idea that earthly wealth can  buy  heavenly favor. From God we can claim nothing, save as He has promised it.
	 When ye have done all,  etc. Our Lord does not say that they would or could do all. The fact that none have done so, makes the argument the stronger.
	 Say we are unprofitable servants,  etc. ‘Unprofitable’ here does not have a bad sense. Any profit or merit would arise from the servant’s doing  more  than his duty, but if he did all his duty, while no blame could attach to him, no merit could be allowed. Thus all works of supererogation are denied, and all claim on the ground of our goodness or fidelity. The moral necessity for justification of faith, afterwards so plainly stated by Paul, is found in this verse; but He who uttered it is Himself the Object of that faith. He was kind and merciful in thus speaking, for the words, apparently severe, are not only true, but so necessary to keep our pride from leading us away from Christ. It is better that we should confess to the Master: ‘we are unprofitable servants,’ than that He should call us so (Matthew 25:30). With this thought, the series of discourses closes.
