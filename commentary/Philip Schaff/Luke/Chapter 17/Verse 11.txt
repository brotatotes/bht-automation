Luke 17:11.  As they were on their way to Jerusalem.  The correct reading leaves the time quite indefinite; comp. chap. Luke 9:51.
	 Between Samaria and Galilee.  This seems to be the sense of the correct reading. There is no such journey recorded by any of the Evangelists except that from Galilee about the time of the Feast of Tabernacles. There is no hint (unless this verse be an exception), that He ever approached Galilee after that time. Our Lord at that time passed into Samaria, but after the rejection mentioned by Luke (Luke 9:52-56) skirted the borders for a time, probably from west to east, reaching Jerusalem by the valley of the Jordan. It may be that He passed through Perea at this time, but   this is not certain. Samaria is mentioned first, because it was nearest to Jerusalem, which had just been named. The E. V.   ‘through the midst of Samaria and Galilee,’ implies a journey directly through the middle, first of Samaria, then of Galilee, towards Jerusalem; which is an absurdity, Samaria lying between Galilee and Jerusalem.
