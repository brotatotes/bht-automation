<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Go and shew yourselves</strong>, etc. This command followed the healing in the first miracle of this kind recorded in the Gospels (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:4">Matthew 8:4</span>); here it precedes it. Our Lord would test their faith by their obedience, and, as it further appears, teach a lesson respecting love and gratitude, useful for the church in all ages.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> As they went, </strong> or, ‘were going,’ on the way, <strong> they were cleansed. </strong> While they obeyed, not because of their obedience, but because of the faith it expressed, they were healed. No one need wait to know all the truth before he can really believe and be saved; let him believe what he has heard the Lord say; if he really believes he will act accordingly, and the spiritual healing promised to faith will come from the Saviour. Personal faith in a personal Lord Jesus Christ is commanded; fuller knowledge will come afterwards and serve to increase the faith.
