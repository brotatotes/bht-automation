Our Lord had, as we supposed, first taken final leave of Galilee, where His popularity had been greatest, but which gradually closed against Him. The nine were Galileans, and represented the ingratitude of their district, our Lordâ€™s own home. The incident is prophetic of the reception accorded to Christ by the Jews and heathen respectively.

Some gratitude they had, but the  personal  gratitude which takes the form of  lave  they lacked. They had enough of faith to receive bodily healing, but it is left uncertain whether they received any spiritual benefit.
