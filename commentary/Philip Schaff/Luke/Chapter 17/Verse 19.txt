<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:19">Luke 17:19</span>. <strong> Thy faith hath made thee whole, </strong> or ‘saved thee.’ Salvation in the highest sense is meant. The faith which the man had manifested was more than the faith of the other nine; it was a hand opened to receive higher spiritual blessings. The man’s obedience, praise to God, gratitude, love, were only evidences of ‘faith.’ Real faith manifests itself in obedience and love. As leprosy most aptly represents our sinfulness, so our Lord’s dealings with lepers most plainly illustrate His method in saving us from sin.
