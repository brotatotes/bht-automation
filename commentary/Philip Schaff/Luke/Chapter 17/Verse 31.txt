This has no reference to the destruction of Jerusalem, as Matthew 24:16-18, but to the future coming of the Messiah. ‘In that day,’ the same haste and abandonment of earthly possessions will be called for, which was required of Lot and his family (Genesis 19:17). The catastrophe immediately preceding the coming of the Messiah, which is described in Matthew 24:29-31, is here referred to. How far an actual physical flight is implied cannot, of course, be determined.
