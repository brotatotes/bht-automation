Luke 17:32.  Remember Lot’s wife.  See Genesis 19:20. Her crime was still paying attention to what had been left behind in Sodom, her punishment was destruction while apparently on the way to safety. She has become ‘the type of earthly-mindedness and self-seeking.’ This caution was appropriate to ‘disciples,’ since Lot’s wife represents, not those entirely careless, but those who have taken a step towards salvation, and yet do not hold out in the hour of decisive trial.
