Luke 17:33.  Shall seek to gain,  etc. There are two views of this verse: (1.) The seeking to gain, takes place throughout the preceding life, and the loss at the final catastrophe. (2.) The seeking to gain, takes place at the catastrophe, and the loss at the decisive moment of the coming Christ Matthew 10:39, which refers to the whole previous life, favors the former view.
	 Whosoever shall have lost his life,   i.e.,  shall not have counted his life dear to him in comparison with Christ.
	 Will preserve,  or, ‘quicken’ it.   The word is derived from animal parturition, as if the events of that day were represented as the pangs of travail resulting in the new and glorious life of the believer. Comp. Matthew 24:8. In this part of the verse, also, the reference to the whole preceding life seems more appropriate.
