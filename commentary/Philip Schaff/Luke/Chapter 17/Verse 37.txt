Luke 17:37.  Where, Lord?   The Pharisees had inquired in regard to the  time;  the disciples ask about the  place,  with special reference to the separation just spoken of. They did not understand its universality. The answer of our Lord:  where the body is,  etc., proclaims this universality. In Matthew 24:28, we find precisely the same thought, ‘carcass’ being substituted for ‘body.’ There, however, a reference to the destruction of Jerusalem is probably included; here the second coming of Christ alone is spoken of. The principle is general.
