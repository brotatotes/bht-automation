<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:37">Luke 17:37</span>. <strong> Where, Lord</strong>? <strong> </strong> The Pharisees had inquired in regard to the <em> time; </em> the disciples ask about the <em> place, </em> with special reference to the separation just spoken of. They did not understand its universality. The answer of our Lord: <strong> where the body is, </strong> etc., proclaims this universality. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:28">Matthew 24:28</span>, we find precisely the same thought, ‘carcass’ being substituted for ‘body.’ There, however, a reference to the destruction of Jerusalem is probably included; here the second coming of Christ alone is spoken of. The principle is general. </p>
