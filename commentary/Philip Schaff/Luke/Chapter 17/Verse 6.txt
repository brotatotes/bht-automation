<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> This sycamine tree. </strong> The discourse was probably uttered in the open air, and the tree near by, as the mountains were on the other occasions when a similar saying was uttered. The mulberry tree seems to be meant, not the sycamore (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:4">Luke 19:4</span>). Some argue that the latter is meant, because it is more common in Palestine and a sturdier tree; but the original points to the former. The promise here given is even stronger than that in Matthew, for the tree is represented as being <strong> planted in the sea, </strong> where growth is ordinarily impossible.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> And it</strong> <strong> should obey you; </strong> the tree being represented a living thing. This promise is misunderstood, only when miracles of power are put above miracles of grace. The whole passage may be thus paraphrased: You think the duties I enjoin too hard for your faith, but this shows that you have as yet no faith of the high order you ought to have, for the smallest measure of such a faith would enable you to do what seems altogether impossible in the natural world; and <em> so much the more </em> in spiritual things, since real faith is preeminently spiritual power.
