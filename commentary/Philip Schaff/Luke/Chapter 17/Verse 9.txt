Luke 17:9.  Doth he thank,  etc. Then it was not the custom to do so; and that it is so now is owing solely to the influence of the religion of Christ. On the former fact the illustration is based, from the latter we infer that our Lord is not saying what ought to be done by an earthly master. God is never bound to thank us for our service, as an earthly master might be, and the whole parable is directed against our choosing to remain in the relation of servants instead of accepting that of sons. If we want wages for our work, then we are servants.
