<p>CHRONOLOGY. The date of this incident has been much discussed. It evidently belongs to the general journey to Jerusalem spoken of in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span>. Robinson and many other harmonists place it at the beginning of the journey, just after the rejection by the Samaritan village chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:52-56">Luke 9:52-56</span>). The preceding chapters (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:10">Luke 13:10</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:10">Luke 17:10</span>) narrate what can be most naturally placed in Perea, and what follows (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:20">Luke 17:20</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:34">Luke 18:34</span>) also belongs to that district, since Matthew and Mark distinctly affirm this in regard to a number of the incidents. But we find no distinct evidence of any other journey which would touch upon the borders of Samaria and Galilee, except the one referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span>, and also in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:1">Matthew 19:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:1">Mark 10:1</span>. Other views: (1) That all the previous incidents belong to Galilee, and that this is a journey from Galilee to Jericho (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:35">Luke 18:35</span>). (2) This healing took place during an excursion from Ephraim (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:54">John 11:54</span>), or (3) during the journey from Ephraim to Jerusalem (Andrews); the raising of Lazarus having occurred after the discourse last recorded. But of this there is no proof, and ‘Galilee’ was too far off to be even skirted in such a journey.
