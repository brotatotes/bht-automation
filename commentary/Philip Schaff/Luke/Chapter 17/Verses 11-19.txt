CHRONOLOGY. The date of this incident has been much discussed. It evidently belongs to the general journey to Jerusalem spoken of in chap. Luke 9:51. Robinson and many other harmonists place it at the beginning of the journey, just after the rejection by the Samaritan village chap. Luke 9:52-56). The preceding chapters (Luke 13:10 to Luke 17:10) narrate what can be most naturally placed in Perea, and what follows (Luke 17:20 to Luke 18:34) also belongs to that district, since Matthew and Mark distinctly affirm this in regard to a number of the incidents. But we find no distinct evidence of any other journey which would touch upon the borders of Samaria and Galilee, except the one referred to in Luke 9:51, and also in Matthew 19:1; Mark 10:1. Other views: (1) That all the previous incidents belong to Galilee, and that this is a journey from Galilee to Jericho (Luke 18:35). (2) This healing took place during an excursion from Ephraim (John 11:54), or (3) during the journey from Ephraim to Jerusalem (Andrews); the raising of Lazarus having occurred after the discourse last recorded. But of this there is no proof, and ‘Galilee’ was too far off to be even skirted in such a journey.
