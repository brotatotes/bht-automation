<p>CHRONOLOGY. We connect this discourse with that ending in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:10">Luke 17:10</span>, placing the whole in Perea, just before the final departure for Jericho and Jerusalem. Chap, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:15-34">Luke 18:15-34</span>, contains incidents to which Matthew and Mark distinctly assign this time and place, and there is no indication of any long interval between this section and that, while the discourses and events have an internal connection. Meyer and others think that all up to chap, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:30">Luke 18:30</span>, belongs to the journey on the borders of Samaria and Galilee, but this involves a difficulty which they admit, and which seems needless. This section contains much that was repeated in the discourse on the Mount of Olives just before the crucifixion, but at the same time much that is peculiar.
