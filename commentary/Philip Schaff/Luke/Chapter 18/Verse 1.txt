Comp. 1 Thessalonians 5:17: ‘Pray without ceasing.’ The latter refers to the believer’s prevailing frame of mind; this, to unwearied petition for the same object believed to be in accordance with God’s will. It shows the conflict of prayer in the distressed and suffering disciple.
	 Not to faint,  not to be discouraged. The danger of discouragement arises from the delay in receiving an answer, while the ‘adversary’ continues to harass.’
