<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:10">Luke 18:10</span>. <strong> Two men went up into the temple to pray. </strong> The temple was on an elevation. Since the Passover was approaching, and some of his hearers were probably on their way to Jerusalem to worship in the temple, the reference is very apt.
