<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:11">Luke 18:11</span>. <strong> The Pharisee stood. </strong> The publican also stood, but the word here used implies that the Pharisee took a position of confidence, a conspicuous one at all events (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:5">Matthew 6:5</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Prayed thus with himself, </strong> <em> i.e., </em> to himself, not orally, since he would hardly venture to speak thus. But the phrase doubtless alludes to the fact that his prayer was not really a communing with God, but a communing with himself.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> God, I thank thee. </strong> He did not thank God, but boasted. It is possible to thank God for what we do and become more than others (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:9-10">1 Corinthians 15:9-10</span>), but such a thanksgiving springs out of the most profound humility.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Not as the rest of men. </strong> Self-righteousness sets at nought, not ‘others,’ but ‘the rest of men;’ as if no one else could be so acceptable to God. The Pharisee then subdivides the rest of men into classes: <strong> extortioners, unjust </strong> (in the restricted sense of those who act unjustly, illegally), <strong> adulterers </strong> (to be taken literally), <strong> or even as this publican. </strong> ‘Even’ is contemptuous; it does not imply that he considered the publican as less unworthy than the other classes. The thanksgiving was not for freedom from these sins, but for his superiority to sinners; and he introduces the concrete and actual sinner (the publican).
