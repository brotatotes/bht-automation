Luke 18:12.  I fast twice in the week.  His acts, he affirms, surpass the requirements of God’s law. But one fast was commanded in the law, namely, on the great day of atonement (Leviticus 16:29; Numbers 29:7). These were therefore private fasts. Mondays and Thursdays were the usual fast days. Comp. Matthew 6:16-18.
	 I give tithes of all that I get,  not of what he possessed, but of what he gained. The law required tithes only of the fruits of the field, flocks, and herds (Leviticus 27:30; Numbers 18:21; Deuteronomy 14:22; comp., however, Genesis 14:20; Genesis 28:22). This gain, he felt, was due to his own prudence, and yet, he says, I give God more than He claims in the law. It is easier to see the folly of the Pharisee’s prayer than to cease offering it ourselves.
