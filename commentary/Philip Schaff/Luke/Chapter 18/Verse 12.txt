<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:12">Luke 18:12</span>. <strong> I fast twice in the week. </strong> His acts, he affirms, surpass the requirements of God’s law. But one fast was commanded in the law, namely, on the great day of atonement (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+16:29">Leviticus 16:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="nu+29:7">Numbers 29:7</span>). These were therefore private fasts. Mondays and Thursdays were the usual fast days. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:16-18">Matthew 6:16-18</span>.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> I give tithes of all that I get, </strong> not of what he possessed, but of what he gained. The law required tithes only of the fruits of the field, flocks, and herds (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+27:30">Leviticus 27:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="nu+18:21">Numbers 18:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="de+14:22">Deuteronomy 14:22</span>; comp., however, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:20">Genesis 14:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+28:22">Genesis 28:22</span>). This gain, he felt, was due to his own prudence, and yet, he says, I give God more than He claims in the law. It is easier to see the folly of the Pharisee’s prayer than to cease offering it ourselves.
