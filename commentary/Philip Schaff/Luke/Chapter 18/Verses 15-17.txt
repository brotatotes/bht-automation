Luke 18:15-17. CHILDREN BROUGHT TO CHRIST. See on Matthew 19:13-15; Mark 10:13-16.
	 Their infants  (Luke 18:15). Luke is more exact here.
	 Called them  (Luke 18:16),  i.e., the infants. Peculiar to Luke. The call to the infants could be obeyed only by the parents. Luke omits all mention of the  act  of blessing.
	 Luke 18:18-30. THE QUESTION OF A RICH RULER, and subsequent conversations. See on Matthew 19:16-30; Mark 10:17-31. The narrative of Luke closely resembles that of Mark, but is briefer. One new detail is presented, that this man was a ruler   (Luke 18:18).
	 Luke 18:31-34. THE FULLER PROPHECY OF OUR LORD’S PASSION.   See on Matthew 20:17-19; Mark 10:32-34. In all three accounts this conversation marks the final journeying to Jerusalem. The reference to the prophets in Luke 18:31 and the whole of Luke 18:34 are peculiar to Luke. He omits any mention of the betrayal, which is distinctly announced by Matthew and implied in Mark’s account.
