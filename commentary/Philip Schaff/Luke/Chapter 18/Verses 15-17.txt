<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Their infants </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:15">Luke 18:15</span>). Luke is more exact here.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Called them </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:16">Luke 18:16</span>), <em> i.e.,</em> the infants. Peculiar to Luke. The call to the infants could be obeyed only by the parents. Luke omits all mention of the <em> act </em> of blessing.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:18-30">Luke 18:18-30</span>. THE QUESTION OF A RICH RULER, and subsequent conversations. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:16-30">Matthew 19:16-30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:17-31">Mark 10:17-31</span>. The narrative of Luke closely resembles that of Mark, but is briefer. One new detail is presented, that this man was a ruler <strong> </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:18">Luke 18:18</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:31-34">Luke 18:31-34</span>. THE FULLER PROPHECY OF OUR LORD’S PASSION. <strong> </strong> See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:17-19">Matthew 20:17-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:32-34">Mark 10:32-34</span>. In all three accounts this conversation marks the final journeying to Jerusalem. The reference to the prophets in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:31">Luke 18:31</span> and the whole of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:34">Luke 18:34</span> are peculiar to Luke. He omits any mention of the betrayal, which is distinctly announced by Matthew and implied in Mark’s account.
