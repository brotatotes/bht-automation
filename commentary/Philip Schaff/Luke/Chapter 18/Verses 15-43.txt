<p>FROM this point on, Lukeâ€™s account is strictly parallel with those of Matthew and Mark. He does not, however, mention the locality (Perea). We group the rest of the chapter together, as the events succeeded each other in chronological order. Luke introduces few new details. See the parallel passages. There is often a remarkable verbal agreement with the account of Mark. The conversation about divorce, with which Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:1-12">Matthew 19:1-12</span>) and Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:2-12">Mark 10:2-12</span>) begin their account of the Perean discourses, is omitted here.
