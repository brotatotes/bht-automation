Luke 18:35-43. THE HEALING OF THE BLIND BEGGAR NEAR JERICHO. See on Matthew 20:29-34; Mark 10:46-52; especially the latter passage, with which this account closely agrees. The main difference is found in Luke 18:35:  As he drew near to Jericho.  Mark: ‘as He went out of Jericho.’ This miracle can scarcely have occurred after the events recorded in chap. Luke 9:1-27, especially as Luke 18:28 is so definite as regards time. We accept the explanation, that the miracle took place during an excursion from Jericho to some place in the neighborhood (probably as they went out); that on the return to Jericho the events of the next chapter occurred. At Jericho our Lord would meet many of His Galilean followers on the way to the Passover. Hence a brief stay in that city is the more probable.
	 They that went before  (Luke 18:39). Matthew: ‘the multitude;’ Mark: ‘many.’ Luke’s expression conveys more distinctly the impression that our Lord’s followers were gathering about Him in a manner almost festal.
