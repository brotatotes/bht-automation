The parable was spoken in the house, probably from the open room looking into the court, where a good part of the multitude that had followed Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:3">Luke 19:3</span>), had doubtless remained and murmured (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:7">Luke 19:7</span>).

Jerusalem was so near, that this was immediately expected; the more since our Lord had just spoken of the actual coming of the Son of man (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:10">Luke 19:10</span>). The parable was designed to controvert the idea that the glory of the Messianic kingdom would appear at once, without a previous separation of the Master from His servants, to whom He would return as King.
