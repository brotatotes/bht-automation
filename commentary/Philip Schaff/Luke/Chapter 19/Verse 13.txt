<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:13">Luke 19:13</span>. <strong> Ten servants of his. </strong> The number is given here, but not in the other parable; comp. the <em> ten </em> virgins, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:1">Matthew 25:1</span>.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Ten pounds, </strong> or, ‘minæ.’ To each one; not to each ‘according to his several ability’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:5">Matthew 25:5</span>). In the other case the man is represented as committing his whole property to his servants; here the sums are ‘very little’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:17">Luke 19:17</span>). The Attic mina, which is probably meant, was the sixtieth part of a talent, and = $15-$17. The Hebrew mina was even smaller. The one equal official gift seems to be referred to here, not the spiritual ‘talents’ which differ in extent.
