Luke 19:13.  Ten servants of his.  The number is given here, but not in the other parable; comp. the  ten  virgins, Matthew 25:1.
	 Ten pounds,  or, ‘minæ.’ To each one; not to each ‘according to his several ability’ (Matthew 25:5). In the other case the man is represented as committing his whole property to his servants; here the sums are ‘very little’ (Luke 19:17). The Attic mina, which is probably meant, was the sixtieth part of a talent, and = $15-$17. The Hebrew mina was even smaller. The one equal official gift seems to be referred to here, not the spiritual ‘talents’ which differ in extent.
	 Trade herewith till I come,   i.e.  ,  while I go and return.
