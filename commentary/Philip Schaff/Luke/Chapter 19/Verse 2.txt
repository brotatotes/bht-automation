Luke 19:2.  Zaccheus.  The name is the Hebrew word meaning ‘pure,’ with a Greek ending attached to it. He was therefore of Jewish origin (comp. Luke 19:9).
	 A chief publican.  Probably the superintendent of the ordinary tax-gatherers. The practice of farming out the revenues to the Roman knights encouraged extortion. Zaccheus was probably the chief agent of the person who held the privilege from the government. The revenue in Jericho was doubtless considerable, and mainly derived from taxes on the  balsam  so abundantly produced in the neighborhood, all along the banks of the Jordan.
	 And he was rich.  This is mentioned, to prepare the way for the language of Luke 19:8.
