<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:27">Luke 19:27</span>. <strong> But </strong> ( = but in addition to this sentence) <strong> these mine enemies. </strong> Still the language of the king to the attending officers.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Slay them before me. </strong> This strong expression sets forth the hopelessness and severity of the punishment which shall fall upon those who oppose Christ as King. It did not seem strange to those who heard the parable; for such vengeance was then only too common. To us it is a figure, first, of the punishment which fell upon Jerusalem; and secondly, of punishment, which is to follow the final judgment. Thus the parable has a primary application to the disciples and the Jewish nation, and then a wider one to the Christian ministry in general and the opposing world.
