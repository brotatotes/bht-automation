<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:34">Luke 19:34</span>. The best authorities insert after <strong> they said </strong> a word which may either be a sign of quotation, or mean ‘because.’ The last clause of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:31">Luke 19:31</span> corresponds exactly, and the translation must be <strong> </strong> the same in both cases, though the sense is not affected.
