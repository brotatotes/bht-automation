<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:38">Luke 19:38</span>. <strong> Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. </strong> Here Luke, by a poetic parallelism, paraphrases the ‘Hosanna’ mentioned by the other Evangelists.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:39-40">Luke 19:39-40</span>. THE MURMUR OF THE PHARISEES. Peculiar to Luke.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Some of the Pharisees from the multitude, </strong> etc. Evidently not of His <strong> disciples, </strong> whom they would have Him <strong> rebuke.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> Master,  or, ‘Teacher.’ They objected to the cry of the disciples, because it recognized Him as more than a ‘Teacher.’ They would, however, hold Him responsible for what they held to be unwise and unwarranted enthusiasm.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> If these should hold their peace, the stones, </strong> etc. A proverbial expression, to show that this outburst could not and ought not to be restrained, and thus a most pointed rebuke of the objectors. There is possibly an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:11">Habakkuk 2:11</span>; and probably an intimation that the stones of the temple, which now reechoed the Hosannas, should in the future proclaim the judgments of the Lord, and thus acknowledge Christ as King.
