Luke 19:38.  Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.  Here Luke, by a poetic parallelism, paraphrases the ‘Hosanna’ mentioned by the other Evangelists.
	 Luke 19:39-40. THE MURMUR OF THE PHARISEES. Peculiar to Luke.
	 Some of the Pharisees from the multitude,  etc. Evidently not of His  disciples,  whom they would have Him  rebuke.

	 If these should hold their peace, the stones,  etc. A proverbial expression, to show that this outburst could not and ought not to be restrained, and thus a most pointed rebuke of the objectors. There is possibly an allusion to Habakkuk 2:11; and probably an intimation that the stones of the temple, which now reechoed the Hosannas, should in the future proclaim the judgments of the Lord, and thus acknowledge Christ as King.
