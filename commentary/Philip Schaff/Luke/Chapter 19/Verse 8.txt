<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:8">Luke 19:8</span>. <strong> And Zaccheus stood. </strong> The same word as in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:11">Luke 18:11</span>. Here it implies that he came forward and took a stand, in a formal way <strong> </strong> with joyful decision. This probably took place shortly after our Lord had entered the house.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> The half of my goods I give to the poor. </strong> It is improbable that Zaccheus had already done so; this is the announcement of his purpose.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> And if </strong> I <strong> have, </strong> etc. This does not imply uncertainty, but is a milder form of saying ‘whatever I have,’ etc.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Wrongfully exacted. </strong> The word is derived from that equivalent to ‘sycophant.’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> I restore fourfold. </strong> Restitution from double to fivefold, was commanded in the case of theft (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:1-7">Exodus 22:1-7</span>); hence this is, by implication, a confession of theft.
