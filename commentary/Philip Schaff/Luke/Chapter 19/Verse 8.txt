Luke 19:8.  And Zaccheus stood.  The same word as in chap. Luke 18:11. Here it implies that he came forward and took a stand, in a formal way   with joyful decision. This probably took place shortly after our Lord had entered the house.
	 The half of my goods I give to the poor.  It is improbable that Zaccheus had already done so; this is the announcement of his purpose.
	 And if  I  have,  etc. This does not imply uncertainty, but is a milder form of saying ‘whatever I have,’ etc.
	 Wrongfully exacted.  The word is derived from that equivalent to ‘sycophant.’
	 I restore fourfold.  Restitution from double to fivefold, was commanded in the case of theft (Exodus 22:1-7); hence this is, by implication, a confession of theft.
