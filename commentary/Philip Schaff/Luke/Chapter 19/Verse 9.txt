<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Forasmuch as </strong> (the older editions of the E. V. read: ‘forsomuch as’). The reason salvation had come was, that <strong> he also, </strong> as well as the other Jews, who despised him as a sinner (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:7">Luke 19:7</span>), was a <strong> son of Abraham, </strong> having now availed himself of his rights as a Jew in thus receiving the Lord. The promised restitution did not bring salvation. Nor was he a Gentile who became by repentance ‘a son of Abraham;’ had he been a Gentile, mention would have been made of it in the hostile murmurs (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:7">Luke 19:7</span>).
