Luke 19:9.  Salvation,  in the fullest sense.
	 Forasmuch as  (the older editions of the E. V. read: ‘forsomuch as’). The reason salvation had come was, that  he also,  as well as the other Jews, who despised him as a sinner (Luke 19:7), was a  son of Abraham,  having now availed himself of his rights as a Jew in thus receiving the Lord. The promised restitution did not bring salvation. Nor was he a Gentile who became by repentance ‘a son of Abraham;’ had he been a Gentile, mention would have been made of it in the hostile murmurs (Luke 19:7).
