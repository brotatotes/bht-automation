ZACCHEUS THE PUBLICAN. The incident is peculiar to Luke, and is a proof of independence. ‘The fundamental idea of Luke’s Gospel demanded that the favor shown to the rich publican should not be omitted. Matthew and Mark are so intent upon depicting the great procession to the feast in its unity, that they cannot linger upon another episode, such as that of Zaccheus, in addition to the healing of the blind man. Matthew indeed, being himself a publican, might hesitate through modesty to record prominently so many instance of favor shown to the publicans; and Mark, writing chiefly for Roman Christians, would probably prefer to omit a new remembrance of the embittered hatred which subsisted between the Jews and the Romans’ (Lange).
