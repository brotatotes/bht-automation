THE PARABLE OF THE TEN POUNDS. Probably spoken in the house of Zaccheus. The parable resembles that of the ‘talents’ (Matthew 25:14-30) sufficiently to make the careless reader confound the two, but the distinction between them is marked, and the theory which identifies them is inconsistent with the trustworthiness of the Evangelists as witnesses to our Lord’s words. The later parable (in Matthew) is the more complicated one, and was addressed to the disciples alone. The points of difference are indicated in the notes on that passage, and recalled here under the separate verses.
