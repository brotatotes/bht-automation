<p>Luke agrees closely with the other Evangelists in the account of the entry to Jerusalem. He mentions in addition a murmur of the Pharisees and our Lord’s reply (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:39-40">Luke 19:39-40</span>), as well as the fact that He wept over the city (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:41-42">Luke 19:41-42</span>); and then, after the cleansing of the temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:45-46">Luke 19:45-46</span>), he gives a general description (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:47-48">Luke 19:47-48</span>), of the Master’s activity during the last days of His public teaching, the particulars being recorded in chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:1">Luke 20:1</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:6">Luke 21:6</span>.
