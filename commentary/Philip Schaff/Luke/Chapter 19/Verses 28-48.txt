Luke agrees closely with the other Evangelists in the account of the entry to Jerusalem. He mentions in addition a murmur of the Pharisees and our Lord’s reply (Luke 19:39-40), as well as the fact that He wept over the city (Luke 19:41-42); and then, after the cleansing of the temple (Luke 19:45-46), he gives a general description (Luke 19:47-48), of the Master’s activity during the last days of His public teaching, the particulars being recorded in chaps. Luke 20:1 to Luke 21:6.
