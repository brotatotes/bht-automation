<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:11">Luke 2:11</span>. <strong> Unto you.</strong> <em> </em> This refers directly to the shepherds, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:10">Luke 2:10</span> <strong> ,</strong> confirming the view, that they were men who expected the Messiah.

The latter instance shows that they understood it at once. The reference to the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:2">Micah 5:2</span>, was probably plain to the pious shepherds.

Not a mere temporal deliverer, as appears from what follows: <strong> who is Christ the Lord</strong>. This is the only place where these words come together in this form. The first means ‘the Messiah,’ and could not be otherwise understood; the second has already been used twice (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:9">Luke 2:9</span>) of God, and is the word used in the LXX. to translate the Hebrew Jehovah. We therefore understand the angelic message, this first Gospel statement of the Person of Christ, to mean that the child born in Bethlehem as a Saviour, was the promised Messiah, Jehovah.</p>
