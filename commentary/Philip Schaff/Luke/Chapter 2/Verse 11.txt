Luke 2:11.  Unto you.   This refers directly to the shepherds, as in Luke 2:10  , confirming the view, that they were men who expected the Messiah.
	 In the  city of David. Bethlehem; comp. Luke 2:4; Luke 2:15. The latter instance shows that they understood it at once. The reference to the prophecy in Micah 5:2, was probably plain to the pious shepherds.

The first means ‘the Messiah,’ and could not be otherwise understood; the second has already been used twice (Luke 2:9) of God, and is the word used in the LXX. to translate the Hebrew Jehovah. We therefore understand the angelic message, this first Gospel statement of the Person of Christ, to mean that the child born in Bethlehem as a Saviour, was the promised Messiah, Jehovah.
