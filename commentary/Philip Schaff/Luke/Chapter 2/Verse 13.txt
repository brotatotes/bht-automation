Luke 2:13.  A multitude of the heavenly host,    i.e.,   angels, who are represented as a host surrounding the throne of God (1 Kings 22:19; 2 Chronicles 18:18; Psalms 103:21; Daniel 7:10; Matthew 26:53; Revelation 19:14). Nothing is said as to whether the song was in the air or on the earth; probably it was heard by the shepherds alone.
