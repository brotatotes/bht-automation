Although Joseph is less prominent in the account before us, he must have been convinced. This verse gives the greater prominence to the naming   of the Saviour, but the circumcision has a significance. He was made under the law, that He might redeem us from the law. As a sinless Being this rite was not necessary for Him, but as a born Jew, and as One who fulfilled the law for us, He was circumcised.
