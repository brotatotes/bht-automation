This naming was an act of obedience and of faith on the part <strong> </strong> of both Mary and Joseph (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:25">Matthew 1:25</span>). Although Joseph is less prominent in the account before us, he must have been convinced. This verse gives the greater prominence to the naming <strong> </strong> of the Saviour, but the circumcision has a significance. He was made under the law, that He might redeem us from the law. As a sinless Being this rite was not necessary for Him, but as a born Jew, and as One who fulfilled the law for us, He was circumcised.</p>
