Luke 2:3.  Every one into his own city,    i.e.,   to the city of his extraction (comp. Luke 2:4). This was not the Roman custom, but was probably adopted as a measure of policy in accordance with the Jewish habits in regard to genealogies.  Roman usage required the enrolment of women, and possibly their actual presence at the place of enrolment. This mixture of Roman and Jewish usage, so likely to occur in an enrolment, made under a Jewish king yet by order of the Roman Emperor, is a strong proof of the accuracy of Lukeâ€™s account.
