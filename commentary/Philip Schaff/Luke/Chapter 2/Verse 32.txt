<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:32">Luke 2:32</span>. <strong> A light.</strong> This defines ‘salvation.’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> For</strong> <strong> revelation to the Gentiles.</strong> Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:6">Isaiah 49:6</span>; where there is a similar prophecy. The idea is that of Old Testament prophecy: The light of the world rises in Israel, extends its influence to other nations, which submit to the Messiah and receive the light of truth. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:2">Isaiah 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:10">Isaiah 11:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+44:5">Isaiah 44:5</span>; </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> And the glory</strong>. This also defines ‘salvation;’ <em> </em> some take it as defining ‘light’ but this destroys the poetic parallelism, and is otherwise objectionable. The end proposed is not the glory of Israel, but the coming of the Messiah, and His salvation is the true glory of Israel, that which really exalts it above other nations, hat for which it was chosen.</p>
