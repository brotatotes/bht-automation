Luke 2:42.  Twelve years old. At this age a Jewish boy became ‘a son of the law ‘and was henceforth bound to obey the law in the full scope of its requirements. After this age attendance at the Passover was necessary; but the passage before us gives no hint that this was the first time the child Jesus had accompanied His parents thither. In the original, Luke 2:42-43 form but one sentence.
