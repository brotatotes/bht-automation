<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> And his parents did not know it</strong>. This does not imply want of proper care on their part. Such a child had not been wont to cause anxiety. How it happened is not stated. The main point is, that He, afterwards (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:51">Luke 2:51</span>) and before so obedient, remained without consulting His parents, and justified Himself for so doing (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:49">Luke 2:49</span>). His action was occasioned by an irresistible longing to remain in the sacred city and in the house of God. This longing He gratified without consulting those to whom He ordinarily owed obedience. Such conduct would have been disobedience, implying moral imperfection, if Jesus were not more than man. The sole justification is in the higher relationship He asserts (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:49">Luke 2:49</span>).</p>
