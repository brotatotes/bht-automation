<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:46">Luke 2:46</span>. <strong> After three days</strong>. Reckoned from the time when they missed Him: one day returning (possibly part of another, as they searched on the way), another of search in Jerusalem, the third day that of finding Him. Others prefer to reckon from their departure out of Jerusalem: one day out, one to return, the third of search. Either is preferable to the theory that three full days were spent in looking for Him in Jerusalem. He must have been most of the time in the temple, and it would scarcely take them so long to think of searching for Him there.

The custom in the East is for <em> scholars</em> to sit cross-legged on the floor.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Both hearing them, and asking them questions</strong> <em> .</em> The ‘hearing’ is mentioned first, which opposes the idea of His having taken the position of a Rabbi. ‘Asking them questions,’ was simply in accordance with the Jewish custom: the <em> scholars</em> asked questions.</p>
