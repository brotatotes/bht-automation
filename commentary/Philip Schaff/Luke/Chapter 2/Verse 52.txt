<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> In favor</strong> (or, ‘grace’) <strong> with God and men</strong>. The favor with God found expression at His baptism, and that expression implies sinless perfection. The innocence of childhood, free in this case from all childish faults, developed into complete holiness of life, in the way of positive obedience.
