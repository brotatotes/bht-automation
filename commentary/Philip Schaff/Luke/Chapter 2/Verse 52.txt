Luke 2:52.  Advanced, not ‘increased.’
	 In wisdom and stature, or, ‘age;’ see Matthew 6:27.   The former sense is included, if the latter be accepted.
	 In favor (or, ‘grace’)  with God and men. The favor with God found expression at His baptism, and that expression implies sinless perfection.

During this time of youthful obedience and subjection, was performed a large part of that work which the second Adam must do as fulfilling the law  for others. This work found ‘favor with God’ The favor with men was probably not complete. Even in youth He must have testified by His life against the worldly people of Nazareth (comp. chap. Luke 4:28-29). The exercise of His passive virtues must have been constant and increasing. His patient waiting has a lesson never more needed than in this bustling age.
