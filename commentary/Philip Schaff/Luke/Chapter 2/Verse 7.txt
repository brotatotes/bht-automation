Luke 2:7.  Her first born son. This implies that Mary had other children (in Matthew 1:25 the reading is in dispute). It is unlikely that an only child would be thus termed by one who wrote long afterwards with a full knowledge of the family. See on Matthew 13:55 Luke says nothing to justify the legends of a birth without pain, and the many other fancies which have been added to the story.

His self-abasement is thus illustrated, the nature of His kingdom suggested, the lesson of humility enforced. Tradition says this stable was a  cave,  and this might be the case, since in rocky countries caves are used for stables. One ancient writer finds in this a fulfilment of the prophecy (Isaiah 33:16): ‘His place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks.’ The place cannot be now identified. It is unlikely that the cave belonged to the shepherds afterwards spoken of; Luke 2:15 suggests that Bethlehem was not their home.

There is no hint of want of hospitality. The town was full, the inn was full; failing to obtain a place there, they found the much needed shelter in a stable, not necessarily however that of the inn, which would be less retired than others. The fact that changed the world was accomplished in a stable; but the world’s emperor must send forth a universal decree that this humble birth might be in accordance with prophecy; for He who lay in the manger there was King of kings. The enrolment is in one aspect a sign of subjection, in another of superiority.
