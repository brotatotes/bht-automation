This implies that Mary had other children (in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:25">Matthew 1:25</span> the reading is in dispute). It is unlikely that an only child would be thus termed by one who wrote long afterwards with a full knowledge of the family.

His self-abasement is thus illustrated, the nature of His kingdom suggested, the lesson of humility enforced. Tradition says this stable was a <em> cave, </em> and this might be the case, since in rocky countries caves are used for stables.

There is no hint of want of hospitality. The town was full, the inn was full; failing to obtain a place there, they found the much needed shelter in a stable, not necessarily however that of the inn, which would be less retired than others. The fact that changed the world was accomplished in a stable; but the world’s emperor must send forth a universal decree that this humble birth might be in accordance with prophecy; for He who lay in the manger there was King of kings. The enrolment is in one aspect a sign of subjection, in another of superiority.</p>
