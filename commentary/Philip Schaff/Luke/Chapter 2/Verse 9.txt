Luke 2:9.    An angel,   not ‘the angel.’
	 Stood by  .  This indicates a sudden but actual appearance; not a vision. The angel may have been above them, but this is not stated. The shepherds may   have been in a state of peculiar susceptibility, as pious men, in the quiet night, under the starry heavens, where David first sang as he watched his flock; but this will not account for the story before us.
	 The glory of the Lord. The Shekinah, the brightness of God’s presence, so often spoken of in the Old Testament. This accompanied the angel, both to reveal his presence in the night and to attest his authority.
	 And they were sore afraid  .  Lit., ‘feared a great fear.’ The usual effect of angelic appearances, enhanced in this case by the supernatural brightness.
