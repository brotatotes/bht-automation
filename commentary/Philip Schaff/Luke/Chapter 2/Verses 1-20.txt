<p>Jesus of Nazareth born in Bethlehem (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:1-11">Matthew 2:1-11</span>). This section narrates: the circumstances which led His mother from Nazareth (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:26">Luke 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:56">Luke 1:56</span>) to Bethlehem (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:1-5">Luke 2:1-5</span>); the fact and place of His birth (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:6-7">Luke 2:6-7</span>); the first gospel message, by the mouth of an angel, to shepherds in the fields (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:8-12">Luke 2:8-12</span>); the joyous song of the heavenly hosts at this announcement (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:13-14">Luke 2:13-14</span>); the visit of the shepherds in obedience to the angelic message. (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:15-20">Luke 2:15-20</span>); their praise, heaven and earth uniting in the celebration of the nativity. These supernatural events if accepted, are conclusive in their testimony to the Divine-human Person of Christ. No one, inventing statements to prove the supernatural origin of Jesus, would have been satisfied with this brief sketch, or with the amount of miraculous incident here introduced. ‘In the details of the history, the supernatural is confined within the limits of the strictest sobriety and most perfect suitability, and differs altogether in this respect from the marvels of the apocryphal writings.’ (Godet) The main argument against the historical character of the chapter has been drawn from the difficulty about the census under Quirinius; but the accuracy of Luke’s statement cannot be disproved, and the latest researches confirm it. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:3">Luke 2:3</span>. Other points open to discussion are: the date of the birth (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:8">Luke 2:8</span>), and the exact sense of the angels’ song (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:14">Luke 2:14</span>).</p>
