The fulfilment of the legal requirements respecting the child Jesus: His   circumcision and naming on the eighth day (Luke 2:21), as one of the Jewish people, and the redemption from the temple service on the day of purification (fortieth day), as a first-born son (Luke 2:22-24). In the former case the mere fact is stated; in the latter there is added the recognition of the infant by two godly persons, likely to be in the temple  .
	 THE ORDER of events. 1 . The flight into   Egypt (Matthew 2:13-21) must have occurred after the presentation in the temple, and before the return to Nazareth. The journey could not have been made during the forty days, and Matthew’s account makes it perfectly obvious that the flight took place from Bethlehem. 2 . The  Adoration of the Magi took place about the time of the presentation in the temple. The traditional date (January 6 ), the thirteenth day after our Lord’s birth, is to be rejected. So long an interval (twenty-seven days) is opposed by Matthew 2:13, which indicates a speedy warning to Joseph. Nor would Herod have postponed so long the murder of the Innocents. On the other hand, there was no reason why Joseph and Mary should remain long in Bethlehem after the purification, and Luke 2:39 indicates that they did not. It is uncertain, however, which came first. The priority of the  presentation has been urged, because after the visit of the Magi and the revelation of danger, the parents would scarcely venture into the temple; because after the presents from the wise men Mary would not have brought the offering of poverty; because it seems more likely that the child would first receive the homage of pious Israelites and then of the representatives of the Gentiles. On the other hand, however, it may be said that there seems to be no necessity for the delay of the holy family in Bethlehem  after the presentation. In any case the revelation of danger made to Joseph followed the presentation, since he obeyed  at once (Matthew 2:14).
