Luke 20:38.  For all live unto him.  Peculiar to Luke. The emphasis rests upon ‘all,’ which may be taken in its widest sense: all creatures, whether living or dead, angels or men, live in the sight of God. This extends the argument further than the parallels in Matthew and Mark, where the  covenant relation  alone is brought into view.
