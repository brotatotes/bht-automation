<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:38">Luke 20:38</span>. <strong> For all live unto him. </strong> Peculiar to Luke. The emphasis rests upon ‘all,’ which may be taken in its widest sense: all creatures, whether living or dead, angels or men, live in the sight of God. This extends the argument further than the parallels in Matthew and Mark, where the <em> covenant relation </em> alone is brought into view.
