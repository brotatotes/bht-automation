Passing over the incident of the barren fig tree (Monday evening and Tuesday morning, on the way to and from Bethany) related by Matthew and Mark, Luke gives a sketch of the various assaults made upon our Lord in the temple. His account is not so full as that of the other two Evangelists. In common with them he tells of the question respecting  authority  (Luke 20:1-8), and then gives  the parable of the wicked husbandmen  (Luke 20:9-19); omitting (with Mark) the parable of the wedding of the Kingâ€™s Son, he narrates the insidious assault of the  Pharisees  with the question respecting  tribute  (Luke 20:20-26). See further on next section.
