But the discrepancy is only apparent. The passage in Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:6">Matthew 24:6</span>) tells of what shall take place before the end comes, then in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:7-8">Matthew 24:7-8</span> (corresponding to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:10-11">Luke 21:10-11</span>, here) of certain things which are ‘the beginning of sorrows’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:9">Matthew 24:9</span>), actually a part of the final throes, introducing these as a proof (‘for,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:7">Matthew 24:7</span>) that ‘the end is not yet’): afterwards in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:9">Matthew 24:9</span> (corresponding to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:12">Luke 21:12</span> here) the point of time spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:6">Matthew 24:6</span>, is resumed, and ‘then’ ( <em> i.e., </em> while ‘the end is not yet’) introduces the prediction of persecution.
