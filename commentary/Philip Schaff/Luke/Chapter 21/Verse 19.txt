<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:19">Luke 21:19</span>. <strong> In your patience, </strong> or ‘stedfastness,’ <strong> ye shall win your souls, </strong> or ‘lives.’ In the endurance of these predicted afflictions they should gain, or come into the possession of, their true life. If <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:18">Luke 21:18</span> refers to physical safety this promise also does. ‘In’ means: in this God appointed way, not strictly, by means of it. The whole verse is not a command but a promise: and the E. V., following an incorrect leading, misleads the reader. The word ‘souls’ (or ‘lives’) opposes that view of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:18">Luke 21:18</span>, which refers it to the preservation of every hair in the resurrection.
