Luke 21:19.  In your patience,  or ‘stedfastness,’  ye shall win your souls,  or ‘lives.’ In the endurance of these predicted afflictions they should gain, or come into the possession of, their true life. If Luke 21:18 refers to physical safety this promise also does. ‘In’ means: in this God appointed way, not strictly, by means of it. The whole verse is not a command but a promise: and the E. V., following an incorrect leading, misleads the reader. The word ‘souls’ (or ‘lives’) opposes that view of Luke 21:18, which refers it to the preservation of every hair in the resurrection.
