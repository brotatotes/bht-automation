Luke 21:20.  Compassed with armies.  The plainest and most graphic form of the prediction. Luke, writing for Gentile readers, does not refer to Danielâ€™s prophecy, but speaks of its fulfilment. We prefer this view to that which finds a different sign here; see on Matthew 25:15. There was abundant time, after the first approach of the Roman armies, for the Christians to flee:  her desolation  did not then begin, but was  at hand.
