<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:23">Luke 21:23</span>. <strong> Upon the land, </strong> or ‘earth.’ This may be general, but as the direct reference is to the war under Titus, it more probably means: the land of Judea. If the wider sense be adopted, the particular distress (Divine retribution) is brought out in the clause: <strong> wrath unto this people.
