<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:34">Luke 21:34</span>. <strong> To yourselves. </strong> Emphatic.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Overcharged. </strong> Made heavy, sleepy, and hence unexpectant, the underlying thought being the sudden return of the Lord. Three things are mentioned as bringing them into such a state.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Surfeiting, </strong> heaviness and dizziness such as drunkenness of <em> yesterday </em> gives; <strong> drunkenness, </strong> which makes them for <em> today </em> unfit to reflect maturely upon their highest interests; <strong> cares of this life, </strong> which plague them for <em> tomorrow </em> (Van Oosterzee). These are not to be taken figuratively, but as representing three classes of dangers. Things relatively lawful are here included, because they may be used so unwisely as to deprive Christians of a watchful spirit.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Suddenly as a snare. </strong> The phrase, ‘as a snare,’ should probably be connected with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:34">Luke 21:34</span>. ‘That day’ would certainly come ‘suddenly,’ but if they were ‘overcharged’ with other matters, it would come ‘as a snare.’ The figure is that of throwing of a net or noose, over wild animals. There is a thought of ruinous consequences as well as of suddenness.
