Luke 21:36.  But watch ye.  This is the main exhortation, and the mode of the watching is further described,  at all times making supplication.  ‘At all times,’ in effect, belongs both to the watching and praying.

As the glorified Son of man is referred to, we may include here the idea of permanent glory in His presence as well as full acquittal at the hour when brought before Him. A fitting conclusion, entirely in the spirit of the fuller account of Matthew 25:0.
