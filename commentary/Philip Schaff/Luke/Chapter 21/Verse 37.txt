Luke 21:37.  Every day.  Lit., ‘the days,’ definite days of that week of His passion.
	 Olivet.  Luke makes no mention of Bethany, where, according to Matthew and Mark, our Lord spent the nights of Sunday and Monday. This is all they assert, although from their inserting the supper at Bethany  after  these discourses, the impression is made that  Tuesday night  was spent there. As the nights here referred to were those connected with public teaching, it does not meet the difficulty, to say that Luke is telling us where our Lord spent Tuesday and Wednesday nights, of which we have no definite record. It is improbable that He spent the night (partly in prayer) without shelter. The next appearance of our Lord is, as sending two of His disciples (chap. Luke 22:18), so that they were near Him. Bethany was probably the place, and Olivet is here mentioned as including it.
