Luke 21:38.  Came early in the morning,  rather than came eagerly, as some translate. This suggests that our Lord was for the greater part of the teaching days in the temple; a fact in accordance with the number of incidents which we must place on Tuesday. No miracles are mentioned in this connection; the time for these had already passed. Up to the last appearance in public before His betrayal, our Lordâ€™s popularity continued.
