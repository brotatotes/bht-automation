In this section Luke records the assault of the Sadducees respecting the resurrection (Luke 20:27-40); then omitting the lawyer’s question, he tells of our Lord’s unanswered question respecting  Christ the Son of David  (Luke 20:41-44); like Mark he gives but a brief summary of the discourse against the  Pharisees  (‘scribes,’ Luke 20:45-47), with which the public teaching in the temple closed, though one other incident is mentioned as occurring while He lingered there (the widow’s mites, chap. Luke 21:1-4). In some cases this account agrees more closely with that of Matthew, in others with that of Mark, and sometimes all three have their special points of difference.
