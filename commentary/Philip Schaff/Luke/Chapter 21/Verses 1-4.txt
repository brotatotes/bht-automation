<p>In this section Luke records the assault of the Sadducees respecting the resurrection (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:27-40">Luke 20:27-40</span>); then omitting the lawyer’s question, he tells of our Lord’s unanswered question respecting <em> Christ the Son of David </em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:41-44">Luke 20:41-44</span>); like Mark he gives but a brief summary of the discourse against the <em> Pharisees </em> (‘scribes,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:45-47">Luke 20:45-47</span>), with which the public teaching in the temple closed, though one other incident is mentioned as occurring while He lingered there (the widow’s mites, chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:1-4">Luke 21:1-4</span>). In some cases this account agrees more closely with that of Matthew, in others with that of Mark, and sometimes all three have their special points of difference.
