Luke 21:25-33. THE SIGNS OF   THE COMING OF THE END. See on the paragraph in general, the notes on Matthew 24:29-35; Mark 13:24-31. The only variations are in the signs mentioned in Luke 21:25-26, and the exhortation in Luke 21:28.These signs evidently refer not to the destruction of Jerusalem, but to the end of ‘the times of the Gentiles.’
	 In sun,  etc. See Matthew 24:29.
	 And upon the earth anguish of nations, etc. How far this prophecy will be literally fulfilled cannot be determined. If the whole passage be taken figuratively, then a remarkable commotion in the sea of nations is predicted, but it may refer to physical perturbations ushering in the new earth. The perturbations, whether physical or not, will be portentous, producing general anxiety and despair in view of the further terrors these events presage. This is evident from Luke 21:26:  for expectation of the things, etc.
