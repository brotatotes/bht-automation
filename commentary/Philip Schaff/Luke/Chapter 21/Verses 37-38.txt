Luke 21:37-38. CONCLUDING SKETCH OF OUR LORD’S TEACHING. Peculiar to Luke. Luke does not assert that our Lord afterwards taught in the temple, and thus contradicts the accounts of Matthew and Mark. Unlike them he has prefaced the final discourses with a general sketch of our Lord’s activity during these days (chap. Luke 19:47-48), and now he sums up in conclusion, with a similar sketch.
