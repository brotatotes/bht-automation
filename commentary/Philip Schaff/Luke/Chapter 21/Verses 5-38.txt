<p>The discourse of our Lord about the last times, is here connected most closely with the prediction of the destruction of the temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:5-6">Luke 21:5-6</span>). There is no allusion to the mount of Olives, where, as Matthew and Mark distinctly assert, the question of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:7">Luke 21:7</span> was put; but the wording of that verse clearly admits of a change of scene. Lukeâ€™s account of the discourse is not so full, yet it contains a number of peculiarities.
