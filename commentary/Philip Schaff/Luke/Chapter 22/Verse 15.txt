Luke 22:15.  With desire I have desired.  A Hebrew form of expression, denoting strong desire.
	 To eat this Passover.  This refers to this Passover itself, not to the ‘Lord’s Supper,’ which it introduced. One ground of the strong desire was the certainty that it would be the last one, hence peculiarly solemn and important.
	 With you.  Emphatic, it was the eating with them which He so strongly desired.
	 Before I suffer.  The expression occurs in this absolute sense only here in the Gospels. The certainty that this was the last Passover with them rested on the certainty of His sufferings for them; hence the affectionateness of His desire, that before His Passion He might have this privilege. The feast at its very beginning takes on a farewell character.
