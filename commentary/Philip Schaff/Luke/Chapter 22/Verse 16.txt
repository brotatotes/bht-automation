Luke 22:16.  I shall not eat it.  Some authorities read: ‘no more,’ a correct explanation. He would eat of it now, but never again. Yet He passes beyond this, and introduces a thought of the future, which was doubtless the deeper reason of His strong desire:  until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.  This points to His return; rather than to ‘the Christian dispensation.’ Lange refers it ‘to the eternal coronation-feast of His glorified Church, the shining image of the eternal Supper, the anticipatory celebration of which in the New Testament covenant meal, He is now about to establish.’ It must be granted that the Lord is here speaking of the Passover itself, not of the Lord’s Supper which followed. In a very proper sense the Jewish Passover itself, as a feast of deliverance, will be fulfilled in the ‘marriage supper of the Lamb,’ but our Lord is speaking of  this  Passover particularly, which introduced the Lord’s Supper. That Passover could only be fulfilled in the Messianic feast of the future, alluded to in Luke 22:30, and in Matthew 27:29.
