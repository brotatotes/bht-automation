The form of the blessing was: ‘Blessed be thou, O Lord our God, who hast created the fruit of the vine.’ Of this form there seems to be an echo in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:18">Luke 22:18</span>.

As He had eaten before He uttered the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:15-16">Luke 22:15-16</span>, so He had drunk before saying this. This was a part of the regular Passover celebration; the institution of the Lord’s Supper was distinct from the act here mentioned.
