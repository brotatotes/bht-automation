Luke 22:18.  I shall not drink, etc.  From this we infer that our Lord did not partake in the Supper He afterwards instituted. The verse points to the same event in the future as Luke 22:16. The old rite was thus formally abrogated, the new one about to be instituted. This view at once suggests a reason for the order adopted by Luke; it contrasts the two rites more fully.
