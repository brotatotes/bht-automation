<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:18">Luke 22:18</span>. <strong> I shall not drink, etc. </strong> From this we infer that our Lord did not partake in the Supper He afterwards instituted. The verse points to the same event in the future as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:16">Luke 22:16</span>. The old rite was thus formally abrogated, the new one about to be instituted. This view at once suggests a reason for the order adopted by Luke; it contrasts the two rites more fully.
