<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:19">Luke 22:19</span>. <strong> Given. </strong> Given to death, as the sequel shows, and as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:20">Luke 22:20</span> involves.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> For you. </strong> This may mean in behalf of you, but such a surrender to death had necessarily a vicarious character.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> This do in remembrance of me. </strong> Peculiar to Luke and Paul, and pointing to the establishment of a permanent feast. Whatever else the Lordâ€™s Supper may be, this passage proves that it is a memorial service, commemorating the atoning death of our Master.
