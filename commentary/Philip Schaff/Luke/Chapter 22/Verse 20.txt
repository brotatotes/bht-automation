<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> After supper. </strong> The paschal lamb had been eaten, and the feast was about to conclude with the <em> third </em> cup (‘the cup of blessing’), since according to Matthew and Mark, our Lord gave, or, as we would say, returned thanks with this cup. A fourth cup usually followed, but of this no mention is made.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> The new covenant in my blood. </strong> This means: the new covenant which is ratified or established in my blood. The form here used agrees with that of Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:25">1 Corinthians 11:25</span>). Some paraphrase thus: ‘This cup is the new covenant because it contains my blood; ‘but even this view gives no countenance to the literal rendering of the Roman Catholics, since the ‘cup’ could only <em> represent </em> the ‘covenant.’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> That which is poured out for you. </strong> This is spoken of the ‘blood,’ although the form of the original admits of a reference to the word ‘cup.’ More exactly it points to the fruit of the vine poured out from the grapes and representing the blood of Christ. Otherwise the sign would not include a ‘pouring out,’ which is essential here, especially in view of the ‘breaking’ of the bread.
