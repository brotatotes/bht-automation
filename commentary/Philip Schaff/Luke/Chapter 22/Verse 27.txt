Luke 22:27.  But I am in  the midst of you as he that serveth.  This clause gains in force by supposing that our Lord at this point washed His disciples’ feet. He, the ‘chief,’ was serving. We may also connect this with Luke 22:25: ‘the benefactors among the Gentiles are rulers and potentates; I, your benefactor, am among you as a servant.’
	 Luke 22:28-30 may belong here chronologically, or, as is far more likely, they followed the washing of the disciples’ feet, which may be appropriately placed at Luke 22:27.
