<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:27">Luke 22:27</span>. <strong> But I am in</strong> <strong> the midst of you as he that serveth. </strong> This clause gains in force by supposing that our Lord at this point washed His disciples’ feet. He, the ‘chief,’ was serving. We may also connect this with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:25">Luke 22:25</span>: ‘the benefactors among the Gentiles are rulers and potentates; I, your benefactor, am among you as a servant.’

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:28-30">Luke 22:28-30</span> may belong here chronologically, or, as is far more likely, they followed the washing of the disciples’ feet, which may be appropriately placed at <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:27">Luke 22:27</span>.
