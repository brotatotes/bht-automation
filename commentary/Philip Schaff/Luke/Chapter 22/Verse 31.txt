<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:31">Luke 22:31</span>. <strong> Simon, Simon. </strong> Earnestness and affection are indicated by the repetition. The apostle is addressed by his old name, not the new and significant one. The sudden call (‘And the Lord said’ is to be omitted) may have been occasioned by his part in the strife. There is too a connection of thought with what precedes. The way to these thrones was <em> His way, </em> through temptations, trials, siftings of Satan.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Satan asked to have you, </strong> or ‘obtained you by asking,’ as in the case of Job. ‘You’ refers to all the Apostles: all must pass to the throne through trial, since the purpose of this asking and obtaining was in order <strong> that ha might sift you as wheat. </strong> As wheat is shaken in the sieve, so Satan would try their faithfulness. If ‘you’ includes Judas (who had probably gone out before this), then the sifting process had begun and the chaff partially removed.
