<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> For thee. </strong> Peter is now spoken of alone, as in the greatest danger.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> That thy faith fail not</strong>, <em> i.e., </em> cease altogether. Our Lord prays, not that Peter be not tried, but that his faith should not utterly fail. It was only through this prayer that Peter’s faith did not fail altogether. An Apostle’s faith would become extinct, did not Christ intercede for His own.
