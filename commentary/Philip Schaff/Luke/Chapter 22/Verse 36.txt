<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> He that hath not, </strong> <em> i.e., </em> purse or wallet, <strong> let him sell his cloke </strong> (‘outer garment’), necessary as that is, <strong> and buy a sword, </strong> which is now more indispensable than clothing. One who had not a sword, might still have a purse, and thus not be obliged to sell his garment; a point overlooked by the rendering of the E. V. This is not to be taken literally, nor yet allegorically, as though the purse, wallet, and sword had each a spiritual signification; but the whole is a figurative setting forth of the fact that henceforth self-defence would be their chief necessity, in view of the outward perils which would come upon them. This opposes the non-resistant theory of the Quakers, and also the view, that force can be used <em> aggressively </em> in the cause of Christ; self-defence alone is in question.
