Luke 22:36.  Therefore,   i.e.,   in consequence of their reply.
	 Let him take it.  The precise word used in the prohibition of chap. Luke 9:3.
	 He that hath not,   i.e.,  purse or wallet,  let him sell his cloke  (‘outer garment’), necessary as that is,  and buy a sword,  which is now more indispensable than clothing. One who had not a sword, might still have a purse, and thus not be obliged to sell his garment; a point overlooked by the rendering of the E. V. This is not to be taken literally, nor yet allegorically, as though the purse, wallet, and sword had each a spiritual signification; but the whole is a figurative setting forth of the fact that henceforth self-defence would be their chief necessity, in view of the outward perils which would come upon them. This opposes the non-resistant theory of the Quakers, and also the view, that force can be used  aggressively  in the cause of Christ; self-defence alone is in question.
