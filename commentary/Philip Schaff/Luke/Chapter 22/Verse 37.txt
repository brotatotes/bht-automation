<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:37">Luke 22:37</span>. <strong> For </strong> I <strong> say to you, </strong> etc. The course of reasoning is: If the Master is to be <strong> reckoned among the transgressors, </strong> and this will be the case, since this prophecy of Isaiah <em> must </em> be fulfilled, then you, my disciples, may well expect such perils. Notice, our Lord speaks of His position among malefactors as something which <em> must </em> be. That the sinless one was thus reckoned was no accident. The allusion to the ‘sword’ had no reference to defending <em> Him </em> from what was coming upon Him; that must come: <strong> for that which concerneth me, </strong> <em> i.e., </em> written or determined concerning me, <strong> hath a fufilment, </strong> or ‘end.’ Everything written of the Messiah must be completely fulfilled, and this completion is approaching. The coming of this end proves that the prophecy cited (which our Lord expressly applies to Himself), will be speedily fulfilled.
