<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:38">Luke 22:38</span>. <strong> Lord, behold here are two swords. </strong> Swords, not knives used at the feast, probably belonging to the disciples. The Galileans often travelled armed, and possibly two of the disciples had thus provided themselves because they expected danger that night

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> It is enough. </strong> The reference is not to the sufficiency of the weapons, but a mild turning away from further explanation in view of their failure to understand. ‘Two swords’ were of no avail in the spiritual conflict before Him; of this He had just spoken, but they failed to recognize His meaning. The discourse recorded by John (14-17), probably followed; then on the way to Gethsemane, the second prediction of the unfaithfulness of Peter and the other disciples, repelled by them all. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:31">Matthew 26:31</span>. These are passed over by Luke.
