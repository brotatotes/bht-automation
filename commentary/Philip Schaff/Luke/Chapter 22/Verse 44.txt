<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:44">Luke 22:44</span>. <strong> And being in an agony. </strong> This was <em> after </em> the coming of the angel. Our Lord was strengthened <em> for </em> this <em> agony </em> or conflict. The first result of the strengthening was that <strong> He prayed more earnestly, </strong> the final result was complete resignation and victorious waiting for the betrayer.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> And his sweat became as it were, </strong> etc. The easy and natural explanation is, that as the result of the agony His sweat became colored with blood (not pure blood, hence ‘as it were’), and fell in great clots to the ground. No other sense accords so well with the language used. Instances of bloody sweat have occurred since. Every other view fails to give a sufficient climax to Luke’s description and seems to fall below the dignity of the conflict there endured <em> for us. </em> See notes on Matthew.
