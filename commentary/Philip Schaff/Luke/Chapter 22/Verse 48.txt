Luke 22:48.  Judas, betrayest then,  etc. This probably followed the question recorded by Matthew. It is addressed to Judas by name, and is emphatic throughout, setting before the traitor the full enormity of his purpose. The form used coincides with that used in predicting the betrayal (Matthew 17:22; Matthew 20:18; Matthew 26:2; Matthew 26:45).
