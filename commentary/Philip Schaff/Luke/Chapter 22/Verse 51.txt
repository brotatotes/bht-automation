<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:51">Luke 22:51</span>. <strong> Suffer ye thus far. </strong> Probably addressed to the disciples: Let them go on and fulfil this their design of taking me. Ft is a mild reproof of the hasty use of the sword, and thus agrees with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:52">Matthew 26:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:11">John 18:11</span>. Were the sense: Let them go thus far (and no further), we would find a different expression here. Others suppose the soldiers were addressed, and that the sense is: Let me go, until I have healed this man, or Let me go as far as this man. This is grammatically probable, but opposed by the phrase ‘answered.’

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Touched his ear, </strong> etc. Luke, the physician, alone mentions this. The passage does not clearly indicate how the healing took place: Whether at our Lord’s touch the ear was wholly restored, or merely the wound healed, or whether the piece cut off was taken up and restored to its place in the body. The last is least likely, as the passage contains no hint of picking up. The first seems more in keeping with the occasion, representing our Lord as making good the loss occasioned by the hasty zeal of Peter.
