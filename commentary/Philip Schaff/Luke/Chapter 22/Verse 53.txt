<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:53">Luke 22:53</span>. <strong> But this is your hour, and the power of darkness. </strong> An allusion to the fact that it was midnight, contrasting this with His appearance <em> by day </em> in the temple. Darkness was appropriate to such a deed, hence it was the hour which suited them. The parallel passages speak of this as a fulfilment of Scripture. We therefore explain it, as the hour appointed to them for carrying out this work. Its fitness as an hour of midnight darkness was but a part of this appointment. (Observe, however, that they <em> freely chose it.) </em> ‘Power of darkness’ therefore points to the kingdom of darkness. They were doing the work of the Evil One, and the power over Him was the power of darkness. This clause suggests mysterious, and as yet unexplained, facts in regard to the relation of God’s purpose, man’s agency, and Satanic power. Luke passes over the flight of the disciples and that of the naked young man (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:48-52">Mark 14:48-52</span>).
