Luke 22:61.  And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter.  This detail, so interesting and touching, may be explained by supposing, that even during the trial our Lord could think on Peter and be aware of what he was doing, though at some distance. But probably the first examination before Caiaphas was now over, and the officers were leading Him away to prison to await the more formal morning examination, or possibly keeping Him in custody in the court.
	 And Peter remembered.  His memory was assisted by the cockcrow, but doubtless the Lord’s look of pity, love, and consolation was the chief cause of his penitence. After the first burst of penitence, he probably remembered our Lord’s prayer for him and his own boast, yet the look was designed to recall these also.
