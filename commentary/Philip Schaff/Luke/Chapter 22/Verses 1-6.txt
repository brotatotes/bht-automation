Comp. Matthew 26:1-16; Mark 14:1-11. ‘Luke omits our Lord’s prediction of His passion, made at the close of His discourses, (Matthew), and also the supper at Bethany. The latter omission cannot be due to the fact that he has recorded a similar anointing at an earlier period (Luke 7:36-50). The two occurrences cannot be confounded.
