Luke 22:19-20. THE INSTITUTION OF THE LORD’S SUPPER. See on Matthew 26:26-29; comp. Mark 14:22-24; 1 Corinthians 11:23-25. Luke’s account, as might be expected, agrees most closely with the words of the institution, as given by Paul, who distinctly asserts that his account was ‘received of the Lord.’
