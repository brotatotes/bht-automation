<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:21-23">Luke 22:21-23</span>. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A BETRAYER. But <strong> </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:21">Luke 22:21</span>); this is not the word usually rendered thus, but one meaning ‘nevertheless.’ The sense would then seem to be, ‘although I pour out my blood for you, yet the hand,’ etc. But to insist that these words were uttered immediately <em> after </em> the institution, involves a serious difficulty, since according to Matthew and Mark, the betrayer had already been pointed out. This, too, is less definite than the other accounts, which is scarcely conceivable if it referred to a <em> second </em> announcement. We therefore suppose that Luke departs from the chronological order; in this view ‘but’ introduces an additional, but not a connected, thought.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> The hand of him, </strong> etc. Luke does not mention Judas by name, as Matthew and John do.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> With me. </strong> Emphatic.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> On the table. </strong> Probably an allusion to the dipping into the dish mentioned by the other Evangelists. The rest of the account presents no new features.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Began to question </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:23">Luke 22:23</span>) directly opposes the view that this took place after the Lord’s Supper as a <em> second </em> announcement.
