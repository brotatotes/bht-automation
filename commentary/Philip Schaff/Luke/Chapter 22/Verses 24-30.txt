Luke 22:24-30. THE CONTENTION. Peculiar to Luke, although something similar is recorded by Matthew (Matthew 18:1, etc.; Matthew 20:20, etc.) and Mark. Luke cannot refer to one of these previous occurrences. We place it  before  the Lord’s Supper, since ‘it is scarce possible that, after the discovery of the treason of Judas, and with the solemn impression which the Lord’s words respecting the traitor must have made upon them, and after they had eaten His supper, any such strife could have occurred. And the improbability is increased if, before this, He had taught them humility by washing their feet’ (Andrews). Luke 22:27 seems to contain an allusion to the foot-washing; yet if this be insisted upon we may still suppose that a part of our Lord’s reply took place before, and a part after, that symbolical act called forth by this contention. There is nothing in the account which opposes our placing this incident at the beginning of the Passover meal.
