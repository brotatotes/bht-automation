Luke, however, says: <strong> And Satan entered </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:3">Luke 22:3</span>). Comparing this with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:27">John 13:27</span>, we conclude that Luke speaks of a preparatory influence, and John of a later decisive possession.

Cowardice is implied in this plan of wickedness. The inference from the words ‘covenanted and consented,’ is, that the money was not paid at this time.
