<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:31-34">Luke 22:31-34</span>. THE PREDICTION OF PETER’S DENIAL. This we regard as identical with the prediction recorded by John (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:36-38">John 13:36-38</span>), and distinct from and prior to that mentioned by Matthew and Mark. It was very natural that the disciples on the way to Gethsemane should revert to the words spoken at this time, and indications of this are not lacking. See notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:31">Matthew 26:31</span>, etc. We place it after the Lord’s Supper and the concluding hymn, and join with it the incident about the swords (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:35-38">Luke 22:35-38</span>), after which came the discourse and prayer recorded by John 14-17
