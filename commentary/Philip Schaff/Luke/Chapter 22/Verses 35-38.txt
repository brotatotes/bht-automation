<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:35-38">Luke 22:35-38</span>. WARNING IN REGARD TO <strong> </strong> OUTWARD DANGERS, leading to the incident of the two swords. Peculiar to Luke. We join this chronologically with what precedes. No order is more probable, and there is an appropriate connection of thought; to the description of <em> inward </em> danger just made, our Lord adds that of impending <em> outward </em> danger.
