Luke 22:45-46. Luke is very brief in these verses, and we must supplement his account from those of Matthew and Mark. We learn from these that our Lord came once and again to the  three  disciples, and found them asleep.
	 For sorrow.  This was the cause of their sleep. Luke is not seeking to excuse them. See on Matthew 26:40-41.
