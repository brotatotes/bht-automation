Luke passes over the examination by Annas (John 18:19-24), the subsequent examination before Caiaphas (Matthew 26:57-66; Mark 14:53-64), giving immediately his account of Peter’s denial, then mentioning the mocking which occurred at the close of the  night  examination before Caiaphas. This order indicates that the denials occurred between the first examination and the close of the second. Accepting this new, we find no difficulty in regarding Luke’s account (Luke 22:63-65) as referring to the same occurrence narrated by Matthew (Matthew 26:67-68) and Mark (Mark 14:65). On the  three  hearings, see Matthew 26:57, and the next section.
