<p>Luke passes over the examination by Annas (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:19-24">John 18:19-24</span>), the subsequent examination before Caiaphas (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:57-66">Matthew 26:57-66</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:53-64">Mark 14:53-64</span>), giving immediately his account of Peter’s denial, then mentioning the mocking which occurred at the close of the <em> night </em> examination before Caiaphas. This order indicates that the denials occurred between the first examination and the close of the second. Accepting this new, we find no difficulty in regarding Luke’s account (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:63-65">Luke 22:63-65</span>) as referring to the same occurrence narrated by Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:67-68">Matthew 26:67-68</span>) and Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:65">Mark 14:65</span>). On the <em> three </em> hearings, see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:57">Matthew 26:57</span>, and the next section.
