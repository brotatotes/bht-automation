Luke 22:56-57. FIRST DENIAL.  A certain maid.  Probably the porteress who had followed Peter into the court; the different answers suggest that she kept up a bantering accusation of this kind to which he responded in different words, but to the same effect. Luke brings out the fact of her  earnestly looking upon him.
