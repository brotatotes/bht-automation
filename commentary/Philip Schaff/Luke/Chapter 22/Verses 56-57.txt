<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:56-57">Luke 22:56-57</span>. FIRST DENIAL. <strong> A certain maid. </strong> Probably the porteress who had followed Peter into the court; the different answers suggest that she kept up a bantering accusation of this kind to which he responded in different words, but to the same effect. Luke brings out the fact of her <strong> earnestly looking upon him.
