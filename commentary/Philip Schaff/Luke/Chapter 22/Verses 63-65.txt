Luke 22:63-65. THE MOCKERY AT NIGHT. See on Matthew 26:67-68; Mark 14:65. (John 18:22 refers to a different occurrence.) Matthew and Mark place this mockery in a different position. This suggests that it began at the close of the hearing, continuing for some time, thus both preceding and following our Lord’s look on Peter. Luke here moreover gives substantially the same facts in a manner peculiar to himself. He tells us more particularly who were the chief actors in the mockery:  the men that held Jesus  (Luke 22:63); details how they covered His face (Mark), blindfolded Him (Luke 22:64); and sums up the whole in the significant words of Luke 22:65:  and many other things spake they against him, reviling him,  literally, ‘blaspheming him’ See on Matthew 26:68.
