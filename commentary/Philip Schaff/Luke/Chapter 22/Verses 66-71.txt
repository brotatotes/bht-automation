<p>THE MORNING EXAMINATION. Luke here gives an account of another hearing than that detailed by Matthew and Mark. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:63-65">Luke 22:63-65</span> tacitly presuppose some sort of condemnation, which encouraged the servants to commit such outrages. Both Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:1">Matthew 27:1</span>) and Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:1">Mark 15:1</span>) hint at such a morning meeting of the Sanhedrin. The account too has its peculiar coloring, characterizing this as an official and decisive council. This would then be a ratification, in proper form and numbers and at a legal hour, of the resolution already taken by the enemies of our Lord.
