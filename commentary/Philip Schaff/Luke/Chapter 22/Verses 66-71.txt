THE MORNING EXAMINATION. Luke here gives an account of another hearing than that detailed by Matthew and Mark. Luke 22:63-65 tacitly presuppose some sort of condemnation, which encouraged the servants to commit such outrages. Both Matthew (Matthew 27:1) and Mark (Mark 15:1) hint at such a morning meeting of the Sanhedrin. The account too has its peculiar coloring, characterizing this as an official and decisive council. This would then be a ratification, in proper form and numbers and at a legal hour, of the resolution already taken by the enemies of our Lord.
