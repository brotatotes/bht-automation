<p>Luke presents a number of new details: <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:7-13">Luke 22:7-13</span> narrate the preparation with greatest fulness, mentioning the names of the two disciples who were sent for this purpose; the affecting words (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:15">Luke 22:15</span>) with which our Lord opens the meal are peculiar to Luke. He alone of the Synoptists mentions the disciples’ dispute as to rank (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:24-27">Luke 22:24-27</span>), which was probably the occasion for the foot-washing as well as also the remarkable utterance of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:28-30">Luke 22:28-30</span>. We consider the admonition given to Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:31-34">Luke 22:31-34</span>). as identical with that mentioned by John (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:36-38">John 13:36-38</span>), and as distinct from that mentioned by Matthew and Mark. The latter took place on the way to Gethsemane, the former in the room. Luke deviates from the chronological order, which we think was as follows: (1) The expression of desire in connection with the first cup (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:14-18">Luke 22:14-18</span>); (2) The strife about who should be greatest (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:24-30">Luke 22:24-30</span>), followed by the washing of the disciples’ feet; (3) The announcement of the betrayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:21-23">Luke 22:21-23</span>); (4) The actual institution (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:19-20">Luke 22:19-20</span>); (5) The prediction respecting Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:31">Luke 22:31</span>, etc.); (6) The incident of the swords (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:35-38">Luke 22:35-38</span>). In regard to the other events, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:31">Matthew 26:31</span>, etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:0">John 13:0</span> etc.
