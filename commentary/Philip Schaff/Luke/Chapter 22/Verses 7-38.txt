Luke presents a number of new details: Luke 22:7-13 narrate the preparation with greatest fulness, mentioning the names of the two disciples who were sent for this purpose; the affecting words (Luke 22:15) with which our Lord opens the meal are peculiar to Luke. He alone of the Synoptists mentions the disciples’ dispute as to rank (Luke 22:24-27), which was probably the occasion for the foot-washing as well as also the remarkable utterance of Luke 22:28-30. We consider the admonition given to Peter (Luke 22:31-34). as identical with that mentioned by John (John 13:36-38), and as distinct from that mentioned by Matthew and Mark. The latter took place on the way to Gethsemane, the former in the room. Luke deviates from the chronological order, which we think was as follows: (1) The expression of desire in connection with the first cup (Luke 22:14-18); (2) The strife about who should be greatest (Luke 22:24-30), followed by the washing of the disciples’ feet; (3) The announcement of the betrayer (Luke 22:21-23); (4) The actual institution (Luke 22:19-20); (5) The prediction respecting Peter (Luke 22:31, etc.); (6) The incident of the swords (Luke 22:35-38). In regard to the other events, see on Matthew 26:31, etc.; John 13:0 etc.
