Luke 23:12.  Became friends with each other, etc.  If the cause of the quarrel was some question of jurisdiction connected possibly with the occurrence mentioned in chap. Luke 13:1, we see a reason why a reconciliation now took place. As early as Acts 4:27, we find believers alluding in their prayers to this coalition of Herod and Pilate. Even if neither was directly hostile, practically the indecision of the one and the indifference of the other conspired to nail our Lord to the cross. It is easy to harmonize this account with those of Matthew and Mark, but more difficult to insert the occurrence in Johnâ€™s narrative. The probable position is after John 18:38.
