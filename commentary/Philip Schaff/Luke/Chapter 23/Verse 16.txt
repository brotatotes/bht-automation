His want of moral earnestness now appears. This was a concession, and an illegal one, since he declares Jesus to be innocent. This first wrong step was the decisive one, since the Jews understood how to follow up the advantage thus given them. If he was willing to chastise Jesus illegally, why could he not be forced to crucify Him. This proposition of Pilate was repeated (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:22">Luke 23:22</span>), but Luke does not mention the fact of the scourging. See on that fact, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:26">Matthew 27:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:1">John 19:1</span>.
