Luke 23:28.  Daughters of Jerusalem.  A natural address, but solemn and pointing to their relation to a doomed city.
	 Weep not for me.  Comp. Hebrews 12:2. He not only endures the cross, but forgets His sorrows, so heavy, to tell the truth to those who manifested for Him only a human sympathy.
	 But weep for yourselves.  Appropriate words for those who even now make of the crucifixion a mere popular tragedy. Doubtless many of these very women lived until the siege of Jerusalem, about forty years afterwards, but the catastrophe was to fall most directly upon their children:  and for your children.  Comp. Matthew 27:25: ‘His blood be on us and on our children.’
