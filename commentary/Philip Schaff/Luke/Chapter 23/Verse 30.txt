<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:30">Luke 23:30</span>. <strong> Begin to say, </strong> etc. The language is quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ho+10:8">Hosea 10:8</span>. ‘Begin’ does not necessarily imply a repetition of the saying, but there is probably an allusion to another and a greater day of wrath. The prediction had a primary reference to the siege of Jerusalem and a literal fulfilment then, for the Jews in multitudes ‘hid themselves in the subterranean passages and sewers under the city.’
