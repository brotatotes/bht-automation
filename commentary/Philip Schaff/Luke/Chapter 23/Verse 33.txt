Luke 23:33.  Skull. Comp. the Hebrew  Golgotha  (Matthew, Mark, and John), which also means this. ‘Calvary’ is of kindred meaning, but taken from the Latin version. The name probably arose from a resemblance to a skull in the shape of the slight elevation where the crosses were placed. Mount Calvary is an erroneous expression. It could scarcely have been the usual place of execution (see on Matthew 27:33). There is even now no special place of execution in Jerusalem.
