Luke 23:39.  One of the malefactors.  Alford: ‘All were now mocking: the soldiers, the rulers, the mob; and the evil-minded thief, perhaps out of bravado before the crowd, puts in his scoff also.’ This fourfold mocking is a fearful revelation of the extent and power of sin. The better attested form of the taunt is striking:  Art not thou the Christ? Save thyself and us.
