<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:39">Luke 23:39</span>. <strong> One of the malefactors. </strong> Alford: ‘All were now mocking: the soldiers, the rulers, the mob; and the evil-minded thief, perhaps out of bravado before the crowd, puts in his scoff also.’ This fourfold mocking is a fearful revelation of the extent and power of sin. The better attested form of the taunt is striking: <strong> Art not thou the Christ? Save thyself and us.
