Luke 23:41.  And we indeed justly,  etc. He speaks like a true penitent; for the connection with the last verse involves a reference to  God’s  justice. Too many forget it under the shadow of   the cross!
	 But this man hath done nothing amiss.  A strong statement of innocence. ‘Even had the robber said nothing more than this, yet he would awaken our deepest astonishment, that God in a moment wherein literally all voices are raised against Jesus, and not a friendly word is heard in his favor causes a witness for the spotless innocence of the Saviour to appear on one of the crosses beside Him’ (Van Oosterzee). His faith becomes stronger, for he now turns to Christ Himself. He believed in Christ’s innocence, yet believed in the justice of God. There must have been a practical acceptance of our Lord’s atoning sacrifice, or the bold faith of his petition has no sufficient foundation.
