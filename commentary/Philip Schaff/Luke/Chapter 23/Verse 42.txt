Luke 23:42.  And he laid, Jesus, remember me,  etc. He does not ask liberation from the cross, but is satisfied to cast himself on the personal love and care of the Being hanging in torture beside him.
	 When thou comest in thy kingdom,   i.e.,  at thy coming in thy kingdom. ‘Into’ is incorrect, and leaves out of view that the man’s faith recognized Jesus, not as one who would become King, but who  was King,  and as such would appear again, not as now, but in His royal dignity. It detracts nothing from the man’s faith to suppose that he himself cherished some of the common Jewish expectations when he thus spoke. But whatever his belief about the kingdom, his faith in the King was implicit.
