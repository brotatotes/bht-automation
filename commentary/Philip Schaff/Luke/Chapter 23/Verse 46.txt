<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:46">Luke 23:46</span>. <strong> Crying with a loud voice. </strong> Matthew and Mark mention this without giving the words.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit. </strong> Our Lord dies with Scriptural words on His lips (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+31:5">Psalms 31:5</span>). The whole Psalm is not necessarily Messianic, for, by saying ‘Father,’ our lo <em> rd </em> gives the whole its higher meaning for this hour. ‘Spirit’ here means the immaterial part of Him who was dying. It is idle to say that the soul went to Hades and the spirit to His Father, for He had told the robber that He, the Personal object of His faith, would be in Paradise that day (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:43">Luke 23:43</span>). In this prayer which came after the <em> sixth </em> word (‘It is finished’), with its announcement of the completed work, our Lord freely gives up His spirit to the Father. The dying would indeed come in the course of nature, but this represents it as the supreme act of love and obedience.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> Ullmann: ‘Whoever could think that Jesus, with these words, breathed out His life forever into the empty air, such an one certainly knows nothing of the true, living spirit, and, consequently, nothing of the living God, <strong> </strong> and of the living power of the crucified One.’
