Luke 23:47.  Saw what was done.  Mark is most exact here: ‘that he so cried out.’
	 He glorified God.  The original implies a continued action and thus favors the idea that the centurion was really converted by the sight
	 Certainly this man was righteous.  ‘Righteous’ means here first  innocent, then just, truthful.   The centurion knew   that He had been accused of making Himself ‘Son of God;’ and this verdict implies the truthfulness of the claim. Both confessions might have been made, but if only one were uttered in words, it seems more probable that the other Evangelists give it accurately.
