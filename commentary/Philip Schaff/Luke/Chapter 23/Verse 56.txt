Luke 23:56.  And prepared spices and ointments.  It would seem that this preparation of spices took place that evening, while Mark (Mark 16:1) implies that it took place later. The other women, who did not remain at the sepulchre, may have made immediate preparations. The last clause of this verse is to be joined with what follows, so that the resting is not said to have taken place after the preparation of spices. We may thus paraphrase: ‘After they had viewed the grave, they ought (not stated when?) spices, and rested indeed the Sabbath day, according to the law, but when this was over they went with the spices as quickly as possible to the grave.’ On the relation of their purpose to the embalming by Nicodemus, see on Mark 16:1; John 19:39-40.
