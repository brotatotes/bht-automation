<p>Among the peculiarities of Lukeâ€™s description we notice particularly the scene on the way to Calvary (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:27-32">Luke 23:27-32</span>), and the story of the penitent robber (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:39-43">Luke 23:39-43</span>). Both of these accord with the general spirit of the whole Gospel, as do the <em> three words </em> from the cross (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:34">Luke 23:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:43">Luke 23:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:46">Luke 23:46</span>) which Luke alone has preserved for us.
