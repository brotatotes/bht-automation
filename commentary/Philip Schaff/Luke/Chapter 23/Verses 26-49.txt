Among the peculiarities of Lukeâ€™s description we notice particularly the scene on the way to Calvary (Luke 23:27-32), and the story of the penitent robber (Luke 23:39-43). Both of these accord with the general spirit of the whole Gospel, as do the  three words  from the cross (Luke 23:34; Luke 23:43; Luke 23:46) which Luke alone has preserved for us.
