<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:33-38">Luke 23:33-38</span>. THE CRUCIFIXION AND MOCKING. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:33-43">Matthew 27:33-43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:22">Mark 15:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:33">Mark 15:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:17-24">John 19:17-24</span>. Luke’s account is the briefest. He mentions (the others do not) the mocking offer of drink by the soldiers (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:36">Luke 23:36</span>). Here only do we find the touching prayer, usually called the <em> first </em> word on the cross. The casting lots for our Lord’s garments is briefly mentioned, and the mocking of the people is only hinted at (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:35">Luke 23:35</span>). <em> On </em> the mode of crucifixion, see the notes on the parallel passage in Matthew.
