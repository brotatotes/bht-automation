Luke 23:33-38. THE CRUCIFIXION AND MOCKING. See on Matthew 27:33-43; Mark 15:22; Mark 15:33; John 19:17-24. Luke’s account is the briefest. He mentions (the others do not) the mocking offer of drink by the soldiers (Luke 23:36). Here only do we find the touching prayer, usually called the  first  word on the cross. The casting lots for our Lord’s garments is briefly mentioned, and the mocking of the people is only hinted at (see on Luke 23:35).  On  the mode of crucifixion, see the notes on the parallel passage in Matthew.
