Luke 23:39-43. THE PENITENT ROBBER. Peculiar to Luke. John makes no allusion to the   conduct of the malefactors, while Matthew and Mark intimate that both scoffed at our Lord. While those accounts may be regarded as simply more general, we think it probable that both robbers began to revile, but during the time they hung there, so long to them, one of them was moved to penitence. See on Matthew 27:44.
