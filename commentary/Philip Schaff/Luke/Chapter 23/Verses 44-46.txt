Luke 23:44-46. THE CLOSING SCENE. See on Matthew 27:45-53; Mark 15:33-38. Lukeâ€™s account is very brief, passing over the tender scene narrated in John 19:26-27, the lamentation mentioned by Matthew and Mark, and the last refreshment recorded by all three, but it alone has preserved for us  the last word on the cross.
