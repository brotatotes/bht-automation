<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> But, </strong> having rested during the Sabbath, <strong> on the first day of the week, at early dawn. </strong> This agrees with the other accounts.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> They came, </strong> etc., <em> i.e.</em>, the women spoken of in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:55-56">Luke 23:55-56</span>. It is evident from that passage as well as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:10">Luke 24:10</span>, that there were a number of them. It is highly probable, but not certain, that this verse refers to the larger company, which had been preceded by the two Marys (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:1">Matthew 28:1</span>). In chap, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:55-56">Luke 23:55-56</span> Luke tells us, not what we learn from Matthew and Mark the two Marys did, but what the rest of the women did. The omission of the last clause,’ and certain others with them,’ also favors this view; the words having been inserted because ‘they’ was misunderstood as referring to the women mentioned by Matthew and Mark, not to the larger company.
