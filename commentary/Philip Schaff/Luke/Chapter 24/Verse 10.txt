<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:10">Luke 24:10</span>. This verse is somewhat parenthetical, and its exact form must be carefully noted: <strong> How they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna and Mary the mother of James </strong> (who thus reported), <strong> and with them the other women told these things onto the Apostles. </strong> The more important persons are mentioned first, but all bore the message. In the next verse we learn the reception given to the story. The form suggests a variety of accounts in the tumult of feeling natural at such a time, and divides the women into two parties. On the women here spoken of, see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:2-3">Luke 8:2-3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:56">Matthew 27:56</span>. The individual experience of the Magdalene is passed over, but her story doubtless met with the same reception.
