Luke 24:10. This verse is somewhat parenthetical, and its exact form must be carefully noted:  How they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna and Mary the mother of James  (who thus reported),  and with them the other women told these things onto the Apostles.  The more important persons are mentioned first, but all bore the message. In the next verse we learn the reception given to the story. The form suggests a variety of accounts in the tumult of feeling natural at such a time, and divides the women into two parties. On the women here spoken of, see chap. Luke 8:2-3; Matthew 27:56. The individual experience of the Magdalene is passed over, but her story doubtless met with the same reception.
