<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:12">Luke 24:12</span>. <strong> But Peter arose. </strong> ‘Then’ is incorrect, for it is not implied that this happened after the women returned. The unbelief just mentioned is contrasted with the conduct of impulsive Peter. Luke does not mention John, but <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:24">Luke 24:24</span> shows that he does not exclude him. The details agree so closely with John’s account (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:2-10">Luke 20:2-10</span>) that we must suppose the two Evangelists speak of the same visit, which took place before the return of the whole company of women. Luke does not mention the appearance to Peter at this point, but in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:34">Luke 24:34</span>. It is his habit to go on with one line of thought, and afterwards to insert an omitted detail, in logical, rather than chronological, connection.
