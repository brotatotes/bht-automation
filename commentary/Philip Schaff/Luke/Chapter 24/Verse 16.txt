Luke 24:16.  But their eyes were holden,  etc. He Himself prevented their knowing Him; and this was His purpose of love; He would conceal only to reveal more fully. Thus he could best explain to them the meaning of His own death; immediate recognition would have filled them with a tumult of joy, fear, and doubt. Natural causes probably aided in preventing the recognition. Comp. Mark 16:12 (‘in another form’). A quiet, vigorous, dignified traveller, such as He appeared to be, would not be readily recognized as the One so lately languid in death on the cross. We often fail to recognize Christ when He is nearest to us; if He holds our eyes, as He sometimes does, it is to bless us more; if we hold our own eyes, then we are in danger of never recognizing Him at all.
