Luke 24:18.  One of them.  The best authorities omit ‘the.’
	 Cleopas.  See Luke 24:13.
	 Art thou the only one sojourning in Jerusalem and not knowing,  etc. A literal translation would be: ‘Dost thou alone sojourn at Jerusalem and not know,’ etc. It might mean: ‘Dost thou sojourn alone, and (hence) not know.’ The other is, however, more grammatical. ‘Sojourning’ implies that they took Him for one who had been at Jerusalem to attend the Passover. This they probably inferred from His walking away from the city, or from the thought that no inhabitant could be ignorant of this matter; hardly from any peculiarity of dialect. It is implied not only that even a stranger might be expected to know of these things, out that only one who was ignorant of the whole matter could inquire why they thus talked. So absorbing did the events appear to them.
