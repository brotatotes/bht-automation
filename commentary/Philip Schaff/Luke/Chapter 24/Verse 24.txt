Luke 24:24.  And certain of them that were with us.  This may properly be referred to the Apostles, Peter and John. They would not speak of them by name, or as Apostles, to this apparent stranger. Knowing from other sources that John accompanied Peter (John 20:2-10), we have a right to use this verse in explaining Luke 24:12.
	 As the women had said,   i.e., that the sepulchre was empty.
	 But him they saw not.  This is the last contrast. The hope that was rekindled was   turned to sadness (Luke 24:17), because despite the angelic message, the Lord had not yet appeared. According to Matthew, the women (according to Mark and John, Mary Magdalene) had already seen the Lord, these disciples were therefore unaware of this. Yet ‘Him they saw not,’ hints that something had occurred to lead them to expect to see Him. Possibly then some rumor of it had reached their ears. But even were this the case, they had treated the report as ‘idle talk’ (Luke 24:11). It is more probable that they left Jerusalem before the full report came. The appearance to Peter may have taken place  after  these two disciples left Jerusalem (see on Luke 24:34).
