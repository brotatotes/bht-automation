Luke 24:26.  Behooved it not  (according to these prophecies)  the Christ  (of whom they speak) to suffer these things (which have made you sad),  and  (according to the prophets, by just such sufferings)  to enter into his glory?  The ground of these prophecies lies in a deeper necessity. If we may thus speak of it, the necessity of such sufferings, on His way to glory, for our redemption. They needed most instruction about the necessity of such sufferings. Many doubting, unbelieving hearts need such instruction still: they talk of Christâ€™s glory, and forget that the appointed way thither was through suffering.
