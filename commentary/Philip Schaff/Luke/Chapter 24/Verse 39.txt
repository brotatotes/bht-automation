Luke 24:39.  See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. A  comparison with John’s account leads us to find here a proof of His  identity,  from the wounds in His hands and feet. Since these members were uncovered, there is possibly even here a proof of the  reality  of the appearance.
	 Handle me, and see.  The proof of the reality is the main thought here. The two parts of this verse correspond therefore to the two questions of Luke 24:38. They are invited to do what Mary Magdalene was forbidden to do. Well may John write (1 John 1:1): ‘which.... our hands have handled, of the Word of life.’ Comp. John 20:27.
	 A spirit hath not flesh and bones.  This is a direct assertion of our Lord. There are disembodied spirits, without flesh and bones. Instead of ‘flesh and blood,’ our Lord says ‘flesh and bones.’ Alford suggests that the Resurrection Body probably had no blood, since this was the animal life. The thought is not without a bearing on the Roman Catholic view that the sacramental wine becomes the real blood of Christ.
