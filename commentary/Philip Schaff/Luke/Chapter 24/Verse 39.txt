A </strong> comparison with John’s account leads us to find here a proof of His <em> identity, </em> from the wounds in His hands and feet.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> A spirit hath not flesh and bones. </strong> This is a direct assertion of our Lord. There are disembodied spirits, without flesh and bones. Instead of ‘flesh and blood,’ our Lord says ‘flesh and bones.’ Alford suggests that the Resurrection Body probably had no blood, since this was the animal life. The thought is not without a bearing on the Roman Catholic view that the sacramental wine becomes the real blood of Christ.
