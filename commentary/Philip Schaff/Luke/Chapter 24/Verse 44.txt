<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> In the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the Psalms. </strong> The Jews divided the Old Testament into Law, Prophets, and Hagiographa. The Pentateuch formed the first division: Joshua, Judges , 1 and 2 Samuel , 1 and 2 Kings, and the Prophets (except Daniel), the second; the remaining books were the Hagiographa. The original indicates that our Lord thus speaks of the Old Testament to show that in all its parts there was a prophetic unity. At the same time there is no objection to supposing He referred to the prophets and the book of Psalms in the stricter sense, since in these the most striking prophecies of the Messiah are found.
