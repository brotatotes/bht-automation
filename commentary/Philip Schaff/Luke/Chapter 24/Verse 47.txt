	 Repentance and remission of sins.  These two things are inseparably connected. Comp. the preaching of John the Baptist, and of the Apostles (Acts 2:38; Acts 3:19; Acts 26:18).

	 Beginning at Jerusalem.  If this clause is joined to Luke 24:47, it declares that the preaching should begin at Jerusalem in fulfilment of prophecy. See such passages as Isaiah 2:3; Isaiah 40:9. Comp. also Acts 1:8; Romans 15:19. But a better supported reading connects it with Luke 24:48: ‘Beginning at Jerusalem, ye are witnesses.’ etc.
