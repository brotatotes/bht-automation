Comp. the preaching of John the Baptist, and of the Apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:19">Acts 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span>).

See such passages as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:3">Isaiah 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:9">Isaiah 40:9</span>.
