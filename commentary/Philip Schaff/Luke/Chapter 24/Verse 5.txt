<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Why seek ye the living among the dead? </strong> Why seek ye one who is living and no longer dead in the place where the dead are looked for. The term ‘living,’ or ‘him that liveth,’ may have here a higher significance. Christ is the Living One, as Himself the Life, and this the angel knew; whether he meant to say so or not. Mark does not give these words, but their substance. </p>
