Luke 24:5.  Bowed down their faces to the earth.  Peculiar to Luke.
	 Why seek ye the living among the dead?  Why seek ye one who is living and no longer dead in the place where the dead are looked for. The term ‘living,’ or ‘him that liveth,’ may have here a higher significance. Christ is the Living One, as Himself the Life, and this the angel knew; whether he meant to say so or not. Mark does not give these words, but their substance.
