<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> As far as towards Bethany. </strong> Probably over the brow of the Mount of Olives to the descent towards Bethany. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:0">Acts 1:0</span>, Luke says nothing of their going out to the Mount of Olives, but takes for granted this previous statement. Bethany lies on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives and is invisible from Jerusalem. The traditional site of the ascension (now in possession of the Mohammedans) is on the summit of the Mount, in full sight of Jerusalem and too far from Bethany to satisfy the narrative. (See Robinson and Stanley.)
