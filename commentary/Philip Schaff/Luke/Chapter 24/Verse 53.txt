	 Blessing God.  ‘Amen’ is to be omitted. The attitude of the disciples, as they waited for the Spirit, is significant. Their unity was itself a blessing; their composure a proof that they were not enthusiasts; the fact that they were undisturbed, a proof that the Jewish council dared not bring a charge that they had stolen the body of Jesus; their prayerfulness was a proof of their faith; their blessing God a sign that they had not lost Him, but should see Him again. ‘Even so, Lord Jesus, come quickly.’
