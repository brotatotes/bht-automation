Taking the chapter as a whole, it would seem that Luke’s account was derived from one of the two disciples mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:13-35">Luke 24:13-35</span>, who had left Jerusalem before obtaining all the particulars, and that we have here a portrayal of the successive events as they came before his mind. Notice the marked agreement between <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:9-12">Luke 24:9-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:22-24">Luke 24:22-24</span>.
