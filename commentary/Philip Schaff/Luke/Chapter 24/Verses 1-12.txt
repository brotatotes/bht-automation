ON THE RESURRECTION. See the  Introductory Note to Matthew 28:0  .  Of the five appearances there grouped as occurring on the day of the resurrection, Luke omits all mention of (1) and (2). He, however, details the appearances of (4) and (5) in the subsequent part of this chapter, telling of (3) in Luke 24:34, and then passing over the others, (which are, however, alluded to in Acts 1:3) he closes with an account of the last appearance (10), which ended with the Ascension (Luke 24:50-51; comp. Acts 1:6-10). Luke narrates only that vision of two angels which was witnessed by the whole company of women (comp. Mark 16:5).
