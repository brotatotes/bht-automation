This section is peculiar to Luke, although Mark 16:12 refers to the same event. This is the  fourth  appearance of our Lord; that to Peter (Luke 24:34) having been passed over in the narrative. The particularity of detail, and the fact that the whole chapter seems to give the impressions of one of the two who walked to Emmaus, have led some to the opinion that Luke was himself the companion of Cleopas (for other theories, see on Luke 24:13). But Luke was probably a Gentile. It is most likely that Luke derived his information from Cleopas or his companion. This appearance has rightly been regarded as bearing the most human character.
