<p>We assume that Luke did not intend us to regard the whole chapter as the history of one day. Luke must explain Luke, and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:3">Acts 1:3</span> shows that the Evangelist places forty days between <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:36">Luke 24:36</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:50">Luke 24:50</span>. There is nothing here to indicate that he was not aware of the longer interval when he wrote this account. This appearance is the crown of all the appearances of that day. In the first (to Mary) the High Priestly character is prominent; in that to the two disciples, He is prophetic; here however He appears as King among His people, Head of His church, commissioning his ambassadors. The importance of the occasion is indicated by the fact that it alone is recorded by three Evangelists. The harmony of the three accounts presents no difficulties.
