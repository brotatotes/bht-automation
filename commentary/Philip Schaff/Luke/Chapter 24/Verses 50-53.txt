<p>ON THE FACT OF THE ASCENSION. This must be accepted on unimpeachable evidence. Meyer affirms this, adding: ‘For besides being reported historically (here, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:0">Acts 1:0</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:0">Mark 16:0</span>), it was expressly foretold by Jesus Himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:17">John 20:17</span>; comp. the hint in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:62">John 6:62</span>), and is expressly mentioned by the Apostles as having taken place (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:32-33">Acts 2:32-33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:21">Acts 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22">1 Peter 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+3:1">Colossians 3:1</span>, etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:6">Ephesians 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:10">Ephesians 4:10</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:56">Acts 7:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:24">Hebrews 9:24</span>); as a <em> corporeal </em> exaltation into heaven to the seat of the glory of God, it forms the necessary historical presupposition to the preaching of <em> parousia </em> (which is a real and bodily return) as well as to the resurrection of the dead and transformation of the living, which changes have their necessary condition in the glorified body of Christ, who consummates them; ( 1Co 15:5 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:8">1 Corinthians 15:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:16">1 Corinthians 15:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:22-23">1 Corinthians 15:22-23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="php+3:20-21">Philippians 3:20-21</span>, etc.).’ Luke alone narrates the circumstances. These are not improbable in themselves; nor is it likely that our Lord would leave so important an event without witnesses. Luke wrote accounts during the lifetime of some of the Apostles, and his statements were received without contradiction and even without question.
