ON THE FACT OF THE ASCENSION. This must be accepted on unimpeachable evidence. Meyer affirms this, adding: ‘For besides being reported historically (here, Acts 1:0, Mark 16:0), it was expressly foretold by Jesus Himself (John 20:17; comp. the hint in John 6:62), and is expressly mentioned by the Apostles as having taken place (Acts 2:32-33; Acts 3:21; 1 Peter 3:22; Colossians 3:1, etc.; Ephesians 2:6; Ephesians 4:10; comp. Acts 7:56; 1 Timothy 3:16; Hebrews 9:24); as a  corporeal  exaltation into heaven to the seat of the glory of God, it forms the necessary historical presupposition to the preaching of  parousia  (which is a real and bodily return) as well as to the resurrection of the dead and transformation of the living, which changes have their necessary condition in the glorified body of Christ, who consummates them; ( 1Co 15:5 ; 1 Corinthians 15:8; 1 Corinthians 15:16; 1 Corinthians 15:22-23; Philippians 3:20-21, etc.).’ Luke alone narrates the circumstances. These are not improbable in themselves; nor is it likely that our Lord would leave so important an event without witnesses. Luke wrote accounts during the lifetime of some of the Apostles, and his statements were received without contradiction and even without question.
