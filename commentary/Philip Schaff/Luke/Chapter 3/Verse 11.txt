Luke 3:11.  He that hath two coats,  etc. This reply says nothing of faith and love. John belonged to the dispensation of the law, was a preacher of repentance, a forerunner of the Saviour. The answer was correct, but necessarily incomplete. The principle is that of unselfishness, which is set forth by our Lord, in the Sermon on the Mount, as  self-denying love. This is the link between the two preachers, as far as moral precepts are concerned.
