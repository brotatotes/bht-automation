Luke 3:14.  Soldiers. Some soldiers. The original refers to those in actual service at the time. They may have had police duty to perform. That they were foreign mercenaries employed by Herod is less likely, since the inference is that they were either Jews or men like Cornelius (Acts 10:0).
	 Do violence to no one. The verb first means ‘to shake violently,’ then to oppress, vex, lay under contribution, etc.
	 Neither accuse any  wrongfull y. Lit., neither be sycophants,  i.e., play the spy, be informers, slander, etc. For such conduct military service, in those days, afforded great opportunity.
	 Be content with your wages.  Mutinies on account of pay were frequent, especially among the soldiers of dependent kings. John did not say: Throw away your arms and desert your colors; but: Do not abuse your power. His exhortation plainly implies the lawfulness of the military profession, and consequently the right of war under certain circumstances. John understood his audience, yet he had been a recluse. Knowledge of human nature is essential for the preacher; but a careful study of God’s Word in retirement may be a better means of obtaining it than constant intercourse with the world.
