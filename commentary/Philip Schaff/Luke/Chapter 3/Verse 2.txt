Luke 3:2.  In the high priesthood of Annas and  Caiaphas. There could be properly but one high-priest, holding office for life; the verse therefore suggests some peculiar state of things. From other sources we learn: that Annas had been high-priest, but was deposed by the Romans some years before; that, after a number of changes his son-in-law Caiaphas was made high-priest, holding the office at this time. Annas, however, is called the high-priest in Acts 4:6, and still exercised some functions of the office (John 18:13). Annas was probably recognized by the Jews as the  legitimate high-priest, while Caiaphas was accepted as high-priest  de facto,  whenever contact with Roman authority made such a recognition necessary. The name of Annas comes first on account of his age and influence. Others suppose that the two alternated yearly in the office; others, that Annas was the deputy to the high-priest (2 Kings 25:18), thus evading the Roman interference. The first view is the best, especially as it involves a protest against the unlawful meddling with an office of God’s appointment. Comp. on Matthew 26:2; Matthew 26:57.
