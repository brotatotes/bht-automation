<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:2">Luke 3:2</span>. <strong> In the high priesthood of Annas and</strong> <strong> Caiaphas.</strong> There could be properly but one high-priest, holding office for life; the verse therefore suggests some peculiar state of things. From other sources we learn: that Annas had been high-priest, but was deposed by the Romans some years before; that, after a number of changes his son-in-law Caiaphas was made high-priest, holding the office at this time. Annas, however, is called the high-priest in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:6">Acts 4:6</span>, and still exercised some functions of the office (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:13">John 18:13</span>). Annas was probably recognized by the Jews as the <em> legitimate</em> high-priest, while Caiaphas was accepted as high-priest <em> de facto, </em> whenever contact with Roman authority made such a recognition necessary. The name of Annas comes first on account of his age and influence. Others suppose that the two alternated yearly in the office; others, that Annas was the deputy to the high-priest (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2ki+25:18">2 Kings 25:18</span>), thus evading the Roman interference. The first view is the best, especially as it involves a protest against the unlawful meddling with an office of God’s appointment.
