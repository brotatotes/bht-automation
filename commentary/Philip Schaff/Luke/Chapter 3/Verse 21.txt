<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:21">Luke 3:21</span>. Lukeâ€™s account of the baptism of Jesus is concise, but we have some new details.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> When all the people were baptised. </strong> These baptisms preceded that of our Lord; probably few were present on the latter occasion. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Jesus also having</strong> <strong> been baptised, and praying</strong>. The baptism took place first, then the prayer. Luke alone mentions the <em> </em> latter. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> The heaven was opened</strong> <em> . </em> Matthew and Mark say, to Jesus; John, to the Baptist; Luke simply states the fact. This variety and agreement show that some actual external phenomenon occurred.</p>
