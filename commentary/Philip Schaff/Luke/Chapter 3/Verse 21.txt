Luke 3:21. Lukeâ€™s account of the baptism of Jesus is concise, but we have some new details.
	 When all the people were baptised.  These baptisms preceded that of our Lord; probably few were present on the latter occasion.  Jesus also having  been baptised, and praying. The baptism took place first, then the prayer. Luke alone mentions the   latter.  The heaven was opened  .  Matthew and Mark say, to Jesus; John, to the Baptist; Luke simply states the fact. This variety and agreement show that some actual external phenomenon occurred.
