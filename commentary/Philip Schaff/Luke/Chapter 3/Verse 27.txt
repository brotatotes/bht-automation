Luke 3:27.  Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel (Gr.  Salathiel)  , Here the two genealogies probably, but not certainly, coincide (comp. Matthew 1:13). Salathiel is here called ‘the son of Neri;’ in Matthew he is represented as the son of Jeconiah. We may assume a Levirate marriage, or the marriage of Salathiel with a daughter of Neri. Just at that point of the history (the beginning of the captivity) such things would be most likely to occur.
