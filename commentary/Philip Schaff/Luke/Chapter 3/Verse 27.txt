<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:27">Luke 3:27</span>. <strong> Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel</strong> (Gr. <em> Salathiel</em>) <em> ,</em> Here the two genealogies probably, but not certainly, coincide (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:13">Matthew 1:13</span>). Salathiel is here called ‘the son of Neri;’ in Matthew he is represented as the son of Jeconiah. We may assume a Levirate marriage, or the marriage of Salathiel with a daughter of Neri. Just at that point of the history (the beginning of the captivity) such things would be most likely to occur.</p>
