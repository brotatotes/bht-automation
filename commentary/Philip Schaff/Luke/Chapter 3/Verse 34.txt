<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:34">Luke 3:34</span>, ff. etc. From Abraham to Adam, comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:10-26">Genesis 11:10-26</span>. The only variation is the insertion here of <strong> Cainan</strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:36">Luke 3:36</span>), between ‘Salah’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ch+1:18">1 Chronicles 1:18</span>: ‘Shelah’) and ‘Arphaxad.’ This agrees with the LXX. (Genesis), but with no other Old Testament record. Explanations: 1 . That the Jews corrupted the Hebrew in these chronological passages; 2 . That the LXX. is incorrect, though followed here; 3 . Less probably that the transcriber inserted it here by mistake, and from this passage it got into the LXX. Whether ( 1 .) or ( 2 .) be adopted must depend upon the view taken of the whole chronological difference between the Hebrew Bible and the Greek version. (The latter gives a period before Christ of more than five thousand years.)</p>
