Luke 3:34, ff. etc. From Abraham to Adam, comp. Genesis 11:10-26. The only variation is the insertion here of  Cainan (Luke 3:36), between ‘Salah’ (1 Chronicles 1:18: ‘Shelah’) and ‘Arphaxad.’ This agrees with the LXX. (Genesis), but with no other Old Testament record. Explanations: 1 . That the Jews corrupted the Hebrew in these chronological passages; 2 . That the LXX. is incorrect, though followed here; 3 . Less probably that the transcriber inserted it here by mistake, and from this passage it got into the LXX. Whether ( 1 .) or ( 2 .) be adopted must depend upon the view taken of the whole chronological difference between the Hebrew Bible and the Greek version. (The latter gives a period before Christ of more than five thousand years.)
