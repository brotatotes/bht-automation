<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:38">Luke 3:38</span>. <strong> The son of God.</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> Luke does not add this, to prove that Jesus was the son of God. It implies that Adam was <em> created directly</em> by God, also that he stood in a closer relation to God than other creatures. This relation stands in close connection with the fact of the Nativity. The appearance of the Son of God in the highest sense, to redeem, as the second Adam, the fallen race which sprang from the first, proves the exalted position of unfallen man. ‘If man were not the offspring of God, the incarnation would be impossible.’ (Godet.)
