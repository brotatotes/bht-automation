<p>The ministry of John is narrated by all four Evangelists. Peculiar to Luke are: the chronological notice (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:1">Luke 3:1</span>), which points out the exact position of the main gospel facts on the wide platform of universal history; he quotes the fuller quotation from Isaiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:4-6">Luke 3:4-6</span>), and Several particulars exemplifying John’s teaching (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:10-14">Luke 3:10-14</span>). Matthew and Mark pass at once to the announcement of the coming of the Messiah, but Luke prefaces it with a description of the state of expectation prevalent among the people (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:15">Luke 3:15</span>) answering to the fuller account of John (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19-25">John 1:19-25</span>). The imprisonment of the Baptist and the cause of it are mentioned here (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:19-20">Luke 3:19-20</span>) to complete the account of John’s activity; the baptism of Jesus and the Divine attestation which accompanied it, coming last (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:21-22">Luke 3:21-22</span>) as most important and as a resumption of the main thread of the history. On the character and mission of John the Baptist, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:1-12">Matthew 3:1-12</span>.</p>
