<p>ON THE TRANSLATION OF THE GENEALOGY. <strong> </strong> The formula: ‘which was,’ has nothing answering to it, in the original, and ought to be omitted. The spelling of the names has been altered in many cases to accord with the correct reading, in others to conform to the Hebrew names as given in the Old Testament. The tracing back of the genealogy to Adam agrees well with the expressions of Paul about the second Adam (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:0">1 Corinthians 15:0</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:0">Romans 5:0</span>), and with the character of Luke’s Gospel. Yet it would be too much to say that Luke traced the line back of Abraham out of regard for Gentile readers.</p>
