Luke 3:7-9. See on Matthew 3:7-10.
	 Multitudes. Matthew: ‘many of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’ In this case as in that of every popular preacher, many of the hearers were attracted by idle curiosity or worse motives. John knew this, and adopted this severe tone. The agreement with Matthew is close, but in Luke 3:8, we have fruits instead of ‘fruit,’ and begin not instead of ‘think not.’
	 Luke 3:10-14 are peculiar to Luke.
