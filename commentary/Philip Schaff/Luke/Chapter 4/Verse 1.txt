Luke 4:1.  Full of the Holy Spirit,  which came upon Him at His baptism. ‘Full of the Holy Spirit,’ He throughout this conflict wields victoriously ‘the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.’
	 In The Spirit. Not quite the same as ‘by the Spirit;’ the idea of His abiding in the Spirit as the element of His life is included.
	 In the wilderness. More correct than ‘into,’ implying that the leading of the Spirit continued there, ‘during forty days.’
