The ruler of the synagogue usually called upon persons of learning or note to read and explain, and respectable strangers were sometimes invited to give a word of exhortation (Acts 13:15). The exercises were under proper control. Our Lord thus asked the privilege, which was the more readily granted, as those present evidently knew of His previous activity elsewhere. This first appearance of Jesus, as a public instructor, in the synagogue He had attended in youth, before those among whom He had been brought up, assures His sympathy to those placed in similar circumstances.
