<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> To set at liberty them that are bruised.</strong> Found in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+58:6">Isaiah 58:6</span>, not in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span>. Our Lord read what was in the roll, but Luke gives the general drift of the passage. The meaning of this prophetic citation may be better seen, when we remember that it stands in the middle of the third great division of the book of Isaiah (chaps. 49 - 66 ), that namely, which comprises the prophecies of the person, office, sufferings, triumph, and church of the Messiah; and thus by implication announces the <em> fulfilment of all that went before</em>, in Him who then addressed them.’ Alford.</p>
