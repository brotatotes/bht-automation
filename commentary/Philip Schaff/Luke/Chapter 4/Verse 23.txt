Luke 4:23.  Doubtless ye will say. This reply is based upon something deeper than the question of Luke 4:22. The tone throughout is that of reproof.
	 This parable. A proverb, according to our use of terms, but a proverb is usually a condensed parable, see p. 117 .
	 Physician. Luke, the physician, presents Christ as the Physician; our Lord implies that this is His office.
	 Heal thyself. Help thine own countrymen, who are naturally nearest to thee. Others paraphrase it: If thou wilt be a helper of others (physician), help thyself from the want of respect and esteem among us, by working miracles here as thou hast done in Capernaum. The former seems the more natural explanation. Comp, the similar reproach at the crucifixion (‘Himself He cannot save’ ） the one is the natural development of the other, envy ripening into malice.
	 Done at Capernaum. On Capernaum, see Matthew 4:13. The correct reading may mean ‘done  for Capernaum.’ He had certainly been already active there. The inhabitants of Nazareth would naturally be jealous of the larger place, and might hope that He would make His early home the centre of miraculous displays. Local pride was involved, and the material advantage was the only motive of any wish they had for His presence among them. Evil men may boast of a distinguished Christian townsman.
