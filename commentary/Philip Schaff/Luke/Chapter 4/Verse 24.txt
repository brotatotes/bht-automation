Luke 4:24.  No prophet is acceptable, etc. Hence the proverb, ‘Physician, heal thyself,’ could not be fulfilled,  i.e., He could not work here as in Capernaum. The similarity of thought with the saying in Matthew and Mark is an argument for the identity of the visits, the great difference of form is a stronger argument against it.
