Luke 4:30.  But he passing through the midst of  them. As the Nazarenes had Him in custody there was something miraculous in this escape. That they were struck blind, or that He became invisible, is not in accordance with the expression, ‘passing through the midst of them.’ By allowing ‘His personal majesty’ to appear, He might effect this escape, but it cannot be explained as the result of merely human decision, however potent that has been in disorderly mobs. The view that He, visible to them all, passed through them, making them feel His superhuman power restraining them, showing them their own powerlessness against Him, presents no difficulty to those who believe in miracles, and such a miracle was called for. His time was not  yet come, and He would thus protect Himself. Besides, they had demanded a miracle, and now they obtained one, a miracle of judgment on them all, not only in the restraint then put upon them, but in the consequence, namely, that He  went his way. We suppose directly to Capernaum, without returning to Nazareth at all.
