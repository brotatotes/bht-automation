THE TEMPTATION.   See on Matthew 14:1-11. The  second temptation in Matthewâ€™s account is placed last by Luke. The order of Matthew is correct, because Matthew uses  phrases  (Luke 4:5; Luke 4:8) which indicate direct succession, and Luke does not. The same is true of the closing verses of the two accounts. The correct text shows most clearly the independence of the Evangelists.
