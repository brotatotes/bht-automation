<p>THE TEMPTATION. <strong> </strong> See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:1-11">Matthew 14:1-11</span>. The <em> second</em> temptation in Matthewâ€™s account is placed last by Luke. The order of Matthew is correct, because Matthew uses <em> phrases </em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:5">Luke 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:8">Luke 4:8</span>) which indicate direct succession, and Luke does not. The same is true of the closing verses of the two accounts. The correct text shows most clearly the independence of the Evangelists.</p>
