CHRONOLOGY.   A number of events occurred in Judea before the ministry in Galilee spoken of in Luke 4:14-15, according to Andrews the whole of the first year. (See notes on Matthew 4:12; comp. John 1:35 to John 3:36.) We hold that this rejection at Nazareth (Luke 4:16-30), is in its proper chronological position, and that a similar occurrence mentioned by Matthew (Matthew 13:54-58) and Mark (Mark 6:1-6) toot place later: 1 . This early rejection accounts for our Lordâ€™s removal from Nazareth to Capernaum, as the centre of His activity (Matthew 4:13). 2 . The close of the section (Luke 4:31) indicates that Capernaum now became for the first time such a centre, though He had already been there (Luke 4:23). 3 . Two such rejections, closely resembling each other in some features, are not impossible, while it is difficult to believe that the event recorded by Matthew and Mark took place so early in the history. 4 . All notice of followers is omitted. Mark (Mark 6:1) expressly states that His disciples followed Him on that occasion; and the attempt to cast Him down headlong could not have occurred so late in His ministry, without calling forth a demonstration from these followers. If there was but one rejection, Luke, who gives the most detailed account, has probably put it in the proper place.
