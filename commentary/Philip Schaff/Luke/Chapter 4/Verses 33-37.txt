Luke 4:33-37.   THE HEALING OF A DEMONIAC in the synagogue at Capernaum. See on Mark 1:23-28.
	 A spirit of an unclean demon (Luke 4:33). Mark: ‘in unclean spirit’ ‘Spirit’ is defined by ‘unclean demon;’ the word ‘unclean’ being inserted, either because in Greek ‘demon’ might be either good or bad, and Luke, when speaking of a ‘demon’ for the first time, would naturally define which kind he meant; or perhaps, because the effect upon the possessed person made the word peculiarly appropriate.
	 Ah! The word occurs only here. In the parallel passage (Mark 1:24) it is to be omitted. It means either ‘let be,’ ‘let us alone,’ or more probably, ‘Ah!’ a cry of wonder mixed with fear.
	 Having done him no  hurt. This detail is added by Luke, the physician.
	 What is this word? Of what kind is it?
	 For, or ‘that,’  with authority and power (Luke 4:36). The former refers to the power which He had, the latter to its exercise.
