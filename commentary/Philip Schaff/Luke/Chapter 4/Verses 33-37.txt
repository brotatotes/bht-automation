<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> A spirit of an unclean demon</strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:33">Luke 4:33</span>). Mark: ‘in unclean spirit’ ‘Spirit’ is defined by ‘unclean demon;’ the word ‘unclean’ being inserted, either because in Greek ‘demon’ might be either good or bad, and Luke, when speaking of a ‘demon’ for the first time, would naturally define which kind he meant; or perhaps, because the effect upon the possessed person made the word peculiarly appropriate.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Ah!</strong> The word occurs only here. In the parallel passage (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:24">Mark 1:24</span>) it is to be omitted. It means either ‘let be,’ ‘let us alone,’ or more probably, ‘Ah!’ a cry of wonder mixed with fear.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Having done him no</strong> <strong> hurt.</strong> This detail is added by Luke, the physician.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> What is this word?</strong> Of what kind is it?
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> For,</strong> or ‘that,’ <strong> with authority and power</strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:36">Luke 4:36</span>). The former refers to the power which He had, the latter to its exercise.</p>
