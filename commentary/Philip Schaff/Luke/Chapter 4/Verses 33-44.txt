<p>CHRONOLOGY. This section corresponds exactly in its details with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:21-39">Mark 1:21-39</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:14-17">Matthew 8:14-17</span> is the parallel to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:38-42">Luke 4:38-42</span>). Mark is more exact in placing these occurrences <em> after</em> the calling of the first four Apostles. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:38">Luke 4:38</span> implies a previous intimacy with Simon Peter. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:21-22">Mark 1:21-22</span>, corresponds exactly with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:31-32">Luke 4:31-32</span> of this chapter, and in the former passage it is distinctly asserted that the four disciples went with Him into Capernaum on this occasion. The miraculous draught of fishes (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:1-11">Luke 5:1-11</span>) therefore took place <em> after</em> the rejection at Nazareth, and <em> before</em> the miracles here recorded.</p>
