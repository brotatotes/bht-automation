CHRONOLOGY. This section corresponds exactly in its details with Mark 1:21-39 (Matthew 8:14-17 is the parallel to Luke 4:38-42). Mark is more exact in placing these occurrences  after the calling of the first four Apostles. Luke 4:38 implies a previous intimacy with Simon Peter. Mark 1:21-22, corresponds exactly with Luke 4:31-32 of this chapter, and in the former passage it is distinctly asserted that the four disciples went with Him into Capernaum on this occasion. The miraculous draught of fishes (chap. Luke 5:1-11) therefore took place  after the rejection at Nazareth, and  before the miracles here recorded.
