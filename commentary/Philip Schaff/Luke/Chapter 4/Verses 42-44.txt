Luke 4:42-44. RETIREMENT AND SUBSEQUENT PREACHING.   Mark (Mark 1:35-39) is much fuller. The difference in the  words of the two accounts is remarkable.
	 Bring the good tidings. Lit., ‘evangelize.’ The word does not occur in Matthew and Mark.
	 For therefore  was I sent (Luke 4:43). ‘For to this end came I forth’ (Mark). The two independent accounts suggest the harmony of will between the Father and the Son in the coming work of Redemption.
	 He preached (was preaching, continued to preach) a different word from that in Luke 4:43, meaning to proclaim as a herald does.
	 In the synagogues of Judea (Luke 4:44). This is the more probable reading. If the common reading be accepted, we can identify this journey with that spoken of in Mark 1:39. Luke probably gives here a general sketch of our Lord’s first circuit in Galilee, and includes also the journey to Jerusalem, mentioned in John 5:0, which took place not very long afterwards (or before, according to some). It is characteristic of Luke to sum up or anticipate this. But as none of the first three evangelists ever allude to these earlier journeys to Jerusalem, and such an allusion here seemed strange, the transcribers soon changed ‘Judea’ into ‘Galilee,’ which is found in many ancient authorities. The latter reading is, however, retained by many editors.
