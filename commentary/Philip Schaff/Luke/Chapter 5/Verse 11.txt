Luke 5:11.  They left all. The special call to James and John (Matthew 4:21) probably intervened
	 Followed him. Luke thus indicates that they thenceforth constantly attended Him. The whole occurrence was allegorized very early:   the boat being taken as representing the Church; the net, doctrine; the sea, the heathen world; the bursting of the net, heresies. The fish was a favorite symbol among the early Christians, especially as the initial letters of the Greek phrase: Jesus Christ, son of God, Saviour, made up the word meaning fish ( Ιχθυς ). Much of this is fanciful. The miracle after the resurrection (John 21:0), in which Peter was equally prominent, when the Shepherd’s duty was added to that of the Fisher, forms a parallel and contrast to this one. The earlier miracle is ‘symbolical of the gathering of men into the outward kingdom of God on earth, from which they may be lost;’ the later one of ‘the gathering of the elect souls into the kingdom of glory, none of whom will be lost.’ Trench (after Augustine).
