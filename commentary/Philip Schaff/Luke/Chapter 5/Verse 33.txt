Luke 5:33.  And they Mid to him. This seems to refer to the Scribes and Pharisees (Luke 5:30). Matthew makes ‘the disciples of John’ the questioners, and Mark joins both classes. Both were present; they were together in their practice (see on Matthew 9:14), as probably in their objections.
	 The disciples John, etc. This is not in the form of a question.
	 And make prayers. Peculiar to Luke. It refers to stated prayers, like those of ascetics.
