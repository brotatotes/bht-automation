<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:33">Luke 5:33</span>. <strong> And they Mid to him.</strong> This seems to refer to the Scribes and Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:30">Luke 5:30</span>). Matthew makes ‘the disciples of John’ the questioners, and Mark joins both classes. Both were present; they were together in their practice (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:14">Matthew 9:14</span>), as probably in their objections.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> The disciples John,</strong> etc. This is not in the form of a question.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> And make prayers.</strong> Peculiar to Luke. It refers to stated prayers, like those of ascetics.</p>
