<p>TIME. The miraculous draught of fishes took <strong> </strong> place shortly after the rejection at Nazareth, but <em> before</em> the healing of Simon’s mother-in-law (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:38-39">Luke 4:38-39</span>); for at that time these four fishermen were already in close attendance upon our Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:29-30">Mark 1:29-30</span>). The indefinite language of Luke in regard to time, plainly admits of this view.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> IDENTITY <strong> </strong> with the occurrence related in different form by Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:18-22">Matthew 4:18-22</span>) and Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:16-20">Mark 1:16-20</span>). Reasons for believing that all three Evangelists refer to the same call of the fishermen, Matthew and Mark giving prominence to the call, and Luke to the miracle which preceded it, and prepared for obedience to it: ( 1 .) Luke intends us to understand that this was the call of Peter and his companions to follow Christ constantly. ( 2 .) A repetition of the promise to make them ‘fishers of men’ is improbable. ( 3 .) A two-fold leaving of their nets is equally so. ( 4 .) The omission of the miracle by the other two Evangelists is not against the identity, for such omissions occur when there can be no doubt that they are telling of the same occurrence. ( 5 .) A previous <strong> </strong> acquaintance with Peter seems to be implied here, but that does not prove that he had been called before, for John (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:41-42">John 1:41-42</span>) tells us of an acquaintanceship before the call. ( 6 .) No mention is made of Andrew, but <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:9">Luke 5:9</span> tells of others in Peter’s boat, while in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:14">Luke 6:14</span>. Andrew is mentioned as having already been a disciple, and then chosen as an Apostle. Peter here is an example for us: To hear when the Lord speaks <strong> ;</strong> to labor when He commands; to believe what He promises; to follow whither He calls. The fishermen were blessed while laboring in their own calling.</p>
