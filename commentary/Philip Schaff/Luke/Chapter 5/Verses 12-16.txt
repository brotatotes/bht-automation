Luke 5:12-16. HEALING OF A LEPER.  One of the cities (Luke 5:12). Probably not Capernaum.
	 Full of leprosy. A term of medical accuracy, probably referring to the severity of the disease in this case. On this disease, see Matthew 8:2. In Luke 5:14, there is a change to the direct address:  but go, and show thyself,  etc. Luke 5:16 breaks off the direct connection of time with what follows; the length of the interval is uncertain.
