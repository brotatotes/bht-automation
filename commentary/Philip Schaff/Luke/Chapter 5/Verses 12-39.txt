<p>CHRONOLOGY. <em> </em> The occurrences mentioned in <em> </em> this section are detailed by Matthew and Mark. The latter (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:40">Luke 1:40</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:22">Luke 2:22</span>) places them in the same order, but Matthew inserts the healing of the leper immediately after the Sermon on the Mount (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:1-4">Luke 8:1-4</span>), and groups the other events together after the return from Gadara (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:2-17">Luke 9:2-17</span>). The order of Mark, up to the call of Levi (Matthew), is exact, but Levi’s feast belongs to a later period. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:2-17">Matthew 9:2-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:1">Matthew 8:1</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:40">Mark 1:40</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:22">Mark 2:22</span>.
