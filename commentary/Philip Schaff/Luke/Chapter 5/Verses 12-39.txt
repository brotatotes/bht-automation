CHRONOLOGY.   The occurrences mentioned in   this section are detailed by Matthew and Mark. The latter (Luke 1:40 to Luke 2:22) places them in the same order, but Matthew inserts the healing of the leper immediately after the Sermon on the Mount (chap. Luke 8:1-4), and groups the other events together after the return from Gadara (Luke 9:2-17). The order of Mark, up to the call of Levi (Matthew), is exact, but Levi’s feast belongs to a later period. See on Matthew 9:2-17; Matthew 8:1; comp. Mark 1:40 to Mark 2:22. The chief peculiarity of Luke’s account is in Luke 5:39.
