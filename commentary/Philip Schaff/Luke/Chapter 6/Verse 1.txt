Luke 6:1.  On a sabbath. The common reading ‘second-first,’ has good support; but is omitted in the oldest and best manuscripts. It is probable that this unusual phrase arose from the putting together of two Greek words (second.. first), which had been written in the margin to distinguish this Sabbath respectively from that mentioned in Luke 4:31, and that in Luke 6:6. Many, however, think the singularity of the phrase led to the omission. If Luke did use it, the meaning must have been one known to Theophilus. Explanations of the common reading: ( 1 ) That it meant a feast day immediately following the Sabbath (but thus the controversy about Sabbath observance loses much of its point); ( 2 ) a Sabbath preceded by a feast day; ( 3 ) the first day of unleavened bread; the Sabbath following the second day of the Passover, from which the seven weeks to Pentecost were reckoned (the usual view); ( 4 ) the first Sabbath of the second month; ( 5 ) the first Sabbath of the second year in the circle of seven years. This would fix the date as the first Sabbath in the month  Nisan, U.C. 782 . All these explanations assume that Theophilus was acquainted with a technical term in the Jewish Church year, which is not found anywhere else. ( 6 ) That Luke had already told of two Sabbaths (Luke 4:16; Luke 4:31), and as he now begins to tell of two more, he speaks of this as the first of the second pair,   i.e.  ,   ‘second-first.’ But what reader would have understood it so at first sight? The grain might be ripe in April, May, or June, so that we cannot thus determine the time of year. The common view makes this the first event after the second Passover, and seeks here a confirmation. But according to Andrews it was two months after that Passover, in the first year of the Galilean ministry.
	 Rubbing them with their  hands. Peculiar to Luke. The form indicates that they rubbed and ate, as they went.
