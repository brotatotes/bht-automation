<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> His disciples,</strong> in the wider sense, though the Twelve were nearest and the people present. Alford: ‘The discourse was spoken to the disciples generally, to the Twelve particularly, to the people prospectively.’ Our Lord probably sat as He taught (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span>), as this was His custom and that of Jewish teachers in general. Nor is this forbidden by <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:17">Luke 6:17</span>, since an interval of healing had elapsed.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Poor, </strong> <em> i.e.,</em> <strong> </strong> ‘poor in spirit’ (Matthew). To refer this only to literal poverty, etc., and to limit the blessings to the <em> temporal recompense</em> in the Messiah’s kingdom, is forbidden by the context no less than by the account in Matthew. Neither the Evangelist nor our Lord could mean this. In chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:21">Luke 12:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:11">Luke 16:11</span>, Luke shows his knowledge of the distinction between spiritual and earthly riches. An appeal on the part of our Lord to the prejudices of the poor and miserable, like a modern demagogue, is as contrary to His character as to the effect of His teaching.
