Luke 6:22. Comp. Matthew 5:10-11. Luke, however, inserts the foundation of the persecution: when men shall hate you. This hatred is manifested in what follows: exclude you  , etc. This refers to expulsion, or excommunication, from the Jewish synagogue. The separation of Christianity from Judaism is hinted at thus early, immediately after the choice of the Twelve. But all exclusion from intercourse may be included.
	 Revile  .  The same word as in Matthew. Active persecution is meant.
	 Cast out your name as evil  . The final contemptuous and malicious rejection. There is probably no reference to their name as Christians.
	 For the Son of man’s sake. The blessing is promised only to those who endure hatred, rejection, persecution, for Christ’s sake.
