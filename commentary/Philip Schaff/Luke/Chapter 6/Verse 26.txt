Luke 6:26. When all men shall speak well of you  .  This may be addressed, either to the rich, etc., or to the disciples. The former agrees best with what goes before, but the latter is favored by the reference to their fathers, which serves to distinguish those addressed from the Jews. The wider reference would include the other: for when all men speak well of a professed disciple, it is a proof that he is not a disciple. ‘Universal praise from the world is a stigma for the Saviour’s disciples, since it brings them into the suspicion: ( 1 ) of unfaithfulness, ( 2 ) of characterlessness, ( 3 ) of the lust of pleasing. False prophets can ever reckon upon loud applause.’ Van Oosterzee.
