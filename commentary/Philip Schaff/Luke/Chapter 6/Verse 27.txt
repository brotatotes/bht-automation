<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:27">Luke 6:27</span>. Unto you that hear <strong><em> ,</em></strong> <strong> i.e.</strong>, <strong> </strong> who now hear me. This verse corresponds with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:44">Matthew 5:44</span>. (There is no parallel to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:13-42">Matthew 5:13-42</span>, setting forth the contrast between the teaching followed by the Pharisees and the teaching of Christ.) Our Lord could utter woes against these enemies of His people, His people were not to hate them but to love them; so that the connection brings out the Gospel principle of hating sin but not the sinner.
