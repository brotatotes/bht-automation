Luke 6:40.  The disciple is not above his master, or teacher, etc. See on Matthew 10:24. The connection here is very different. There the principle is assigned as a reason for the disciples’ expecting persecution; here it admonishes to be like the Master in humility and charitableness.
	 When he is perfected, or ‘fully instructed,’ knowing and consequently endeavoring to do his duty. Others explain thus: ‘Only if a disciple surpassed his master could he hope to be preserved from the ditch into which he sees his blind leader fall. Since, however, the disciple does not commonly surpass the master, he has also the same danger to fear. As a rule every one is constituted like his master.’ (Van Oosterzee.) In either case the connection with the next verse implies a caution to them, as teachers, against uncharitableness.
