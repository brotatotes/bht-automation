<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:47">Luke 6:47</span>. This verse is to be closely connected with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:16">Luke 6:16</span>, which should end with a semicolon; this close connection seems to preclude the previous delivery of a discourse on the top of the mountain.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> On a level place</strong>. This refers more naturally to a plain below the mountain, but it can mean a level place on the mountain side. This sense is adopted by those who uphold the identity of the two discourses, and is favored by the appearance of the locality where the discourse was most probably delivered: the Horns of Hattin (see the Chapter comments on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:0">Matthew 5:0</span>). The Apostles are here represented as immediately about Him, then <strong> a great multitude of his disciples</strong> (in the wider sense), then, <strong> a great number of the people</strong>, etc. This agrees with the probable position and composition of the audience as implied in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span>, while the specification of the places from which they came agrees with Markâ€™s account (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:7-8">Luke 3:7-8</span>) of the multitude attending Him about this time.</p>
