<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:5">Luke 6:5</span>. In one of the old manuscripts, this verse is placed after <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:10">Luke 6:10</span>, and instead of it here words to this effect: ‘Observing on the same day one laboring on the Sabbath, He said to him: if thou knowest what thou doest, thou art blessed; if thou knowest not, thou art cursed and a transgressor of the law.’ But it is improbable that any one would have been thus laboring, or that our Lord would thus create needless opposition and misunderstanding.</p>
