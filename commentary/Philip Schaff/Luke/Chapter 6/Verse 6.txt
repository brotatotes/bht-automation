<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:6">Luke 6:6</span>. <strong> On another sabbath.</strong> Probably the next one. This seems more likely than that the next day was observed as a Sabbath.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:7-10">Luke 6:7-10</span> agree closely with Markâ€™s account. Matthew inserts in this connection a thought mentioned by Luke as uttered on a similar occasion (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:1-5">Luke 14:1-5</span>), but there is no reason for inferring a confusion in the statements.</p>
