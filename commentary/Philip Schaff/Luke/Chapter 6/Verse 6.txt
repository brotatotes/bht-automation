Luke 6:6.  On another sabbath. Probably the next one. This seems more likely than that the next day was observed as a Sabbath.
	 Right  hand.  Specified by Luke only.
	 Luke 6:7-10 agree closely with Markâ€™s account. Matthew inserts in this connection a thought mentioned by Luke as uttered on a similar occasion (chap. Luke 14:1-5), but there is no reason for inferring a confusion in the statements.
