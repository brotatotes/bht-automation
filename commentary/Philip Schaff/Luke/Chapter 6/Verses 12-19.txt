The choice of the Twelve (Luke 6:12-16). Comp. Mark 3:13-19; Matthew gives the list of Apostles in the account of their being sent forth (Matthew 10:0; comp. Mark 6:7 ff.; Luke 9:1-6). Luke 6:17-19 describe the multitudes to whom a discourse (Luke 6:20-49) was delivered, which seems to be identical with the sermon on the mount, see the Chapter Comments on Matthew 5:0. Accepting, but without insisting upon, the identity of the discourses, we find Luke much fuller than Matthew in detailing the circumstances, but less full and exact in the report of the discourse.
