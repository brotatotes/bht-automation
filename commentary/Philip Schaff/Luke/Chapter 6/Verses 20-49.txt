ON THE PLAN of the Sermon on the Mount, see the Chapter comments on Matthew 5:0. The subject both here and in Matthew is the state and duties of a citizen of the kingdom of heaven. Van Oosterzee gives the following general division of Lukeâ€™s report: 1 . The salutation of Love (Luke 6:17-26); 2 . The requirement of Love (Luke 6:27-38); 3 . The importunity of Love (Luke 6:39-49).
