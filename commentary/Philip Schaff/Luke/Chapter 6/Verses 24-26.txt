<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:24-26">Luke 6:24-26</span>. Peculiar to Luke. The difficulty of inserting them in Matthew’s report of the sermon, is one great argument against the identity of the two discourses. Some think they were uttered on a different occasion and inserted here by Luke because of their appropriateness. They agree with the conclusion of the discourse, in both Gospels, which contains a blessing and a woe in the form of a parable (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:47-49">Luke 6:47-49</span>). All the reports of our Lord’s discourses are sketches of what He said, and there is every reason to believe that the leading, or central, thoughts were repeated with various applications and inferences, so that two reports might be entirely correct, and yet introduce not only different matter, but different applications of the same general statements. The reports are too brief to be regarded as given word for word, and the method of instruction must have been, ‘line upon line,’ etc.</p>
