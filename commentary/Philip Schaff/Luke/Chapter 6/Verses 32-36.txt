<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:32-36">Luke 6:32-36</span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:45-48">Matthew 5:45-48</span>; where, however, the order is different.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:32-33">Luke 6:32-33</span>, thank <strong><em> </em></strong> (lit. ‘grace’) corresponds with ‘reward’ in Matthew.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Never despairing (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:35">Luke 6:35</span></strong>). Peculiar to Luke, and a peculiar expression. The common interpretation, however appropriate, does not convey the usual sense of the original, which means: ‘despairing in regard to nothing,’ <em> i.e.</em> <strong><em> </em></strong> regarding nothing that you thus do as lost, for the reason that ‘your reward shall be great, etc. A slight change of reading, supported by some authorities, gives the sense: ‘despairing of no one.’

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Sons of the most High</strong>, <strong> </strong> <em> i.e.,</em> <strong> </strong> of God, here and now, as evidenced by family resemblance.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Merciful</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:36">Luke 6:36</span>). In substance the same thought as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:48">Matthew 5:48</span>. The likeness to Divine perfections can exist only in moral qualities; highest among these is mercy.</p>
