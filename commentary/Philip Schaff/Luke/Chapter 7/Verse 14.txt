Luke 7:14.  The bier. An open coffin was used among the Jews.
	 The bearers stood still. Stopped, not by miraculous influence, yet probably because of our Lordâ€™s manner. That they had heard of Him is of course possible, but not certain.
	 Young man, I say onto thee, Arise.   A command, as in all the similar cases. A simple word, uttered in the exalted composure of sufficient, all-sufficient might. The simplicity of the narrative attests its truthfulness; the simplicity of the command attests the power of the Prince of Life.
