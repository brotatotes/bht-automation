<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:15">Luke 7:15</span>. <strong> And the dead man sat up, and began to speak</strong> <strong><em> . </em></strong> The commanding word wrought its proper effect. Not only life, but health and strength had returned.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> And he gave him to his mother.</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> The compassion (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:13">Luke 7:13</span>) completes its work. This act of love fulfils all that was implied in the consoling word: ‘Weep not.’

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> The sublime simplicity of Luke should guard against a too sentimental representation of the death of the young man, the sorrow of the widow, the joy of the reunion, and the like. All these, purely human, fanciful, and dramatic additions may call forth tears, without leading any nearer to the Giver of eternal Life. Doubtless the miracle itself had deeper reasons than the consolation of the widow and the quickening of the young man, even though no mention is made of them here. The effect upon others is however narrated in the verses that follow.</p>
