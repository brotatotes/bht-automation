<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> If he were a prophet,</strong> etc. Simon seems to have been inclined to regard Him as such. But he reasoned thus: a prophet would <em> know</em> what others must learn; this man cannot be a prophet, for He does not know who is touching Him since no one would knowingly allow himself to be touched by a woman of this character. The main error was in the last thought; for our Lord did allow Himself to be touched by such a person. Hence His reply sets forth why He allows this. Notice that the objection of the Pharisee was against the <em> touch</em> by an unclean person; a technical, ceremonial, and Pharisaical one. Really and morally such persons can defile by their presence: yet to this no objection was raised. Still less dared any one cast a reflection upon the <em> morality</em> of Jesus in such circumstances.</p>
