Luke 7:42.  And when they had not wherewith to pay.  They found out and confessed that they could not pay the debt. It is true that sinners have ‘nothing,’ but the verse brings out rather the discovery than the fact itself. Grateful love does not pay any part of the debt, according to the parable.
	 He forgave both.  ‘Frankly’ means ‘freely;’ but there is only one word in the original, for ‘frankly forgave.’ The forgiveness was real and personal. It does not represent an indiscriminate forgiveness of those unconscious of sin and of inability to atone for it, hence not seeking pardon in penitence and confession. The fact, not the ground, of forgiveness is here brought.
