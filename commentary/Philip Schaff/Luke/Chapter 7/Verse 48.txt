<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:48">Luke 7:48</span>. <strong> Thy sins are forgiven.</strong> This does not forbid the view that a previous sense of pardon moved the woman to acts of love. It is rather a new assurance, a more formal personal declaration. Christians have a sense of pardon awakening gratitude, but ever need more assurance of it, ever hope for and desire more; that is our faith. As appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:50">Luke 7:50</span>, it was precisely to this faith on the part of the woman, who has already felt enough to manifest her love in this way, that our Lord addressed the declaration of this verse. This is the constant and blessed action and reaction of Divine grace and Christian gratitude it awakens.</p>
