Luke 7:49.  Who is this that even forgiveth sins?  Comp. chap. Luke 5:21 and the parallel passages. Such a question was natural, and does not necessarily imply decided hostility.
	 Thy faith hath saved thee. Not love. Love is to convince others, faith lays hold of grace, and thus love is begotten. It was faith, the hope of a penitent based on the words and the character of Jesus, which brought her to the house of Simon. In this faith her love was born, and as its manifestations began, her faith was ever encouraged by the reception of her acts of love. Growing as she wept and washed His feet, it laid hold more and more fully of the pardon it expected, and received at length the full absolution (Luke 7:48). The closing words were therefore of  faith, and of its most blessed result:  go in peace, literally, ‘into peace.’ This was the state of mind to which she might now look forward. Faith first, manifestations of grateful love next, then  peace. If we consider well to whom these words were spoken, we will not forget that grace is free, or exalt our love into a ground of pardon. All her tokens of penitence and affection could not, even in the eyes of sinful men, wash away the stain of her life, but the grace of Christ led her to true peace, as her abiding condition.
