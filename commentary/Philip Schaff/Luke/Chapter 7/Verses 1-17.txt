<p>CHRONOLOGY. The healing of the centurion’s servant at Capernaum followed the discourse recorded in the last chapter, no event of which we have any account intervening. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:1">Matthew 8:1</span> ff.) The raising of the widow’s son at Nain, narrated by Luke only, occurred shortly after (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:11">Luke 7:11</span>), also without any intervening event on record. We join the two, especially since <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:17">Luke 7:17</span> is a formal conclusion, such as we often find in this Gospel.</p>
