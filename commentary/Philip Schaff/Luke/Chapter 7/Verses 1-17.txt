CHRONOLOGY. The healing of the centurion’s servant at Capernaum followed the discourse recorded in the last chapter, no event of which we have any account intervening. (See on Matthew 8:1 ff.) The raising of the widow’s son at Nain, narrated by Luke only, occurred shortly after (see Luke 7:11), also without any intervening event on record. We join the two, especially since Luke 7:17 is a formal conclusion, such as we often find in this Gospel.
