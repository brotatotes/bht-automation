<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:11-17">Luke 7:11-17</span>. THE RAISING OF THE WIDOW’S SON AT NAIN. Peculiar to Luke. Of course the silence of the other Evangelists is no argument against the truthfulness of Luke’s account. As compared with the other two similar miracles this takes a middle position. Jairus’ daughter was just dead <em> ,</em> this young man on the way to burial, Lazarus had been buried for four days.</p>
