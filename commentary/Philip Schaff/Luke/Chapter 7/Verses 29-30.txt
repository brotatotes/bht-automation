But the words: ‘And the Lord said’ (Luke 7:31), are to be omitted. The early insertion of the phrase shows that the verses were very early regarded as an explanation of the Evangelist. If they belong to our Lord’s discourse, they were introduced to show the different reception accorded to John, and thus to furnish a historical ground for the reproach which follows (Luke 7:31-34).
