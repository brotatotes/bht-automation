Luke 7:31-35. See Matthew 11:16-19. The only variation is in Luke 7:35:  all her children. In Matthew: ‘by her works.’ Here the persons are contrasted. The children of Wisdom are childlike, not childish, like the men of this generation (Luke 7:31-32). Instead of petulant treatment of the different teachers, sent of God, they have seen the wisdom of God in sending both teachers, have learned the truth from each, and thus, by estimate and corresponding act, ‘justified’ that wisdom.
