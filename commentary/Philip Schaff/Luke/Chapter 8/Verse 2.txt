Luke 8:2.  And certain women, etc. All of them had probably been cured of some affliction; hence their service was one of gratitude. Such a service, however, is contrary to the Oriental notions of propriety, founded upon low views of woman’s virtue. Christianity has done much to correct these notions. It is significant that this mention of our Lord’s female attendants should follow the account of the forgiven one in the Pharisee’s house.
	 Mary called Magdalene.  A native of Magdala (see on Matthew 15:39).
	 From whom seven demons had gone out.  This woman had been possessed of seven demons, and our Lord had cast them out. The notion of some (Dr. Lange among others) that this means released from special sinfulness, ‘seven demons’ being an expression for total subjection to the spirit of the world, is an attempt to support the legend that Mary Magdalene was the ‘sinner’ of the last chapter. But that occurrence loses its appropriateness, if we suppose that the woman had been already dispossessed of seven demons by oar Lord. The accuracy and aptness of the Gospel narrative are diminished by this theory.
