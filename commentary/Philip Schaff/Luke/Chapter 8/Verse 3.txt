<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> The wife,</strong> perhaps at that time a widow, of <strong> Chuzas Herod’s steward, </strong> <em> i.e.,</em> <strong> </strong> the ‘house-steward’ of Herod Antipas. Through this family Herod and his servants (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:2">Matthew 14:2</span>) might have heard of Jesus. Some have identified Chuzas with the ‘nobleman’ whose son was healed by our Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:46-54">John 4:46-54</span>); but the reason for Joanna’s gratitude was that she had herself been healed (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:2">Luke 8:2</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Susanna</strong> (‘lily’). Not mentioned again.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Unto them</strong> (the better supported reading), <strong> </strong> i.e. <em> ,</em> <strong> </strong> to the whole company. The alteration to the singular was probably designed to exalt the service of the women; but what was done to the disciples was done to Christ, according to His own words (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:40">Matthew 25:40</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> From their substance. </strong> This implies that some, perhaps most of them, were persons of means.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> Our Lord confided in the purity and faithfulness of His Galilean friends; He exalted women into the circle of His followers; woman’s work was at once a service of grateful love (a diaconate); these women of high position felt that constant temporal service was a fitting, though insufficient, return for spiritual benefits. Such a circle as this is possible only where Christ is; about Him as the centre, gather preaching men and ministering women in purity and harmony.
