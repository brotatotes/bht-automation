Luke 8:3.  Joanna. Her name appears again in chap. Luke 24:10.
	 The wife, perhaps at that time a widow, of  Chuzas Herod’s steward,   i.e.,   the ‘house-steward’ of Herod Antipas. Through this family Herod and his servants (Matthew 14:2) might have heard of Jesus. Some have identified Chuzas with the ‘nobleman’ whose son was healed by our Lord (John 4:46-54); but the reason for Joanna’s gratitude was that she had herself been healed (Luke 8:2).
	 Susanna (‘lily’). Not mentioned again.
	 And many others. Comp. Matthew 27:55.
	 Who ministered.  All of them were such as thus ‘ministered,’   i.e.  ,   provided food and other necessary attentions.
	 Unto them (the better supported reading),   i.e.  ,   to the whole company. The alteration to the singular was probably designed to exalt the service of the women; but what was done to the disciples was done to Christ, according to His own words (Matthew 25:40).
	 From their substance.  This implies that some, perhaps most of them, were persons of means.
	 Our Lord confided in the purity and faithfulness of His Galilean friends; He exalted women into the circle of His followers; woman’s work was at once a service of grateful love (a diaconate); these women of high position felt that constant temporal service was a fitting, though insufficient, return for spiritual benefits. Such a circle as this is possible only where Christ is; about Him as the centre, gather preaching men and ministering women in purity and harmony.
