<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Thinketh he hath</strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:18">Luke 8:18</span>) is peculiar to Luke. It is self-deception, not deception of others that is referred to. Luke omits the other parables, given by Matthew and Mark, inserting two of them in a different connection however (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:18-21">Luke 13:18-21</span>).</p>
