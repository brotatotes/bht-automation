Luke 8:16-18. See on Mark 4:21-25. The same thoughts occur in Matthew in different connections.
	 Thinketh he hath (Luke 8:18) is peculiar to Luke. It is self-deception, not deception of others that is referred to. Luke omits the other parables, given by Matthew and Mark, inserting two of them in a different connection however (chap. Luke 13:18-21).
