Luke 8:19-21. THE MOTHER AND BRETHREN OF JESUS SEEK HIM.   See on Matthew 12:46-50; Mark 3:31-35. Luke presents no new incidents. The reason for putting this occurrence out of the exact order, may have been thus to enforce the lesson of the parable concerning the right hearing and doing of the word.
