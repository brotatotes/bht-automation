Luke 8:22-25. The Storm on the Lake. See on Matthew 8:23-27; Mark 4:35-41. Before starting, the incidents mentioned in chap. Luke 9:57-62 probably occurred (comp. Matthew 8:18-22). Luke’s account is brief, agreeing more closely with that of Mark.
	 On one of the days (Luke 8:22). The indefiniteness indicates that Luke had not consulted Mark’s Gospel.
	 A boat Mark: ‘the boat.’    i.e.  ,   the one from which He had been teaching.
	 Came down (Luke 8:23). Either from the sky, or from the hill-sides, since the sudden storms would roll down the valleys and burst upon the lake.
	 They were filling,    i.e.  ,   the boat was becoming full. The original brings out the sudden coming down of the storm, and then the gradual effect, filling the boat and putting them in danger.
	 Being awakened, or ‘awaking.’ So Mark; in Matthew it is simply ‘arising.’ Luke (Luke 8:25) agrees with Mark, in putting the rebuke of the disciples AFTER the rebuke of the elements. Matthew reverses the order, but the former is probably more exact.
