The voyage across the lake, the storm, the demoniac in the country of the Gerasenes (Gergesenes). Luke is indefinite as to time (Luke 8:22), but it was the evening of the day on which the discourse in parables was delivered (Mark 4:35). The storm probably occurred at night, and the encounter with the demoniac the succeeding morning.
