Luke 8:26-39. THE HEALING OF THE FIERCE DEMONIAC. See on Matthew 8:28-34; Mark 5:1-20. The latter account is the fullest, and Lukeâ€™s agrees more closely with it Gergesenes  .   So Tischendorf reads, but the authority for Gerasenes (which is correct in Mark) is almost equally great. See on Matthew 8:28. Which is over against Galilee  .  Peculiar to Luke.
