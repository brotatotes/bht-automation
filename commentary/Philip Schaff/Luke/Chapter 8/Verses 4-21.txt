<p>CHRONOLOGY. <strong> </strong> It is evident from the parallel accounts that the incident of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:19-21">Luke 8:19-21</span> preceded the parable, etc., <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:4-18">Luke 8:4-18</span>. Some would even insert between them a number of discourses related by Luke further on (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:37">Luke 11:37</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:9">Luke 13:9</span>), but the language of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:1">Matthew 13:1</span> seems to forbid this. The order of Mark, confirmed in this case by that of Matthew, is most exact. After the journey just spoken of (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:1-3">Luke 8:1-3</span>) or during its progress, our Lord healed a demoniac, giving occasion to the Pharisees to vent their growing hostility. This incident is narrated out of its order by Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:14">Luke 11:14</span>, etc.). It was immediately followed by the demand for a sign from heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:38-45">Matthew 12:38-45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:16">Luke 11:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:29-36">Luke 11:29-36</span>), possibly by other events narrated by Luke in the same connection. About this time, while the controversy was going on, the mother and brethren of Jesus sought Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:46-50">Matthew 12:46-50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:31-35">Mark 3:31-35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:19-21">Luke 8:19-21</span>). Then came the discourse in parables (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:0">Matthew 13:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:1-25">Mark 4:1-25</span>), a part of which is here recorded (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:4-18">Luke 8:4-18</span>).
