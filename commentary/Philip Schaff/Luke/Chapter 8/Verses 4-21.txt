CHRONOLOGY.   It is evident from the parallel accounts that the incident of Luke 8:19-21 preceded the parable, etc., Luke 8:4-18. Some would even insert between them a number of discourses related by Luke further on (Luke 11:37 to Luke 13:9), but the language of Matthew 13:1 seems to forbid this. The order of Mark, confirmed in this case by that of Matthew, is most exact. After the journey just spoken of (Luke 8:1-3) or during its progress, our Lord healed a demoniac, giving occasion to the Pharisees to vent their growing hostility. This incident is narrated out of its order by Luke (Luke 11:14, etc.). It was immediately followed by the demand for a sign from heaven (Matthew 12:38-45; Luke 11:16; Luke 11:29-36), possibly by other events narrated by Luke in the same connection. About this time, while the controversy was going on, the mother and brethren of Jesus sought Him (Matthew 12:46-50; Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21). Then came the discourse in parables (Matthew 13:0; Mark 4:1-25), a part of which is here recorded (Luke 8:4-18).
