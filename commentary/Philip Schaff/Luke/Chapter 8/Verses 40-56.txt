<p>WHILE <strong> </strong> the name of the place to which our Lord returned, is not given here, the fact that the people were waiting for Him suggests Capernaum (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:1">Matthew 9:1</span>: ‘His own city’). Jairus came to our Lord while He was at a feast in the house of Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:10-18">Matthew 9:10-18</span>), who probably lived in Capernaum, and this feast (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:29-39">Luke 5:29-39</span>) took place just after the return from the other side. On the miracles, see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:18-26">Matthew 9:18-26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:21-43">Mark 5:21-43</span>. The account of Luke is more full than that of Matthew, agreeing more closely with that of Mark, but presenting some new details.</p>
