WHILE   the name of the place to which our Lord returned, is not given here, the fact that the people were waiting for Him suggests Capernaum (comp. Matthew 9:1: ‘His own city’). Jairus came to our Lord while He was at a feast in the house of Matthew (Matthew 9:10-18), who probably lived in Capernaum, and this feast (chap. Luke 5:29-39) took place just after the return from the other side. On the miracles, see Matthew 9:18-26; Mark 5:21-43. The account of Luke is more full than that of Matthew, agreeing more closely with that of Mark, but presenting some new details.
