<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:55">Luke 9:55</span>. ‘Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.’ All the words of our Lord’s rebuke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:55-56">Luke 9:55-56</span>) are omitted in the best manuscripts, but found in many early versions. Some take the clause as a question: Know ye not what manner of spirit, etc. The thought is: ‘Ye know not of what spirit you are the instruments when speaking thus; you think that you are working a miracle of faith in my service, but you are obeying a spirit alien from mine. (Godet, following Augustine and Calvin.)</p>
