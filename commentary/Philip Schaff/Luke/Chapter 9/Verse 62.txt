Luke 9:62.  No man, having put his hand to the plough, etc. The figure is easily understood, especially when we remember that the plough used in the East was easily overturned. Such labor, with divided service and longing looks backward will be profitless and doubly toilsome. Such a laborer is no fitting one. While the primary application is to the ministry, the verse has an important lesson for all. All have ground to break, and it is here rather than in the harvesting that the labor is most discouraging and whatever makes their service a divided one is forbidden. These conversations have one common lesson: conditional following of Christ is impossible. The three chief impediments here illustrated are: earthly desire, earthly sorrow, earthly affection.
