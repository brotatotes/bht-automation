<p>CHRONOLOGY. From Matthew we learn that the miracle narrated in the last section was followed immediately by others (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:27-34">Matthew 9:27-34</span>). From Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:1-6">Mark 6:1-6</span>) we infer that our Lord then visited Nazareth and was again rejected (Matthew places this out of its order; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:54-58">Matthew 13:54-58</span>). Then began the third circuit through Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:35">Matthew 9:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:6">Mark 6:6</span>), during which the Twelve were sent forth. The events in this section are in their chronological order. Luke is very brief, presenting no new details.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:1-6">Luke 9:1-6</span>. THE SENDING OUT OF THE TWELVE. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:5-15">Matthew 10:5-15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:7-13">Mark 6:7-13</span>. The latter passage agrees almost exactly with Luke’s account; Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:16-42">Matthew 10:16-42</span>) adds a part of the discourse not given by the other two.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> The twelve</strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:1">Luke 9:1</span>). This brief form agrees with Luke’s usage.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> To heal the sick </strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:2">Luke 9:2</span>). Some good authorities omit ‘the sick,’ which Luke, as a physician, might deem unnecessary.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Against them</strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:5">Luke 9:5</span>). More definite than ‘to them,’ which is found in Matthew and Mark.</p>
