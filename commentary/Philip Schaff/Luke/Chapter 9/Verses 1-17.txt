CHRONOLOGY. From Matthew we learn that the miracle narrated in the last section was followed immediately by others (Matthew 9:27-34). From Mark (Mark 6:1-6) we infer that our Lord then visited Nazareth and was again rejected (Matthew places this out of its order; Matthew 13:54-58). Then began the third circuit through Galilee (Matthew 9:35; Mark 6:6), during which the Twelve were sent forth. The events in this section are in their chronological order. Luke is very brief, presenting no new details.
	 Luke 9:1-6. THE SENDING OUT OF THE TWELVE. See on Matthew 10:5-15; Mark 6:7-13. The latter passage agrees almost exactly with Luke’s account; Matthew (Matthew 10:16-42) adds a part of the discourse not given by the other two.
	 The twelve (Luke 9:1). This brief form agrees with Luke’s usage.
	 To heal the sick  (Luke 9:2). Some good authorities omit ‘the sick,’ which Luke, as a physician, might deem unnecessary.
	 Against them (Luke 9:5). More definite than ‘to them,’ which is found in Matthew and Mark.
