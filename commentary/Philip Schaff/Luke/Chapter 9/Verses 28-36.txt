<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> About eight days</strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:28">Luke 9:28</span>). About a week = ‘after six days’ (Matthew, Mark).
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Was altered</strong> <strong><em> </em></strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:29">Luke 9:29</span>). Luke does not use the word translated, ‘transfigured,’ possibly because it would suggest to his readers the fables about the <em> metamorphoses</em> of heathen deities.

<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Spake of his decease</strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:31">Luke 9:31</span>). Peculiar to Luke. It means His <em> death</em>, although it probably includes the Resurrection and Ascension. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:2">Matthew 17:2</span>.</p>
