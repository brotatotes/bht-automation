Luke 9:37-42. THE HEALING OFTHE DEMONIAC BOY.   See on Matthew 17:14-21; Mark 9:14-29. Luke is briefest, Mark fullest.
	 For he is mine only child  (Luke 9:38). Peculiar to Luke.
	 And he suddenly crieth out  (Luke 9:39)   i.e.  ,   the child  . The rapid change of subject, first the spirit, then the child, then the spirit again, shows the intimate connection of possessed and possessing.
	 Bruising him grievously. Comp. Mark 9:26: ‘rent him sore.’
