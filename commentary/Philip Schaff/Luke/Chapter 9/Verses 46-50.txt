Luke 9:46-50. THE DISCIPLES REBUKED   for their emulation and exclusiveness. See on Matthew 18:1-5; Mark 9:33-40; especially the latter. In the briefer narrative of Luke there is nothing at variance with the other accounts.
	 Luke 9:46 declares the fact of a dispute, and Luke 9:47 assumes that it was not spoken out before our Lord, but perceived by Him and brought to judgment. Luke notes the perception of their thought; Mark, the way in which the matter was brought up by our Lord; Matthew, their submission of the question to His decision.
	 He that is not against you is for you  (Luke 9:50). This reading is to be accepted, and it presents substantially the same thought as that of the E. V. (and of Mark 9:40). The disciples (‘you’) represent Christ and His people (‘us’). On the connection of thought in Luke 9:49-50, see notes on Mark 9:38.
