Mark 1:1. THE TITLE.    The beginning of the gospel.   This is regarded by some as the title of the whole book: here begins the Gospel. But the word ‘gospel’ in the New Testament is not applied to a book. See the Matthew Book Comments: “Introduction”, “Special Introduction to the Gospels”, “§ 7. The Gospels”. Others more properly refer it to this section alone, which gives the events forming the beginning of the gospel. As a title, the verse forms a complete sentence. Some, however, connect it with Mark 1:2: The beginning, etc., as it is written. Others again, with Mark 1:4: The beginning of the gospel (was this), John did baptize, etc. Still another view puts a period at the close of this verse, but refers it to the ministry of John, taking Mark 1:2-3, as a second confirmatory title.
	 Of Jesus Christ, i.e., concerning Jesus Christ, who is the subject of the gospel.
	 The Son of God. Matthew (Matthew 1:1), writing for the Jews, says: ‘the Son of David, the Son of Abraham;’ but Mark, writing for Gentile Christians, adds the title, the meaning of which is most fully brought out in the prologue to the Gospel according to John.
