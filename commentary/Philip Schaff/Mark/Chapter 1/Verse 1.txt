<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:1">Mark 1:1</span>. THE TITLE. <em> </em> <strong> The beginning of the gospel.</strong> <em> </em> This is regarded by some as the title of the whole book: here begins the Gospel. But the word ‘gospel’ in the New Testament is not applied to a book. See the Matthew Book Comments: “Introduction”, “Special Introduction to the Gospels”, “§ 7. The Gospels”. Others more properly refer it to this section alone, which gives the events forming the beginning of the gospel. As a title, the verse forms a complete sentence. Some, however, connect it with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:2">Mark 1:2</span>: The beginning, etc., as it is written. Others again, with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:4">Mark 1:4</span>: The beginning of the gospel (was this), John did baptize, etc. Still another view puts a period at the close of this verse, but refers it to the ministry of John, taking <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:2-3">Mark 1:2-3</span>, as a second confirmatory title.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Of Jesus Christ</strong>, i.e., concerning Jesus Christ, who is the subject of the gospel.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The Son of God.</strong> Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>), writing for the Jews, says: ‘the Son of David, the Son of Abraham;’ but Mark, writing for Gentile Christians, adds the title, the meaning of which is most fully brought out in the prologue to the Gospel according to John.
