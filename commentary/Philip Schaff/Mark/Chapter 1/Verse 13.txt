Mark 1:13.  Tempted  . It is implied here, as in Luke, that the temptation continued during the forty days, although the more personal assault was made at the close of the fast.
	 Satan, the prince of darkness, was personally engaged.
	 With the wild beasts. A graphic touch peculiar to Mark, enhancing the horror of the scene. Christ was probably threatened with physical danger from the wild beasts. Scarcely a figurative expression of His loneliness and helplessness. Possibly a hint of His lordship over animals, who could not hurt or flee from Him: or an allusion to the second Adam as the restorer of Paradise.
	 Ministered  . Probably with food (comp. Matthew 4:11). The fasting, though not mentioned, is thus implied.
