Mark 1:15.  The time is fulfilled  . The right time, already predicted, has come in fulfilment of prophecy.
	 The kingdom of God is at hand.   Matthew: ‘the kingdom of heaven.’ The reign of the Messiah, which is the kingdom of God, has approached. Comp. Matthew 3:2.
	 Repent. Comp, the preaching of John the Baptist; Matthew 3:2.
	 Believe in the gospel  . Peculiar to Mark. The message of John the Baptist did not include this. As yet our Lord does not preach faith in Himself; that must come later. Yet even here is the germ of faith in a Personal Redeemer. The Jews all hoped for the kingdom of God. Jesus proclaims it, but adds something they do not seem to have expected: repentance and faith in order to enter it.
