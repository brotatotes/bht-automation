<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:24">Mark 1:24</span>. <strong><em> </em></strong> <strong> What have we to do with thee.</strong> <em> Lit., </em> ‘what to us and to thee,’ what have we in common; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span>.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> To destroy us.</strong> The language of the demon, overbearing the consciousness of the man. The plural indicates, either the presence of more than one evil spirit, or that this one speaks as the representative of the class. The destruction referred to includes banishment to torment (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span>), and also the destruction of the empire of Satan in the world, signified and begun in such expulsions as these.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> I know thee.</strong> Already conscious of His influence, the evil spirit with supernatural sagacity recognizes Him as the Messiah.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> The Holy One of God.</strong> An acknowledgment of His Messiahship, but not necessarily of His Divinity. The ‘unclean spirit’ describes our Lord as the ‘Holy One,’ because this holiness torments him already, and marks Jesus as One sent by God to destroy Satan’s empire.
