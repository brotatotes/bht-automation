Mark 1:27.    They questioned among themselves.   Only a miracle could produce this effect. The people began to think and argue for themselves, not to ask the scribes.
	 What is this? a new teaching! This is the rendering of the more lively report of Mark. They rightly inferred, that such new and unexampled power was to attest a new revelation from God. Mark and Luke mention this miracle first, without saying that it was actually the  first. That in Cana of Galilee (John 2:1-11), was the first, since this is expressly stated. The second is recorded in John 4:46-54. Matthew (Matthew 4:24) speaks of many miracles, but describes first the healing of a leper (chap. Mark 8:2-4), in accordance with the purpose of his Gospel. Mark gives special prominence to Christâ€™s power over demons.
