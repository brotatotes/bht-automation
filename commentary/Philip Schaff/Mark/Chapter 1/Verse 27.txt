<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> What is this? a new teaching!</strong> This is the rendering of the more lively report of Mark. They rightly inferred, that such new and unexampled power was to attest a new revelation from God. Mark and Luke mention this miracle first, without saying that it was actually the <em> first.</em> That in Cana of Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:1-11">John 2:1-11</span>), was the first, since this is expressly stated. The second is recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:46-54">John 4:46-54</span>. Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>) speaks of many miracles, but describes first the healing of a leper (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:2-4">Mark 8:2-4</span>), in accordance with the purpose of his Gospel. Mark gives special prominence to Christâ€™s power over demons.
