<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:34">Mark 1:34</span>. <strong> And he healed many,</strong> etc. This does not imply that some were not healed, either because there was not time, or because they lacked faith; both Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:16">Matthew 8:16</span>) and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:40">Luke 4:40</span>) say that all were healed.

See <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:25">Mark 1:25</span>; comp. the more particular account of Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:41">Luke 4:41</span>). Our Lord could be Himself the witness to His claims (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:14-18">John 8:14-18</span>); practically no man ever believes in Christ without first believing Christ Himself independently of other witnesses. Besides these were unworthy witnesses; it was not the right time for the truth they stated. But Satan and Satanâ€™s emissaries can speak the truth when it will serve an evil end.
