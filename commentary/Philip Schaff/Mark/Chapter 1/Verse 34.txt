Mark 1:34.  And he healed many, etc. This does not imply that some were not healed, either because there was not time, or because they lacked faith; both Matthew (Matthew 8:16) and Luke (Luke 4:40) say that all were healed.
	 Suffered not the demons to speak. This was usual. See Mark 1:25; comp. the more particular account of Luke (Luke 4:41). Our Lord could be Himself the witness to His claims (comp. John 8:14-18); practically no man ever believes in Christ without first believing Christ Himself independently of other witnesses. Besides these were unworthy witnesses; it was not the right time for the truth they stated. But Satan and Satanâ€™s emissaries can speak the truth when it will serve an evil end.
