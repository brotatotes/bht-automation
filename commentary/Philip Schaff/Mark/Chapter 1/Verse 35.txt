<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:35">Mark 1:35</span>. <strong> A great while before day,</strong> or, ‘while it was still night’ Luke: ‘when it was day,’ or literally, ‘it becoming day.’ Both refer to the same point of time, the earliest dawn. Between this and the parallel passage in Luke there is a great difference in words, though none in matter. A proof of the independence of Mark, since Matthew does not give these details.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Into a desert place</strong> <em> .</em> Just as in Luke. ‘Solitary place’ really expresses the uninhabited character of the region referred to, but the word is usually rendered ‘desert’ Evidently near Capernaum.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And there prayed.</strong> Our Lord’s example enjoins secret prayer. His work and prayer are closely connected. The punctilious observance of the Sabbath in Capernaum gave the people their rest, and yet must have abridged our Lord’s repose. Prayer with Him seems to have been not only intimate communion with His Father, but a necessary preparation for His ministry. How much more needful for us!
