<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:4">Mark 1:4</span>. <strong> John appeared</strong> <strong><em> .</em></strong> The connection is with what precedes, as is indicated by the emphatic position of the word we translate ‘appeared,’ usually rendered: came to pass. ‘As it was written,’ so it was, so there appeared, or came, the one spoken of, John. The common version obscures the emphatic word.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> He who baptised and preached</strong> <em> .</em> The correct reading makes this not so much a declaration of what John did, as an explanation of how he performed the duty of forerunner, according to the prophecy. On the Baptist’s preaching and baptism, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:1">Matthew 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:6">Matthew 3:6</span>. Contrast the abrupt introduction of John by Matthew and Mark with the full account of Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:5-80">Luke 1:5-80</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The baptism of repentance.</strong> ‘The baptism’ is too definite; John did not institute some new rite, but his baptism was a ceremonial washing, such as was well-known, to signify repentance and forgiveness: <strong> unto remission of sins</strong>. ‘Repentance’ was the prominent idea of John’s baptism, while ‘remission of sins’ was to come from the Messiah, whose forerunner he was.
