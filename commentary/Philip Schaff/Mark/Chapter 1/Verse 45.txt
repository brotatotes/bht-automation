Some think our Lord, after touching the leper, was unclean according to the Jewish law, and hence remained ‘in desert places.’ But He would not have acted from this motive unless He acknowledged the uncleanness, and such an acknowledgment could not be affected by the leper’s report, which is said to be the cause of His keeping away from the cities. Nor would the multitudes have come thus to an unclean person. The retirement was rather from motives of prudence, to avoid exciting the multitudes with their carnal expectations and prematurely increasing the hostility already awakened at Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:1">John 4:1</span>) and beginning to show itself in Galilee. See next section. This hostility must be regarded as much greater, if we accept the view that the events recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:0">John 5:0</span> had occurred before the Galilean ministry. </p>
