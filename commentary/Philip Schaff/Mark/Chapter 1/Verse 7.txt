<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:7">Mark 1:7</span>. <strong> There cometh he that is</strong> <em> ,</em> etc. The English version does not give the definite idea of the original. The denunciation and warning recorded by Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7-12">Matthew 3:7-12</span>) and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:7-14">Luke 3:7-14</span>) are omitted by Mark, who merely gives the sum of Johnâ€™s preaching as a forerunner of the Messiah.

<p><strong> To stoop down</strong>, etc. Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>) speaks of bearing the shoes, Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:16">Luke 3:16</span>) and John (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:27">John 1:27</span>) of unloosing them, but Mark only of stooping down. It is his peculiarity to mention gestures. The perfect independence of the Evangelists thus appears. Nothing could more vividly depict to an eastern audience the inferiority of John the Baptist to the Messiah, than these words.
