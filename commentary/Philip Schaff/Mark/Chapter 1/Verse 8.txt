<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:8">Mark 1:8</span>. <strong> With the Holy Ghost.</strong> In Matthew’s account the word ‘in’ is used, but not here: On the day of Pentecost, when the great fulfilment of this prophecy occurred (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:3">Acts 2:3</span>), the Apostles were baptized ‘with,’ not ‘in’ the Holy Ghost ‘With fire’ is omitted here, because the Evangelist has not mentioned the severity of John’s preaching.
