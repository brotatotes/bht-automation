Mark 1:8.  With the Holy Ghost. In Matthew’s account the word ‘in’ is used, but not here: On the day of Pentecost, when the great fulfilment of this prophecy occurred (Acts 2:3), the Apostles were baptized ‘with,’ not ‘in’ the Holy Ghost ‘With fire’ is omitted here, because the Evangelist has not mentioned the severity of John’s preaching.
