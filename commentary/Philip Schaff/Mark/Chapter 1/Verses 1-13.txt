<p>The Evangelist, intending to narrate our Lord’s ministry without dwelling upon the earlier part of His life, prefaces the whole with a <em> title</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:1">Mark 1:1</span>), which is followed by a reference to the preaching of John the Baptist (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:2-8">Mark 1:2-8</span>). This was necessary, since, in one sense, John’s appearance was ‘the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.’ A brief narration of the baptism of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:10-11">Mark 1:10-11</span>) and of the temptation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:12-13">Mark 1:12-13</span>) completes Mark’s account of the preliminary events.
