The Evangelist, intending to narrate our Lord’s ministry without dwelling upon the earlier part of His life, prefaces the whole with a  title (Mark 1:1), which is followed by a reference to the preaching of John the Baptist (Mark 1:2-8). This was necessary, since, in one sense, John’s appearance was ‘the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.’ A brief narration of the baptism of Jesus (Mark 1:10-11) and of the temptation (Mark 1:12-13) completes Mark’s account of the preliminary events.
