CHRONOLOGY. This Gospel presents the fewest deviations from the chronological order. In the whole narrative of the ministry in Galilee, we find but one such: in the case of the feast at Leviâ€™s house; chap. Mark 2:15-22. On the occurrences between the temptation and the appear once in Galilee, see Introduction, pp. 17 , 18 , and on Matthew 4:12-25; John 1:19 to John 4:42. All harmonists agree in placing the events recorded in this section in both chronological and immediate succession. Attention to this fact aids greatly in understanding the proper order of events as recorded by Matthew. The transfer of His residence from Nazareth to Capernaum took place before the calling of the first disciples (Mark 1:16-20); see Matthew 4:13; Luke 4:16-30.
