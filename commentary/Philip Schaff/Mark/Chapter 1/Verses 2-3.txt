<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:2-3">Mark 1:2-3</span>. <strong> In Isaiah the prophet.</strong> The common reading (‘prophets’) arose from the fact that only the second prophecy (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:3">Mark 1:3</span>) is from Isaiah; the first is from Malachi (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:1">Mark 3:1</span>). Isaiah is named, because his prediction is the more important and striking, and the key note of Malachi’s prophecy. Matthew and Luke quote the latter in a different connection (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:10">Matthew 11:10</span>, see the notes there for an explanation of the prophecy; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:27">Luke 7:27</span>). On <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:3">Mark 1:3</span>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:3">Matthew 3:3</span>.
