Mark 1:2-3.  In Isaiah the prophet. The common reading (‘prophets’) arose from the fact that only the second prophecy (Mark 1:3) is from Isaiah; the first is from Malachi (Mark 3:1). Isaiah is named, because his prediction is the more important and striking, and the key note of Malachi’s prophecy. Matthew and Luke quote the latter in a different connection (Matthew 11:10, see the notes there for an explanation of the prophecy; Luke 7:27). On Mark 1:3, see Matthew 3:3.
