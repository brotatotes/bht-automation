Mark 1:29-34. This miracle and those in the evening following are mentioned by Matthew (Matthew 8:14-17) and Luke (Luke 4:38-41). The order of the latter agrees with that of Mark, and the time is definitely indicated. The deviations from the correct order made by Matthew can easily be explained (see on Matthew 8:1-17).
