<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:29-34">Mark 1:29-34</span>. This miracle and those in the evening following are mentioned by Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:14-17">Matthew 8:14-17</span>) and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:38-41">Luke 4:38-41</span>). The order of the latter agrees with that of Mark, and the time is definitely indicated. The deviations from the correct order made by Matthew can easily be explained (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:1-17">Matthew 8:1-17</span>).
