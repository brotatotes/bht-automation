<p>The journey through Galilee here spoken of (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:35-39">Mark 1:35-39</span>) is the first one recorded in the Gospels and is identical with that mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:42-44">Luke 4:42-44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23-25">Matthew 4:23-25</span>. Mark and Luke, however, are more definite than Matthew; the passage just cited from the latter may be a more general description of our Lord’s ministry in Galilee. The miracle here given in detail by Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:40-45">Mark 1:40-45</span>) is in its proper chronological position. Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:2-4">Matthew 8:2-4</span>) deviates for a purpose. The emendations suggested in this section conform to the better established Greek text and bring out more fully the lively character of Mark’s style.
