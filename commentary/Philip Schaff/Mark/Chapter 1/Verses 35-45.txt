The journey through Galilee here spoken of (Mark 1:35-39) is the first one recorded in the Gospels and is identical with that mentioned in Luke 4:42-44; Matthew 4:23-25. Mark and Luke, however, are more definite than Matthew; the passage just cited from the latter may be a more general description of our Lord’s ministry in Galilee. The miracle here given in detail by Mark (Mark 1:40-45) is in its proper chronological position. Matthew (Matthew 8:2-4) deviates for a purpose. The emendations suggested in this section conform to the better established Greek text and bring out more fully the lively character of Mark’s style.
