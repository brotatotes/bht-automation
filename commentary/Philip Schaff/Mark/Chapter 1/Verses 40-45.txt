Mark 1:40-45. See on Matthew 8:2-4. Markâ€™s account is fuller, showing independence, and confirming the view that Matthew has deviated from the chronological order. From Luke 5:12-14 we conclude that the miracle occurred at some other place than Capernaum, although Mark 2:1 suggests that it was not far from that city.
