Mark 10:10.  And in the house.  An accurate detail peculiar to Mark. The fuller private teaching was needed, for these disciples were to teach the world new lessons on the subject of marriage and divorce, and thus elevate women. Sadly enough, women who have been elevated by these teachings are seeking to overthrow their authority, thus unwittingly laboring for the renewed degradation of their sex.
