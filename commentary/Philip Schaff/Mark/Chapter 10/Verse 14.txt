<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:14">Mark 10:14</span>. <strong> Much displeased</strong>, <em> i.e.,</em> at the rebuke of the disciples. Peculiar to Mark. Some sign of displeasure was probably on His countenance. How careful we should be not to call forth His displeasure, by keeping children from Him, be cause we are speculating on high themes about marriage and divorce.
