<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:15">Mark 10:15</span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:3">Matthew 18:3</span>. The connection here is remarkable. Not only may infants be brought to Christ, but adults, in order to enter the kingdom, to come to Him, must become <em> like</em> them. Only as a little child can any one enter the kingdom. It is fairly implied that children in years can be Christians, recognized as such by their parents’ act and the Master’s act through His ministers, trained as such by parents and pastors, and a promise that His grace will not fail, where our faith does not fail.
