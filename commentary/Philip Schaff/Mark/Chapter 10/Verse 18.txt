Mark 10:18.  Why callest thou    me good? Matthew (the correct reading): ‘Why askest thou me of that which is good?’ In applying the term ‘good’ to our Lord, the young ruler was honest, but mistaken. He used it without fully apprehending its meaning. On the connection of this answer with the one ‘good thing,’ see Matthew 19:17.  Either ‘there is none good, but God: Christ is good; therefore Christ is God’  or, ‘there is none good, but God: Christ is not God: therefore Christ is NOT GOOD’   (Stier). Since but one is good, God, then giving up all for Him is the last test, and following Christ (Mark 10:21) is doing that.
