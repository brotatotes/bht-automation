Mark 10:21.  And    Jesus looking upon him loved him.  A touching particular peculiar to Mark. The young man made no immediate response to this love. How then could Jesus have loved him in his self-righteousness and worldliness? The phrase ‘looking upon him,’ indicates that the love was called forth by the loveliness of the young ruler. Despite all his mistakes, there was in him something lovely. To this loveliness there was a response in the heart of Him who shared our humanity so entirely. It may have been a part of the sorrows of His earthly life, that such affection met no proper spiritual response. This view neither diminishes the  power of our Saviour’s affection, nor assumes, what is nowhere hinted, that the young man was at heart right.
	 One  thing thou lackest.  The ruler himself had asked such a question (Matthew).
