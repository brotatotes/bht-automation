Mark 10:24.  Were amazed. The word is a strong one. Mark introduces this astonishment of the disciples earlier than Matthew, and adds the Lord’s explanation:  Children (a term of affection to tranquillize them),  how hard it is for them that trust in riches, etc. That this trust is almost inseparable from the possession of riches, is implied by the connection with Mark 10:25 (on which see Matthew 19:24). Some ancient authorities omit: ‘for them that trust in riches,’ thus making the statement more general.
