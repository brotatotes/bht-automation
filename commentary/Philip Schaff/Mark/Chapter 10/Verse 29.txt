Mark 10:29.  And the gospel’s sake. A similar addition occurs in chap. Mark 8:38. Mark perhaps inserts this in both places, in consequence of his own shrinking from suffering on account of the Gospel (Acts 13:13; Acts 15:38); so also, ‘with persecution’ (Mark 10:30). He would guard others against his own mistake.
