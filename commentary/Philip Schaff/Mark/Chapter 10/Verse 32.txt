<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Going up to Jerusalem;</strong> continuing the journey already begun.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Jesus was going before them</strong> <em> ,</em> leading the way. Probably implying some remarkable energy in His gait, some determination or eagerness in His manner.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And they were amazed</strong>. At His eagerness. By this time they knew that great danger awaited Him at Jerusalem.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And they that followed him were afraid</strong>. Of this known danger to Himself, which they may have thought threatened themselves also. This graphic description is peculiar to Mark. The better supported reading is followed here, which distinguishes between those who were ‘amazed,’ and those who were ‘afraid.’ Explanations: ( 1 .) The whole body were amazed, so much so, that only some continued to follow, and these were afraid. But multitudes attended Him all the way. Besides, according to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:34">Luke 18:34</span>, even the revelation to the Twelve was not understood by them, how then should His manner of walking frighten away most of the crowd? ( 2 .) The better view is: The Twelve nearest to Him were amazed, and the larger company of followers were afraid, though further away from Him.

This was a fuller and more detailed revelation of the <em> time</em> and the <em> mode</em> of His sufferings and of the <em> agents</em> who should be engaged therein.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> That were to happen</strong> <em> ,</em> not ‘that should.’ Certainty and nearness are implied.
