<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Kill him.</strong> Matthew: ‘crucify Him,’ which is implied here, as the ‘Gentiles,’ to whom the whole verse refers, were to put Him to death. The Twelve failed to understand this detailed prediction (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:34">Luke 18:34</span>). That danger threatened they felt, but they may have given this prediction <em> figurative</em> interpretation.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> After three days.</strong> This form is given by Mark in all three predictions (chaps. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:31">Mark 8:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:31">Mark 9:31</span>, and here).
