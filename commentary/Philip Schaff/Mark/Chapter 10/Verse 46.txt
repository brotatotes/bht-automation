Mark 10:46.  And they come to Jericho. Mark specifies this, and this shows that our Lord entered the city  before the blind man was healed, so that Luke’s account (chap. Luke 18:35) must refer to a  second entrance. On the location of Jericho, and the date of this miracle, see Matthew 20:29.
	 As he went out from Jericho. Probably on some excursion, from which He returned to meet Zaccheus (Luke 19:1-27), after which He began the journey to the neighborhood of Bethany.
	 The son of Timeus, Bartimeus. Some think the father was well known, but the order in the original suggests that the son was the well-known personage. ‘Bar’ = son, as Mark seems to explain.
	 A blind beggar. He was probably begging as he sat, as the E. V. states, but the original does not necessarily mean this. Why Matthew (Matthew 20:30-34) mentions  two blind men, and Mark and Luke but  one, has been variously explained; but it is altogether unnecessary to find a contradiction in the accounts. The prominence of this  one is evident from the narrative before us, which is in many respects the most exact and vivid of the three.
