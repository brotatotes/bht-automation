<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:46">Mark 10:46</span>. <strong> And they come to Jericho</strong>. Mark specifies this, and this shows that our Lord entered the city <em> before</em> the blind man was healed, so that Luke’s account (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:35">Luke 18:35</span>) must refer to a <em> second</em> entrance. On the location of Jericho, and the date of this miracle, see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:29">Matthew 20:29</span>.

<p><strong> As he went out from Jericho.</strong> Probably on some excursion, from which He returned to meet Zaccheus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:1-27">Luke 19:1-27</span>), after which He began the journey to the neighborhood of Bethany.

<p><strong> The son of Timeus, Bartimeus.</strong> Some think the father was well known, but the order in the original suggests that the son was the well-known personage. ‘Bar’ = son, as Mark seems to explain.
	</p>
<p><strong> A blind beggar.</strong> He was probably begging as he sat, as the E. V. states, but the original does not necessarily mean this. Why Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:30-34">Matthew 20:30-34</span>) mentions <em> two</em> blind men, and Mark and Luke but <em> one</em>, has been variously explained; but it is altogether unnecessary to find a contradiction in the accounts. The prominence of this <em> one</em> is evident from the narrative before us, which is in many respects the most exact and vivid of the three.
