<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:49">Mark 10:49</span>. <strong> Call ye him</strong>. Peculiar in this form to Mark, and omitted altogether by Matthew. This was a ‘reproof to the reprovers.’ It seems to have had an effect, for the words now addressed to the blind man are full of sympathy: <strong> Be of good cheer</strong>, rise, he calleth thee. The order is that of <em> kindness, faith</em> would put: ‘He calleth thee’ first. The forbidding and the cheering address represent the priestly spirit which would keep men from applying directly to Christ, and the true spirit of the Gospel messengers.
