<p>The <strong> </strong> position of this section is the same in all three Gospels. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:17">Mark 10:17</span> shows that our Lord had already started on His journey to death. This gives the greater emphasis to His demand for self-denial from the rich young man. The connection with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:15">Mark 10:15</span> is also significant: the love of riches is the very opposite of receiving ‘the kingdom of God, as a little child.’
