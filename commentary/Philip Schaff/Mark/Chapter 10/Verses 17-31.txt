The   position of this section is the same in all three Gospels. Mark 10:17 shows that our Lord had already started on His journey to death. This gives the greater emphasis to His demand for self-denial from the rich young man. The connection with Mark 10:15 is also significant: the love of riches is the very opposite of receiving ‘the kingdom of God, as a little child.’
