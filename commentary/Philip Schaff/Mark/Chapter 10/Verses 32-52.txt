<p>See <em> </em> notes on the parallel passage in Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:17-34">Matthew 20:17-34</span>). These events took place on the final journey to Jerusalem, from Perea through Jericho. The raising of Lazarus is, however, placed by some between the departure from Perea and this final journey.
