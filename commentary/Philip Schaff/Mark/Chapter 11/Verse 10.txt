Mark 11:10.  Blessed is the kingdom of our father David, that cometh! or, ‘the coming kingdom of our father David!’ This form of the Hosannas is preserved by Mark alone. It brings out most clearly the recognition of our Lord as the royal Messiah, who was to restore the throne of David. It is asserted that the Messiah Himself was called ’David’ by the Rabbis. What strange mingling of truth and error in the thoughts and hopes of the multitude that day! And the error was the more fatal, because combined with the truth. See further, on Matthew 21:10-11; Luke 19:37-44.
