<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:12">Mark 11:12</span>. <strong> And they sought to lay hands on him. </strong> The three accounts supplement each other here. The purpose to seize Him is plainly stated in all. Mark shows that it was a continued effort (literally ‘they were seeking’ ); while Luke tells that they would have done so on the spot, had they not been afraid of the people.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> For they perceived, </strong> etc. Matthew gives the more general reason for this fear: ‘because they held Him as a prophet.’ Their desire to seize Him was increased by this parable, but their fear of the people was also increased, since they ( <em> i.e.,</em> the rulers) perceived <strong> that he spake the parable against them,</strong> and in the presence of the people (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:9">Luke 20:9</span>), so that they felt themselves convicted before the people. Conscience made them cowards. On the interpretation, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:33-46">Matthew 21:33-46</span>.
