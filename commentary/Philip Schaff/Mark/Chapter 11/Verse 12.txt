Mark 11:12.  And they sought to lay hands on him.  The three accounts supplement each other here. The purpose to seize Him is plainly stated in all. Mark shows that it was a continued effort (literally ‘they were seeking’ ); while Luke tells that they would have done so on the spot, had they not been afraid of the people.
	 For they perceived,  etc. Matthew gives the more general reason for this fear: ‘because they held Him as a prophet.’ Their desire to seize Him was increased by this parable, but their fear of the people was also increased, since they (  i.e., the rulers) perceived  that he spake the parable against them, and in the presence of the people (Luke 20:9), so that they felt themselves convicted before the people. Conscience made them cowards. On the interpretation, see on Matthew 21:33-46.
