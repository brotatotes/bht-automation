Mark 11:13. Afar off, or, ‘from afar.’ Mark presents the appearance of the tree in the distance: having leaves.
	 If haply. Because it had leaves. This scarcely implies doubt in  His mind, since the design was to teach the Apostles a very important lesson.
	 For it was not the season of figs. The full season had not come, yet the leaves gave promise of fruit. The failure was then in the  barrenness of the tree, a fit symbol of the pretentious hypocrisy of the Jewish hierarchy. See on Matthew 21:19.
