<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Calling to remembrance.</strong> Peter himself probably informed Mark of the circumstance. This minute detail, implying an interval, confirms the view that Mark gives the more exact account

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Which thou cursedst.</strong> The language of Peter; yet our Lord’s act was a curse, <em> i.e.,</em> a judicial word and act of condemnation (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:19">Matthew 21:19</span>). That it was judicial and just, not passionate and wanton, is evident not only from the character of our Lord, but from the lessons He connects with it Mark, who inserts Peter’s language, which might be misunderstood, alone tells us about forgiving (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:25">Mark 11:25</span>).
