Mark 11:25.  When ye stand praying. A common and proper posture in prayer (comp. Luke 18:13).
	 Forgive if ye have ought against any one. See on Matthew 5:23, where the converse is presented: ‘thy brother hath aught against thee,’ and Matthew 6:14, etc. That such sayings should be repeated almost word for word, is not at all strange. A forgiving temper is necessary for them in working miracles, as well as faith and believing prayer; their faith and the power it wields should never be used in the service of hate. A caution against passing judicial condemnation on the evil and unfruitful, as He had just done, even though their faith should be strong enough, to effect like results (Matthew 21:21; ‘ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree,’ etc.). The best authorities omit Mark 11:26.
