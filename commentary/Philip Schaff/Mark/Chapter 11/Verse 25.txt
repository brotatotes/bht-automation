<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:25">Mark 11:25</span>. <strong> When ye stand praying</strong>. A common and proper posture in prayer (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:13">Luke 18:13</span>).
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Forgive if ye have ought against any one</strong>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:23">Matthew 5:23</span>, where the converse is presented: ‘thy brother hath aught against thee,’ and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:14">Matthew 6:14</span>, etc. That such sayings should be repeated almost word for word, is not at all strange. A forgiving temper is necessary for them in working miracles, as well as faith and believing prayer; their faith and the power it wields should never be used in the service of hate. A caution against passing judicial condemnation on the evil and unfruitful, as He had just done, even though their faith should be strong enough, to effect like results (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:21">Matthew 21:21</span>; ‘ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree,’ etc.). The best authorities omit <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:26">Mark 11:26</span>.
