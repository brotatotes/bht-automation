<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Walking in the temple.</strong> ‘As if at home, or in His Father’s house’ (J. A. Alexander); possibly to see if the profanation had been renewed, but according to Matthew: ‘as He was teaching’ (so Luke); so that He seems to have taught as He walked, which was not at all singular. All three classes of the Sanhedrim are mentioned here.
