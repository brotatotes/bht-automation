<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:3">Mark 11:3</span>. <strong> And straightway he will send</strong>, literally, ‘sendeth,’ <strong> him again hither</strong>. In Matthew the clause corresponding to this is probably a declaration of what the owner, or those objecting would do. Here the word ‘again’ (found in the best authorities) compels us to take it as part of the message, a promise to return the colt soon.
