<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:31-32">Mark 11:31-32</span>. Matthew carries out the reasoning of the rulers; but Mark puts the second part of their pondering in the form of a question: <strong> Shall we say, From men?</strong> then abruptly answers in His own words (not theirs): <strong> they feared the people; for all held John to be a prophet indeed.</strong> Luke tells that the fear of being stoned entered into the thoughts of the rulers.
