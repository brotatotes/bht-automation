Mark 11:31-32. Matthew carries out the reasoning of the rulers; but Mark puts the second part of their pondering in the form of a question:  Shall we say, From men? then abruptly answers in His own words (not theirs):  they feared the people; for all held John to be a prophet indeed. Luke tells that the fear of being stoned entered into the thoughts of the rulers.
