<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:34">Mark 12:34</span>. <strong> Discreetly.</strong> Understandingly, intelligently, wisely; more than ‘discreetly,’ in the more modem sense.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Thou art not far from the kingdom of God</strong>. Intellectually on the right road, nearer to the kingdom than a mere formalist could be, recognizing the spirituality of the law, perhaps conscious of the folly of self-righteousness; but, though standing as it were at the door, still outside. Alexander. While the worst of His opponents were unable to convict Him of an error, or betray Him into a mistake, the best of them, when brought into direct communication with Him on the most important subjects, found themselves almost in the position of His own disciples.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And no man any more durst ask him any question.</strong> A natural effect of the previous experiments. No further question is put to Him, but He asks one which they cannot answer. Matthew however, gives more prominence to the fact that no one ‘was able to answer Him a word,’ and so puts this statement after the victorious question of our Lord. Such independent testimony is the most valuable, especially here where our Lord asks a question respecting <em> His own Person</em>, in some respects the central question of Christianity.
