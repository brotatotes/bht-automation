<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:37">Mark 12:37</span>. <strong> And whence</strong>. From what source shall we seek an explanation of the fact that He is his Son. Or perhaps simply: ‘how can He be his Son.’

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And the great multitude.</strong> This multitude was made up of ‘the common people,’ since the upper classes were withdrawing, but that is not the prominent idea. A great multitude still listened to Him.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Heard him gladly.</strong> Lit, sweetly, with relish, with pleasure. This was after He had virtually claimed to be the Messiah: David’s Lord, as well as David’s Son. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:45">Matthew 22:45</span>. Had He desired to establish a temporal kingdom, the multitude would now have followed Him. But hearing Christ with relish, is not necessarily accepting Him as a Saviour. Knowing all men (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:24-25">John 2:24-25</span>), and faithful to His mission of Atoning Love, our Lord remains in the temple to deliver His fearful denunciation of the Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:0">Matthew 23:0</span>), briefly alluded to by Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:38-40">Mark 12:38-40</span>), pauses to praise a poor widow (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:41-44">Mark 12:41-44</span>), and then withdraws from His foes and from the listening multitude, to give in private some of His most remarkable predictions.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> THE accounts of Mark and Luke agree here very closely. The denunciatory discourse of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:0">Matthew 23:0</span>, is given in this abridged form, the other incident is omitted by Matthew. We join them together because they form a striking contrast. Comp. ‘devour widows’ houses’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:41">Mark 12:41</span>) and the ‘poor widow’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:42">Mark 12:42</span>). Both expressions are peculiar to Mark and Luke (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:14">Matthew 23:14</span>). Even after such fearful denunciations, our Lord quietly sits in the court of the women (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:41">Mark 12:41</span>).
