<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:42">Mark 12:42</span>. <strong> And one poor widow.</strong> ‘One’ in contrast with the ‘many’ just spoken of, not without a suggestion of her loneliness. Possibly this widow was ‘poor,’ because her house had been ‘devoured’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:40">Mark 12:40</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Two</strong> <strong> mites.</strong> The ‘mite’ (lepton) was the smallest Jewish copper coin. The Greek name means ‘fish-scale,’ suggesting its diminutive size. Its value was about one tenth of an English penny, one fifth of a cent. She had two and gave both.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> A farthing</strong>. Mark (not Luke) adds for his Roman readers an explanation, using a Greek word (taken from the Latin) meaning the fourth part, as our word ‘farthing’ does.
