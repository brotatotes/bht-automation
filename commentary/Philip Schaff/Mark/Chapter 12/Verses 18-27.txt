Mark 12:18-27. SECOND ASSAULT.   The question concerning the resurrection. See on Matthew 22:23-33; comp. Luke 20:27-40. The latter Evangelist is fuller, especially in Mark 12:34-36. The description of the successive marriages is graphic, though not more so than Luke’s. The most prominent peculiarity is the question: Do ye not err for this cause, etc., (Mark 12:24), which is answered by the positive statement: ye greatly err (Mark 12:27). The effect of our Lord’s words, which is added at this point by Matthew and Luke, is narrated by Mark in Mark 12:34.
	 In the book of Moses, at the Bush,  i.e., in the chapter or passage where the well-known ‘bush’ is spoken of. It can scarcely mean, when Moses was at the bush, or when God spake at the bush. The article before ‘God’ is omitted in the Greek, except in the phrase:    the God of Abraham. The argument derived from this designation of God in favor of the immortality of the soul, against the Sadducees who denied it, reveals the marvelous insight of our Lord into the deepest meaning of the Scriptures. The personal everliving God calls Himself the God not of the dead which would be dishonoring but of those who live in perpetual communion with Him, to whom He has communicated His own immortality.
