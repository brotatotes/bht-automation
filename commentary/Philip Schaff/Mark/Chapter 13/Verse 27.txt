<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:27">Mark 13:27</span>. <strong> From the uttermost part of the earth,</strong> etc. Probably an allusion to the apparent junction of earth and sky at the visible horizon, but in any case it refers to the whole world. Matthew gives a different form, and inserts ‘with a trumpet of great sound.’
