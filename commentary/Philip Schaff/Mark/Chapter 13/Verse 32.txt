Mark 13:32.  Neither the Son. Here distinguished from ‘angels,’ as above them, since there is a climax, ‘angels,’ ‘the Son,’ ‘the Father.’ The verse is to be taken in its plain sense (see on Matthew 24:36) as part of the mystery of Christ’s humiliation, a self-limitation, a self-emptying of the God-man.
