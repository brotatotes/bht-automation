Mark 13:34.    It is as when a man.  The whole matter of watchfulness is as in the following parable.
	 Away from his country, sojourning in a foreign land.
	 Having left his house and given authority  (i.e., the delegated power necessary for their duty)  to his servants, to each one his work (the authority being joined with duty),  commanded also the porter (as it were at the door, just as he went away)  to watch. This injunction is the main point of the parable.
