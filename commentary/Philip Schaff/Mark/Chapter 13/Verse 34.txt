<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:34">Mark 13:34</span>. <em> </em> <strong> It is as when a man. </strong> The whole matter of watchfulness is as in the following parable.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Away from his country</strong>, sojourning in a foreign land.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Having left his house and given authority </strong> (i.e., the delegated power necessary for their duty) <strong> to his servants, to each one his work</strong> (the authority being joined with duty), <strong> commanded also the porter</strong> (as it were at the door, just as he went away) <strong> to watch</strong>. This injunction is the main point of the parable.
