<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:37">Mark 13:37</span>. <strong> I say unto all, watch</strong>. Though the Apostles and the ministry are watchmen and porters, yet all believers are to be incessantly watchful and for the same reasons. The time of our Lordâ€™s coming, whether at our death or in His personal appearing, is uncertain; therefore we should always be ready. Faithfulness to Him bids us not only work but watch. Matthew (chap. 25 ) gives an account of the parables which followed, but the most important part of the discourse is doubtless what is contained in all three narratives, namely, the coming of the Lord and our duty to be watchful.
