Mark 13:9.  In the synagogues. The punctuation is doubtful. The literal meaning is: ‘into synagogues.’ This may be explained ‘ye shall be taken into synagogues and beaten; ‘the synagogue being the place where such punishments were inflicted for greater publicity. Others join this with what precedes; ‘to councils and to synagogues; ye shall be beaten,’ etc. (Comp. Matthew 10:17-18.)
