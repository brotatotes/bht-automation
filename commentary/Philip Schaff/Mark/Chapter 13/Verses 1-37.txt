THIS discourse is recorded by three Evangelists (Matthew, Mark, and Luke). All the accounts correspond remarkably; that of Matthew is the fullest. See on Matthew 24:0. Mark introduces a few thoughts not included there. The  occasion and  circumstances of delivery (Mark 13:1-4) are described most fully by Mark. In Mark 13:5-23 we find a reference to both the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the world, the judgment upon the Jewish nation being the prominent thought; in Mark 13:24-31 the Lordâ€™s second coming is more prominent, and in Mark 13:32-37 it alone referred to.
