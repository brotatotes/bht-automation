<p>THIS discourse is recorded by three Evangelists (Matthew, Mark, and Luke). All the accounts correspond remarkably; that of Matthew is the fullest. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:0">Matthew 24:0</span>. Mark introduces a few thoughts not included there. The <em> occasion</em> and <em> circumstances</em> of delivery (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:1-4">Mark 13:1-4</span>) are described most fully by Mark. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:5-23">Mark 13:5-23</span> we find a reference to both the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the world, the judgment upon the Jewish nation being the prominent thought; in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:24-31">Mark 13:24-31</span> the Lordâ€™s second coming is more prominent, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:32-37">Mark 13:32-37</span> it alone referred to.
