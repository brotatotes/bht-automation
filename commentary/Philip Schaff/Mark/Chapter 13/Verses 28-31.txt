<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:28-31">Mark 13:28-31</span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:32-35">Matthew 24:32-35</span>; almost word for word the same. Comp, also, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:29-33">Luke 21:29-33</span>, where the form is different, but the thought precisely identical.
