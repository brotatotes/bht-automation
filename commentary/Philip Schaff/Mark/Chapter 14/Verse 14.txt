<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> My guest-chamber.</strong> ‘The word used properly denotes a place where a traveller unloads his beast, or halts for the night; then an inn or place of public entertainment; then a hired room, as here’ (Alexander). The correct reading ‘my,’ is suggestive. Our Lord lays claim to it, even though it were to be hired.
