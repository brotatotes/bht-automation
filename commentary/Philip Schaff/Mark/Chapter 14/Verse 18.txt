Mark 14:18.  One of you shall betray me, even he that eateth with me. The first clause is word for word the same in the accounts of Matthew, Mark, and John; the last clause, so graphic, and so full of grief, is peculiar to Mark. This, as well as Mark 14:20, indicate, that Judas reclined near Him. On the probable order of the various incidents narrated by the four Evangelists, see Matthew 26:21.
