<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:18">Mark 14:18</span>. <strong> One of you shall betray me, even he that eateth with me.</strong> The first clause is word for word the same in the accounts of Matthew, Mark, and John; the last clause, so graphic, and so full of grief, is peculiar to Mark.
