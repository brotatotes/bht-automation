Mark 14:36.  Abba, Father. Mark gives, not only the substance of the prayer (Mark 14:35), but some of the words of our Lora. ‘Abba’ is the word for ‘Father’ in the dialect of that time and country. In explanation Mark adds the Greek word. But before this Gospel was written, ‘Abba Father’ came into general use as an address to God (Romans 8:15; Galatians 4:6), probably from our Lord’s use of the former word.
	 All things are possible unto thee. Peculiar to Mark, and doubtless a part of the very form used.
	 Howbeit, not what I will. The form differs from that of Matthew, and might be paraphrased: ‘But,  the great question is, not what I will, but what thou wilt.’
