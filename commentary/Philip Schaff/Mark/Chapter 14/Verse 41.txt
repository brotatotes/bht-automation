Mark 14:41.  The third time. The third prayer, mentioned in Matthew 26:44, is of course implied here.
	 It is enough. That is, enough of your watching with me, or seeming to watch with me. Even could you watch, it would no longer avail,  the hour is come. A number of other interpretations have been given, but they are open to serious objections. It can scarcely mean, it is enough of sleep; and it is very improbable that between that permission and this expression sufficient time intervened to allow them to sleep. Some explain it: the conflict is over; others: he (  i.e.  , the betrayer) is still far off. But the former is contrary to usage, and the latter to the context. The single word in the original is therefore well rendered; ‘it is enough.’ See further on Matthew 26:45.
