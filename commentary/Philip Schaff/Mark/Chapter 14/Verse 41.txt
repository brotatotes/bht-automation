<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:41">Mark 14:41</span>. <strong> The third time.</strong> The third prayer, mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:44">Matthew 26:44</span>, is of course implied here.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> It is enough.</strong> That is, enough of your watching with me, or seeming to watch with me. Even could you watch, it would no longer avail, <strong> the hour is come.</strong> A number of other interpretations have been given, but they are open to serious objections. It can scarcely mean, it is enough of sleep; and it is very improbable that between that permission and this expression sufficient time intervened to allow them to sleep. Some explain it: the conflict is over; others: he ( <em> i.e</em>. <em> ,</em> the betrayer) is still far off. But the former is contrary to usage, and the latter to the context. The single word in the original is therefore well rendered; ‘it is enough.’ See further on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:45">Matthew 26:45</span>. </p>
