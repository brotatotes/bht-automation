<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:51">Mark 14:51</span>. <strong> A certain young man. </strong> Not one of the Apostles, all of whom had fled (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:50">Mark 14:50</span>), but a disciple. He may have been seized because of some expression o <em> f</em> sympathy, or simply because of his strange attire.

<p style="margin-left:0.3em;"><strong> Having a </strong> linen cloth. Either a sheet or a night-garment, the material alone being definitely mentioned.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.3em;"><strong> On his naked body. </strong> He had just risen from bed, having probably been asleep in a house near by, possibly on the ‘place’ itself. Further all is conjecture. It may have been Mark himself; others think it was the owner of the garden; others again that it was a member of the family where the Passover had been eaten; others, James the brother of our Lord; others, the apostle John. The first theory would account for the insertion of this incident here, with the name suppressed. A few years later Mark was living with his mother in Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:12">Acts 12:12</span>), and probably at this time also. If it was any one well-known to the first readers of the Gospel, it was no doubt the Evangelist himself. The words ‘the young men’ are to be omitted.
