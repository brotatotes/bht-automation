Mark 14:51.  A certain young man.  Not one of the Apostles, all of whom had fled (Mark 14:50), but a disciple. He may have been seized because of some expression o  f sympathy, or simply because of his strange attire.
	 Having a  linen cloth. Either a sheet or a night-garment, the material alone being definitely mentioned.
	 On his naked body.  He had just risen from bed, having probably been asleep in a house near by, possibly on the ‘place’ itself. Further all is conjecture. It may have been Mark himself; others think it was the owner of the garden; others again that it was a member of the family where the Passover had been eaten; others, James the brother of our Lord; others, the apostle John. The first theory would account for the insertion of this incident here, with the name suppressed. A few years later Mark was living with his mother in Jerusalem (Acts 12:12), and probably at this time also. If it was any one well-known to the first readers of the Gospel, it was no doubt the Evangelist himself. The words ‘the young men’ are to be omitted.
