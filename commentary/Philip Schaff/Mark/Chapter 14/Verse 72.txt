<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And when he thought thereon, he wept</strong> <em> . </em> Continued weeping is implied. The word translated ‘thought thereon ‘means literally, ‘casting on; ‘then casting it over, reflecting on it. The calling to mind was the momentary act of remembrance occasioned by the crowing of the cock, this the serious and continued reflection on the sin. Other interpretations are given: ‘rushing forth,’ <em> i.e., </em> he threw himself out of the place; ‘ <em> beginning</em> ’ ‘continuing,’ ‘covering his head,’ etc. The most fanciful view is: ‘ <em> casting</em> (his eyes) <em> on</em> ’ (Him), i.e. <em> ,</em> looking at the Saviour as He passed.
