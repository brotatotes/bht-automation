<p>Chronology. <strong> </strong> See the Chapter Comments on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:0">Matthew 26:0</span>. To the prediction of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:1-2">Matthew 26:1-2</span>, Mark gives no parallel. His account of the anointing at Bethany resembles that of John (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1-8">John 12:1-8</span>), but he gives independent details, in his graphic manner.
