Mark 15:22.  To the place Golgotha.  More correctly perhaps: place of Golgotha, answering to  Place of a Skull, since Golgotha means ‘skull,’ and Luke (Luke 23:33) calls the place simply ‘skull.’ This is an additional reason for supposing that the name was owing to the conical shape of the ground. See on Matthew 27:33.
