<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:28">Mark 15:28</span>. This verse (a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:12">Isaiah 53:12</span>) is omitted by the oldest manuscripts and rejected by the latest critics. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:37">Luke 22:37</span>, its genuineness is undoubted. Mark rarely quotes prophecies so directly.
