<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:36">Mark 15:36</span>. <strong> Saying, Let be,</strong> etc. In Matthew’s account, these words are addressed <em> to</em> the man who gave the vinegar, here spoken <em> by</em> him to the others. A sign of accuracy; such a conversation is natural; the one addressed by the crowd flinging back their own words. ‘Let be’ means ‘let this suffice,’ until we see Elijah coming. The man may have had the passing earnest thought that Elijah might come. But to keep on good terms with the excited jeering rabble, he assumes the same tone with them.

<p><strong> To take him down. </strong> Matthew: ‘to save Him.’ The two Evangelists give two distinct parts of the same conversation.
