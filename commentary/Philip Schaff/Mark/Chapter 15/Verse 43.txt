Mark 15:43.  An honourable councillor. A member of the Sanhedrin (comp. Luke 23:51). ‘Honorable’ here means noble in station.
	 Who also himself was, etc. He expected the Messiah, and had been a secret disciple of Jesus (John 19:38).
	 Came. Literally,  having come, i.e., to the scene of the crucifixion (Matthew 27:57). He had probably seen the breaking of the legs of the other two, and was aware of the request of the Jews that the bodies should be taken down. If he would pay this tribute of respect to one whom he had followed in secret, he must quickly and publicly take this step.
	 And he boldly went in. The decisive act which marked the change from a secret to an open discipleship.
