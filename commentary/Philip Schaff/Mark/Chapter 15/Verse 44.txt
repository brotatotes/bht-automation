Mark 15:44.  And Pilate marvelled.  Not at the request, but:  if he were already dead. This shows there was something unusual in this case of crucifixion. Pilate had already given orders to have the legs of the crucified broken and the bodies taken down. The first part of the order had been carried out, but our Lord was already dead. The two other bodies were probably taken down at once, but Joseph, appearing at Golgotha (as Matthew and Mark state) made known to the soldiers his purpose; hence they left the body of Jesus on the cross, perhaps going with Joseph to Pilate, in the expectation that his request (as that of a rich and influential man) would be granted. The sudden announcement of the rapid death of this Person, in whom he had been so interested that day, amazed him, and led to his inquiry of the centurion.
