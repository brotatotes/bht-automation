The original indicates that they came after the burial, entering without hesitation the garden of the rich councillor. The two members of the Sanhedrin (Joseph and Nicodemus; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:38-39">John 19:38-39</span>) were still probably there. The company was a singular one, but a type of the Christian congregations collected together by the death of Christ Salome was absent. It she were the sister of our Lord’s mother, she should go to comfort her mourning sister, who had probably left the scene of the crucifixion under the conduct of John some time before. Their temporary residence would be in the same place (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:27">John 19:27</span>). An incidental hint of accuracy and truthfulness.
