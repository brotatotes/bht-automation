<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:9-14">Mark 15:9-14</span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:17-23">Matthew 27:17-23</span>. Markâ€™s account is much briefer than the other three. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:9">Mark 15:9</span> it agrees more closely with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:39">John 18:39</span>; referring however to the first proposal of Pilate, before the message from his wife. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:12">Mark 15:12</span> describes the second, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:14">Mark 15:14</span> the third attempt of Pilate. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:13">Mark 15:13</span>, <strong> again</strong> does not mean a repetition of the same cry. The cry for the crucifixion of Jesus, was the answer to the second attempt of Pilate.
