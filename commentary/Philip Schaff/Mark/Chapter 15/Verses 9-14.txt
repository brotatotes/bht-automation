Mark 15:9-14. See on Matthew 27:17-23. Markâ€™s account is much briefer than the other three. In Mark 15:9 it agrees more closely with John 18:39; referring however to the first proposal of Pilate, before the message from his wife. Mark 15:12 describes the second, Mark 15:14 the third attempt of Pilate. In Mark 15:13,  again does not mean a repetition of the same cry. The cry for the crucifixion of Jesus, was the answer to the second attempt of Pilate.
