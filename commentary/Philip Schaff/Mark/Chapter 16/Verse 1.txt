<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Bought spices.</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:56">Luke 22:56</span> does not necessarily imply that the preparation of spices took place on Friday, before the beginning of the Sabbath. Even if most of the women began the preparations at that time, these three were not thus engaged. The two Maries sat over against the sepulchre late on Friday (Matthew), and Salome had probably rejoined her sister Mary. (See on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:47">Mark 15:47</span>.) The resting on the Sabbath is expressly affirmed by Luke.
