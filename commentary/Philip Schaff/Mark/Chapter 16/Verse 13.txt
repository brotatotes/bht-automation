Mark 16:13.  They. Emphatic, giving prominence to these successive messages.

Luke (Luke 24:34) tells how these two met the company who told them, ‘The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.’ But he speaks immediately after of their terror at His appearance (Luke 24:37); their state of mind was not one of decided belief. The same impression is conveyed by Matthew 28:17; John 20:20. A conflict of doubt and belief would be very natural, or even a division of opinion, some doubting and some believing. Even if all believed that the Lord had appeared to Simon, some might, for various reasons, still doubt the message of the two disciples. This apparent discrepancy with Luke may have encouraged the copyists to omit the passage, if they found any authority for doing so.
