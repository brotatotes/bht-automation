<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:16">Mark 16:16</span>. <strong> He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned.</strong> The obvious lessons of this verse are pressing and practical. ( 1 .) The belief is belief in Jesus of Nazareth, crucified and risen again, as <em> an all-sufficient Personal Saviour,</em> It is belief of the gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15">Mark 16:15</span>), because the gospel presents Christ. ( 2 .) Baptism is generally but not absolutely necessary to salvation. It is not said: He that believeth not <em> and is not baptized</em> will be condemned. The first trophy of the crucified Lord, was the unbaptized yet believing robber. Many martyrs had no opportunity of baptism. Multitudes of unbaptized children die in infancy, and the Society of Friends reject water-baptism. Yet the other clause shows the general necessity. Baptism cannot be deemed indifferent in view of this command. None are condemned simply because not baptized, but positive unbelief is the one certain ground of condemnation, whether the person be baptized or not baptized. ( 3 .) Nothing can be proved from this passage as to the <em> order </em> in which faith and baptism must always come. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19-20">Matthew 28:19-20</span>, it is altogether different. ( 4 .) The form of the original is peculiar, and points to a future and permanent division of mankind into ‘saved’ and ‘condemned.’ ( 5 .) The condemnation for the sin of unbelief, implies a previous offer of the gospel. The preceding verse points to a proclamation of the offer to every one, without exception, and the sin of unbelief has its spring in something independent of any such offer. Blessedness is impossible for those who when they know of Christ do not trust Him. ( 6 .) The word ‘condemned’ implies just what our Lord has expressed again and again in awful language (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:43-49">Mark 9:43-49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:51">Matthew 24:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:30">Matthew 25:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:46">Matthew 25:46</span>).
