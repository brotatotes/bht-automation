Mark 16:17.  And these signs shall follow them that believe. This promise is to be taken literally; but is it to be limited to the Apostolic times, or is it to be extended to all Christians? In favor of the limitation may be urged: the reference to the  founding of the Church which runs through the whole passage; the cessation of the necessity for such ‘signs’ as proofs of the truth, and the cessation of such miraculous gifts as a fact in the history of the Church. Yet it is highly probable that the promise is more general. Alford: ‘Should occasion arise for its fulfillment  ,  there can be no doubt that it will be made good in our own or any other time. But we must remember that “signs’’ are not needed where Christianity is  professed; nor by missionaries who are backed by the influence of powerful Christian nations.’ Fanatical and superstitious use of the promise is due to a failure to understand the nature of these things as ‘signs.’

	 Shall they cast out demons. Comp. Matthew 12:27 on this ‘sign.’ It is characteristic of Mark to emphasize this form of miraculous power.
	 They  shall speak with new tongues. See Acts 2:4; Acts 10:46; Acts 1:0 Corinthians 13, 14 . This was literally fulfilled. A symbolical meaning, such as new forms of spiritual truth, is unnecessary. As the whole was written after the manifestation of the gifts of tongues in the Apostolic times, this clause is no proof of a later origin of the section. These ‘tongues’ were the most striking signs for the first success of the gospel, hence we might expect to find such a promise.
