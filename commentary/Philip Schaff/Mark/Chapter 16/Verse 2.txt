Mark 16:2.  Very early.  In the East this would mean before sunrise, as the other accounts show. The anxious women would go to the tomb as soon as possible.
	 When the sun was risen. This may be taken literally as referring to the time when they reached the tomb, or less exactly ‘when the sun was about to rise.’
