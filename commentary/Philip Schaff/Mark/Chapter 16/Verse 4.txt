Mark 16:4.  Looking up. They may have been looking down before, absorbed in their conversation; the tomb was probably above them, cut horizontally in the face of the rock at a slight elevation.
	 They see that the stone is rolled back. Possibly ‘rolled up,’ as if it had rested in a hollow at the door of the tomb.
	 For it was exceeding great.  This does not mean that the greatness of the stone was the reason of their anxiety and questioning, although this was doubtless true, but that its size enabled them to notice the position even in the early morning. A vivid touch peculiar to Mark. An angel had removed it (Matthew 26:2).
