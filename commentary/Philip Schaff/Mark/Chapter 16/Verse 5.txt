This entrance, as we think, took place after an interval, during which the three separated, after the angelic message mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:2-7">Matthew 28:2-7</span>, the two Maries returning with the other women and entering the tomb. On the other intervening events, see the Chapter Comments for <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:0">Matthew 28:0</span>.

Luke speaks of ‘two men,’ afterwards referring to them as ‘angels’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:23">Luke 24:23</span>). Mark describes the first impression as the women went in. Luke is more general, but it is not probable that he joins the two angels spoken of separately by Matthew and Mark.

Also, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:4">Luke 24:4</span> (see notes there), which tells of the same occurrence <em> within </em> the tomb, but less definitely. Peter and John had already been there and seen <em> no</em> angel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:3-8">John 19:3-8</span>). The mission of the angels was to comfort and instruct the disciples, not to perplex them and us by the mysterious disappearances and reappearances which some other explanations suggest.
