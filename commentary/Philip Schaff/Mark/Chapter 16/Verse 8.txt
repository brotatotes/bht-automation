Mark 16:8.  And fled from the tomb.  In a tumult of excitement.
	 For trembling and astonishment possessed them. This was the reason of their fleeing.
	 And they said nothing to any one; for they were afraid.  Matthew twice (Matthew 28:8; Matthew 28:11) speaks of their going to deliver the message, hence some explain this clause: they told no one  by the way. But Mark’s words mean that they did  not, immediately at least, deliver the message. The ‘fear’ spoken of by Matthew is made prominent here; joined with the fright from what they had seen was a fear that their reports would be (as they actually were) deemed ‘idle tales’ by the disciples (Luke 24:11). In this state of indecision, as they ran back, the Lord meets them (Matthew 28:9-10), overcomes their fear (‘Be not afraid,’ He says), and they go on with the message, now coming from the Lord Himself. The remarkable events of that day produced mingled and indeed confused emotions. To that of fear and indecision, Mark gives prominence. Even these faithful women were full of doubt: a fact that upsets all theories resembling the Jewish falsehood, mentioned by Matthew. Strangest of all, however, would be the sudden ending of the Gospel at this point of indecision. See next section.
