<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:1">Mark 2:1</span>. <strong> Capernaum.</strong> ‘His own city.’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:1">Matthew 9:1</span>.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> After some days.</strong> More than one day, but how many does not appear. Still even this indefinite mark of time favors the view, that the order of this Evangelist is exact.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Noised.</strong> This suggests a private entrance into the city, and then a general report that He was there.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> In the house</strong> <strong><em> .</em></strong> <em> </em> The article is wanting in the original; the phrase is equivalent to ‘at home;’ but with the additional idea of having come there. It is therefore probable that the house was His usual residence in Capernaum, but this is not definitely expressed.
