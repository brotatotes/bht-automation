<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:15">Mark 2:15</span>. <strong> In his house.</strong> That of Levi, who made the feast for our Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:29">Luke 5:29</span>). The passage before us does not decide this, but any other view needlessly creates a discrepancy. Our Lord did not pass directly from the custom house to the feast. In all three accounts the interval is left indefinite. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:10">Matthew 9:10</span>. The narrative is lively in style.

<p><strong> For they were many and they followed him.</strong> Mark alone gives this reason for the number of publicans and sinners gathered there, namely, that persons of these classes were numerous and that they very generally followed Christ. The fact that the host was one of the former class (and would naturally gather his associates), is brought out by Luke.
