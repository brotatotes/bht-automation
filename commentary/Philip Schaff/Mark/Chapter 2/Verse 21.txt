Mark 2:21.  That which filleth it up  (lit, ‘the fulness’)  taketh away from it, the new from the old, and a worse rent is made  . The form is peculiar to Mark, and characteristic of his lively style. The variations show entire independence. Compare:    the wine will burst the skins, and the wine perisheth, and the skins,  with Matthew 9:17; Luke 5:37.
