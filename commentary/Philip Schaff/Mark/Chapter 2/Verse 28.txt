Mark 2:28.  So that the Son of man it Lord also of the Sabbath.  The connection here differs from that of the other accounts, and the idea is more full. Since the Sabbath was made for the benefit of man, it follows that  the Son of Man (the Messiah, but especially in His character as the Head and Representative of humanity) is Lord (Sovereign over all that belongs to the interest of man and hence)  also of the Sabbath; i.e., not for its abolition, but for its true fulfilment; comp, Matthew 5:17. See further on Matthew 12:8.
