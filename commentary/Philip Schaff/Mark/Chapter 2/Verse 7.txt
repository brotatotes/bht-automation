Mark 2:7.  Why doth this man thus speak? He blasphemeth! Who can  , etc. This is the best established sense of the verse. ‘This one,’ contemptuously; ‘thus,’  i.e., such great things; the words in the original resemble each other:  This one in this wise. If our Lord were what the scribes deemed Him, their judgment was correct. This occurrence is to prove the incorrectness of their estimate of Him.
