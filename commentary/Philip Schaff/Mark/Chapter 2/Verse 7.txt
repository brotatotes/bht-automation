<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:7">Mark 2:7</span>. <strong> Why doth this man thus speak? He blasphemeth! Who can</strong> <em> ,</em> etc. This is the best established sense of the verse. ‘This one,’ contemptuously; ‘thus,’ <em> i.e.,</em> such great things; the words in the original resemble each other: <em> This one in this wise.</em> If our Lord were what the scribes deemed Him, their judgment was correct. This occurrence is to prove the incorrectness of their estimate of Him.
