<p>ON the chronology, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:2-17">Matthew 9:2-17</span>. According to the view there defended, the feast and discourse (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:15-22">Mark 2:15-22</span>) occurred some time after the call of Levi, and these verses only, in the first thirteen chapters of Mark, are out of chronological order.
