<p>CHRONOLOGY <em> . </em> See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:1-21">Matthew 11:1-21</span>. These events took place just before the choosing of the Twelve (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:14">Mark 2:14</span>, etc.). On the theory of a three yearsâ€™ ministry in Galilee, they occurred shortly after the visit to Jerusalem mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:0">John 5:0</span>, when the enmity of the Jews was awakened on this point of Sabbath observance. The interval between the call of Levi and these controversies may have been of considerable length.
