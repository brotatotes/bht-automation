<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:17">Mark 3:17</span>. <strong> Boanerges.</strong> A transfer into Greek of an Aramaic word, which was modified from the Hebrew. Mark, writing for other than Jews, interprets it. He alone mentions it.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Sons of thunder.</strong> This seems to have been occasioned by their ‘ <em> vehement</em> and <em> zealous</em> disposition, as indicated in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:54">Luke 9:54</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:38">Mark 9:38</span>.’ This does not imply censure; for these traits, when sanctified, would be praiseworthy. John was not, as he is often portrayed, of a soft and almost effeminate disposition. Such neutral characters are rarely heroes of faith. The Apocalypse reveals the son of thunder. The name may refer also to the corresponding character of their eloquence. Powerful, fervid preachers are still thus termed. With the ancients, thunder was the symbol for profound and solemn utterances. The name would be prophetic in this application. It was not used frequently, like Simon’s surname, because it was borne by two brothers, one of whom was martyred earliest.
