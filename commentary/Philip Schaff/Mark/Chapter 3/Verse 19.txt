<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:19">Mark 3:19</span>. <strong> And he cometh into a house.</strong> This indicates a return to Capernaum; as the succeeding events probably took place there. The sentence, therefore, properly belongs to the next section. In the interval a number of important events took place; see next note. If a particular house is meant, there is an undesigned coincidence. Matthew, in prefacing the parables of our Lord, tells us He went ‘out of the house,’ without having spoken of His entering one. Those parables were uttered just after the events next recorded by Mark, who speaks of this entering a house, without telling of His going out.
