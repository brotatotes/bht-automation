Mark 3:30.  Because they said, he hath an unclean spirit. This does not necessarily define the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, but certainly indicates its character. Ever if these accusers had not committed it, their language tended in that direction. They had attributed to an evil spirit what was the work of the Holy Spirit, that too in presence of sufficient evidence of its true character.
