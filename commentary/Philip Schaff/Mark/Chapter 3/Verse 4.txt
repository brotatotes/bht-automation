<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:4">Mark 3:4</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:10">Matthew 12:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:10">Matthew 12:10</span> shows that the question of our Lord was preceded by one from the Pharisees, just as His command had been occasioned by ‘their thoughts’ or ‘reasonings’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:8">Luke 6:8</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Is it lawful? </strong> i.e., according to the Mosaic law.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> To do good, or to do harm.</strong> To benefit, or to injure, rather than to do right or to do wrong. This is repeated yet more forcibly: <strong> to save a life or to kill?</strong> Our Lord thus establishes the propriety of works of mercy on the Sabbath, even according to the Mosaic law (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:11-12">Matthew 12:11-12</span>, where the falling of a sheep into a pit is introduced). His opponents were silenced; and his authority as ‘Lord also of the Sabbath’ (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:28">Mark 2:28</span>) is then vindicated by the miracle.
