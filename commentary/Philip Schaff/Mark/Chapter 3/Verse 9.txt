<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Because of the crowd.</strong> A different word from ‘multitude’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:7-8">Mark 3:7-8</span>), though the one usually so translated. The purpose was probably both to teach from the boat and to retire from the crowd when He wished. It was doubtless thus that He retired shortly afterwards (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:13">Mark 3:13</span>). His ministry, rather than His personal comfort, was thus furthered.
