CHRONOLOGY  .  See on Matthew 11:1-21. These events took place just before the choosing of the Twelve (Mark 2:14, etc.). On the theory of a three yearsâ€™ ministry in Galilee, they occurred shortly after the visit to Jerusalem mentioned in John 5:0, when the enmity of the Jews was awakened on this point of Sabbath observance. The interval between the call of Levi and these controversies may have been of considerable length.
