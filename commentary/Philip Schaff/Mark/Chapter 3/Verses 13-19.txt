Luke tells or great works or healing immediately succeeding the choice of the Twelve. During the withdrawal, after the opening hostility of the Pharisees (Mark 3:7), this choice took place, followed by the Sermon on the Mount, of which Mark makes no mention. This event is to be distinguished from the  sending out of the Twelve. See notes on Matthew 9:36; Matthew 10:4. Comp. Mark 6:7; Luke 9:1.
