CHRONOLOGY. At this point we find the largest gap in Markâ€™s narrative. Shortly after the choice of the Twelve, the Sermon on the Mount was delivered. See notes on Matthew. On and after the return to Capernaum, a number of events took place, recorded partly by Matthew and partly by Luke, and in most cases by both. The miracle immediately preceding the occurrences of the section before us, was the healing of a blind and dumb demoniac (Matthew 12:22), which called forth the charge of the scribes (Mark 3:22). Mark 3:20-21, are peculiar to Mark.
