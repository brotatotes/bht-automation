<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:31-35">Mark 3:31-35</span>. Comparing these verses with the account of Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:46-50">Matthew 12:46-50</span>), we find that Mark omits the introductory phrase; ‘While He yet talked to the people; in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:31">Mark 3:31</span> he tells us that His mother and brothers <strong> sent unto him</strong>; in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:32">Mark 3:32</span> he inserts: <strong> And a multitude was sitting about him</strong>; in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:34">Mark 3:34</span> he mentions our Lord’s glance: <strong> And he looked round,</strong> instead of the gesture preserved by Matthew: ‘And He stretched forth His hand toward His disciples.’ The look was probably one of affectionate recognition; contrast the look of anger and grief (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:5">Mark 3:5</span>). That the look as well as the word applied to more than the Twelve is evident. The blessed truth belongs to multitudes who sit about Jesus and feel His look of affection in a higher spiritual sense. </p>
