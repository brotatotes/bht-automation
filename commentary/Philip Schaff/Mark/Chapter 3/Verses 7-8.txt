<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:7-8">Mark 3:7-8</span>. <strong> Withdrew.</strong> Not to avoid the multitudes, but rather to fulfil His ministry among them, undisturbed by the opposition of the Pharisees.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> To the sea</strong>. To the shores of the sea of Galilee; perhaps to a boat from which He might teach (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:9">Mark 3:9</span>, chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:1">Mark 4:1</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:3">Luke 5:3</span>). This description of the crowds waiting upon His ministry is the fullest given in the Gospels. The verses are unfortunately divided in the E. V. Two classes are spoken of, <em> first</em>, <strong> a great multitude from Galilee</strong>, where He was teaching, who <strong> followed him</strong>, holding to Him in His conflict with the Pharisees, then: from Judea, etc.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> A great multitude</strong>, who in consequence of the reports of His works <strong> came unto him.</strong> Others prefer to distinguish the second crowd as those who came from Tyre and Sidon, but the correct reading forbids this view. The original emphasizes the greatness of the crowd in the first instance, and in the second their coming from different and distant places.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Idumea</strong>. Edom, southeast of Palestine, a sort of border land between the Jews and Gentiles. The inhabitants were descendants of Esau, but had been conquered and made Jews by violence about one hundred and twenty-five years before Christ.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Beyond Jordan.</strong> Perea, east of Jordan.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> About Tyre and Sidon.</strong> The leading cities of Phenicia, north of Palestine along the sea-coast. They stand here for the whole district. Probably Jews and heathen alike came from all these quarters. The route of traffic between the points here specified was by Capernaum, so that reports would quickly spread and crowds easily gather.
