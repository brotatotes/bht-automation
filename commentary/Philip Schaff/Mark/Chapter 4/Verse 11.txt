<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:11">Mark 4:11</span>. <strong> The mystery.</strong> Matthew and Luke: ‘the mysteries.’ All the mysteries of the gospel form but one mystery, namely, the mystery of Christ for and in His people. And to them ‘is given the mystery of the kingdom of God’. The omission of ‘to know’ renders the declaration even more forcible. These parables are to reveal, not good moral advice, but <em> truth otherwise unknown</em>, the peculiar doctrines of the gospel, which can be fully received only by those to whom spiritual discernment is given. Christ did not come merely to teach the Golden Rule or the Sermon on the Mount.

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> Unto them that are without.</strong> Matthew: ‘to them.’ Luke: ‘to others.’ A separation between the disciples and others had begun. (Afterwards, ‘those without’ meant those not Christians; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:12">1 Corinthians 5:12</span>.) ‘Those without’ did not receive this gift of God necessary for the understanding of these truths, were without its influences. But their position was according to their own choice; Christ forbade none, and the disciples in this case were not merely the Twelve chosen by Him, but all who would come.
