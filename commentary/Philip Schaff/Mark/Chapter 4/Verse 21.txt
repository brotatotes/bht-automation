Mark 4:21. See on Matthew 5:15. The application here is to teaching in parables: Although thus spoken in secret, they were not to remain mysteries, confined to a few; the purpose, as in case of a lamp, was to give light. Hence they should take care to learn their meaning, ‘not hiding them under a blunted understanding, nor when they did understand them, neglecting the teaching of them to others’ (Alford).
