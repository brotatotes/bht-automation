<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> But that it should come to light.</strong> This is the purpose of the temporary secrecy, a thought implied throughout, but more strongly expressed here. Even the <em> concealing</em> is for the purpose of revealing. Only by such a process could Christian truth be ultimately spread. The concealing, hiding purpose, mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:12">Mark 4:12</span>, is not without this gracious use of revealing the truth more fully to those who see the evil effect of rejecting it.
