Mark 4:25.  For he that hath, etc. See on Matthew 13:12, where this thought precedes the explanation of the parable of the sower. It was possibly repeated, since it is equally apt in both cases. There as well as here the application is to spiritual knowledge. (In Matthew 25:29, the application is more general.) There is nothing arbitrary in this rule; it is a law of Godâ€™s dealing in the kingdom of nature as well as of grace.
