<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:29">Mark 4:29</span>. <strong> But when the fruit is ripe.</strong> The Greek means either: ‘when the fruit shall have yielded itself,’ or, according to the more usual sense, of the word used, ‘when the fruit alloweth,’ <em> i.e.,</em> when it is ripe. In either case the thought of independence of human agency is kept up.

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> Straightway he sendeth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come. </strong> The agency which sowed enters again. If it means human agency, the conclusion is simply: this development and fruitfulness is for man’s benefit, though independent of his care. We reap in spiritual things, though God alone (by His laws of grace) gives the increase. If it refers to Christ, it is hinted that when the grain is ripe He harvests it, takes matured Christians to Himself. The parable possibly has a historical application: The sowing referring to Christ’s instituting the Church; the intervening period to his absence, during which the growth continues according to the laws of the Spirit’s influence; and the harvest to His return. Such a view suits the position of the parable between that of the <em> sower </em> (the beginnings of Christianity) and that of the <em> mustard-seed</em> (its wonderful extension). But this is not to be insisted on, since the agent is not brought into prominence. The main lesson is: that of spiritual growth independent of our agency, even though we sow the good seed and reap the harvest. Hence, <em> patience</em> with immature Christians, and <em> patience</em> with an immature Church. Both cautions are constantly needed to prevent our becoming uncharitable and schismatic.
