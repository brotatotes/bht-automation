Mark 4:32.  Shooteth out great branches.  Lit, ‘maketh.’ Peculiar to Mark. This parable, setting forth the wonderful extension of the kingdom of God, is an appropriate close to the selections made by our Evangelist. After the difficulties in the beginning (the sower) and the slow growth independently of human agency have been emphasized, the successful result is foretold. The lesson of  patience is again enforced, but  hope  is more directly encouraged.
