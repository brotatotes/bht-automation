Mark 4:34.  And, not ‘but.’ The contrast begins with the next clause.
	 Without a parable spake he not. Our Lord did instruct in other ways, but now that the separation had begun, He taught a  certain set of truths in this way alone, since this would carry out the purpose or mercy and judgment indicated in Mark 4:11-12. But this method was also necessary, in view of Jewish prejudice and misunderstanding, to prepare His disciples to extend the truth (Mark 4:21-22).
	 But privately to his own disciples.  The correct reading and the Greek order alike emphasize the isolation of the disciples.
	 He expounded all things. That they needed this is evident from the Gospel accounts, and we have specimens of these expositions in this chapter and Matthew 13:0; Matthew 15:15. In other cases there are indications of such expositions. More are not given, because the  subsequent teaching of the Apostles gives us the fruits of this training, revealing the truth more plainly than was possible then. A caution to those who underrate the Epistles, which embody what is not told us in the Gospels. Still the specimens recorded by the Evangelists are sufficient to guide us in interpretation.
