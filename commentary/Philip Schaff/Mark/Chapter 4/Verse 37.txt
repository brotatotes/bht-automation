<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:37">Mark 4:37</span>. All three accounts of this storm and its effects differ in form, but agree in substance. From <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:35">Mark 4:35</span>, we infer that it was already night when the storm arose. The lake was and is still subject to sudden storms, but very few boats are seen there now.
