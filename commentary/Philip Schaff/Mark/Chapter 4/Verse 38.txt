<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:38">Mark 4:38</span>. <strong> In the stern, asleep on the cushion.</strong> The ordinary cushion, at the stern of the boat, used for a seat, sometimes for the rowers. The position is mentioned by Mark only, but Matthew and Luke speak of the disciples’ coming to Him, which indicates the same thing. His weary body needed the rest, and this the disciples must have known; hence there is a tone of unkindness as well as unbelief in the language he recorded: <strong> Carest thou not that we perish?</strong> The various accounts indicate a variety of expressions, all of fear, though this includes a complaint. The same want of faith is still manifest in Christians in times of trial, even though not thus expressed.
