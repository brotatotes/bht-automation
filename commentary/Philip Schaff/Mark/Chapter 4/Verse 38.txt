Mark 4:38.  In the stern, asleep on the cushion. The ordinary cushion, at the stern of the boat, used for a seat, sometimes for the rowers. The position is mentioned by Mark only, but Matthew and Luke speak of the disciplesâ€™ coming to Him, which indicates the same thing. His weary body needed the rest, and this the disciples must have known; hence there is a tone of unkindness as well as unbelief in the language he recorded:  Carest thou not that we perish? The various accounts indicate a variety of expressions, all of fear, though this includes a complaint. The same want of faith is still manifest in Christians in times of trial, even though not thus expressed.
