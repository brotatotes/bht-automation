<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:8">Mark 4:8</span>. <strong> Growing up and increasing</strong> <em> .</em> The words are peculiar to Mark. This is spoken of the ‘fruit,’ but in the wider sense of the whole progress of the plant, since all this is necessary to the real fruit or grain, which was brought forth. This verse puts the smallest proportion first; in Matthew’s account it is put last. Other verbal differences attesting the independence of the Evangelists, are indicated as far as possible in the foot-notes to the text.
