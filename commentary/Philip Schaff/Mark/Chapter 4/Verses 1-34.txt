<p>ON PARABLES, <em> </em> see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:1-52">Matthew 13:1-52</span>. In his report of the discourse in parables, Mark gives but three, one of them not mentioned elsewhere. Each independently chose these out of the many uttered. In Matthew we find the <em> chronological</em> development of the kingdom of heaven brought out; here, all three parables are drawn from familiar agricultural pursuits, presenting the one idea of the growth or development of the kingdom of God: the <em> first</em>, as respects the soil, or the difficulty of its beginnings; the <em> second</em>, illustrating the <em> relative independence</em> of this development; the last, its wonderful extension. Mark here introduces (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:21-25">Mark 4:21-25</span>) what Matthew records as uttered on other occasions. Our Lord was in the habit of repeating striking figures, proverbs, and aphorisms. This discourse took place the ‘same day’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:1">Matthew 13:1</span>) with the occurrences just mentioned (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:20-35">Mark 3:20-35</span>). The hostility of the Pharisees called for the teaching by parables in its purpose of <em> concealing</em> the truth, which is most strongly expressed by Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:12">Mark 4:12</span>), while the choice of the Twelve (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:14">Mark 3:14</span>) formed the nucleus of a band of followers (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:10">Mark 4:10</span>) in whom the other purpose of <em> revealing</em> the truth could be fulfilled.
