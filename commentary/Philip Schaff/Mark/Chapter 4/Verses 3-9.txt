Mark 4:3-9. THE PARABLE OF THE SOWER.   See on Matthew 13:3-9. The similarity between the two accounts is very great, as might be expected in the case of such a striking parable. Matthew was present; Mark probably heard it from Peter, who was also present. Lukeâ€™s account ( Luke 8:5-8) is briefer, and he does not describe the position of the Teacher and His audience.
