<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:3-9">Mark 4:3-9</span>. THE PARABLE OF THE SOWER. <em> </em> See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:3-9">Matthew 13:3-9</span>. The similarity between the two accounts is very great, as might be expected in the case of such a striking parable. Matthew was present; Mark probably heard it from Peter, who was also present. Lukeâ€™s account ( <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:5-8">Luke 8:5-8</span>) is briefer, and he does not describe the position of the Teacher and His audience.
