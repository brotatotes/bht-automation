<p>THE TIME of the voyage across the lake is fixed by the account before us. It was the evening of the day (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:35">Mark 4:35</span>) when the discourse in parables had been uttered. The other accounts (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:18">Matthew 8:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:22">Luke 8:22</span>) can readily be harmonized on this view. The conversations with some who would follow Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:19-22">Matthew 8:19-22</span>) seems to have taken place just before He crossed the sea. It had been a busy day; our Lord had first healed a demoniac (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:22">Matthew 12:22</span>), then encountered the accusation of His family (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:20-21">Mark 3:20-21</span>); afterwards the accusation of the Pharisees (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:22-30">Mark 3:22-30</span>; more fully in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:24-45">Matthew 12:24-45</span>), when His mother and brethren sought Him (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:31-35">Mark 3:31-35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:46-50">Matthew 12:46-50</span>); then after some discourses narrated by Luke only (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:37">Luke 10:37</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:59">Luke 12:59</span>), departing to the sea-side had given the long discourse, parts of which are recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:0">Mark 4:0</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:0">Matthew 13:0</span>, then encountered halfhearted followers (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:19-22">Matthew 8:19-22</span>), and in the evening crossed the lake. After such exhausting labors, it is not strange that He fell asleep, even amid the storm. Markâ€™s account is vivid, and in most respects more minute than that of Matthew, giving particulars omitted by both the other Evangelists.
