<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:13">Mark 5:13</span>. <strong> Being about two thousand.</strong> The parenthesis is unnecessary. The correct reading omits the verb, and we supply: being. This is preserved by Mark alone. The rest agrees entirely, though not verbally, with Matthewâ€™s account.
