<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:19">Mark 5:19</span>. <strong> Go into thy house unto thy friends, </strong> etc. He may have been in danger of despising his friends in the district that rejected Christ. His previous life may have harmed them; our Lord would make his future life a blessing to them.

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> Tell them. </strong> The command to those healed was often to keep silence, here it is the reverse, and for a good reason. There was no danger of tumult attending such a proclamation in that region as in Galilee. Then our Lord, even when rejected, would leave a preacher behind Him.

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> How great things the Lord hath done for thee.</strong> Luke: ‘God hath done for thee.’ So that ‘the Lord ‘means <em> Jehovah</em>, but it is also a fair inference that it means Christ Himself (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:20">Mark 5:20</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> And hath had mercy on thee. </strong> This hints at a spiritual blessing.
