<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:23">Mark 5:23</span>. <strong> My little daughter.</strong> ‘Little daughter,’ one word in the original, a diminutive of affection; comp. the German <em> Tochterlein</em> Mark probably gives the exact words of the ruler; Luke narrates in his own language the state of the case; Matthew, in his briefer account, combines in one sentence the substance of what the ruler said and the actual state of the girl as reported on the way thither (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:35">Mark 5:35</span>), omitting any special reference to the latter fact.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Is at the point of death.</strong> A correct paraphrase of a Greek expression which cannot be literally translated.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> That thou come,</strong> etc. The language of the original is peculiar and broken, indicating great emotion. Hence ‘I pray thee’ has been supplied, but the strong word ‘that’ (in order that) should not be omitted. The best explanation is: He states the condition of his daughter ‘in order that coming thou mayest lay thy hands on her, in order that she may be made whole and live.’ He thus expresses his faith. ‘Made whole,’ lit., ‘saved,’ from her disease, and ‘live,’ since it threatened death.
