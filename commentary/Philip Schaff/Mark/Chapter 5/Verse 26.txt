Mark 5:26.  Suffered many things of many physicians. Luke, himself a physician, also states that she ‘had spent all her living on physicians,’ without any good result. Mark emphasizes the fact that she ‘suffered ‘at their hands, and grew worse instead of better. In those days such diseases especially would be poorly treated, and treated without tenderness, first because the patient was Levitically  unclean, second because she was a  woman. Our Lord’s conduct was a protest against both these. Just in proportion as His influence permeates society, is woman not only elevated, but tenderly dealt with, especially in the matter of delicate diseases. All, physicians included, may learn a lesson here in the treatment of invalids of the female sex.
