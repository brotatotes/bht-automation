<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:36">Mark 5:36</span>. <strong> But Jesus not heeding,</strong> or, <strong> overhearing, the word spoken. </strong> The correct reading introduces a word, which usually means, to pass by as unheard, not to heed: more rarely, to overhear. In either case, it is a mark of accuracy in this account. The message was addressed to the ruler, not to our Lord. Either He did not heed it, though He heard it; or He heard it, when it was not addressed to Him, the former seems preferable.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Be not afraid, </strong> only believe. Luke adds: ‘and she shall be made whole.’ The delay seemed fatal, was in itself a trial to the faith of Jairus, especially now that the crisis had come. Yet what had just happened, for the message came ‘while He was speaking’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:35">Mark 5:35</span>, would encourage Jairus, especially as faith had been exalted in the miracle which the ruler himself witnessed.
