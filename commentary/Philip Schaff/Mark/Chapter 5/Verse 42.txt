Mark 5:42.  Straightway the damsel arose. Luke, the physician, speaks of her spirit returning.
	 And walked.  Peculiar to Mark, and an incident which would be impressed upon an eye-witness.
	 For she was twelve years old. Before her death she was old enough to walk and was now restored just as before. Up to this point there was nothing to indicate that she was other than an infant. Luke mentions her age much earlier in his narrative, while Matthew omits it altogether. It is impossible to believe that these three Evangelists copied from each other, or from a common source, in regard to this occurrence. The attempt to differ and agree in this way would be either altogether unsuccessful or cost more than it was worth.
	 Amazed. A stronger word than that usually translated ‘astonished.’
