<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:6">Mark 5:6</span>. <strong> And when he saw Jesus from afar.</strong> The prominent thought is that he ran from a distance. This running would look like a violent attack, but instead of this, he <strong> worshipped him</strong>; <strong> </strong> Luke: ‘fell down before Him,’ which may be all that the word ‘worshipped ‘means. But the next verse intimates that it was an acknowledgment of Christ’s power, even if still hostile in its tone. If the man was merely insane, how could he have known of Jesus.
