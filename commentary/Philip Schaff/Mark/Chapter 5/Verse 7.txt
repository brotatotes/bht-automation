Mark 5:7. See on Matthew 8:29. Peculiar to Mark is the strong expression:  I adjure thee by God.  The language of the demon, not of the man; not a mere blasphemy, but a plausible argument: ‘We implore thee to deal with us as God Himself does, that is, not to precipitate our final doom, but to prolong the respite which we now enjoy’ (J. A. Alexander). The highest acknowledgment comes from the most virulent demon.
