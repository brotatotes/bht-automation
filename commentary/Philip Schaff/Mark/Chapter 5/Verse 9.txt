<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:9">Mark 5:9</span>. <strong> What is thy name!</strong> Probably addressed to the man, since there would be no special object in finding out the name of the demon, who however answered: <strong> Legion is my name. </strong> Matthew omits this, and Luke abbreviates it. The Latin word ‘legion’ (used also in Greek and rabbinical Hebrew), was applied to a division of the Roman army, numbering from three to six thousand men. But it also denotes, indefinitely, a large number (compare our popular use of the word regiment); so that the answer means: ‘I am a host,’ as the next clause shows: for <strong> we are many.</strong> Luke narrates the fact without putting it in the mouth of the demon. Our Lord had already commanded the demon to come out (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:8">Mark 5:8</span>); the question ‘what is thy name ‘assumed that the command would be obeyed, leaving the man free to answer; but the demons still lingered and one of them, as leader, answered thus, in pride and partial resistance. ‘Legion ‘implies, not a collection, but an organized host (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="col+2:15">Colossians 2:15</span>).
