<p>CHRONOLOGY. These miracles were performed very shortly after the return from the country of the Gadarenes. From Matthew, however (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:18">Mark 9:18</span>), we learn that Jairus came while our Lord was discoursing after the feast at his (Matthew’s) house. The paragraph (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:15-22">Mark 2:15-22</span>), in order of time, should immediately precede this section. Mark’s account of these two miracles is most full and vivid. The peculiarities alone are commented on.
