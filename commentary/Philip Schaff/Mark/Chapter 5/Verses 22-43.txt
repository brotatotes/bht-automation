CHRONOLOGY. These miracles were performed very shortly after the return from the country of the Gadarenes. From Matthew, however (Mark 9:18), we learn that Jairus came while our Lord was discoursing after the feast at his (Matthew’s) house. The paragraph (chap. Mark 2:15-22), in order of time, should immediately precede this section. Mark’s account of these two miracles is most full and vivid. The peculiarities alone are commented on.
