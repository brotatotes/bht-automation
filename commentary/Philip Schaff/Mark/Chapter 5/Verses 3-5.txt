Mark 5:3-5. Mark’s description of the man is most full and striking. Both he and Luke tell in different words that his dwelling was  among, lit., ‘in’  the tombs, a fact only hinted at by Matthew. Peculiar to this narrative is the mention of the fact that  no man could bind him any more; as well as the proof of it from the unsuccessful attempts which had been made (Mark 5:4). The case was probably one of long standing, and repeated efforts had been made to confine him (Luke 8:29.
	 Fetters  were for the feet, chains, for any other part of the body.
	 To tame him,  by any means. The necessity for attempting to tame him was the danger to those passing that way (Matthew 8:28). This untamable demoniac spent his time in self-laceration (Mark 5:5), crying,  night and day, deprived of sleep in all probability, and wandering not only  among the tombs in which he dwelt, but  in the mountains, so common in that district. That he was usually naked is implied here, but stated in Luke only. A fearful picture, agreeing in most points with certain forms of insanity. It cannot be argued from these symptoms that it was merely a case of insanity. The writers who so accurately describe the symptoms, define the malady; their statements must be accepted or rejected as a whole. (See on Matthew 8:34). Mark’s gospel, more fully than any of the others, shows Christ’s power over evil spirits. The power is measured by the difficulty of the case.
