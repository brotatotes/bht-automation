<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:3-5">Mark 5:3-5</span>. Mark’s description of the man is most full and striking. Both he and Luke tell in different words that his dwelling was <strong> among,</strong> lit., ‘in’ <strong> the tombs,</strong> a fact only hinted at by Matthew. Peculiar to this narrative is the mention of the fact that <strong> no man could bind him any more;</strong> as well as the proof of it from the unsuccessful attempts which had been made (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:4">Mark 5:4</span>). The case was probably one of long standing, and repeated efforts had been made to confine him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:29">Luke 8:29</span>.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> To tame him, </strong> by any means. The necessity for attempting to tame him was the danger to those passing that way (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:28">Matthew 8:28</span>). This untamable demoniac spent his time in self-laceration (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:5">Mark 5:5</span>), crying, <strong> night and day,</strong> deprived of sleep in all probability, and wandering not only <strong> among the tombs</strong> in which he dwelt, but <strong> in the mountains,</strong> so common in that district. That he was usually naked is implied here, but stated in Luke only. A fearful picture, agreeing in most points with certain forms of insanity. It cannot be argued from these symptoms that it was merely a case of insanity. The writers who so accurately describe the symptoms, define the malady; their statements must be accepted or rejected as a whole. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:34">Matthew 8:34</span>). Mark’s gospel, more fully than any of the others, shows Christ’s power over evil spirits. The power is measured by the difficulty of the case.
