Mark 6:2.  The sabbath-day. Mark, here as so often, is more specific than Matthew.
	 Many, according to many ancient authorities, ‘the many,’ the multitude of this city.
	 What is the wisdom given unto this man?  This acknowledgement of His wisdom conveys a sneer. More graphic than Matthew’s statement.
	 And such mighty works (or, ‘powers’)  wrought by his hands. We may supply either ‘whence are,’ or ‘what are.’ The latter seems to give the sense of the correct reading. It is plain, from Mark 6:5, that they referred to miracles in other places.
