<p><strong> The daughter of Herodias herself. </strong> Not a common dancing girl, but her own daughter was put to this degrading task, for the accomplishment of her malignant purpose. Some of the best authorities, however, read: ‘his daughter Herodias.’ She was now, in law, his daughter, and thus a member of his own family is made to arouse feelings, which, while sinful in themselves, led him into a crime he did not wish to commit. It should be noted that the opening clause of this verse is joined closely to the first clause of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:21">Mark 6:21</span>, the day having come, the damsel having come in; what intervenes describes the convenient day. The main thought is: <strong> she pleased Herod.</strong> The fact that the whole company was pleased is mentioned by Mark only, who also gives the words of Herod.
