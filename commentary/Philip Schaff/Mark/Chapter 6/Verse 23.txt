<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:23">Mark 6:23</span>. <strong> Unto the half of my kingdom. </strong> The full form of the oath is here preserved. Ahasuerus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="es+7:2">Esther 7:2</span>) made a similar oath to his queen; this was to a girl whose graceful immodesty had pleased the king.
