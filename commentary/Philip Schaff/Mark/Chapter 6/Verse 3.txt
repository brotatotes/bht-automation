Mark 6:3.  The carpenter.  Matthew: ‘the carpenter’s son.’ Our Lord had probably wrought at the trade of Joseph; though the Nazarenes would in any case naturally identify Him with the occupation of His reported father. All Jewish young men learned a trade. The legends and fancies about the infancy of Christ are very foolish; but the Son of man would doubtless share in the primal curse (Genesis 3:19). On the brethren of our Lord, see Matthew, pp. 127 , 128 .
