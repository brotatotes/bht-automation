Mark 6:41. Mark here agrees most closely with Matthew and Luke, while John is less full. The emendations correspond with those in Matthew 14:19.
	 And the two fishes divided he among them all.  In the case of the fish there is no mention made of a distribution through the disciples. The greater detail in regard to the bread was probably due to its higher symbolical meaning. Moreover all did not partake of the fishes; comp. John 6:11. Markâ€™s mention of the division of the fishes is another evidence of the exactness so characteristic of this Gospel.
