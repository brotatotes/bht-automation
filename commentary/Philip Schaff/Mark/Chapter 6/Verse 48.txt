John says they rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs; yet they must have been thus engaged for some time, since it was not until <strong> about the fourth watch of the night</strong> (three to six in the morning) that our Lord appeared.

It seems best to suppose, not that both were going in the same direction, but that their courses crossed, and that, seeing Him go on His path over the sea, they were affected as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:49">Mark 6:49</span> describes. This too will best account for Peter’s loss of courage in the boisterous (contrary) wind. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:30">Matthew 14:30</span>. Lange thinks that this passing on was, as it were, to show them the way, to show that they need no longer toil to meet Him at eastern Bethsaida, but might pass directly over.
