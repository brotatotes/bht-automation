It seems best to suppose, not that both were going in the same direction, but that their courses crossed, and that, seeing Him go on His path over the sea, they were affected as Mark 6:49 describes. This too will best account for Peter’s loss of courage in the boisterous (contrary) wind. See on Matthew 14:30.
