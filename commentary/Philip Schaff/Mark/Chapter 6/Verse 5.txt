Mark 6:5.  And he could there do no mighty work.  His power was not changed. His miracles were not feats of magic, but required two conditions to call them forth: an opportunity and a sufficient moral purpose. ‘Unbelief ‘prevented both. The unbelieving would not come for healing; to heal such would be contrary to His purpose in the miracles, the demonstration of His spiritual power. Hence, He ‘could not’ When men do not believe, they do not give Him the opportunity to save them, and to save the unbelieving is contrary to His purpose, and impossible. The few miracles of healing in Nazareth were of the most usual character; but these too were doubtless according to the faith of the subjects.
