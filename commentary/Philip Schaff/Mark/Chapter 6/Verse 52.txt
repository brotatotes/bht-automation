Mark 6:52.  For they understood not concerning the loaves,  lit, ‘  on the loaves.’ ‘There was no intelligent comprehension  founded on the miracle of the loaves. They did not from the miracle they had seen, infer the power of the Lord over nature’ (Alford).
	 But their heart was hardened. ‘Had been hardened ‘is equally near the meaning. Not in the sense in which we now use these terms, but meaning rather slowness of intellect. Yet there is a tone of censure in the verse. This state of mind was in keeping with their character as portrayed throughout the Gospels, and true to human nature.
