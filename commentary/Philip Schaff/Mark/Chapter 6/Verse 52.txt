<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:52">Mark 6:52</span>. <strong> For they understood not concerning the loaves, </strong> lit, ‘ <em> on</em> the loaves.’ ‘There was no intelligent comprehension <em> founded</em> on the miracle of the loaves. They did not from the miracle they had seen, infer the power of the Lord over nature’ (Alford).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> But their heart was hardened.</strong> ‘Had been hardened ‘is equally near the meaning. Not in the sense in which we now use these terms, but meaning rather slowness of intellect. Yet there is a tone of censure in the verse. This state of mind was in keeping with their character as portrayed throughout the Gospels, and true to human nature.
