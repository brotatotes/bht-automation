Mark 6:53.  Passed over to the land. The correct reading strengthens the view that there was no miraculous sailing, since it distinguishes the passing over to the land, and the coming to Gennesaret. The natural course of things is further apparent from the last phrase: moored there,  i.e.,  came to anchor, or, made fast, possibly ran the boat on shore, although there is nothing in the original answering to the phrase: ‘to the shore,’ of the common version.
