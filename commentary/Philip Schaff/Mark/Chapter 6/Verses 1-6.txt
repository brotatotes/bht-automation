<p>CHRONOLOGY. This visit to Nazareth is the same as that mentioned by Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:54-58">Matthew 13:54-58</span>), but different from that recorded by Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:14-29">Luke 4:14-29</span>). See notes on the former passage. Some other miracles intervened between the raising of Jairusâ€™ daughter and this rejection (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:27-34">Matthew 9:27-34</span>).
