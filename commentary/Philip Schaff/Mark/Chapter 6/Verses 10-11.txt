Mark 6:10-11. See notes on Matthew 10:11-15. Mark, however, adds:  for a testimony unto them  (comp. Matthew 10:18). Luke says, ‘against them.’ This solemn act, which meant a cessation of intercourse, was a testimony to them, and against them also, a token that the truth was still the truth, and their rejection would be a ground of judgment.
