Mark, however, adds: <strong> for a testimony unto them </strong> (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:18">Matthew 10:18</span>). Luke says, ‘against them.’ This solemn act, which meant a cessation of intercourse, was a testimony to them, and against them also, a token that the truth was still the truth, and their rejection would be a ground of judgment.
