<p>MATTHEW prefaces his fuller account by telling of our Lordâ€™s compassion for the multitudes (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:36-38">Matthew 9:36-38</span>). Luke gives a very brief statement (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:1-6">Luke 9:1-6</span>). The <em> choice</em> of the Twelve took place some time before (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:13-19">Mark 3:13-19</span>), within the same year. Mark gives only a portion of the <em> first part</em> of the discourse recorded in Matthew.
