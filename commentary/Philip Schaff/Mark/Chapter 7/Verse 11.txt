Mark 7:11.  Corban. This was the Hebrew word used, which Mark translates into Greek for his Greek readers. Both mean a gift to God. The term ‘Corban’ seems to have included all kinds of offerings, though some think it was applied in the time of Christ only to offerings without a sacrifice. On the whole verse, see Matthew 15:5-6.
