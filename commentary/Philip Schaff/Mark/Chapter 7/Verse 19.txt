Mark 7:19.  Making all meats clean.  The general thought of Mark 7:18-19, is the same as that of Matthew 15:16-17, but besides the fuller form Mark gives, he inserts this new detail. The clause may be joined with ‘draught;’ if then refers to the purifying process, which takes place in the impure matter coming from the body. God having thus provided for a purifying (physical) process, how absurd to make the spiritual condition depend on food, especially upon certain ceremonies connected with it. A grammatical difficulty, however, attends this view. Many therefore consider this an explanation of the Evangelist =  This he saith; making all meats clean. This view is very old, but open to grave objections. The variation in readings is against it, there is no similar instance of interpretation, and it gives an unusual sense to the word ‘purify,’ or ‘make clean.’
