<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:21">Mark 7:21</span>. <strong> For from within, out of the heart of man.</strong> This represents, even more emphatically than the form preserved by Matthew, that the heart of man is ‘the laboratory and fountain-head of all that is good and bad in the inner life of man,’ hence his responsibility, etc. That the body is the seat of sin is here denied. Both materialism and asceticism are opposed. Mark’s catalogue of sins is fuller than that of Matthew. Here, as there, the plural seems to indicate that the sins are common and notorious.
