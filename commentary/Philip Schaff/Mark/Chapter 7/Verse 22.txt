Mark 7:22.  Covetings,  lit., ‘covetousnesses,’ grasping, greedy desires, with the attending peculiarities.
	 Wickednesses. ‘Malignities;’ evil dispositions.
	 Deceit. Fraud, as distinguished from actual theft.
	 Lasciviousness. Sensual excess.
	 An evil eye.  A figure for  envy.
	 Blasphemy. Proud and spiteful anger, manifesting itself in abusive language against God.
	 Pride. Self exaltation, leading to arrogance towards God and man.
	 Foolishness. Senselessness, unreasoning folly, in thought, as well as in the words and acts which result. A fearful catalogue, true to nature still. How well our Lord, the purest of the pure, knew the depths of iniquity from which He would save sinful men!
