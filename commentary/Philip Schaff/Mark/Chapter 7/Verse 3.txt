Mark 7:3.  All the Jews. Pharisaism had the upper hand.
	 Diligently, lit., ‘with the fist’ The two interpretations now most generally adopted are: ( 1 ) Actually ‘with the fist,’ as a peculiar ceremony on such occasions. Probably it was part of the rite, that the washing hand was shut; Because it might have been thought that the open hand engaged in washing would make the other unclean, or be made unclean by it, after having itself been washed’ (Lange.) ( 2 ) ‘Diligently,’ thoroughly, in accordance with a Hebrew expression, which uses the fist as meaning  strength. But Mark is giving an explanation to Gentile readers, and he would hardly use a Hebrew expression. The literal sense is the correct one, but it conveys no meaning to the ordinary reader without a long explanation. The main point is, that the ceremony was formal.
