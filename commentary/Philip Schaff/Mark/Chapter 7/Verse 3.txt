<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:3">Mark 7:3</span>. <strong> All the Jews.</strong> Pharisaism had the upper hand.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Diligently,</strong> lit., ‘with the fist’ The two interpretations now most generally adopted are: ( 1 ) Actually ‘with the fist,’ as a peculiar ceremony on such occasions. Probably it was part of the rite, that the washing hand was shut; Because it might have been thought that the open hand engaged in washing would make the other unclean, or be made unclean by it, after having itself been washed’ (Lange.) ( 2 ) ‘Diligently,’ thoroughly, in accordance with a Hebrew expression, which uses the fist as meaning <em> strength.</em> But Mark is giving an explanation to Gentile readers, and he would hardly use a Hebrew expression. The literal sense is the correct one, but it conveys no meaning to the ordinary reader without a long explanation. The main point is, that the ceremony was formal.
