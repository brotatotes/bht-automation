The history of the last year of our Lordâ€™s ministry begins here. See notes on Matthew 15:1-20. Mark introduces several independent details: the fact that the opposers came from Jerusalem (Mark 7:1), the explanation of the Jewish washings (Mark 7:3-4); but he omits the remarks to the disciples about the Pharisees taking offence (Matthew 15:12-14).
