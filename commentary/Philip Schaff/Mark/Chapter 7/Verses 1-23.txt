<p>The history of the last year of our Lordâ€™s ministry begins here. See notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:1-20">Matthew 15:1-20</span>. Mark introduces several independent details: the fact that the opposers came from Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:1">Mark 7:1</span>), the explanation of the Jewish washings (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:3-4">Mark 7:3-4</span>); but he omits the remarks to the disciples about the Pharisees taking offence (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:12-14">Matthew 15:12-14</span>).
