The coming referred to was probably at the day of Pentecost, or the destruction of Jerusalem, and the consequent triumph of Christianity, as a religion distinct from Judaism (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:28">Matthew 16:28</span>). This would be not simply <em> with </em> power, but <em> in</em> power, <em> i.e.,</em> its principal manifestation would be an exhibition of power.
