Mark 8:14.  In the boat with them more than one loaf. The conversation did not necessarily take place in the boat. When they landed (Matthew) they forgot to supply themselves with provisions for their land journey, although they had brought but one loaf with them in the boat. No stock of provisions was needed for the short voyage.
