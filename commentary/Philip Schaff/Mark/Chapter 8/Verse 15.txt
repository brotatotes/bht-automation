Mark 8:15.  The leaven of Herod. Matthew: ‘of the Sadducees.’ Herod was not a professed Sadducee, but our Lord was warning against what all these had in common. On the alliance of the Pharisees and Herodians, see on chap. Mark 3:6. The one common characteristic of the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Herodians was ‘hypocrisy’ (see on Matthew 16:12), the last named party coquetting with the other two as politicians do, and of course acting hypocritically.
