The reason may have been the unbelief of the place, since the man was particularly commanded not to go back there (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:26">Mark 8:26</span>). The application of saliva came first, then the laying on of hands (which had been requested) which was repeated (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:25">Mark 8:25</span>). Three successive acts instead of the usual word or touch.
