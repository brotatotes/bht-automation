Mark 8:24.  I see the men;  for I behold them as trees walking. The first exclamation is one of joyous surprise: ‘I see the men,’  i.e., the men who were near, the disciples and perhaps the man’s friends. But the cure was not complete, and, as he had been asked to tell what and how he saw, he adds: ‘because as trees,’  i.e., indistinctly, ‘I behold them’ (the men, not trees, as some infer from the common version) ‘walking.’ Perhaps his friends, or even the disciples, were restlessly moving about, awaiting the result. The mention of men and trees suggests that the man had once had his eyesight.
