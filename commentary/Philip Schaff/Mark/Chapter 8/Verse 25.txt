Mark 8:25. See foot-note to text.  He saw clearly (the work of that instant),  and was (thoroughly)  restored;  and he (thenceforward)  saw all things plainly. The last clause represents a continued action. The common reading represents a second trial of vision at our Lord’s command. ‘All things ‘is preferable to ‘every man.’ Of course our Lord  could have healed the man with a word, but He was not confined to one method. The gradual cure would remove the notion of magical influence. There may have been something in the man’s spiritual condition which called for this method to develop his faith. Nor was the mode without an important lesson for the disciples, at this juncture. We need not and ought not to expect Christ’s work of grace to be manifested in all cases through the same experience; a mistake which caused much distress among real Christians, and encouraged hypocrisy. The work of grace, though always wrought by Christ, is often a gradual process, in which other agencies are apparently involved; a protest against the notions, which look for magical power in sacramental forms, or insist upon sudden illumination and joy as a necessary accompaniment of conversion. Comp, the parable (chap. Mark 4:36-39) peculiar to this Gospel. While the man is not represented as active in curing himself he follows Christ, who leads him by the hand, looks up when Christ bids and tells our Lord both of the cure and its imperfection.
