<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:17-20">Mark 8:17-20</span>. The reproofs here given and the references to the miracles, are somewhat fuller than in the parallel passage; the answers of the disciples about the fragments are preserved, the distinction between the two kinds of baskets being kept up. Notice that the last clause of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:18">Mark 8:18</span> should be joined with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:19">Mark 8:19</span>.
