<p>THIS <em> </em> miracle, mentioned by Mark alone, is of peculiar interest, as exhibiting a <em> gradual</em> cure. In this case as in the last miracle (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:32-36">Mark 7:32-36</span>), there was a suggestion from the people as to the mode of healing, a separation from the crowd, a different mode from that suggested, including the application of saliva. The place was undoubtedly Bethsaida Julias on the eastern side of the lake. It is probable that there was no other Bethsaida. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:21">Matthew 11:21</span>.
