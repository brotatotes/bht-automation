<p>SEE notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:13-28">Matthew 16:13-28</span>. Mark omits the <em> blessing</em> bestowed on Peter, and the subsequent <em> promise</em>, but inserts the <em> rebuke</em>. A significant fact, showing the humility of Peter. The reference to the institution of the Church as a separate communion, is also wanting. Hence the <em> Passion of Christ</em> is the central truth, involving the <em> active</em> and <em> passive</em> confession of His people, and not the institution of the Church, much less the primacy of Peter. It is remarkable that this fundamental confession of faith was called forth by our Lord, not in Galilee or Judea, but near Cesarea Philippi (Banias), a Roman settlement on the extreme northern boundary of Palestine.
