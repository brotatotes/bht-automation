SEE notes on Matthew 16:13-28. Mark omits the  blessing bestowed on Peter, and the subsequent  promise, but inserts the  rebuke. A significant fact, showing the humility of Peter. The reference to the institution of the Church as a separate communion, is also wanting. Hence the  Passion of Christ is the central truth, involving the  active and  passive confession of His people, and not the institution of the Church, much less the primacy of Peter. It is remarkable that this fundamental confession of faith was called forth by our Lord, not in Galilee or Judea, but near Cesarea Philippi (Banias), a Roman settlement on the extreme northern boundary of Palestine.
