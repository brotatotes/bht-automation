<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:11">Mark 9:11</span>. The question is the same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:10">Matthew 17:10</span> (see notes there). Three renderings are possible: ‘saying, The scribes say,’ etc., ‘How is it that the scribes,’ etc., ‘Why,’ etc. The last is probably the sense here. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:28">Mark 9:28</span>.
