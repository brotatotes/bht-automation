Mark 9:12. The punctuation is in dispute. The E.V. does not give ‘how ‘its proper meaning. Most later scholars take the first half only as a question:  And how is it written of the Son of  man? then the answer:  That he should suffer, etc. Others take the whole as one question. The next verse shows that the main point is not so much to prove that the Son of man must soon suffer, as that the predicted Elijah had come, and, like the Old Testament. Elijah, had suffered as the Messiah also would, hence that this Elijah was  John the Baptist (Matthew 17:13).
