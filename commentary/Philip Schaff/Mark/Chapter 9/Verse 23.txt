Mark 9:23.  If thou canst! The sense of the passage is: ‘The question is, not what is possible on my part, but on yours.’ The best authorities omit the word ‘believe.’ The man’s words were repeated by our Lord either as a  question; ‘Did you say; if thou canst?’ or as an  exclamation: ‘As to thy words,  if thou canst, all depends upon faith,’ etc.
	 All things are possible, etc. The fundamental law of the kingdom of God. The measure of faith is the measure of our ability, because according to our faith Christ’s power is ours. Christ is the object of faith; faith can only be omnipotent as Christ is omnipotent.
