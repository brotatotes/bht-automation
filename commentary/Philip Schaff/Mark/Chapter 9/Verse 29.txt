Mark 9:29. Matthew’s account is fuller, but the answer here given is to be omitted there.
	 This kind. Probably evil spirits in general. The disciples had cast out evil spirits before, their failure in this case of remarkable malignity was for their admonition.
	 By prayer. On the part of those who would exorcise the demon. The words ‘and fasting’ are to be omitted. Even if retained, they cannot refer, as the sermon on the mount shows, to stated or ceremonial observances, but to proper spiritual discipline, in which fasting (private and personal) holds an important place. Of course nothing is implied about the power to cast out evil spirits and work miracles in later times. The ‘prayer and fasting’ would not work the miracle, but were necessary to sustain the faith which would successfully call upon Christ’s power in such a case.
