<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:38">Mark 9:38</span>. <strong> John said to him</strong>. Luke: ‘answered,’ so the E. V. here also. It was an answer in the wide sense; for the command to receive a child in His name would suggest the question of John. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> We saw</strong>. Probably on their missionary tour. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> One casting out demons in thy name</strong>. This unknown man had wrought such miracles as the Apostles did and by the same power, though it had not been directly committed to him as to them. He was not a follower of Jesus, yet he believed in the power of our Lord sufficiently to attempt this exorcism. The needed power was given him; undoubtedly to teach the lesson here recorded.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> We forbade him</strong>. This forbidding may have so disturbed his faith, that he could no longer exorcise.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Because he followeth not us</strong>. This repetition is characteristic of Mark. They probably demanded that the man should either stop his activity or join them. How natural!
