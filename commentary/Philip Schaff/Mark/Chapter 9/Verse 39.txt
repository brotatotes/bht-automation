<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Be able quickly to speak evil of me </strong> (the word is usually rendered ‘revile’). The use of so strong a word points to a sharp distinction between the two classes: ‘for’ and ‘against us.’ This is a warning against limiting ‘the work of the Spirit of God to any sect, or succession, or outward form of church’ (Alford). The Apostles lost no authority from this exceptional case. The two mistakes have been: either, denying that such exceptions exist; or, regarding these cases as the rule not the exceptions. While the Apostles were taught this lesson in toleration, the man receives only negative praise. There are always earnest Christian laborers who decline to be orderly in their methods. Their irregularity calls for toleration, not approval.
