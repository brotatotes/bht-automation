<p style="margin-left:0.12em;">‘He that is not with me, is against me.’ As regards Christ and His people, there is no neutrality. In certain cases, the absence of hostility is a proof of friendship; in others, the failure to cooperate is the proof of enmity; and both might occur in the experience of the same person. But in all cases there is <em> either friendship or enmity</em>. The apparently contradictory proverbs suggest the need of discrimination in applying them. The saying in Matthew refers more to inward unity with Christ; this one to outward <em> conformity</em> with His people. The former may exist independently of the latter, and its existence unites real Christians, whatever their name and outward differences.
