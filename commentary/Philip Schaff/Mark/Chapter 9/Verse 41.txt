Mark 9:41.  For whosoever shall give you, etc. Comp. Matthew 10:42. Here the lesson is intended directly for the Apostles.
	 In this name that ye are Christ’s, i.e., because ye belong to Christ. It may include a reference to the recognition of Christ’s name on the part of the giver. He always recognizes what is done to His people, but His people are so slow to recognize what is done for Him, if not done by them and in their way!
