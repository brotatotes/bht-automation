<p>Markâ€™s account is most detailed and vivid. He alone mentions the contention with the scribes, the amazement of the people, their running to Jesus. The wretched state of the possessed youth is most vividly represented, and the effect of the presence of Jesus upon him. The description of the interview with the father (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:21-25">Mark 9:21-25</span>) is as valuable as it is touching. The report of the subsequent conversation with the disciples is brief, and no mention is made of the effect upon the people (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:43">Luke 9:43</span>).
