<p>MARK <em> </em> alone tells us that the journey from the mount of Transfiguration to Capernaum was private (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:30">Mark 9:30</span>). The education of the disciples called for this, and the hostility of the Pharisees had in fact closed Galilee against His labors. The incident about the temple-tribute (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:24-27">Matthew 17:24-27</span>) is omitted, probably on account of Peterâ€™s desire not to make himself too prominent in the narrative. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:22">Matthew 17:22</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:14">Matthew 18:14</span>.
