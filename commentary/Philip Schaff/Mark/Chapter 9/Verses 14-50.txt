MARK   alone tells us that the journey from the mount of Transfiguration to Capernaum was private (Mark 9:30). The education of the disciples called for this, and the hostility of the Pharisees had in fact closed Galilee against His labors. The incident about the temple-tribute (Matthew 17:24-27) is omitted, probably on account of Peterâ€™s desire not to make himself too prominent in the narrative. See the notes on Matthew 17:22 to Matthew 18:14.
