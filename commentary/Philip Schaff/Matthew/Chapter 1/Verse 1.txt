Matthew 1:1.  The book of the generation  (or,  birth,  the same word in Greek as in Matthew 1:18). Literally, ‘book of birth, birth-book,’  i.e., pedigree, genealogy. The title of the genealogical table, Matthew 1:1-17, not of the whole Gospel, nor of the first two chapters, nor of chap. 1 . Possibly the title of an original (Hebrew) document, used by the Evangelist.
	 Jesus Christ.  This combination is the Gospel in a nutshell, a declaration that Jesus is the Christ, the promised Messiah, the great truth, which the following narrative is to establish.
	 Jesus.  The human name (Matthew 1:21) = the Hebrew Joshua (comp. Hebrews 4:8) = the Lord is Helper, Saviour (Exodus 24:13; Numbers 13:16; Nehemiah 7:7). Christ = The Messiah, the Anointed One; the official title. Applied to the three officers of the Old Testament theocracy: prophets (1 Kings 19:16), priests (Leviticus 4:3; Leviticus 5:16; Psalms 105:15), and kings ( 1Sa 24:7 ; 1 Samuel 24:11; Psalms 2:2; Daniel 9:25-26). Here all three offices are combined and perfected. Christ is our Anointed Prophet, Priest, and King. That of ‘King ‘was most prominent in the expectations of the Jews.
	 The Son of David.  ‘David the king,’ Matthew 1:6. From him descended One ‘born King of the Jews’ (Matthew 2:2).
	 His Son of Abraham.  The genealogy is traced back thus far, because ‘to Abraham and his seed were the promises made’ (Galatians 2:16). The Epistle to the Galatians shows the connection of the gospel and the covenant with Abraham. ‘Son ‘here is almost = ‘seed’ there; both refer to Christ.
