<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>. <strong> The book of the generation </strong> (or, <em> birth, </em> the same word in Greek as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:18">Matthew 1:18</span>). Literally, ‘book of birth, birth-book,’ <em> i.e.,</em> pedigree, genealogy. The title of the genealogical table, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1-17">Matthew 1:1-17</span>, not of the whole Gospel, nor of the first two chapters, nor of chap. 1 . Possibly the title of an original (Hebrew) document, used by the Evangelist.

<p><strong> Jesus Christ. </strong> This combination is the Gospel in a nutshell, a declaration that Jesus is the Christ, the promised Messiah, the great truth, which the following narrative is to establish.
	</p>
<p><strong> Jesus. </strong> The human name (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>) = the Hebrew Joshua (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:8">Hebrews 4:8</span>) = the Lord is Helper, Saviour (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:13">Exodus 24:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="nu+13:16">Numbers 13:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ne+7:7">Nehemiah 7:7</span>). Christ = The Messiah, the Anointed One; the official title. Applied to the three officers of the Old Testament theocracy: prophets (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:16">1 Kings 19:16</span>), priests (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+4:3">Leviticus 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+5:16">Leviticus 5:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+105:15">Psalms 105:15</span>), and kings ( 1Sa 24:7 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1sa+24:11">1 Samuel 24:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:2">Psalms 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="da+9:25-26">Daniel 9:25-26</span>). Here all three offices are combined and perfected. Christ is our Anointed Prophet, Priest, and King. That of ‘King ‘was most prominent in the expectations of the Jews.
	</p>
<p><strong> The Son of David. </strong> ‘David the king,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:6">Matthew 1:6</span>. From him descended One ‘born King of the Jews’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:2">Matthew 2:2</span>).
	</p>
<p><strong> His Son of Abraham. </strong> The genealogy is traced back thus far, because ‘to Abraham and his seed were the promises made’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:16">Galatians 2:16</span>). The Epistle to the Galatians shows the connection of the gospel and the covenant with Abraham. ‘Son ‘here is almost = ‘seed’ there; both refer to Christ.</p>
