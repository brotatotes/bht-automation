The succeeding list cannot be verified, although we meet with the names of Salathiel (Shealtiel), Zerrubbabel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ezr+3:2">Ezra 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ne+12:1">Nehemiah 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="hag+1:1">Haggai 1:1</span>) in the Old Testament. ‘In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ch+3:19">1 Chronicles 3:19</span>, Zerubbabel is said to have been the son of Pedaiah, brother of Salathiel.
