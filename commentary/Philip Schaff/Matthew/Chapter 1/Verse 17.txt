Matthew 1:17.  Fourteen generations.  There were exactly fourteen generations from Abraham to David; the two other series are made to correspond. But to make out the second and third series, one name must be counted twice. We prefer to repeat that of David, and close the second series with Josiah, since Jeconiah and his brethren are only indefinitely included in it; the third then begins with Jeconiah and ends with Christ. Thus: Abraham
	Isaac
	Jacob
	Judah
	Pharez
	Hezron
	Ram
	Amminadab
	Nahshon
	Salmon
	Boaz
	Obed
	Jesse
	David David
	Solomon
	Rehoboam
	Abijah
	Asa
	Jehoshaphat
	Joram
	Uzziah
	Jotham
	Ahaz
	Hezekiah
	Manasseh
	Amon
	Josiah Jeconiah
	Shealtiel
	Zerrubbabel
	Abiud
	Eliakim
	Azor
	Sadoc
	Achim
	Eliud
	Eleazar
	Matthan
	Jacob
	Joseph
	JESUS Meyer counts Jeconiah twice, since he belongs to the period before and during the Captivity. Others, with less reason, repeat the name of Josiah; others make no repetition, but reckon the third series from Shealtiel to Christ, including the name of Mary, which seems forced.
	In a nation where few books and records existed, such genealogical tables would be put into a form easy to be remembered. Hence, the omissions and the divisions which cover the three periods of Israelitish history. The numbers here involved, two, three, and seven, had a symbolical significance among the Jews, but this symbolism is not the prominent reason for the arrangement. It has been noticed that the forty-two generations correspond with the forty-two years of the wandering in the wilderness. Thus Jesus is the sacred heir of the ancient world; as heir of the blessing, the Prophet of the world; as heir of the sufferings entailed by the curse, its atoning High Priest; as heir of the promise, its King.
