<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:18">Matthew 1:18</span>. <strong> The birth of Jesus Christ. </strong> Same word as <strong> </strong> in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span> (‘generation’). Here it means ‘origin.’ The more usual word implies a ‘begetting’; the choice of this word indicates something peculiar in this birth, as does the form: ‘Abraham begat Isaac,’ etc., etc.; ‘the birth of Jesus Christ, however, was in this wise.’ ‘For,’ in the next clause, implies: there is need of a <strong> </strong> particular account, for the circumstances were peculiar. The best critics, however, omit the word.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Of the Holy Ghost. </strong> A statement of fact, not a part of the discovery, or Joseph would not have been perplexed. The Third Person of the Trinity is meant. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:35">Luke 1:35</span>. ‘Conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary,’ is an article not only in our Apostles’ creed, but in nearly all other creeds of the ancient Church. On the other hand, neither the Scriptures nor the early Church know anything of the supernatural, immaculate conception of Mary. Christ is the sole, the absolute exception to the universal rule of sinfulness; a miracle in history.</p>
