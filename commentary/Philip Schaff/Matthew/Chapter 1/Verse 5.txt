<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:5">Matthew 1:5</span>. <strong> Rahab. </strong> Another heathen woman, a sinner also. Undoubtedly the woman of Jericho (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jos+2:1">Joshua 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jos+6:23">Joshua 6:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jos+6:25">Joshua 6:25</span>). But by heroic faith she rose above her degradation.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Ruth. </strong> Still another heathen woman; though personally not criminal, to her also a stain attached according to the Jewish law. The book which bears her name and tells her story is a charming episode of domestic virtue and happiness in the anarchical period of the Judges, when might was right. Its position in the canon is a recognition of the working of Godâ€™s grace outside of Israel, and a prophecy of the calling of the Gentiles. Compare the record in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ru+4:18-22">Ruth 4:18-22</span>. The long interval between the taking of Jericho and the birth of David ( 366 years according to Ussher), has led to the supposition that some names are omitted here, as is certainly the case in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:8-11">Matthew 1:8-11</span>. But Rahab was probably young at the time Jericho was taken, Boaz old at the time of his marriage, and David was the youngest son of an old man.
