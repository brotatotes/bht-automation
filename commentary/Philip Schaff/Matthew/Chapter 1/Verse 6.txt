<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:6">Matthew 1:6</span>. <strong> David the king. </strong> Emphatic as the culminating name of an ascending series. Even here <strong> </strong> pride is humbled; the wife of a heathen is mentioned, David’s partner in the deepest guilt of his life, but also in his most profound penitence (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:0">Psalms 51:0</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The wife of Uriah. </strong> ‘Her that had been <strong> </strong> the wife’ seems to gloss over the guilt.</p>
