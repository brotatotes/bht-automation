Matthew 1:6.  David the king.  Emphatic as the culminating name of an ascending series. Even here   pride is humbled; the wife of a heathen is mentioned, David’s partner in the deepest guilt of his life, but also in his most profound penitence (Psalms 51:0).
	 The wife of Uriah.  ‘Her that had been   the wife’ seems to gloss over the guilt.
