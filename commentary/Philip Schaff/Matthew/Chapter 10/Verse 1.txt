They are now sent out as ‘laborers.’ Henceforward they are ‘Apostles’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:2">Matthew 10:2</span> <em> ),</em> with a definite mission; first to heal, as Christ did, by the <strong> authority </strong> He gave them, so as to attest the truth of the message they bore respecting Christ and His teachings. The number <em> twelve</em> ( 3 × 4 ) has been considered a symbol of the Trinity ( 3 ) indwelling in the world ( 4 ). See Lange’s Com. <em> Matthew</em>, p. 183 .
