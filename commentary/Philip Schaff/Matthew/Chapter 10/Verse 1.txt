Matthew 10:1.  And he called unto him his twelve disciples.  There is here an indication that they had been previously chosen. They are now sent out as ‘laborers.’ Henceforward they are ‘Apostles’ (Matthew 10:2  ), with a definite mission; first to heal, as Christ did, by the  authority  He gave them, so as to attest the truth of the message they bore respecting Christ and His teachings. The number  twelve ( 3 × 4 ) has been considered a symbol of the Trinity ( 3 ) indwelling in the world ( 4 ). See Lange’s Com.  Matthew, p. 183 .
