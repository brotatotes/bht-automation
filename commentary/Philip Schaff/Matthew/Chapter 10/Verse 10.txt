Matthew 10:10.  No wallet.  They need provide neither money nor baggage.
	 Two coats,  two inner garments or tunics.
	 Nor shoes.  This either means a second pair, or that they should wear their ordinary sandals without waiting to get a pair of walking shoes. The latter is preferable, since we should read next, a   staff.   ‘Staves’ was inserted to avoid a seeming conflict with Mark 6:8. The meaning really is: they need not provide a staff especially for this journey, but take the one they had. They were to be free from care, not seeking any profit from their office; outwardly unburdened, inwardly carrying the greatest treasures. Without money or luggage they would be most free from care,  for the workman is worthy of his meat  (or ‘sustenance.’) Those who ‘freely received’ from them are expected in their turn to ‘freely give.’ These verses in their literal sense apply only to that particular journey, the principle, ‘the workman is worthy of his meat,’ remains always in force. Matthew 10:8, in forbidding the spirit of covetousness in the ministry, shows that the preaching of the gospel should not become a mere livelihood; this verse shows that the laborers should be without worldly care. Those among whom they labor should so provide for them as to prevent care; the extent of the provision to be regulated by the mode of living of those who provide it.
