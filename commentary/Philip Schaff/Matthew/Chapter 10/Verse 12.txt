Matthew 10:12.  The house.  ‘The house’ they might enter, whether it was the house of one really worthy was to be tested. But whether worthy or not they were to salute it. Conformity to proper social customs, without official pride, with an immediate and friendly recognition of the expected hospitality, irrespective of the worthiness or unworthiness of the host.
