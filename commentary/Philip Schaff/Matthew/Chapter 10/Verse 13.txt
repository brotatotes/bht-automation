Matthew 10:13.  And if the house be worthy,   i.e., of your stay. The worthiness of the house is dependent on the worthiness of its head. In its nature, whatever exceptions there may be, the family is to be regarded as a spiritual unit.
	 Let your peace come upon it.  The usual Eastern salutation meant: ‘Peace be to you.’ In the case of worthiness the Lord will ratify your salutation which includes a wish for the highest prosperity. Salutations are not necessarily unmeaning forms; nor should Christians make them such.
	 Let your peace return to you.  ‘Be content with having brought a blessing on yourselves by showing such a spirit and obeying my express command’ (J. A. Alexander). It is implied in Matthew 10:14 that they should have no further fellowship with such households. The ‘angels unawares’ would thus be driven away.
