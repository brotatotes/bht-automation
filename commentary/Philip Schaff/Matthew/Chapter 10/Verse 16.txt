<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:16">Matthew 10:16</span>. <strong> Behold, </strong> as usual, marking a new thought.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> I send you forth. </strong> ‘I’ emphatic; I <strong> </strong> who know what awaits you, send you into these trials, but as my ‘Apostles,’ with my authority and promise and support.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> As sheep in the midst of wolves. </strong> Contrary to the order of nature, the meek and defenceless are sent among the fierce and cruel, their natural enemies. The spiritual strength He had imparted prevented the discouragement likely to arise from this revelation of the thorough hostility of the world. Only His sheep can successfully encounter wolves.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Be, </strong> or ‘become,’ <strong> ye therefore wise as serpents, and simple</strong> <strong> as doves. </strong> Like serpents, cautious in avoiding danger; like doves, in simplicity of motive (rather than in harmlessness). Wisdom to avoid persecution without cowardice, simplicity to encounter it without compromise. The spirit of Christ alone can combine these apparently antagonistic qualities of serpents and doves.
