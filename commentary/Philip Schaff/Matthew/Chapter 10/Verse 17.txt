Matthew 10:17.  But beware of men,  i.e., ‘wolves.’ Men in general will be hostile and weak. To ‘beware’ they must be ‘wise.’ Not needless suspicion but prudent discernment.
	 Councils.  The regular local courts, which tried for heresy. The sentence they pronounced was executed in the  synagogues.  Literally fulfilled in Apostolic times, yet in all ages church courts have been apt to persecute. Human nature is selfish and intolerant, and slow to learn the lesson of mercy and charity.
