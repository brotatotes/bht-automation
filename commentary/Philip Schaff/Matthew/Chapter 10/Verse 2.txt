<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:2">Matthew 10:2</span>. <strong> Apostles, </strong> those sent out; the name was given when they were chosen (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13">Luke 6:13</span>), but was strictly applicable only after the occurrence here mentioned. On its fuller meaning see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:2">Acts 1:2</span> ff. Matthew mentions the Twelve in pairs, and it is probable that they were thus joined when sent out two by two (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:7">Mark 6:7</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The first, Simon, who is called Peter. </strong> ‘First’ in all the lists; ‘first’ to confess the Messiahship of Christ, usually ‘first’ to speak both before and after the death of Christ. He was not the first to follow Christ; Andrew and John preceded him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:37">John 1:37</span> ff.), <strong> </strong> nor the first one called, since Philip was called long before him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:43">John 1:43</span>). In all bodies of men, one must be first although ‘first among equals.’ Peter was therefore <em> personally</em>, not officially, ‘the first.’ As regards the <em> primacy</em> of <em> Peter</em>, all that can be admitted as historically proven, is a primacy of honor and influence, but without supremacy <em> of </em> jurisdiction. See chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15-18">John 21:15-18</span>. His character constituted him a leader, but he neither claimed nor possessed this position as one of office or rank. ‘Simon’ means ‘hearing,’ ‘answer’; on the name ‘Peter’ comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Andrew his brother. </strong> The name is probably derived from, or related to, a Greek word, meaning ‘manly.’ He was the first (with John) to follow the Lord, and was called with his brother (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:18">Matthew 4:18</span> ff.)
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> James the son of Zebedee. </strong> The same name as ‘Jacob,’ and naturally common among the Jews. This one, usually called James the Elder, to distinguish him from the other James (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:3">Matthew 10:3</span>), was the first of the Twelve to suffer martyrdom (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:2">Acts 12:2</span>), as <strong> John his brother </strong> was the last survivor (on the name see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:1">Matthew 3:1</span>). The two brothers were called ‘Boanerges,’ according to Mark. John is generally considered the type of an affectionate character, as he was the bosom friend of the Lord. Tradition says he was the youngest of the Twelve. The name of their mother was Salome, as we learn from comparing <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:56">Matthew 27:56</span> with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:40">Mark 15:40</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:25">John 19:25</span> it is probable that the sister of the mother of Jesus refers to Salome; if so, these two brothers were cousins of our Lord.
