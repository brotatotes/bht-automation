Matthew 10:22.  And ye shall be hated by all.  ‘All’ other than believers, referred to in ‘ye.’ This hatred toward Christ will spread over the world like an infectious fever or pestilence.
	 For my name’s sake.  The Christianity of Christians, not their errors or personal faults, will call forth this hatred. The latter may be the pretext, yet the world has hated most those whom it was forced to respect and admire most.
	 He that endureth,  or ‘shall have endured,’  i.e., in his confession of Christ.
	 To the end.  In the case of individual believers, to the end of life, but primarily with a literal reference to great epochs; in this case, to the destruction of Jerusalem.
	 Shall be saved.  Literally fulfilled in the escape of the Christians from that doomed city, but with a wider application, and higher fulfilment, in the everlasting salvation. Perseverance to the end, however bitter, is the evidence of genuine faith.
