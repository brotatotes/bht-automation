Matthew 10:25.  If they have called;  as they had already done (see chap. Matthew 9:34; comp. chap. Matthew 12:24).
	 Beelzebub,  more correctly ‘Beelzebul.’ The former (‘lord of flies’) was the name of a Philistine idol. ‘Beelzebul’ means either, ( 1 ) ‘lord of dung,’ the word being changed from Beelzebub to Beelzebul to admit of this contemptuous sense; or ( 2 ) ‘lord of the habitation.’ The latter corresponds better with the expression, ‘master of the house.’ Satan is referred to, but with a special reference to the indwelling of evil spirits in man; Satan being their lord. This view agrees with the allusions to a ‘house’ in connection with the casting out of devils, in chap. Matthew 12:25; Matthew 12:29; Matthew 12:44-45.
