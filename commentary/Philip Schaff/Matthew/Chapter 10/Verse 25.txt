<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> Beelzebub, </strong> more correctly ‘Beelzebul.’ The former (‘lord of flies’) was the name of a Philistine idol. ‘Beelzebul’ means either, ( 1 ) ‘lord of dung,’ the word being changed from Beelzebub to Beelzebul to admit of this contemptuous sense; or ( 2 ) ‘lord of the habitation.’ The latter corresponds better with the expression, ‘master of the house.’ Satan is referred to, but with a special reference to the indwelling of evil spirits in man; Satan being their lord. This view agrees with the allusions to a ‘house’ in connection with the casting out of devils, in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:25">Matthew 12:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:29">Matthew 12:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:44-45">Matthew 12:44-45</span>.
