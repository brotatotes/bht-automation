Matthew 10:26.  Fear them not therefore,  because of the relation to Christ, who will certainly triumph. Another reason follows:  for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed.  A proverbial statement, occurring with a different application in Luke 12:2; in a different connection, but with the same general application in Mark 4:22; Luke 8:18. This clause refers to God’s dealing; the next,  and hid, that shall not be known,  to man’s conduct in regard to what is revealed. The course of thought is: God designs to reveal His truth (‘there is nothing covered,’ etc.). You are the agents in doing so, be bold therefore, for however you or others may hide it, there is nothing ‘hid that shall not be known.’ The injunction: ‘fear not’ has then a double support; fear not, for it is your duty as my servants to proclaim the truth; fear not, for however men treat it, your Master will set things in the true light. A subordinate thought is: Beware of hypocrisy and holding back of the truth; which will be detected hereafter.
