Matthew 10:30.  The very hairs of your head.  The most special providence, and the most absolute preservation. No part of our life, of what characterizes or adorns it, shall be lost. God, to be God, must know the very hairs of our head. The word ‘your’ is emphatic, asserting a special care for Christ’s disciples: ‘Of you the hairs of the head are all numbered.’ This refers to all who truly   confess Christ (Matthew 10:32).
