Matthew 10:31.  Fear ye not therefore.  In Matthew 10:25 the motive was drawn from the relation to Christ, here   from the relation to God:  ye are of more value,   i.e., in the sight of God, who is ‘your Father’ (Matthew 10:29). ‘The humblest of God’s creatures have their value in His sight: how much more human beings. Especially Christians, but above all, the witnesses of Jesus.’
	 The scope of Matthew 10:25-31 is: A right sense of our immortality consists in the feeling that we are perfectly safe in the keeping of our Father; let us then not fear men, but boldly and fully proclaim the truth we have from our Master who also suffered from men.
