Matthew 10:35. A quotation (or reminiscence) from Micah 7:6, which contains the same general thought of wars and sorrows ushering in the kingdom of peace. The sword shall enter into the family. The conversion of individual members to Christ will cause variance. Domestic peace, the highest earthly peace, is thus disturbed by peace with God through Christ. It is supposed that the terms: a man   (  i.e., ‘a son’ in this case),  a daughter, a daughter in law  (or ‘bride’), refer to those converted, ‘because the younger members and the female members of households were commonly the first to embrace the gospel,’ and because Christ speaks of these as ‘set’ by Himself.
	 Matthew 10:36, from the same prophecy, is a more general statement of the same thought.
	 A man’s foes.  The idea here expressed is the reverse of that stated in Matthew 10:21.
