<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:37">Matthew 10:37</span>. <strong> </strong> He that loveth, etc. Not to love these less, but Christ more. Connection: Love to Christ may divide family ties, but is superior to family affection; because it is a love and devotion due only to a Divine being. This claim to supreme love, if made by others, would be extreme madness or intolerable presumption; from the God-man it seems natural.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Not worthy of me. </strong> No one is worthy of Christ; but the love Christ gives creates the love Christ claims, and is the reward for all the trials and self-sacrifices here spoken of. Hence the saying is not harsh, though deemed ‘hard.’
