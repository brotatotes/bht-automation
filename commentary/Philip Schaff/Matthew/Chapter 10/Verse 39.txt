Matthew 10:39.  He that findeth his life, shall lose  (or ‘destroy’)  it,  etc. ‘Life’ is here used in two senses; otherwise the paradoxical statement would have no meaning at all. (Comp. chap. Matthew 16:25-26.) In both clauses it means, in the first instance, the outward, earthly life, with all its pleasures and comforts; and in the second (‘it’) the inward, spiritual life, beginning here in faith, and to be perfected in heaven. This is the climax, in setting forth Christ as the supreme object of our affection. It is not said, that we must lose the one life in order to gain the other; nor that each one is called to make the sacrifice literally. The meaning is: Christ must be loved more than life itself, or, ‘he that gains or saves his earthly life, saving it by unfaithfulness, shall lose his heavenly life; but he that loses his temporal life by faithfulness, shall find eternal life.’ The standard is not too high. He gave His life  for us, and therefore asks us to give our lives  for Him;   He gives His life  to us, so that we can give our lives both  to and  for Him.
