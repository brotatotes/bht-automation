<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:4">Matthew 10:4</span>. <strong> Simon the Cananæan. </strong> Not ‘Canaanite.’ If a local term at all, it means ‘an inhabitant of Cana’; but it is probably derived from the Hebrew, and is the same as ‘Zelotes’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:15">Luke 6:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:13">Acts 1:13</span>). The <em> Zealots</em> were a sect of strict Jews, who afterwards became fierce fanatics. They were apt to take the law into their own hands, to punish offences against the Jewish law. This Apostle has also been considered one of our Lord’s ‘brethren,’ but ‘Simon’ was a very common name (eight persons, at least, of this name are mentioned in the New Testament). These three are joined together in all four lists of the Apostles, but there is no other hint of relationship.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Judas Iscariot, </strong> <em> i.e.,</em> ‘a man of Kerioth,’ in the tribe of Judah (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jos+15:25">Joshua 15:25</span>). He was not, like all the rest, a Galilean.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Who also betrayed, </strong> or, <strong> delivered him up. </strong> The choice of this man remains a part of the great mystery concerning God’s sovereignty and man’s free choice. He is generally supposed to have been by nature the most gifted of the Twelve; but it is a mistake to suppose that the Twelve as a body were poor, ignorant, or dull. They had fair natural abilities, a teachable disposition, and the common religious education; some had been in the preparatory school of the Baptist; Peter and John were men of genius, especially the latter, as his Gospel abundantly proves; John possessed a house in Jerusalem, and was connected with the family of the high-priest. All were unsophisticated, simple-hearted, open to conviction, and fit vessels to be filled with the saving knowledge of Christ.
