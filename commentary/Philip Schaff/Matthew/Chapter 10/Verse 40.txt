<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:40">Matthew 10:40</span>. H <strong> e that receiveth you, receiveth me. </strong> The concluding verses convey one appropriate thought, similar to that of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:24-25">Matthew 10:24-25</span>: Christ’s disciples are identified with Him. Notwithstanding all the opposition and sundering of family ties, just set forth, Christ’s people carry true peace with them, bearing Him and His blessing to all who receive them. The reception is not merely a welcome of the disciples to the house, but of their message to the heart. The language is not entirely figurative. Those who welcome the men, are most apt to welcome the truth they bear, and thus the Master they represent.
