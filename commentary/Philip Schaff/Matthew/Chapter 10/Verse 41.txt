Matthew 10:41.  In the name of a prophet,   i.e., ‘because he is a prophet,’ the original implying an inward impulse of love toward the object. The prophet may be unworthy, but the love and the regard arise from the relation to Christ implied in his office.
	 A righteous  man  i.e., a Christian, one righteous through and in Christ; the usual meaning among Christians when this Gospel was written.
	 Shall receive a prophet’s reward  a righteous man’s reward.  The reward they receive (not the reward they can give) on the principle of identification through love.
