Matthew 10:42.  One of these little ones.  Either the disciples, or children, who were present. The former is preferable. An allusion to their weakness in themselves as they went out on their mission.
	 A cup of cold water only.  The smallest kindness.
	 In the name of a disciple,  ‘because he is a disciple,’ out of love to Christ His master.
	 Verily I say unto you.  A solemn declaration that for such an act,  he shall in no wise, lose his reward.  Not as before, the reward a disciple receives, but a reward due to himself, measured, not by our estimate of the act, but by God’s. In His sight it may be more worthy than the great benefactions which the world applauds. Thus those who went out to persecution, to cast a sword into the world, to be hated of all, and holding loosely to their lives for Christ’s sake, bestowed blessings by their very presence, and He who numbered the hairs of their head, treasured up every act and look of kindness given them for their Master’s sake.
