Matthew 10:7.  And as ye go preach,  proclaim, announce. The matter of their preaching was the approach of the  kingdom of heaven  (comp. Matthew 3:2; Matthew 4:17). Their mission was preparatory; the gospel tells of a kingdom already come. As yet   they were not instructed to proclaim the King, but were sent rather to announce the kingdom (Matthew 10:7), ‘to teach men its nature, and to prove it at hand by their miracles. If men had faith in the words of the Apostles, they would soon come to Jesus to be taught by Him.’ (Andrews.)
