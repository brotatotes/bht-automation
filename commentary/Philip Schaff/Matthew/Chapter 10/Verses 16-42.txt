Peculiar to Matthew, though some of the sayings occur in the other Gospels. As such trials and emergencies did not occur on this journey, some suppose this part of the discourse was uttered at a later period. But Matthew, himself an Apostle, would be most likely to give the whole discourse. The Twelve alone were prepared for so early a revelation about persecution; yet this section is more universally applicable than the Matthew 10:5-15. No satisfactory analysis can be given; the whole is a series of alternate warnings and comforts. Trials await them in the world (Matthew 10:16-18; no care about their defence (Matthew 10:19-20); the intensity of persecution, with the promise to those who endure (Matthew 10:21-22); then with a twofold reference, flight in persecution, with the accompanying promise (Matthew 10:23); the disciples will only suffer as Christ has done before them (Matthew 10:24-25); holy boldness and candor enjoined, since we should not be afraid of men, but fear God, who is our protecting father (Matthew 10:26-31); as we confess or deny, He confesses or denies us (Matthew 10:32-33). The opposition is further set forth by the declaration that not peace but a sword is the result of the gospel in the world; so that it divides even the family (Matthew 10:34-36); but Christ demands a love beyond that for the family (Matthew 10:37), that for life itself (Matthew 10:38-39); and yet despite this opposition His servants bring Him to those who receive them, and the reward of reception is a corresponding one (Matthew 10:40-42).
