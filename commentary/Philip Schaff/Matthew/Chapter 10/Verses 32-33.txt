<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Confess me, </strong> lit, ‘confess in me.’ A peculiar mode of expression, meaning: ‘shall make me the object of his acknowledgment among and before men.’ The idea of being ‘in Christ,’ in vital union with Him, is also implied. Confession is the first act of faith; but confessing Christ must not be confounded with confessing a particular creed about Christ framed by men.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Him will I also confess. </strong> ‘I’ emphatic; Christ is the Supreme Judge, even in the presence of His heavenly Father, where He is the Advocate of His people (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>).

Alford: ‘The Lord will not confess the confessing Judas, nor deny the denying Peter; the traitor who denied Him in acts is denied. The Apostle who confessed Him even to death will be confessed.’ We ‘confess’ Christ by every genuine and earnest testimony for Him; we deny Him by every unchristian deed.
