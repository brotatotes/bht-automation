<p>THE FIRST PREACHING OF THE TWELVE. The locality from which the Twelve were sent out, and the length of their tour are unknown. But Galilee, where our Lord had Himself labored so long, was doubtless the scene of this first mission, which probably covered some time. The instruction given, though directly applicable to the Twelve on that occasion, ‘may be taken as the type of all the commissions given by Christ to His servants.’ (Lange.) We divide the discourse into two sections. The second one is peculiar to Matthew, and more general in its character. The present one was more immediately applicable to the first preaching tour.
