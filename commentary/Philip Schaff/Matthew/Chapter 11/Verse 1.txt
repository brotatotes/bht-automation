<p>Peculiar to Matthew, though some of the sayings occur in the other Gospels. As such trials and emergencies did not occur on this journey, some suppose this part of the discourse was uttered at a later period. But Matthew, himself an Apostle, would be most likely to give the whole discourse. The Twelve alone were prepared for so early a revelation about persecution; yet this section is more universally applicable than the <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:5-15">Matthew 10:5-15</span>. No satisfactory analysis can be given; the whole is a series of alternate warnings and comforts. Trials await them in the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:16-18">Matthew 10:16-18</span>; no care about their defence (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:19-20">Matthew 10:19-20</span>); the intensity of persecution, with the promise to those who endure (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:21-22">Matthew 10:21-22</span>); then with a twofold reference, flight in persecution, with the accompanying promise (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:23">Matthew 10:23</span>); the disciples will only suffer as Christ has done before them (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:24-25">Matthew 10:24-25</span>); holy boldness and candor enjoined, since we should not be afraid of men, but fear God, who is our protecting father (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:26-31">Matthew 10:26-31</span>); as we confess or deny, He confesses or denies us (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:32-33">Matthew 10:32-33</span>). The opposition is further set forth by the declaration that not peace but a sword is the result of the gospel in the world; so that it divides even the family (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:34-36">Matthew 10:34-36</span>); but Christ demands a love beyond that for the family (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:37">Matthew 10:37</span>), that for life itself (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:38-39">Matthew 10:38-39</span>); and yet despite this opposition His servants bring Him to those who receive them, and the reward of reception is a corresponding one (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:40-42">Matthew 10:40-42</span>).
