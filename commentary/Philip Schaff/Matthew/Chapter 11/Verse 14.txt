Matthew 11:14.  And if ye are willing to receive it.  The Jews expected that Elijah would rise from the dead, hence many would not receive it. The popular notions on the whole subject of prophecy were incorrect; for in the day of fulfilment our Lord thus prefaces an explanation.
	 He is Elijah,  etc. Malachi 4:5, applied to John before his birth by the angel Gabriel (Luke 1:17). Not the entire fulfilment of the prophecy, for John himself (John 1:21) said he was not Elijah, and our Lord afterwards intimated that another coming of Elijah is to be expected (Matthew 17:11).
