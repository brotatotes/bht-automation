<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:15">Matthew 11:15</span>. <strong> He that hath ears to hear, </strong> etc. This usually follows an important statement, intimating that he who has the discernment to understand will find the deeper meaning. Here it suggests: Christ meant more than that John was Elijah, that he Himself was the Messiah. Then, as now, properly to understand the Scriptures was to know Christ. The comparison which follows intimates that few would ‘receive’ the truth respecting John, or have ‘ears to hear’ the glad news of the Messiah’s presence. If John wished our Lord to declare Himself, his wish was granted, but the revelation was, as always, only to those who really sought to know Christ.
