Matthew 11:17. One set of children is represented as having invited another set to play, first in a mock wedding and then in a mock funeral, but the latter would not join them. Explanations: ( 1 ) The children calling, represent John and Jesus, but these two earnest preachers would not be likened to idling, petulant children, and in that case the ‘mourning’ ought to precede the ‘piping.’ ( 2 ) Those who will not play represent the two preachers, but this is opposed to the word ‘fellows’ or ‘companions’ in Matthew 11:16, as well as to the parallel passage in Luke (Luke 7:32), where the children are spoken of as ‘calling to one another.’ All the children were petulant. ( 3 ) The simplest view: The whole company of children represent the Jews, engaged in the childish pursuits of amusement and showing disagreement, discontent, and petulance. With these ‘children’ the children of wisdom are contrasted (Luke).
