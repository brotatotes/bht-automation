	</p>
<p><strong> Chorazin. </strong> Mentioned only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:13">Luke 10:13</span>. Probably identical with the ruins of Kerazeh.

<p><strong> Bethsaida. </strong> A city of Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:21">John 12:21</span>); the home of Peter, of Andrew, and of Philip (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:44">John 1:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:21">John 12:21</span>). Mark mentions the name twice (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45">Mark 6:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:22">Mark 8:22</span>). In one instance the reference to a place on the eastern shore is obvious. Views: ( 1 ) The ancient view: but one place, namely, on the western shore. This involved difficulty in explaining <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45">Mark 6:45</span>. ( 2 ) The usual modem view: two places, namely, ‘Bethsaida of Galilee’ on the western shore; ‘Bethsaida Julias’ on the eastern shore. ( 3 ) The latest and best view: One place situated at the northern end of the lake on both sides of the inlet, hence partly in Galilee, and yet on the site of Bethsaida Julias and the eastern shore of the lake. So Dr. Thomson. See notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45">Mark 6:45</span>.

<p><strong> Tyre and Sidon. </strong> Ancient Gentile cities in existence at that time, The corruption of these places had been spoken of ages before by the prophets.

<p><strong> They would have repented. </strong> Our Lord claims knowledge of contingent spiritual events.
	</p>
<p><strong> Long ago. </strong> Either, the cities would have changed their character in ages past, or the present inhabitants would have repented speedily.

<p><strong> In sackcloth and ashes. </strong> The symbol of mourning and repentance (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jon+3:5-9">Jonah 3:5-9</span>, on the repentance of Nineveh). The costume of mourners resembled a sack with holes for the arms, and it was usual to strew ashes upon the head.
