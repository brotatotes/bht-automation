<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:23">Matthew 11:23</span>. <strong> Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? </strong> The correct reading is a question anticipating a negative answer: Nay, thou shalt go down, etc. The place, as the centre of our Lord’s activity, enjoyed special privileges. In wealth Capernaum could not be compared with Sodom; its lofty situation is uncertain, hence a reference to this is doubtful.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Shalt go down unto hell, </strong> or <strong> Hades, </strong> the ‘place of the dead,’ not the place of future punishment. A figure of spiritual destitution and desolation, as ‘heaven’ represented privilege. Nothing positive about ‘Hades’ can be inferred from this verse, though it certainly hints at a disembodied state between death and the resurrection, which differs from ‘hell,’ where both ‘soul and body’ are punished (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:28">Matthew 10:28</span>). Temporal judgments have been linked with the spiritual degradation here predicted; the very sites of these cities are disputed.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Sodom </strong> (compare its history in Genesis, chaps, 13 - 19 ) was the synonym for wickedness.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Remained until this day. </strong> As it was the oldest city of importance in Palestine, the language is the more striking.
