<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>. <strong> All things, </strong> whether of judgment or salvation, of hiding or revealing.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> were delivered unto me by my Father. </strong> ‘All things were by the Father brought into connection with, and subordination to the economy instituted by Christ.’ His power as King extends over both, the lost and saved.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And no one knoweth the Son but the Father, </strong> etc. This great mystery of Christ’s power over all things rests upon the greatest of mysteries, the person of Christ, the Son, as related to the Father, a mystery thoroughly known (as the Greek word means) only to the two parties, the Father and the Son.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal it. </strong> The Son is the Revealer of this mystery, and about it all revelation centres, not only written revelation, but the revelation made to our hearts. This verse, the genuineness of which is not disputed, contradicts the notion that the view of the Person of Christ presented in the fourth Gospel is different from that of the three others. To know God men need a revelation from this lowly Saviour. The same pride still refuses it. John the Baptist had said this of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:35">John 3:35</span>), and now Christ says it Himself in a discourse which began in a defence of the Baptist.
