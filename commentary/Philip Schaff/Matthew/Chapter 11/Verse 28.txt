Matthew 11:28.  Come unto me.  Christ now shows first of all His  willingness (comp. Matthew 11:27) in this invitation.
	 All ye that labour,  etc., ‘all the laboring and the burdened.’ A figurative description of men seeking to become holy by external acts of righteousness. The immediate reference is to the Jews struggling to obtain deliverance through the law, and oppressed by the yoke placed upon them by the Pharisaical interpretation of it. It is applicable to all men as subject to misery, actively and passively; but most directly to those conscious of sin, striving to make themselves better, or sinking under a sense of their guilt
	 And  I  will give you rest.  ‘I’ is emphatic; other teachers lay burdens on you, I am  able, as well as willing, to end your useless labor and remove the crushing burden.
