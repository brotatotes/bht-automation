Matthew 11:29.  Take my yoke upon you.  The Jews called the law a ‘  yoke.’ Our Lord here refers to His rule, doctrine, and leadership.
	 And learn of me.  Either, take pattern from me, or as the context suggests, become my disciples.
	 For I am meek and lowly in heart,  not in appearance merely, as the scribes. Humility is the first requisite in learning of God. The ‘meek and lowly’ One can teach us this first lesson. The lowliness seems the greater from the language of Matthew 11:27.
	 And ye shall find rest unto your souls.  Rest of soul is the true aim; we must seek it, and seek it from Christ ‘Man is made for Christ, and his heart is without rest, until it rests in Him.’
