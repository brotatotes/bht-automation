Matthew 11:3.  Art thou he that cometh,   i.e., the Messiah,  or do we look for another.  Explanations: ( 1 ) John was temporarily in depression and doubt, respecting the slow and unostentatious mode of Christ’s manifestation, and the true nature of his kingdom. ( 2 ) John’s disciples (not himself) were in doubt, and he sent them to be instructed; the opinion of some of the Fathers. This saves John’s orthodoxy at the expense of his morality. There is no more evidence of doubt in their case than in that of John. Besides the answer was addressed to John. ( 3 ) John was prompted by impatient zeal, and wished to call forth from Jesus a public declaration of His Messiahship. But this would have been even worse than doubt. ( 4 ) John wished to learn with certainty whether this worker of miracles was the one he had baptized. This is opposed by the phrase ‘works of the Christ’ (Matthew 11:2). The first view is preferable. The Bible does not represent the saints as free from imperfection and doubt. Elijah, the prototype of John, had his season of despondency. John was at least disappointed, and may have sent this message, hoping for something to strengthen his own faith, hoping perhaps that he would be set free to see the coming of the kingdom of heaven, and that judgment would come upon the wicked ruler and court from whom he suffered; and yet doubting because these hopes had not been realized long before.
