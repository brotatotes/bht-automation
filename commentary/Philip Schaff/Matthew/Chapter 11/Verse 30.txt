<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:30">Matthew 11:30</span>. <strong> For my yoke is easy </strong> (wholesome) <strong> and my burden is light. </strong> The ‘yoke’ answers to those ‘laboring;’ the ‘burden’ to those ‘heavy laden.’ Christ does not promise freedom from labor and burdens, but promises that we shall be so changed as to find them ‘wholesome’ and light. Christ indeed demands a righteousness exceeding that of the Scribes and Pharisees, and teaches us that there is a depth of meaning in the law, which our consciences did not perceive; yet. He says that His yoke, His requirements, are wholesome, and His burden, <strong> </strong> oftentimes a cross, is light! One who goes to Christ to find rest for his soul, obtains from Him peace of conscience and power to obey. We go to Him as a teacher meek and lowly in heart; the first lesson learned is, to humbly and penitently take from Him what we need. What He has done <em> for us</em> secures pardon, what He does <em> in us</em> gives power. The Teacher of the highest morality could only fulfil these promises by becoming an actual Saviour from sin; that He can and will save is the ground tone of the whole passage. Saved by Him, indeed, as Augustine says, the yoke is like the plumage of the bird, an easy weight enabling it to soar heavenward.
