Matthew 11:5.  The blind receive their sight,  or ‘see again.’ The word means this when applied to the blind. In other cases, ‘to look up.’
	 The dead are raised up.  The raising of the daughter of Jairus probably took place afterwards, but the miracle in Nain certainly preceded.
	 The poor have the gospel preached to them.  The ‘poor’ in spirit are included. This is the climax. Spiritual deliverance was the greatest miracle. The answer (comp. Isaiah 35:5; Isaiah 61:1) means: ‘I do great things in physical healing, but my greatest work is the spiritual healing I bring: do not then expect some wonderful temporal victory, but be content with the thought that I as Messiah am doing my appropriate and most glorious work.’ The reference to the Old Testament prophecy would give John both testimony and instruction. Even our Lord answers doubt out of the Scriptures.
