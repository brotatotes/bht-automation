INTRODUCTORY NOTE. The sending out of the Twelve probably called into open manifestation the opposition of the Pharisees: hence Matthew groups the events indicating this hostility, without regard to chronological order. The Twelve were not sent forth until after the period covered by chaps. 11 - 13 . The account of the message from John precedes, because the course of conduct which aroused hostility in the Pharisees had awakened hesitation on the part of John (or at least of his disciples).
