This section is a continuation of the preceding discourse. The comparison between the children of ‘this generation’ and ‘wisdom’ which is justified by her works, is, on the one hand, sharpened into a declaration of judgment against the unrepentant cities He had visited, and, on the other, expanded into a thanksgiving, a declaration of His own exalted position, and a tender invitation. The connection with what precedes is obvious, and also the relation of the two parts. The thoughts of Matthew 11:21-24 were uttered again at the sending out of the Seventy (Luke 10:12-15). The authoritative tone of Matthew 11:21-24, declaration of what would have taken place, the positive statement of what will occur at the judgment, form a contrast to the tenderness of Matthew 11:25-30. But both parts coincide with our Lord’s character of holy love. The authority to invite involves the authority to denounce; the willingness to bless implies the curse of those who would not be blessed; the praise of the Father’s good pleasure befits the Son who reveals Him.
	Lessons: In the sight of Christ, one rejecting Him in the midst of light is worse than a heathen; offers of grace and threats of judgment are proportionate; faithful preaching makes the faithless hearer more guilty; pride hardens even more than impurity. The thought of persistent sin leads our Lord to His Father, yet in thanksgiving; ‘So it was well-pleasing,’ the comfort of God’s adopted children, taught them by the Only Begotten; the authority of the Son the security for our rest in Him; the declaration of His ability to bless followed by a declaration of His willingness (see further on the verses).
