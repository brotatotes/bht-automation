Matthew 12:12.  How much, then, is a man better than a sheep?  Some take this as an explanation: ‘Of how much more worth now is a man than a sheep!’ But it is better to regard it as a question. Our Lord recognizes the superiority of man, as well as the superior claims of humanity.
	 Wherefore it is lawful,  etc. (Comp. Mark and Luke.) Works of  mercy on the Sabbath are lawful and right. Hypocrites care more for ceremonies than for their cattle, and more for their cattle than for suffering humanity.
