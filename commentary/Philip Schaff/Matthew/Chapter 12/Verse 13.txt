<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:13">Matthew 12:13</span>. Mark tells us, that ‘they held their peace,’ and both he and Luke describe our Lord as looking round upon them (with anger and grief). The manner in which the healing took place gave no legal ground for a charge on account of His actions. He did not touch the man, or even command: be healed, but simply said: <strong> Stretch forth thine hand. </strong> The man had no power to do this, and as in the case of spiritual healing, the act of stretching forth was both the effect and the evidence of Divine power. The man’s faith was manifest in his attempt to obey, and that too in the midst of such an assembly. His act was a defiance of them, and yet it was not a forbidden act, so that they could not accuse either the Healer or the healed.
