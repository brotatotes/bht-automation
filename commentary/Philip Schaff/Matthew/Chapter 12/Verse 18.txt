Matthew 12:18.  Behold my servant.  The Greek word means both ‘son’ and ‘servant’ Christ as Messiah was obedient as a ‘servant’ and dear as a ‘Son.’ The latter thought comes into prominence in the next clause:  my beloved,  etc. Comp, the accounts of the baptism (chap. Matthew 3:17) and the transfiguration (chap. Matthew 17:5). On the former occasion there was a direct fulfilment of the words:  I will put my Spirit upon him He shall proclaim judgment to the Gentiles; announce the final judgment to the Gentiles, presenting Himself as the  Judge. Many from Gentile regions were present at the time just spoken of (Mark 3:8). Some understand the clause as a prediction that the gospel (‘judgment’) should be preached to the Gentiles. But this is not exact, and obscures the contrast in the prophecy. The Messiah is the Judge and yet meek.
