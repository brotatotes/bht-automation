Matthew 12:19.  He shall not strive, nor cry,  etc. Not a combatant nor a noisy declaimer in public places, but meek and retiring. (Those who refer ‘judgment’ to the gospel, take this verse as descriptive of the means by which it was to be extended.) There is also a contrast with ‘victory’ in Matthew 12:20. He presents Himself as Judge and yet is meek; He is meek, does not strive, and yet shall be victor. The lessons are obvious.
