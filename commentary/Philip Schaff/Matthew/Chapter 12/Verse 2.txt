Matthew 12:2.  But when the Pharisees saw it.  They were lying in wait for something as a ground of opposition.
	 They said unto him.  Luke represents the objection as made to the disciples, both were probably addressed.
	 That which it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.  It was lawful on other days, all admitted; but the Pharisees claimed it was not lawful on the Sabbath. Plucking grain on the Sabbath was construed by the Rabbins into a kind of harvesting. This departure from their formal legalism was magnified by the Pharisees into a breaking of Godâ€™s law.
