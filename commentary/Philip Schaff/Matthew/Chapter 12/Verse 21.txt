<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> On the ground of what His name, as the Messiah, implies. Those to whom He presented Himself as Judge would learn to trust Him in consequence of the gentle, patient dealing just spoken of, and more fully brought out in the original prophecy. Matthew here omits part of a verse in Isaiah and paraphrases the part he retains, but without any important variation in sense.
