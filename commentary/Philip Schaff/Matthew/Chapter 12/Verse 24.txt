<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:24">Matthew 12:24</span>. <strong> But when the Pharisees heard it. </strong> According to Luke, some who were present; according to Mark, ‘the scribes which came down from Jerusalem,’ probably sent to spy out his actions. A public declaration of war against our Lord on the part of the Pharisees, and an answer to the question of the people (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:23">Matthew 12:23</span>). The Pharisees admit the miracles, but explain them in another way as the work of Satan. Consistency required this explanation.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> This man. </strong> ‘This fellow’ is too strong. ‘This,’ in the question of the people, was an expression of surprise; the word is here taken up and turned against Jesus.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> But by Beelzebub, the prince of demons.</strong> The word ‘devil,’ is applied to but one person in the Scriptures, namely, Satan. On the word ‘Beelzebub,’ see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:25">Matthew 10:25</span>. The sense ‘lord of dung,’ implies coarse wit. The sense: lord of the habitation, referring to rule over the possessed, agrees well with the phrase here added: ‘the prince of demons.’ ‘By,’ literally ‘in,’ <em> i.e.,</em> in intimate fellowship.
