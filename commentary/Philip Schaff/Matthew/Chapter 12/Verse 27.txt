<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Therefore they shall be your judges. </strong> They shall convict you of partiality. The argument is valid, whether the Jewish exorcists cured or only pretended to do so. It is probable they did exercise some influence; though to no great extent, else the wonder at Christ’s power would not have been so great. Our Lord does not hint at any imposture; in every age there has been something analogous and inexplicable, <em> e. g., </em> the Egyptian sorcerers. The existence of ‘demoniacs’ in those days, is proof that supernatural power, <em> of itself</em> is no test of truth.
