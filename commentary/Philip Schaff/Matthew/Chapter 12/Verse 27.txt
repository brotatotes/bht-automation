Matthew 12:27.  By whom do your sons,   i.e., disciples,  cast them out? ‘If casting out devils is an evidence of a league with Satan, then this holds good against your scholars who profess to do it also.’
	 Therefore they shall be your judges.  They shall convict you of partiality. The argument is valid, whether the Jewish exorcists cured or only pretended to do so. It is probable they did exercise some influence; though to no great extent, else the wonder at Christ’s power would not have been so great. Our Lord does not hint at any imposture; in every age there has been something analogous and inexplicable,  e. g.,  the Egyptian sorcerers. The existence of ‘demoniacs’ in those days, is proof that supernatural power,  of itself is no test of truth.
