Matthew 12:28.  By the Spirit of God,   i.e., in union with the Spirit of God. The contrast with ‘Beelzebub’ points to a ‘Person,’ not an influence. The alternative raised by the Pharisees is accepted, namely, such works of power are done either by God or Satan. Then having proved the absurdity of the latter explanation, our Lord declares that the agent is ‘the Spirit of God.’
	 Then the kingdom of God is come upon you.  ‘The kingdom you profess to be waiting for, has come upon you suddenly, before you expected it, in spite of your opposition to me.’ An assertion, that His power was not only Divine, but sufficient to prove Him the expected Messiah. This strong charge against them grows directly out of the falsity of theirs against Him.
