Matthew 12:30.  He that is not with me.  The opposition between the kingdom of Christ and the kingdom of Satan is absolute; it is impossible to be neutral. ‘Neutrality’ is often the worst ‘hostility.’ Since these two opposing kingdoms exist, all moral beings must belong to one or the other. Our Lord has proved that He is the stronger, that He is the Messiah, working miracles by the Spirit of God; the alternative is therefore presented in a new form:  Christ or  Satan. The Pharisees decided for Satan, and were consistent in their opposition. Sentimental admirers of Christ are simply inconsistent enemies.
