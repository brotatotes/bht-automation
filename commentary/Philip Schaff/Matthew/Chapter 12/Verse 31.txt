Matthew 12:31. Our Lord, who knew the thoughts of His opposers, now explains the awful meaning of their enmity.
	 Therefore I say unto you.  A revelation on the authority of Christ.
	 Every sin and blasphemy.  Every sin up to and including blasphemy, with the exception afterwards mentioned. ‘Blasphemy,’ the worst form of sin: it is malicious evil-speaking against God. Even this may be forgiven if repented of.
	 But the blasphemy against the Spirit.  The one exception. ‘The Spirit,’ of course, means the ‘Spirit of God’ (Matthew 12:28). See next verse.
