<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:31">Matthew 12:31</span>. Our Lord, who knew the thoughts of His opposers, now explains the awful meaning of their enmity.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Therefore I say unto you. </strong> A revelation on the authority of Christ.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Every sin and blasphemy. </strong> Every sin up to and including blasphemy, with the exception afterwards mentioned. ‘Blasphemy,’ the worst form of sin: it is malicious evil-speaking against God. Even this may be forgiven if repented of.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> But the blasphemy against the Spirit. </strong> The one exception. ‘The Spirit,’ of course, means the ‘Spirit of God’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:28">Matthew 12:28</span>). See next verse.
