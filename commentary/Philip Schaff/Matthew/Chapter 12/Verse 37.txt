<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:37">Matthew 12:37</span>. <strong> For by thy words thou shalt be justified, </strong> declared righteous, acquitted, not made righteous. The word never has the latter sense in the New Testament. The index of character will be the words, not hypocritical ones, although even these speedily reveal their true character, but those coming from the heart (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:34-35">Matthew 12:34-35</span>). ‘By’ here points to the true source. This general principle, tar exceeding ‘the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees,’ concludes this discourse. Its awful statements challenge every one: Are you with Christ or against Him; do your words, coming from the heart, confess or deny Him.
