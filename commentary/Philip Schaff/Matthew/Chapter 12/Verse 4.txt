Matthew 12:4.  The house of God.  The tabernacle at Nob.
	 The shew-bread.  Twelve loaves were placed in rows upon a table in the holy place, as a symbol of the communion of God with men. They were renewed every seven days, on the Sabbath, the old loaves being eaten by the priests. David probably came on the day the old loaves were taken away,  i.e., on the Sabbath; which makes the case very appropriate. David did what was actually forbidden, yet hunger was a sufficient justification, much more might the constructive transgression of the disciples be justified by their hunger. Principle: Works of  necessity have always been permitted on the Sabbath.
