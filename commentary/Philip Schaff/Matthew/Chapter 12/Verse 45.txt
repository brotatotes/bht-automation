Matthew 12:45.  Then,  seeing this inviting residence.
	 Seven other spirits,  etc. To be understood indefinitely, of a more complete and terrible possession; there being no resistance to their entrance.
	 And the last state of that man is worse than the first.  Possibly a reference to some well-known case; but the whole is applied directly to the Jews:  Thus shall it be also unto this wicked generation.  Explanations: 1 . The  specific application to the Jews. The first possession, the early idolatrous tendency of the Jews; the going out, the result of the captivity in Babylon; the emptying, sweeping, and garnishing at their return (Pharisaism, a seeming reformation, but really an invitation to evil influences); the last state, the terrible and infatuated condition of the Jews after they had rejected Christ 2 .  General application to the Jews. ‘A process of deterioration, with occasional vicissitudes and fluctuations, but resulting in a state far worse than any that had gone before it’ (J. A. Alexander). Both are true; the former is probably the primary reference. 3 . Application to the history of Christianity. The Reformation, the casting out of the first evil spirit of idolatry, permitted by Rome, the house ‘empty, swept, and garnished: swept and garnished by the decencies of civilization and discoveries of secular knowledge, but empty of living and earnest faith’ (Alford); the repossession, the final development of the man of sin. 4 . An application to individuals; external reformation without permanent spiritual results, leading to a ‘worse state.’
