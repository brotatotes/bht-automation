<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Stood, </strong> ‘or were standing,’ <strong> without. </strong> Either outside the crowd or the house; it is not certain that He was in a house. They remained there unsuccessfully (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:19">Luke 8:19</span>), <strong> seeking to speak with him. </strong> A sufficient motive should be looked for. It was probably affectionate solicitude for His safety (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:21">Mark 3:21</span>), in consequence of the open rupture with the Pharisees; also for His health, since He had not time to eat (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:20">Mark 3:20</span>). It is uncertain whether His friends really thought He was beside Himself or only said so to screen Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:21">Mark 3:21</span>). They probably did not doubt Him, but mistook their duty, and adopted a worldly policy, which though natural and prompted by genuine affection deserved the rebuke here implied. In any case the faith of Mary His mother must have grown stronger before the crucifixion. Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:27-28">Luke 11:27-28</span>) places immediately after the discourse just narrated, the exclamation of a woman, referring to His mother (‘Blessed is the womb,’ etc.),as if <strong> </strong> Mary’s presence had occasioned it. The response there recorded is similar in character to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:50">Matthew 12:50</span> of this chapter.
