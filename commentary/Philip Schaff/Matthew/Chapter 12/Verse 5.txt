Matthew 12:5.  The priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are blameless?  Peculiar to Matthew. On the Sabbath the priests must change the shewbread, and offer double offerings. That construction of the law which condemned His disciples, would condemn this as a profanation, yet the priests were blameless. Works of  necessity on the Sabbath are not only permitted, but may become a  duty (see Matthew 12:6).
