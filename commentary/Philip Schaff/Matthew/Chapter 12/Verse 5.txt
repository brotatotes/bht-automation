<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:5">Matthew 12:5</span>. <strong> The priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are blameless? </strong> Peculiar to Matthew. On the Sabbath the priests must change the shewbread, and offer double offerings. That construction of the law which condemned His disciples, would condemn this as a profanation, yet the priests were blameless. Works of <em> necessity</em> on the Sabbath are not only permitted, but may become a <em> duty</em> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:6">Matthew 12:6</span>).
