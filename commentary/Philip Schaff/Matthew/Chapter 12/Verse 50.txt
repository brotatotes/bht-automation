Matthew 12:50.  For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven.  Mere profession of discipleship does not entitle to such a position. Our Lord does not say how we are enabled to do the will of His heavenly Father, but makes such a result the criterion.
	 He is my brother, and sister, and mother.  The term ‘father’ is excluded; His ‘Father’ is ‘in heaven.’ Our Lord loved His relatives, but all whom He teaches (‘His disciples’) and saves (‘do the will of my Father’), whosoever they are, stand equally near Him. Christ loves His people with a love  human  as well as Divine; there can be no closer relationship to Him than that of real discipleship which manifests itself in this obedience to His Heavenly Father. Christ was ‘the Son of man’ as well as ‘the Son of Mary,’ identified with humanity in one sense, even more than with her. Those who have not seen Jesus on earth, are here assured of His presence and affection in a way that should be a constant stimulant to holiness. Brethren of Christ are brethren to each other. The dearest and best of friends and relatives, so often needlessly anxious about us, have no claims upon us superior to our duties to the gospel of the Kingdom.
