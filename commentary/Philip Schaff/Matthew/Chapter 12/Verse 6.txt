Matthew 12:6.  That which is greater,  not some one greater; the comparison with the temple occasions this form, although the reference is undoubtedly to Christ Himself. Argument: If the priests in the temple are authorized to profane the Sabbath (according to your view of what that means) in the performance of necessary duties, how much more can One who is the real temple of God on earth authorize His followers to do so; or, if the former are blameless, so are these who have grown hungry in following Him who is greater than the temple. This ‘meek and lowly’ Teacher asserts this on His own authority. Works of  necessity become a  duty on the Sabbath only when so declared by Christ, or as we follow Christ.
