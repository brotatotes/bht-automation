<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> I will have mercy, </strong> etc. Quoted before (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:13">Matthew 9:13</span>), from <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:6">Hosea 6:6</span>. Our Lord properly censures them, after defending his disciples. They did not recognize this greater temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:6">Matthew 12:6</span>), nor accept the service which God had approved; ‘mercy and not sacrifice,’ had they done so, they <strong> would not have condemned the blameless </strong> (the same word as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:5">Matthew 12:5</span>).
