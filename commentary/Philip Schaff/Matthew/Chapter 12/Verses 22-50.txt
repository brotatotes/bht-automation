<p><strong> INTRODUCTORY NOTE. </strong> These occurrences seem to have followed each other in immediate succession. Luke places the last one (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:46-50">Matthew 12:46-50</span>) after the parable of the sower, but Mark gives the same order as Matthew, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:46">Matthew 12:46</span> is more definite as to time than Luke’s account, and that occurrence was more likely to have been occasioned by the events here placed before it. The time was immediately after the events narrated in chap. 11 ; the occurrences intervening between this and the retirement just recorded, being the <em> choice</em> of the Twelve; the Sermon on the Mount, the healing of the centurion’s servant (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:5-13">Matthew 8:5-13</span>), the message of John (chap. 11 ); and some occurrences mentioned by Luke only (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:36">Luke 7:36</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:3">Luke 8:3</span>). The position serves to indicate the growing and bolder hostility of the Pharisees, which was answered by the bold and startling words of our Lord, awakening the anxiety for His safety among His relatives, which led to the interruption and discussion of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:46-50">Matthew 12:46-50</span>. Our Lord’s stay in Galilee after this was neither continuous nor successful, for except the mission of the Twelve, little occurred there save repeated rejection and retirement. Acceptance or rejection must follow such a presentation of Himself as Jesus here makes.
