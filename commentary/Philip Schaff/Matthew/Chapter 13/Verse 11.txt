The mysteriousness arises mainly from the sinful state of man; yet God for wise purposes often withholds the revelation without which these things remain ‘mysteries.’ The great mystery is Christ Himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>), making peace between <strong> </strong> God and man, between man and man (Jew and Gentile; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:4-11">Ephesians 3:4-11</span>). This was not fully revealed to the Apostles until long after the death of Christ, although they already had clearer views than the mass of the people. Where this gospel mystery has been preached, sin alone hides it from men; however much may remain not fully revealed to us.
