<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> For whosoever hath. </strong> Applied more generally in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:29">Matthew 25:29</span>. A rule of Godâ€™s dealings with men, holding good even in the lower forms of creation; here to be applied to knowledge of spiritual things. The phrase: <strong> from him shall be taken away that which he hath, </strong> points to a seeming or supposed knowledge. This twofold result is not arbitrary, but a necessary development, akin to what we perceive in every form of growth. To the disciples, with a desire for spiritual knowledge, an interpretation was <em> given</em>, and their knowledge grew through the outward and inward revelation; the people, without this desire, did not hear the interpretation, consequently they had less and less spiritual apprehension of the truth they possessed as Jews, since they got further away from Christ who alone fulfilled and explained that truth.
