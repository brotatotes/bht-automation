<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:15">Matthew 13:15</span>. <strong> For this people’s heart. </strong> A more exact quotation, but changed into a prediction.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Waxed gross, </strong> become fat, carnal, losing its spiritual life.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Their eyes they have closed</strong>; a persistent course of action. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Lest haply. </strong> What they would not do, was what they at length could not do. The result of their own doings fulfilled God’s righteous judicial purpose, but the blame was theirs. The parables themselves betokened the existence of this state of things both as a result and as a punishment.
