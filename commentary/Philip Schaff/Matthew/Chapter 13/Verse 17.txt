<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:17">Matthew 13:17</span>. <strong> That many prophets, </strong> etc. Over against the responsibility of the ignorant (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:13-15">Matthew 13:13-15</span>), prominence is given to the great and unmerited privilege of the disciples. They were permitted to see and know what had been denied even to inspired and good men who longed for such knowledge.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Desired to see those things which ye behold </strong> (a stronger word, meaning ‘to gaze upon’), <strong> and did not see them. </strong> The privilege of the disciples exceeded not only the privilege but even the desire of these good men of former times. Hence all was of grace.
