Matthew 13:18.  Hear ye therefore.  ‘Hear, in your hearts, ye who are so highly favored, the true meaning of these parables.’ Our Lord’s explanation is to guide us in the interpretation of other parables. He does not say: it teaches this general principle, nor does He give a significance to all the objects and actions which may be linked with sowing in a grain-field.
