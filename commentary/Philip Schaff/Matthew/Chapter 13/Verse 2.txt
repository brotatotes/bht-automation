Comp, the previous occasion (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:9">Mark 3:9</span>), when ‘he spake to his disciples that a small boat should wait on him, because of the crowd, lest they should throng him.’ The people <strong> stood on the shore, </strong> in order to hear Him. From the boat, the first four parables were spoken; the other three, to the disciples in the house.
