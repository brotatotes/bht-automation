Matthew 13:2.  Great multitudes.  Comp. Mark 4:1; Luke 7:4  .
	 A boat.  Comp, the previous occasion (Mark 3:9), when ‘he spake to his disciples that a small boat should wait on him, because of the crowd, lest they should throng him.’ The people  stood on the shore,  in order to hear Him. From the boat, the first four parables were spoken; the other three, to the disciples in the house.
