<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Endureth for a while. </strong> The expression implies also: ‘is the creature of circumstances.’
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Tribulation, </strong> afflictions; <strong> persecution, </strong> a special form of affliction; all arising <strong> because of the word, </strong> and intended to strengthen, as the sunshine the plant; but the plant without root is withered.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Forthwith </strong> (as in the reception of the word) <strong> he is offended, </strong> or ‘taketh offence and falleth.’ Sentimental, superficial, changeful, one-sided professors of Christianity. The parable does not decide whether such have really been subjects of grace.
