Matthew 13:21.  Yet hath he not root in himself.  His apparent Christian life is rooted only in the temporary excitement about him.
	 Endureth for a while.  The expression implies also: ‘is the creature of circumstances.’
	 Tribulation,  afflictions;  persecution,  a special form of affliction; all arising  because of the word,  and intended to strengthen, as the sunshine the plant; but the plant without root is withered.
	 Forthwith  (as in the reception of the word)  he is offended,  or ‘taketh offence and falleth.’ Sentimental, superficial, changeful, one-sided professors of Christianity. The parable does not decide whether such have really been subjects of grace.
