<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The care of the world, </strong> not pure worldliness, which belongs to the first class, but anxieties about worldly things distracting persons of serious mind.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The deceitfulness of riches. </strong> Whether in the pursuit or possession of wealth. A false expectation or a false confidence in regard to wealth will <strong> choke the word. </strong> Mark adds: ‘the lusts of other things,’ other than those presented by the word.
