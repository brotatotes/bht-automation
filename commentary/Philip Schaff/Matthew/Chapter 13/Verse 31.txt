Matthew 13:31. A  third parable, also from agricultural  experience.  A grain of  mustard-seed.  The plant grows wild, but was often found in the gardens of the Jews. In the fertile soil of Palestine it reached the height of several feet ‘A grain of mustard seed’ was the proverbial expression for the smallest thing conceivable (comp. chap. Matthew 17:20; Matthew 17:20).
	 Took. Probably a hint that the small seed must be taken up carefully or it would be lost.
