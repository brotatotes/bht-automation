Matthew 13:32.  Less than all seeds, i.e., those sown by the Jews.
	 Greater than the herbs. The literal meaning leaves it uncertain whether the plant referred to was itself an herb. The main point is the rapid growth from a diminutive seed.
	 The birds of the heaven represent the external adherents of the kingdom, nations nominally Christian; oftentimes ‘outward church form,’ since the kingdom itself is not the Church organization.
	 Lodge in the branches thereof. Seeking shelter and remaining there. The permanent external adhesion is thus indicated.
