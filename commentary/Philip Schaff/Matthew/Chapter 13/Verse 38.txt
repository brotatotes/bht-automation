<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:38">Matthew 13:38</span>. <strong> The field is the world. </strong> ‘His field’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:24">Matthew 13:24</span>), hence some would limit this to the Church. But in that case the parable would not differ from the last of the series. The phrase can only mean the Church, as the Church is seeking to occupy the whole world. The gospel is good seed to be scattered everywhere; the intertwining of the roots suggests that the tares are <em> in</em> the Church also, as indeed <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:41">Matthew 13:41</span> plainly implies.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The sons of the kingdom the sons of the evil one.</strong> The reference is to persons, who represent and embody the two opposing influences and developments. In the world, and in the Church both as an organized body and as engaged in its missionary enterprises, there exist side by side two such classes; those made heirs of Christ’s kingdom by Divine sowing and those who are of the seed of the serpent.
