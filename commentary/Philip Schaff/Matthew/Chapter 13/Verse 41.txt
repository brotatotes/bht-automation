	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Out of His kingdom.</strong> The angels sent forth by Christ will accomplish what men could not do, ought not to attempt to do, namely, remove all evil from the Church and from the world, which will stand only so long as the purpose of the kingdom requires it. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> All stumbling-blocks</strong>, lit., ‘scandals.’ As punishment is spoken of, this must refer to persons, those who cause others to fall </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And them that do iniquity.</strong> This class includes the former and yet more. How long this gathering out will continue is not stated.
