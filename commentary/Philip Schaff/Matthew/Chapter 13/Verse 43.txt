Matthew 13:43.  Then shall the righteous shine forth.  The gospel tells how men become ‘righteous.’ As such they have a glory, a light which is here obscured, but shall then burst forth, as Christ’s glory shall appear.
	 In the kingdom of their Father. The righteous being God’s adopted sons, He is ‘their Father.’ This kingdom of final glory seems to be distinguished from the mediatorial kingdom of Christ spoken of throughout the chapter; comp. 1 Corinthians 15:24.
	 He that hath ears, etc. This conclusion befits the importance of the parable. The prophecy respecting the destiny of all men deserves the attention of all men. Yet even on this point many have no ears to hear.
