Matthew 13:44.  A treasure hidden in the field. It is; possible, but not probable, that our Lord refers to some case of ‘treasure trove,’ which had lately occurred.  In his joy. Natural to those who find unexpectedly. The legality or morality of the transaction does not enter into the discussion; the man who had made this discovery used all the means in his power to possess himself of the treasure. This suggests the general application and lesson. Notice: He obtained the ‘treasure,’ worth more than he could pay, and also ‘the field,’ which he could buy. In this result the parable differs from the next. Many, therefore, refer ‘the field’ to the external Church, in which a man may, as it were, stumble on the treasure of true religion; he naturally possesses himself also of the means of grace, the external forms of the Church.
	 We may aptly apply it historically to the days of the Reformation, when true religion was sought and obtained at the cost of everything; the discovery of the treasure was apparently accidental, and great joy attended it. The field was doctrinal theology. In this, the treasure had been hidden, but the reformers obtained this also as a possession.
