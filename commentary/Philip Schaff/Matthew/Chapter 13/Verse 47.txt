Matthew 13:47.  A net, that was cast into the sea. A drag-net or seine is meant. Appropriate for an audience largely made up of fishermen. The parable resembles that of the tares; that, however, represented the two developments of good and evil, side by side in the world (and in the church); this one is applicable rather to the missionary effort of the Church. ‘The sea’ is a Scriptural figure for ‘the nations’ (Revelation 17:15; Isaiah 8:7; Psalms 65:7). Gathered of every kind. This predicted result of Christian effort is sufficiently evident at all times.
