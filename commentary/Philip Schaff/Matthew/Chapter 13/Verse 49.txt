Matthew 13:49.  Sever the wicked from among the just.  Comp. Matthew 13:41. The phrase ‘sitting down,’ in Matthew 13:48, and other minor points in the two parables, suggest that this may occupy a period of some length. In the parable of the tares, however, the final separating process accounts for the command: ‘Let both grow together till the harvest;’ here it is the main point. That parable emphasized the existence with evil side by side with good; this, the separation and destruction of the evil.
