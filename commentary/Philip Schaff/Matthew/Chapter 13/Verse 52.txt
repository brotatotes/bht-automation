<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Bringeth forth out of his treasure.</strong> The ‘treasure’ is a constantly increasing knowledge of God’s word, in the Bible, in nature, in experience. This he must use to instruct others; he must not selfishly conceal it, nor so set it forth that few can understand it.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Things new and old.</strong> Explanations: ( 1 ) the law and the gospel; ( 2 .) things hitherto unknown and those already known; ( 3 .) the old truths in new lights, new truths brought into proper accord with the old ones. This is preferable. He who forgets the old, will get hold of novelties, but bring few new things out of his treasure; he who forgets the new, will find that his old methods have become antiquated even to himself, and others will discover it even sooner. Christ’s methods of instruction give point to these words, for the old familiar occupations are here used to illustrate the truths of the new kingdom, and yet the thoughts and yet even words of the Old Testament appear again and again throughout.
