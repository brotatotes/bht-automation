<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:55">Matthew 13:55</span>. <strong> The carpenter’s son.</strong> The word rendered ‘carpenter’ <strong> </strong> is sometimes applied to artisans in general, but it means strictly a worker in wood.

On the brothers of our Lord, see the close of the section.
