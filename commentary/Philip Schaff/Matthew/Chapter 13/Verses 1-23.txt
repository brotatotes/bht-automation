The occasion (Matthew 13:1); the scene (Matthew 13:2); the first parable (Matthew 13:3-9); the question of the disciples (Matthew 13:10); the twofold answer; ( 1 ) why He taught in parables (Matthew 13:11-17); ( 2 ) what He taught in this parable (Matthew 13:18-23). The parable which begins the discourse refers primarily to the beginnings of Christianity. The generous sowing of the Apostolic age; though the hearers differ, the sowing always the same; with good seed, a full hand and a wide reach. The four classes of hearers, the same in every age. The unfruitful hearers: the  first class, careless, corrupt, utterly hardened; the  second, enthusiastic but fickle, full of feeling not of faith; the  third, earnest but legal, self-seeking, serious-minded worldlings the worst of the three, though often awakening most hope. The first have the faults of childhood; the second, of youth; the third, of more mature years.
	The good ground; broken up, deeply stirred, cleared of thorns. The proportion of fruit varies, but the whole is fruitful. Historical application: 1 . The Jews (who failed to receive the word); 2 . The Greeks (shortlived in their devotion); 3 . The Romans (choked by temporal power); 4 . As we hope, the Teutonic races (thus far the most fruitful). ‘The mysteries of the kingdom of heaven:’ 1 . Revealed by Christ, as they are revealed in Christ; 2 . Revealed to faith, concealed from unbelief; 3 . To one class God freely gives; to the other He denies, the responsibility is theirs; 4 . Willingness to receive leads to abundance, unwillingness results in inability; 5 . The new revelation fulfils the Old Testament (Matthew 13:14-15), yet far exceeds it in the privilege it bestows (Matthew 13:16-17). The longing of the O. T. saints, the privilege of Christians.
