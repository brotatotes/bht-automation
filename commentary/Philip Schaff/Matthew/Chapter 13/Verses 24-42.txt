<p><strong> The three other parables spoken </strong> in public (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:24-33">Matthew 13:24-33</span>), with the interpretation of the parable of the tares in private (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:36-43">Matthew 13:36-43</span>). The Evangelist inserts, as is his habit, a prophecy fulfilled by this method of instructing the multitudes (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:34-35">Matthew 13:34-35</span>). <em> </em> The parable of the tares follows that of the sower; the development of evil is soon apparent; it was foretold to prevent discouragement. The third and fourth, setting forth the expansive and permeating power of the kingdom of heaven, were an assurance that the tares would not dispossess the wheat. <em> </em> The historical application of the parable of the tares, is to the early days of Christianity, when evil tendencies, not yet rooted up, manifested themselves. It has an application for every succeeding age; not however as a whole to individuals. Its various parts enjoin: zeal in extending the gospel over the world, vigilance against Satan, patience in the midst of recognized evil, hope of final triumph for Christâ€™s cause; the final scene is impressive. The Son of man who here speaks will send forth the reapers at the end of the world. <em> </em> The parables of the mustard-seed and of the leaven, form a pair: both pointing to the growth of Christianity from small beginnings; the former presenting its extensive power, in consequence of its inherent capacity for development; the latter its intensive power, all the more pervasive because noiseless. The historical application of the one is to the rapid extension of Christianity in the early centuries; of the other, to its gradual and hidden effects on humanity, especially among barbarous nations in the Dark Ages. The individual application of the former is not prominent; it encourages by showing that the beginnings of grace in the heart are small, and warms by asserting its rapid extension. The parable of the leaven points directly to the mystery of regeneration transforming the soul. <em> </em> For other lessons see comments.
