These three parables relate   mainly to human effort in the development of the kingdom of heaven. The last one corresponds to the second, while the fifth and sixth form a pair; the transition of thought being easy and natural in every case.   The Hidden Treasure (Matthew 13:44), finding without seeking; The Pearl of great price (Matthew 13:45-46), seeking and finding; in both cases, proper effort to appropriate the valuable possession; The Net cast into the Sea (Matthew 13:47-50), the Church and her efforts, the mixed result and the final separation. Application in the form of a comparison (Matthew 13:51-52).
