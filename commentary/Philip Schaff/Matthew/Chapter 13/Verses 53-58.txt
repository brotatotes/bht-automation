CHRONOLOGY, and relation to the account in  Luke 4:14-30. Views: ( 1 .) Two distinct visits. That in Luke at the beginning of the Galilean ministry, and occasioning the removal to Capernaum (Matthew 4:17). This one much later, after the discourse in parables (chap. 13 ), the visit to Gadara and the subsequent miracles (chaps, Matthew 8:18 to Matthew 9:34). ( 2 .) Different accounts of the same visit, which took place at the earlier period; ( 3 .) which took place at the later period. We prefer ( 1 ), for the following reasons: He would probably visit His early home a second time; a second rejection would be the result of a second visit. It seems unlikely that the visit, if there was but one, took place at the later period, yet Mark, who is chronologically most exact, agrees with Matthew in placing it about this time. Matthew and Mark would scarcely omit to mention the attempt at violence detailed by Luke, while the unbelief of the Nazarenes would express itself in much the same way, and the answer of our Lord convey the same thought. The points of agreement and of difference are thus most satisfactorily accounted for.
