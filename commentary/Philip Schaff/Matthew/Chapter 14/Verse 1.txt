<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Herod the tetrarch</strong>. Herod Antipas (a son of Herod the Great) now ruler in Galilee; a light-minded, prodigal, and luxurious prince, superstitious and cunning (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:15">Mark 8:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:32">Luke 13:32</span>). He was at Jerusalem when our Lord suffered, and showed utter heartlessness on that occasion. He died in Spain, a defeated and banished man (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:3">Matthew 14:3</span>). ‘Tetrarch;’ strictly speaking, the ruler of the fourth part of a country, but here used less exactly.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Heard the report concerning Jesus</strong>. Probably at Machærus (where John had been imprisoned), which was remote from the scene of our Lord’s ministry. He first heard of Him now, through the more extended labors of the Twelve.
