Matthew 14:14.  Had compassion on them. All had followed Him so far and were in a state of spiritual destitution; many of them were sick. His compassion manifested itself in healing their sick, and in giving them instruction (Mark 6:34). The approach of the Passover season (John 6:4), accounts for the greatness of the multitude; many of them were probably on their way to Jerusalem.
