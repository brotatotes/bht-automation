Matthew 14:15.  Evening. The  first evening,  i.e.,  from three to six P.M.   (ninth to twelfth hour of the day); Matthew 14:23 refers to the  second evening, which began at six P.M  .  (the first watch of the night).
	 The time, lit., ‘hour,’  is already past. Either the time of day is late, or the time for the evening meal is past. The disciples probably interrupted His discourse with this suggestion. Our Lord had continued His work of teaching and healing, until He had an opportunity to show how He could supply other wants. Those who wait on Him shall be fed! John tells us He ‘knew what he would do,’ inserting a question our Lord put to Philip (who was probably the spokesman) to try him. (See John 6:5-7.)
