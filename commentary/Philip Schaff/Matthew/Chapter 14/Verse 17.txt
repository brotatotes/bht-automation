Matthew 14:17.  We have here. Andrew said this; a lad who was present had this small store of food (John 6:8-9). The disciples, though full of perplexity and doubt, tried to  obey, and sought food for the multitude. The loaves and fishes thus obtained, of which they said ‘What are they among so many,’ were given by them to the people.
	 Five loaves (‘barley loaves’) and two fishes (‘small fishes,’ probably salt ones). Plain common food.
