Matthew 14:26.  It in an apparition  . An unreal appearance of a real person. The word is not that usually rendered, ‘spirit’
	 They cried out for fear  . Matthew is an honest witness to tell of this superstitious fear. As he here discriminates between ‘an apparition’ and a real bodily appearance of our Lord, he cannot mean the former when he writes of the resurrection of Christ.
