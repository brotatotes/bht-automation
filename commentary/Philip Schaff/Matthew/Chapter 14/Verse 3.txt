<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> For the sake of Herodias, his brother Philipâ€™s wife</strong>. Herodias, the daughter of Aristobulus (the half-brother of Herod Antipas), the wife of Herod Philip (not to be confounded with Philip the Tetrarch, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:1">Luke 3:1</span>), who was disinherited by his father, Herod the Great, and lived as a private citizen. Herod Antipas was first married to a daughter of Aretas, king of Arabia (mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:32">2 Corinthians 11:32</span>). Becoming enamored of Herodias, his niece and sister-in-law, he married her secretly, while her husband was still living, repudiating his own legal wife. Aretas made war against him in consequence, and having defeated him was prevented by the Romans from dethroning him (A. D. 37 ). At the instigation of Herodias he went to Rome to compete for the kingly power bestowed on Agrippa, but was banished by the Emperor Caligula to Cyprus.
