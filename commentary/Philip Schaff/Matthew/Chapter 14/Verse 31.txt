<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:31">Matthew 14:31</span>. <strong> O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? </strong> Chrysostom: we need not fear the tempest, but only the weakness of our faith. Hence Christ does not calm the storm, but takes Peter by the hand. Trench: ‘Peter is here the image of all the faithful of all ages, in the seasons of their weakness and their fear.’
