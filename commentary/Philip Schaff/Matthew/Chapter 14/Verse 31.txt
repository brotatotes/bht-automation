Matthew 14:31.  O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?  Chrysostom: we need not fear the tempest, but only the weakness of our faith. Hence Christ does not calm the storm, but takes Peter by the hand. Trench: ‘Peter is here the image of all the faithful of all ages, in the seasons of their weakness and their fear.’
