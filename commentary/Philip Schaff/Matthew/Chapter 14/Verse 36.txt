Matthew 14:36.  Only touch the border of his garment  . A woman had been thus healed in the presence of a crowd (chap. Matthew 9:20-22), so that these people were not superstitious, but had strong faith. As our Lord was only passing through, a greater number could be healed in this way. Christ’s miracles were always performed so as to show a connection between Himself and the person cured, even though it were so slight a one as this touch. This is the fourth general description of our Lord’s ministry; in each case (Matthew 4:24; Matthew 9:35; Matthew 11:1, and here) after a series of events grouped together without reference to accurate chronological order.
