The nobility of Galilee were at the feast (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:21">Mark 6:21</span>). The dancing seems to have taken place late in the entertainment, when all were more or less intoxicated </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The daughter of Herodias</strong>. ‘Salome,’ the daughter of Herod Philip. She married her uncle Philip the Tetrarch, and after his death her cousin Aristobulus. Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:22">Mark 6:22</span>.

She had been sent by her mother to gain an opportunity for killing John (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:21">Mark 6:21</span>). The dance was a pantomime probably of a voluptuous character, and was performed ‘in the midst,’ with the intoxicated party forming a circle about her. Such conduct was deemed immodest by Jews, Greeks, and Romans; in this case there was added a criminal purpose, and a sin against her own forsaken father. Public dancing (and often private dancing) calls forth evil passions, even if not designed to do so.
