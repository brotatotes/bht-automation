<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:8">Matthew 14:8</span>. <strong> Being let on by her mother</strong>. Instigated rather than instructed. She went out and consulted her mother, but the mother’s purpose had already been formed, and her answer (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:24">Mark 6:24</span>) shows great vindictiveness and determination, as does the demand, not for the death, but for the head of the Baptist.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Upon a platter</strong>. A large dish. This seems to have been added by Salome herself, ‘as a hideous jest, implying an intention to devour it’ (J. A. Alexander).
