Matthew 14:9. And  the king was grieved. ‘Grieved’ rather than ‘sorry.’ Disturbed rather than penitent. The emotion was in keeping with his character and feelings toward John but was of no avail; compliance with the murderous request was the more criminal because he was ‘grieved.’ Herod is called ‘the king’ by Mark also, although he did not really possess the title.
	 But because of his oaths. The oath was foolish, and was sinfully kept. Better break our word than God’s Word. Herod was scrupulous on this point, and yet an adulterer and murderer.  And them that sat with him. His courtiers were probably hostile to John. In any case the fear of men, so powerful for evil, influenced him.
