<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:9">Matthew 14:9</span>. And <strong> the king was grieved</strong>. ‘Grieved’ rather than ‘sorry.’ Disturbed rather than penitent. The emotion was in keeping with his character and feelings toward John but was of no avail; compliance with the murderous request was the more criminal because he was ‘grieved.’ Herod is called ‘the king’ by Mark also, although he did not really possess the title.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> But because of his oaths</strong>. The oath was foolish, and was sinfully kept. Better break our word than God’s Word. Herod was scrupulous on this point, and yet an adulterer and murderer. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And them that sat with him</strong>. His courtiers were probably hostile to John. In any case the fear of men, so powerful for evil, influenced him.
