CHRONOLOGY. The chapter opens with an indefinite mark of time (‘at that season,’ Matthew 14:1); but Luke 9:10 shows that it was upon the return of the Twelve. Hence chaps, Matthew 9:35-38; Matthew 9:10, find their place between chaps, 13 and 14 . The order of this chapter is chronological. The feeding of the five thousand, narrated by all four Evangelists, forms a definite point of comparison.
	 The section gives a fearful picture   of the Herodian family, in their lust, ambition, and cruelty. No scene in history presents in a single group more of the vices characteristic of corrupt courts: arbitrary imprisonment, dread of the multitude, adultery and incest, illegal divorce, feasting and intoxication, voluptuous and immodest dancing, lavish promises and foolish oaths to the dancer, weak fear of court flatterers, and the murder of a faithful reprover; the picture completed by the superstition of the murderer, who sees in the power of the Messiah only a token that his victim has reappeared. The impression produced on the mind of Herod leads to the withdrawal mentioned in Matthew 14:13.
