The disciples were probably ready to join the people in an enterprise, which would fulfil their remaining carnal expectations regarding the Messiahship of their Master. Hence our Lord dismissed them, sending them where they would feel their need of His presence. Mark and John narrate this occurrence, but the attempt of Peter (Matthew 14:29-31) is mentioned only by Matthew.
