Matthew 15:1.    From Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes. Not ‘scribes and Pharisees,’ but representatives of the party of the Pharisees, including ‘scribes.’ Possibly a formal deputation from the Sanhedrin (‘from Jerusalem’. They came apparently with a definite and hostile purpose (comp. Mark 7:1), probably to aid the Galilean Pharisees, or, as is less likely, in consequence of the conduct of the disciples of our Lord at the recent Passover feast in Jerusalem. (See Matthew 15:2.)
