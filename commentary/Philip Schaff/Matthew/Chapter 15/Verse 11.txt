<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Defileth the man, </strong> <em> i.e.,</em> makes him common, impure or profane. The Mosaic law, by a variety of regulations, kept up the distinction between pure and impure, to teach the importance of <em> moral</em> purity. This purpose had been lost sight of, and the external regulation not only made the main matter, but extended and exalted, so that ceremonial impurity was considered worse than moral impurity. Our Lord opposes only this perversion of the Mosaic law. Lange: ‘What is here said concerning the going into and coming out of the mouth, applies to the whole series of Levitical and moral injunctions concerning purity. The statement was, in the first place, indeed intended as a justification of His disciples on the charge brought against them by the Pharisees. But the inference was obvious, that all these injunctions required to be fulfilled in a higher sense (although this did not imply that the Lord denied their validity as Levitical ordinances). As a matter of course, when the symbol would be completely fulfilled, its outward representation must fall to the ground.’ Pharisees in all ages have exalted the mere sign and symbol above the reality. Some people make their whole religion consist in not allowing certain meats and drinks to enter ‘into the mouth.’
