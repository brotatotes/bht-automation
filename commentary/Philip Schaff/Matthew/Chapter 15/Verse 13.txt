<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:13">Matthew 15:13</span>. <strong> Every plant.</strong> This refers to the <em> teaching</em> and <em> traditions</em> of the Pharisees, although the persons became identified with their false doctrine.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Which my heavenly father planted not.</strong> The Pharisees claimed Divine authority for their teaching; our Lord declares by implication that it was wholly human and as such should <em> be rooted up</em>, taken away and destroyed, to make room for a plant of His planting, the purer doctrine of the kingdom. It was a declaration of a purpose to oppose the Pharisees. To us it is a promise, with a terrible side indeed, but bidding us take courage when we see false and corrupt religion flourishing; it ‘shall be rooted up.’
