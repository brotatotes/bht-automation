Matthew 15:13.  Every plant. This refers to the  teaching and  traditions of the Pharisees, although the persons became identified with their false doctrine.
	 Which my heavenly father planted not. The Pharisees claimed Divine authority for their teaching; our Lord declares by implication that it was wholly human and as such should  be rooted up, taken away and destroyed, to make room for a plant of His planting, the purer doctrine of the kingdom. It was a declaration of a purpose to oppose the Pharisees. To us it is a promise, with a terrible side indeed, but bidding us take courage when we see false and corrupt religion flourishing; it ‘shall be rooted up.’
