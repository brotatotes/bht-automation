	 Into the borders of Magadan  , according to the best authorities. (‘Magdalan’ is also found.) Mark: ‘Into the parts of Dalmanutha.’ This was probably a village not far from Magadan.

The site of Magdala (Magadan), now called  Madschel  (‘Migdol,’ Joshua 19:38), is north of Tiberias and directly east of Cana, on the  western shore of the lake, since the next voyage (chap. Matthew 16:5; Mark 8:13) was across the lake to the eastern side.
