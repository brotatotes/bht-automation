Matthew 15:5.  But ye say.  God said one thing, ‘ye say’ another, and though you quote tradition, it has only your own authority.
	 It is a gift to God, all that,  etc. ‘That from which thou mightest have been benefited by me, is an offering to God.’ The Rabbins taught that by saying ‘corban’ of his possessions (Mark 7:11), a man was absolved from the duty of caring for his parents, yet the brief expression was not considered sufficient to bind the party to devote his property to religious uses.
