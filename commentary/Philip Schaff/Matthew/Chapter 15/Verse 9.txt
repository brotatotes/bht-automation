Matthew 15:9.    In vain. This phrase (only implied in the original passage in Isaiah) refers to the  emptiness of such worship. It is both  groundless  (without true principle) and  fruitless (without proper results). The Hebrew means literally: ‘their fearing of me has become a precept of men, a thing taught.’ A rebuke of religion, resting only on human authority, but as applied to the Pharisees in this case, showing that such religion becomes  positively false, contrary to Goa’s commandments. Alford: ‘The portion of Isaiah from which this citation is made (Isaiah 24-35.) sets forth, in alternate threatenings and promises, the punishment of the mere nominal Israel, and the salvation of the true Israel of God. And, as so often in the prophetic word, its threats and promises are for all times of the Church; the particular event then foretold being but one fulfilment of those deeper and more general declarations of God, which shall be ever having their successive illustrations in His dealings with men.’
