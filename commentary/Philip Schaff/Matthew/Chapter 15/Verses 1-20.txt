<p>Only Matthew and Mark narrate the events recorded in this chapter. The discourse at Capernaum (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:22-71">John 6:22-71</span>), respecting the manna from heaven, followed the feeding of the five thousand. The Passover, which was nigh at hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:4">John 6:4</span>), was not attended by our Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:1">John 7:1</span>). This chapter begins the story of the last year of our Lord’s ministry, which covers half the Gospel (chaps, 14 - 28 .). The history of ‘the year of conflict’ begins with an account of a covert attack on our Lord. The Pharisees from Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:22">Mark 3:22</span>) began their open opposition some time before (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:24">Mark 13:24</span>.). Then they expressed a blasphemously hostile opinion respecting the miracles of our Lord; now they remonstrate against the conduct of His disciples. The opposition now, though apparently less bitter, was really more dangerous. The interview with the Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:1-9">Matthew 15:1-9</span>) shows that it is characteristic of sticklers for the external customs and ceremonies of religion (Pharisees in all ages) to be intolerant about little and belittling questions, to be inconsistent, unrighteous (even according to their own standard), and hypocritical. This ever recurring mistake of making religion consist in ‘meat and drink,’ is further rebuked in the saying to the multitude (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:10-11">Matthew 15:10-11</span>), while the offence taken by the Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:12">Matthew 15:12</span>) forms the basis of a declaration that Pharisaism is not of God’s planting and is to be destroyed, defeating itself (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:13-14">Matthew 15:13-14</span>). The exposition of the ‘parable’ shows the nature of real defilement. Moral purity or impurity is from the heart, not from the food, still less from the observance or neglect of the ceremonial ‘washing’ of the hands before eating bread. On this point the Lord’s words (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:16">Matthew 15:16</span>) are still applicable: ‘Even yet are ye also without understanding.’
