Matthew 15:32-38. This miracle is not identical with that described in chap. Matthew 14:15-21. The circumstances vary in every possible respect: the number fed, the amount of provision present, the fragments gathered, even the kind of baskets used, a different word being found here, and also in the question of our Lord about the two miracles (chap. Matthew 16:9-10; Mark 8:19-20).
