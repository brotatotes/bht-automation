<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:11">Matthew 16:11</span>. <strong> How is it that ye do not perceive,</strong> etc. The recent instruction (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:19-20">Matthew 15:19-20</span>) that eating did not defile a man, should have prevented the surmise about not eating bread with the Pharisees and Sadducees; the miracles should have shown them that lack of earthly bread was not referred to. Mark stops at this point in the narrative.
