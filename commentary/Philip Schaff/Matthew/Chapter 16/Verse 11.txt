Matthew 16:11.  How is it that ye do not perceive, etc. The recent instruction (chap. Matthew 15:19-20) that eating did not defile a man, should have prevented the surmise about not eating bread with the Pharisees and Sadducees; the miracles should have shown them that lack of earthly bread was not referred to. Mark stops at this point in the narrative.
