<p><strong> The teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</strong> Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:1">Luke 12:1</span>. The leaven of the Pharisees is ‘hypocrisy.’ But the Sadducees, the ‘liberal Jews’ of that age, went to the other extreme. The reference is, therefore, not to what they taught in common, but to the mode and spirit of their teaching. In both cases <em> hypocrisy; </em> in the Pharisees hypocritical formalism, in the Sadducees hypocritical liberalism. These two apparently antagonistic tendencies have been practically united ever since in opposing Christ. Without Him strict morality (‘Pharisees’) and free inquiry (‘Sadducees’) inevitably become hypocritical. Comp, on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:15">Mark 8:15</span>.

<p>The emphasis here laid on false ‘teaching ‘is suggestive, Principles, tendencies, ‘teachings,’ are most permeating, and if evil, most dangerous. To those who after all the lessons of history, and of experience, fail to see this, we may apply the words of our Lord: ‘How is it that ye do not perceive?’
