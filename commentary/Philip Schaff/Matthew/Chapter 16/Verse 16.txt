<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Thou art the Christ</strong> <em> </em> (‘the Messiah’), <strong> the Son of the living God</strong>. Peter’s reply is a decided, solemn, profound confession, that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God in a specific sense. This specific sense is clearly vindicated: ( 1 .) by the presence of the article, which otherwise might have been omitted: ( 2 .) by the addition of the phrase itself, otherwise unnecessary, since the confession of His Messiahship includes all lower ideas; ( 3 .) from the word ‘living,’ which is not opposed to dead idols, but indicates that God is the source of all life, and that His Son is the fountain of life to men; ( 4 ) from the declaration that God had revealed this to Peter, since men of themselves readily form lower conceptions of Christ. This is the germ of the true and full statement respecting the Divine Human Person of Christ. The germ itself was a revelation, and its development was through subsequent revelation to the Apostles. The doctrine of Christ’s Person is not the result of human speculation, but a truth revealed by the Father of our Lord respecting His only Begotten Son. As at the beginning of His ministry our Lord received an attestation from man (John the Baptist) preceding the attestation of His Son-ship from heaven (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>), so at this turning-point a confession from man precedes the renewed attestation from heaven on the mount of Transfiguration (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:5">Matthew 17:5</span>).
