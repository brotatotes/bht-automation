<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:17">Matthew 16:17</span>. <strong> Blessed art thou.</strong> An answering confession of Peter as an object of the Divine favor, a subject of Divine grace (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:9">Romans 10:9</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Simon Bar-Jona</strong> <em> ,</em> son of Jonah. His human name and paternity are introduced, probably with an allusion to the title: Son of man (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:13">Matthew 16:13</span>); there is a similarity in the phrases in the language then spoken. Simon confesses his belief in the higher title of Christ; our Lord refers to Simon’s higher name, Peter.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> For flesh and blood revealed it not unto thee.</strong> The knowledge was not from, any human source (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:16">Galatians 1:16</span>).
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> But my Father who is in heaven.</strong> <em> </em> The real knowledge of Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of the living God, is and must be a matter of Divine revelation. Men may, of themselves, hold such a doctrine as part of a creed, but a belief that influences heart and life is the result of a Divine revelation made in us. Peter’s confession was based on such a belief. For the trials of faith before them during the remainder of our Lord’s earthly life the disciples needed a knowledge of His Person far above the carnal notions of the Messiah; the reply of Peter shows that they had it, and our Lord tells whence it came.
