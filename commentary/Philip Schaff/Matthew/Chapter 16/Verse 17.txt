Matthew 16:17.  Blessed art thou. An answering confession of Peter as an object of the Divine favor, a subject of Divine grace (comp. Romans 10:9).
	 Simon Bar-Jona  , son of Jonah. His human name and paternity are introduced, probably with an allusion to the title: Son of man (Matthew 16:13); there is a similarity in the phrases in the language then spoken. Simon confesses his belief in the higher title of Christ; our Lord refers to Simon’s higher name, Peter.
	 For flesh and blood revealed it not unto thee. The knowledge was not from, any human source (comp. Galatians 1:16).
	 But my Father who is in heaven.   The real knowledge of Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of the living God, is and must be a matter of Divine revelation. Men may, of themselves, hold such a doctrine as part of a creed, but a belief that influences heart and life is the result of a Divine revelation made in us. Peter’s confession was based on such a belief. For the trials of faith before them during the remainder of our Lord’s earthly life the disciples needed a knowledge of His Person far above the carnal notions of the Messiah; the reply of Peter shows that they had it, and our Lord tells whence it came.
