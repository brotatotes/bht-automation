<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span>. <strong> Unto thee.</strong> To Peter, who is addressed throughout; but as chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:18">Matthew 18:18</span> includes the other Apostles in the second promise of this verse, they are probably included here also.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The keys of the kingdom of heaven. </strong> Power to open and shut Peter first admitted Jews (on the day of Pentecost) and Gentiles(Cornelius) to the Church; and first excluded (Ananias and Sapphira; Simon Magus). This promise in its full sense does not extend beyond the Apostles, who needed special power for their foundation work; for the keys are not the keys of the Church but ‘of the kingdom of heaven.’ It is applicable to the Christian ministry, only in the subordinate sense of proclaiming the word and exercising prudential (not punitive) discipline.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And whatsoever thou shalt bind,</strong> etc. Jewish usage would explain: ‘bind’ and ‘loose,’ as equivalent to <em> forbid</em> and <em> permit</em>; the reference therefore is to the power of legislation in the Church (‘on earth’) in the case of the Apostles, Peter being their representative; this was in accordance with heavenly design (‘in heaven’). Things are probably referred to here; in the previous clause <em> persons</em> (admitted or excluded). The power seems to be judicial also (comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:17-18">Matthew 18:17-18</span>). This promise also is, in its full sense, applicable only to the Apostles. Most of the difficulties connected with the interpretation of this passage are obviated by considering that the full gospel could not be preached until after the Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension of our Lord; the Apostles, who had to lay the foundation and be the foundation, must therefore have knowledge and authority which no one after them needs or can rightly claim. The foundation thus laid, the Church enters upon a conflict in which final victory, though long delayed, is assured. Church authorities must indeed legislate and exercise judicial power, etc., but not as having final and supreme power nor with any assurance of infallibility. For such binding and loosing on earth they may implore, but cannot assert, heavenly direction and sanction.
