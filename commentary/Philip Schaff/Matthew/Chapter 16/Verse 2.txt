Matthew 16:2.  When it is evening, ye say, Fair weather,   etc. In answer to their demand for a ‘sign from heaven,’ our Lord cites two weather ‘signs,’ such as all men look for, ‘in the face of the heaven.’ These signs (cited, not given by our Lord) hold good in other regions. The design was to rebuke their carnal and sensuous expectations (see Matthew 16:3).
