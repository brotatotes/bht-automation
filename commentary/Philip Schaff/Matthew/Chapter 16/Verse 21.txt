<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span>. <strong> From that time began Jesus. </strong> The confession prepared them for the revelation. We infer that He spoke often and familiarly on this topic, to prepare them for their own trials, and to impress upon them the truth they deemed so strange. (Comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:22-23">Matthew 17:22-23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:17-19">Matthew 20:17-19</span>, and the parallel passages in Mark and Luke).

	</p>
<p><strong> Of the elders,</strong> etc. These classes represented the whole Jewish nation. Christ did not reject the covenant people; they rejected Him.

<p><strong> And be killed</strong>. A startling announcement to the disciples, and yet Daniel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="da+9:26">Daniel 9:26</span>) and Isaiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:4-10">Isaiah 53:4-10</span>) had foretold it ‘The cross’ is the <em> necessary</em> climax of His sufferings.
	</p>
<p><strong> The third day be raised up.</strong> ‘According to the Scriptures.’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:4">1 Corinthians 15:4</span>.) Despite this plain announcement, they were full of doubt and despondency after His death.
