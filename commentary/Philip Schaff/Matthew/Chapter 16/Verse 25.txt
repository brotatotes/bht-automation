Matthew 16:25.  For whosoever would save his life, etc. Comp, the same thought in chap. Matthew 10:39. Whoever makes the lower life the supreme motive shall lose the higher life, and whoever, making Christ supreme, shall lose even life for His sake shall find it in the highest, truest sense. The contrast throughout the passage is not between body and soul, but earthly life in all forms with true heavenly life here and hereafter. Life, worldly, selfish, fleshly, is opposed to life eternal, Christian and spiritual. ‘The fear of death subjects to the bondage of death (Hebrews 2:15); while readiness to suffer a holy death for Christ’s sake opens up before us true life.’
