<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:26">Matthew 16:26</span>. <strong> What shall a man be profited.</strong> In view of this saving and losing.
	</p>
<p><strong> Forfeit his life. </strong> Same word as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:25">Matthew 16:25</span>. The variation in the common version is unfortunate. It has the double meaning ‘life’ and ‘soul.’ But here ‘life’ in the higher sense is meant, not ‘soul’ in distinction from ‘body.’ It is plainly implied that gaining the world in a selfish manner involves the loss of true life, that such a gain is really only an apparent gain of the world, while the loss is real, irreparable, irretrievable. The usual inferences, based on the sense ‘soul,’ are true enough, but not suggested here. (See further on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:37">Mark 8:37</span>.)
