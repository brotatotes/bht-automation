<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:3">Matthew 16:3</span>. Symbolical meaning (not to be pressed):
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;">‘The red at even of the Old Testament betokened fair weather at hand. Similarly, the red sky at the commencement of the New Testament, indicated the storm about to descend upon Israel. But they were incapable of understanding either one or other of these signs.’ (Lange’s Comm.)

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Ye can not.</strong> Not a question, but an assertion.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The signs of the times</strong>, <em> i.e.</em>, <em> </em> the fulfilment of prophecy; the miracles performed before them, showing that the Messiah had come. The Jews, with the promise of the Messiah, ought to have been as quick in discerning the signs of His coming, as those of the weather. Proverbially so keen to discern the signs of the times as affecting trade, etc., they have always shown lack of spiritual discernment. But all men are naturally slow in discovering the spiritual significance of passing events.
