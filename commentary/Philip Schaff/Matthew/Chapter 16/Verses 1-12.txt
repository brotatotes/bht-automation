<p>In consequence of the opposition of Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:1">Matthew 15:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:21">Matthew 15:21</span>), our Lord had withdrawn to heathen and unfrequented regions. On His return, He lands at a retired locality in Galilee; the Pharisees seek Him, on this occasion in company with the Sadducees, tempting Him again. He then withdraws to the eastern side of the sea (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:5">Matthew 16:5</span>), not far from Bethsaida (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:22">Mark 8:22</span>). The connection of events shows the reason for these repeated voyages, which seem purposeless to many readers. Galilee being almost completely closed to Him, it was time for the decided confessions (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:13-20">Matthew 16:13-20</span>) and revelation (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21-28">Matthew 16:21-28</span>) which follow. On the way the unbelief and ignorance of the Twelve were manifested (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:7">Matthew 16:7</span> ff.); instruction was given them which would separate them more decidedly from the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:6">Matthew 16:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:12">Matthew 16:12</span>). It is one of the Twelve that tells of their weakness at this important crisis. Our Lord visited Galilee but once more, and then to take leave of it (comp, chaps, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:22">Matthew 17:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:1">Matthew 19:1</span>).
