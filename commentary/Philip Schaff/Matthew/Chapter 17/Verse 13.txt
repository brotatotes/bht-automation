<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:13">Matthew 17:13</span>. <strong> He spake unto them of John the Baptist</strong>. Our Lord referred to John, but this does not exhaust the meaning of the prophecy in Malachi. The passages bearing on the subject indicate strongly another appearance of Elijah (whether the same person or not is of course unknown to us) before the second coming of Christ, to do a similar preparatory work. In every great spiritual movement there must be one who precedes ‘in the spirit and power of Elijah.’
