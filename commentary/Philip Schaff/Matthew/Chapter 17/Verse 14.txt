<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:14">Matthew 17:14</span>. <strong> Kneeling to him</strong>. An act of homage, not necessarily of worship. The scribes were questioning with the disciples; the multitude were amazed and ran to Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:14-17">Mark 9:14-17</span>). The failure of the disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:16">Matthew 17:16</span>) had probably occasioned a denial of Christâ€™s authority on the part of the scribes. Hence the agitation of the crowd.
