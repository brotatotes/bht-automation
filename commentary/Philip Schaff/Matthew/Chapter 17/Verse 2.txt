	 His face did shine as the snow, and his garments became white as the light.  Mark: ‘And his garments became glistening, exceeding white; such as no fuller on earth can so whiten them.’ Luke: ‘The fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became white and dazzling.’ No explanation is possible that denies the supernatural element. Our Lord’s inherent glory burst forth; added to this there was an external heavenly illumination affecting His garments and surrounding Moses and Elijah, reaching its highest manifestation in the luminous cloud spoken of in Matthew 17:5.
