<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:21">Matthew 17:21</span>. The two oldest manuscripts, the best of the later ones (cursives), some very ancient versions, omit this verse, and there are other reasons for doubting its genuineness. If retained: ‘Howbeit’ should be changed to ‘but <em> .’</em> See notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:29">Mark 9:29</span>, where the passage is to be retained.
