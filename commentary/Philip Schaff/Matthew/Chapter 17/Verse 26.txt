Matthew 17:26.  Surely then the sons are free. Peter had lately confessed that Jesus was ‘the Son of the living God;’ and yet now so readily admits the obligation to pay the temple-tax. The real Temple need not pay tribute to that which foreshadowed it. The saying does not refer to taxes to the State (see chap. Matthew 22:19), nor imply that the clergy should be exempt from taxation. Christians are free, not from the duties of citizens, but from the yoke of legality the priesthood would put upon them.
