<p>All three Evangelists place this <strong> </strong> miracle immediately after the transfiguration (Luke: ‘the next day’). This ‘may be regarded as one of the evidences of the genuineness and authenticity of the narrative, and against the mythical hypothesis.’ Meyer. Lesson: On earth we may not rest on the mount of spiritual delight, but must go down into the valley of duty (Raphael has grouped the two events in his masterpiece). The subject of this miracle had all the symptoms of epilepsy and was also possessed. The inability of the disciples to cure him, the questionings of the scribes (mentioned by Mark) and the faith of the father, all give additional interest to the occurrence. Thus the training of the Twelve, now the all-important matter, was earned on. The nine disciples in the valley had ventured without sufficient faith into a conflict with Satan and the scribes. The Master came to their aid, to enforce the needed lesson. The people, on whom the failure of the disciples had produced an effect, now wondered again (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:43">Luke 9:43</span>), but the current of hostility was not checked. Mark is fuller and independent in his account.
