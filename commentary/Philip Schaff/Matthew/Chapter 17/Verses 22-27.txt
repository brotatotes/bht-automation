The definite details as to time and place show that our Lord repeated His prediction of His sufferings (chap. Matthew 16:21-23). Our Lord now left the foot of the mount and passed through Galilee (Mark 9:30); the prediction was made while the people were still wondering (Luke 9:43). We infer that they passed directly from Mount Hermon into Galilee; on the way our Lord made this declaration; reaching Capernaum, the question about tribute was put.   Both incidents belong together in the education of the Apostles for the events which were so soon to come. This was the last visit to Galilee, the last miracle there. It is unlikely that a visit to Jerusalem (at the Feast of Tabernacles, John 7:2-14) intervened.
