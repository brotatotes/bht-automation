Matthew 18:10.  See. Little ones are made to offend through contempt or disregard for them in their littleness.
	 These little ones. A direct address to the disciples in view of their question: Who shall be the greater? ‘Little ones,’ not Christians in general, nor even truly humble Christians, but rather weak, growing Christians, including children, who may and ought to be Christians.
	 Their angels in heaven. They are not to be despised, since they enjoy angelic guardianship. Both the words and form are against the explanation: ‘their spirits after death.’ The incorrect order of the common version encourages this view, which is a reaction from the Romish angel-worship.
	 Do always behold. An allusion to the fact that the ministers of eastern kings had access to them; suggesting that these angels were not actively employed, ‘as if God were through them always looking upon the little ones.’ The general sense is: God’s  highest angels represent the  least subjects of His kingdom. ‘Christ Himself, as the Great Advocate and Intercessor, is the central point of their angelic guardianship.’
