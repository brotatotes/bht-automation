<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:11">Matthew 18:11</span>. This verse is omitted in the most ancient manuscripts. It seemed apt at this point, both in view of what follows, and as a reason for the admonition in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:10">Matthew 18:10</span>, presenting Christ’s conduct in contrast to this ‘despising.’ He came to save those altogether lost, such contempt repels those who are apparently on the path of salvation.
