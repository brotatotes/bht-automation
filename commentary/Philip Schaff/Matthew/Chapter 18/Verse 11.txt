Matthew 18:11. This verse is omitted in the most ancient manuscripts. It seemed apt at this point, both in view of what follows, and as a reason for the admonition in Matthew 18:10, presenting Christ’s conduct in contrast to this ‘despising.’ He came to save those altogether lost, such contempt repels those who are apparently on the path of salvation.
