Matthew 18:12.  How think ye. This parable (with a similar one) was spoken on a later occasion to a different audience (Luke 15:4-7). Here it is a lesson for the disciples (the under-shepherds), showing them their duty: there it is a rebuke for the Pharisees, who objected to this seeking and saving on the part of the good Shepherd.
