<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:12">Matthew 18:12</span>. <strong> How think ye</strong>. This parable (with a similar one) was spoken on a later occasion to a different audience (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:4-7">Luke 15:4-7</span>). Here it is a lesson for the disciples (the under-shepherds), showing them their duty: there it is a rebuke for the Pharisees, who objected to this seeking and saving on the part of the good Shepherd.
