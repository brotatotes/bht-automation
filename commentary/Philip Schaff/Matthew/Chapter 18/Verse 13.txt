<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:13">Matthew 18:13</span>. <strong> The ninety and nine which have not</strong> <strong> gone astray</strong>. Either the unfallen beings in other worlds, whom Christ in a certain sense left, to save the ‘one’ in this lost world, or those who think they are not lost and who cannot be saved as long as they think so. The former meaning seems more appropriate here, the latter in Luke. The general lesson is: The good Shepherd’s special care was for those in greatest need, so should yours be; even if the needy be but the smallest fraction of those committed to your care.
