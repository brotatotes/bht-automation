<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:14">Matthew 18:14</span>. <strong> The will of your Father. </strong> In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:10">Matthew 18:10</span> <strong> </strong> where the dignity of the little ones is asserted, our Lord says ‘my rather;’ here where the duty is enforced by God’s gracious will, ‘your Father.’ </p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> One of these little ones</strong>, as above, weak, humble, believers: God will not that a single one of them perish, reach the final state of the lost. ‘Little ones’ cannot refer to all mankind; here as throughout, it includes children. It warrants the belief that children, dying in childhood, are <em> all saved.</em> The parable snows that it cannot be on the ground of their innocence, but because the Son of man came to save them. As a child is trustful, going to the arms opened to receive it, so we may well believe that at death that trustfulness places it in the arms of Jesus, who saves it, its infantile trustfulness expanding under the impulse of a higher state of existence, into a living faith, no less real and justifying than that of adults.
