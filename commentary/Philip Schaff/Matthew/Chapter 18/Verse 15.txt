<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Sin</strong>. The omission of ‘against thee’ extends the precept. The passage, however, does not extend the power of the Church over all sins (since the rebuke against a hierarchical spirit forbids this), nor warrant meddlesome interference and rebuke. Our disapproval does not prove that the ‘brother’ has sinned. The first step is to be in private.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Thou hast</strong> <strong> gained thy brother</strong>. Regained him for God, by inducing repentance: regained him for thyself, by regaining his love and fellowship, which is disturbed by his sin whether an offence against the reprover or not. Proclaiming his fault is dangerous for him, encouraging him in his sins: and for us, fostering our worst passions.
