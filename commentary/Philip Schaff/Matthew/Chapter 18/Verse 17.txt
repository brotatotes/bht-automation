Matthew 18:17.  If he refuse to hear them. Does not acknowledge his wrong under their influence. The public step follows:  Tell it unto the church,  i.e., the particular Christian congregation.
	 If  he refuse to hear the church also. The admonition and entreaty of the Church is to be used as a means of  regaining the brother.
	 Let him be  unto thee as the heathen and the publican,   i.e.  ,  as outside the Christian fellowship, though in a Christian, not a Jewish spirit. A man of high spirituality would be won by the first step, a lukewarm Christian by the second or third; when all fail, it is not distinctly commanded that the Church should pronounce him  no Christian. His character has proved itself so far unchristian that the person injured cannot have fellowship with him. The next verse, however, hints at formal acts of discipline on the part of the Church.
