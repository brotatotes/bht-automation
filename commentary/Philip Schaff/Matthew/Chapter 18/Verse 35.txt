<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:35">Matthew 18:35</span>. <strong> So shall also</strong>, etc. It is an overstraining of the parable to infer that God revokes His pardon. The character of the servant is not that of one actually forgiven, since with pardon from God power from God is inseparably joined. Where the moral conditions of a Christian <em> life </em> fail, the man who fancies he has been pardoned is actually more guilty that before. Yet the warning is one needed and efficient in practical Christianity.
