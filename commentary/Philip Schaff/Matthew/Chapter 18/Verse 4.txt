Matthew 18:4.  Humble himself as this little child. Not humble himself as this little child has done, but become humble as this little child is in this company. The absolute innocence of children is not implied, but simply this: ‘The real greatness of the child consists in its perfect contentment with its littleness and dependence.’ This is necessary for entrance to the kingdom; our greatness there is measured by our humility. The answer virtually forbids the putting of such a question, and is then expanded into a discourse about ‘the dignity of Christ’s little ones.’
