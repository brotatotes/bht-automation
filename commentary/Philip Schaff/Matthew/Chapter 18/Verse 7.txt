<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:7">Matthew 18:7</span>. <strong> Woe unto the world</strong>, etc. False disciples, causing Christ’s humble followers to stumble, laying burdens on the conscience, cause sin, bring woe on the world.

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> For it must needs be</strong>, in view of the existence of sin.

<p style="margin-left:0.18em;"><strong> But woe to</strong> <strong> that man</strong>. If the world receives woe from the offences, much more he who causes them. There is an inevitable connection between guilt and judgment. A reference to Judas is possible, but the general application is obvious: whatever the necessity of offences from the actual state of things in the world, and from the permissive plan of God, those who lay stumbling-blocks in the way of Christ’s little ones are responsible and shall be punished.
