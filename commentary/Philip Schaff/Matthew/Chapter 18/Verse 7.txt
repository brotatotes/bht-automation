Matthew 18:7.  Woe unto the world, etc. False disciples, causing Christ’s humble followers to stumble, laying burdens on the conscience, cause sin, bring woe on the world.
	 For it must needs be, in view of the existence of sin.
	 But woe to  that man. If the world receives woe from the offences, much more he who causes them. There is an inevitable connection between guilt and judgment. A reference to Judas is possible, but the general application is obvious: whatever the necessity of offences from the actual state of things in the world, and from the permissive plan of God, those who lay stumbling-blocks in the way of Christ’s little ones are responsible and shall be punished.
