The whole chapter forms one discourse, delivered upon one occasion, after the   return to Capernaum, probably immediately succeeding the miracle just mentioned. Two distinct topics are spoken of: the  first,  the nature of true greatness (Matthew 18:1-14), called forth by the question of the disciples (Matthew 18:1); the  second,  Christian discipline and forgiveness. The latter points to the founding of the Christian Church, distinct from the Jewish theocracy. The question of the disciples may have recognized this purpose of the Master (so plainly indicated in chaps, 16 , 17 ) and not have been entirely owing to carnal views of the kingdom of heaven. But at all events they needed to learn what was necessary to enter that kingdom, before they could understand who would be the greatest in it. The disciples had not understood our Lordâ€™s previous saying (chap. Matthew 16:18) as conferring any primacy upon Peter.
