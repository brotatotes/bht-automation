<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:1-14">Matthew 18:1-14</span> forbade offences <em> against </em> the humble. This section teaches how the humble should deal with offences: ( 1 .) as regards the Christian assembly (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:15-20">Matthew 18:15-20</span>); ( 2 .) as regards his own spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:21-35">Matthew 18:21-35</span>). Our Lord seems to say: you have taken ‘the keys’ into your hands too soon, and used them improperly (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:38-39">Mark 9:38-39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:49-50">Luke 9:49-50</span>). After the caution, however, came the renewed declaration of authority (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:18">Matthew 18:18</span>); Peter asked a question (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:21">Matthew 18:21</span>) which showed his fuller apprehension of the Christian rule of forgiveness, and called forth dearer instruction. The closing parable (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:23-35">Matthew 18:23-35</span>) contains truth, the easiest to <em> perceive,</em> the hardest to <strong> </strong> <em> receive,</em> <strong> </strong> of any practical lesson in the <strong> </strong> New Testament; it is based on God’s full and free forgiveness.
