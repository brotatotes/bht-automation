Matthew 18:1-14 forbade offences  against  the humble. This section teaches how the humble should deal with offences: ( 1 .) as regards the Christian assembly (Matthew 18:15-20); ( 2 .) as regards his own spirit (Matthew 18:21-35). Our Lord seems to say: you have taken ‘the keys’ into your hands too soon, and used them improperly (see Mark 9:38-39; Luke 9:49-50). After the caution, however, came the renewed declaration of authority (Matthew 18:18); Peter asked a question (Matthew 18:21) which showed his fuller apprehension of the Christian rule of forgiveness, and called forth dearer instruction. The closing parable (Matthew 18:23-35) contains truth, the easiest to  perceive, the hardest to    receive,   of any practical lesson in the   New Testament; it is based on God’s full and free forgiveness.
