<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:1">Matthew 19:1</span>. <strong> The borders of Judea, beyond the Jordan</strong>, <em> i.e., </em> on the east side. Perea proper is probably meant. This was part of the territory of Herod Antipas, and extended from the Arnon on the south to Pella on the north; or from the head of the Dead Sea to a point nearly opposite the boundary between Samaria and Galilee. The name was also given to the territory between the Arnon and the sources of Jordan, and sometimes included the whole eastern part of the Jordan valley down to the Elamitic Gulf. The breadth of the district in all three senses was not very <em> </em> great. The Christians of Jerusalem sought refuge in Perea (in Pella) just before the destruction of that city. Some identify this visit with the retirement to Bethabara, or Bethany, beyond Jordan (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:40">John 10:40</span>) immediately before the raising of Lazarus; we place it after that event and the retirement to Ephraim (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:54">John 11:54</span>).
