Matthew 19:11.  All men cannot receive, or,  ‘not all can receive,’  this saying. This high ideal can be understood and put into practice only by those who get illumination and power from God. As a rule, the less Christianity, the lower the ideal of marriage, the more numerous the sins against this state.
