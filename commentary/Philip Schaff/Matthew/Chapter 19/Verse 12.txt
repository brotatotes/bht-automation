Matthew 19:12.  For there are. Assuming that the married state is the normal one, three classes are here mentioned who should (or may) remain in celibacy: ( 1 .) those who from natural incapacity or inaptitude, have no desire to marry; ( 2 .) those who have been mutilated, a class very common once and not unknown now; ( 3 .) those who abstain from marriage, whether for the first or second time, to work the better for Christ’s cause. The first case has no moral quality, the second implies misfortune, the third has a moral value. But it is not set forth here as a law for the ministry, nor is there any superior merit in celibacy. The figurative exposition which understands by the second and third classes those who remain unmarried from moral considerations, or sacrifice, when married, their conjugal enjoyments to their spiritual calling, is forced and incorrect, since all Christians are bound to the latter course and exceptional cases are here spoken of.
