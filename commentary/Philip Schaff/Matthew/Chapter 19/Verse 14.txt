<p><strong> To such belongeth the kingdom of heaven. </strong> As in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:1-14">Matthew 18:1-14</span>, the reference is to children in spirit (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:15">Mark 10:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:17">Luke 18:17</span>), but not to the exclusion of actual children, who probably form the majority <strong> </strong> in the kingdom of heaven. Lessons: 1 . Since ‘to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven,’ the earlier children become Christians the better: 2 . Since they are to come (or be brought) to Christ, who is a Saviour, the doctrine of universal depravity is not denied here. 3 . They may be ‘forbidden,’ both by neglect and injudicious teaching: <em> (a.)</em> by not being taught of Christ, through word and example; ( <em> b</em>.) by being taught legalism, <em> i.e.,</em> ‘Be good, or God will not love you,’ instead of this: Christ loves you, therefore go to Him in order to be good. 4 . As they were <em> brought, </em> and were actually blessed by Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:16">Mark 10:16</span>); through the faith of parents <em> a seed of faith</em> may exist in the heart of a child, so that the infant members of a Christian family <em> ought to be</em> Christian children, and their education conducted in the confident expectation that they will show the fruits of faith.
