<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:22">Matthew 19:22</span>. <strong> He went away sorrowful.</strong> Not unaffected, he yet went away. Nothing further if known of him. As Jesus ‘loved him,’ and therefore taught him his duty, that love may have followed him and led him to a right decision. But the silence about his future course hints, that whatever light and love one receives, the decision is to be made by the man himself. Our Lord’s comments on ‘riches’ show that this young man’s pride was intrenched in his wealth; a part of it he might have been willing to pay for ‘eternal life;’ but being his idol, it must be entirely relinquished before he could enter the kingdom of heaven. The hindrance is often removed by God’s Providence.
