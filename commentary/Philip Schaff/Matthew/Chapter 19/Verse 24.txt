Matthew 19:24.  Easier for a camel, etc. A strong declaration of impossibility (comp. Matthew 19:26). This has been weakened in two ways: ( 1 .) by the change of a single letter (in some manuscripts), of the original, altering ‘camel’ into ‘rope;’ ( 2 .) by explaining the  eye of a  needle to mean the small gate for foot passengers at the entrance to cities. The first is incorrect, the second uncertain and unnecessary. The literal sense is not too strong, as both the context and abundant facts show. Our Lord had already spoken of a ‘camel’ as a figure for something very large (chap. Matthew 23:24); and in the Talmud the same saying occurs about an elephant ‘The camel was more familiar to the hearers of the Saviour than the elephant, and on account of the hump on its back, it was especially adapted to symbolize earthly wealth as a heavy load and serious impediment to entrance through the narrow gate of the kingdom of heaven.’
