<p><strong> In the regeneration</strong>, or ‘renovation’ (only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5">Titus 3:5</span>). Joined with what follows, which tells ‘when’ this will be, and shows that it means the accomplishment of the spiritual renovation of the world (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:5">Revelation 21:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:21">Acts 3:21</span>). As this will be the final stage of a continuous work, we find a secondary and partial fulfilment of the promise in the nigh position of the Apostles in the Church.

<p><strong> When the Son of man shall sit. </strong> A definite period, when our Lord shall appear on the throne of his glory, the throne which belongs to, results from, and manifests His glory, as conqueror, ruler, and judge.
	</p>
<p><strong> Upon twelve thrones.</strong> Christ will take His seat upon His own throne; the Twelve will be promoted to thrones prepared for them. Whether Matthias or Paul takes the place of Judas among the Twelve is disputed. It is therefore difficult to press a literal meaning upon the promise.

<p><strong> Judging. </strong> This refers more to their high position, than to acts of judging.

<p><strong> The twelve tribes of Israel</strong>. Scarcely the Jewish nation, since our Lord had already told them that His Church was to be distinct from this. Probably Christ’s people, among whom the Apostles shall occupy the most exalted position at His return.
