Matthew 19:30.  But many shall be last that are first,; and first that are last. A general truth in proverbial form; here a caution against trusting to appearances or to the permanence of present circumstances and conditions. The promise must be accompanied by a caution, especially in view of the coming apostasy of Judas. The Twelve also were liable to mistake priority in time of calling for priority in position, a frequent mistake in every human society, but doubly a mistake where Godâ€™s free grace is concerned.
