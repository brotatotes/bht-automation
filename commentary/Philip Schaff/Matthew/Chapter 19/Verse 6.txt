<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:6">Matthew 19:6</span>. <strong> what therefore God joined together, </strong> etc. Our Lord’s conclusion. The sentence forms a proper part of every Christian marriage ceremony. It is Christ’s protection of this holy relation. It also implies a warning against hasty marriages, against ignorance and forgetfulness of the fact that it is <em> God</em> who forms the indissoluble tie.
