Matthew 19:6.  what therefore God joined together,  etc. Our Lord’s conclusion. The sentence forms a proper part of every Christian marriage ceremony. It is Christ’s protection of this holy relation. It also implies a warning against hasty marriages, against ignorance and forgetfulness of the fact that it is  God who forms the indissoluble tie.
