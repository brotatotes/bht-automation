CHRONOLOGY.   Shortly after the discourse   recorded in chap. 18 our Lord finally left Galilee, passing toward Jerusalem. This chapter (comp. Mark 10:0) takes up the history after an interval of some length, omitting a number of events which are recorded by Luke and John. Intervening occurrences (Robinson): the sending out of the Seventy (Luke 10:1-16); the final departure from Galilee, passing through Samaria (Luke 9:51-56; John 7:2-10); the healing of the ten lepers (Luke 17:11-19); the public teaching of Jesus at the feast of Tabernacles (John 7:11-53); the account of the woman taken in adultery (John 8:1); the reproof of the unbelieving Jews, and the escape from their hands (John 8:12-59); the instruction of the lawyer, and the parable of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:28-37); the incidents in the house of Martha and Mary (Luke 10:38-42); the return of the Seventy (Luke 10:17-24), which should probably be placed earlier; then in regular order the events narrated in John 11:0; ‘Ephraim’ (John 11:54) being in Perea, and this chapter taking up the history at that point Lange, without sufficient reason, refers Matthew 19:1-2, to a previous journey along the borders between Samaria and Perea. At all events Matthew 19:3 belongs to the visit to Perea just before the last Passover.
