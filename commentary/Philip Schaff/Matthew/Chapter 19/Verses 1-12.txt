<p>CHRONOLOGY. <strong> </strong> Shortly after the discourse <strong> </strong> recorded in chap. 18 our Lord finally left Galilee, passing toward Jerusalem. This chapter (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:0">Mark 10:0</span>) takes up the history after an interval of some length, omitting a number of events which are recorded by Luke and John. Intervening occurrences (Robinson): the sending out of the Seventy (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:1-16">Luke 10:1-16</span>); the final departure from Galilee, passing through Samaria (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51-56">Luke 9:51-56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:2-10">John 7:2-10</span>); the healing of the ten lepers (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:11-19">Luke 17:11-19</span>); the public teaching of Jesus at the feast of Tabernacles (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:11-53">John 7:11-53</span>); the account of the woman taken in adultery (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:1">John 8:1</span>); the reproof of the unbelieving Jews, and the escape from their hands (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12-59">John 8:12-59</span>); the instruction of the lawyer, and the parable of the good Samaritan (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:28-37">Luke 10:28-37</span>); the incidents in the house of Martha and Mary (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:38-42">Luke 10:38-42</span>); the return of the Seventy (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:17-24">Luke 10:17-24</span>), which should probably be placed earlier; then in regular order the events narrated in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:0">John 11:0</span>; ‘Ephraim’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:54">John 11:54</span>) being in Perea, and this chapter taking up the history at that point Lange, without sufficient reason, refers <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:1-2">Matthew 19:1-2</span>, to a previous journey along the borders between Samaria and Perea. At all events <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:3">Matthew 19:3</span> belongs to the visit to Perea just before the last Passover.
