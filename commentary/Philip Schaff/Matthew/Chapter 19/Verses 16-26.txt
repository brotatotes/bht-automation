This section is in its proper chronological position. Our Lord ‘departed thence’   (Matthew 19:15), but on the way (Mark 10:17) He was met by this ‘ruler’ (Luke 18:18). Our Lord first presented the high ideal of marriage, the closest human tie, with a hint that even this must be subordinate to the claims of His kingdom; then the position of children, next in order of intimacy; now comes the relation to earthly possessions, which men value next (though through the influence of sin sometimes most of all). Our Lord meets the young ruler, whom he loved, on his ground, leads him to a recognition of the idol that prevents him from entering the kingdom. Going away sorrowful is not entering into life. Riches are a hindrance so great, that just here comes in the declaration of God’s saving omnipotence. Our Lord speaks the truth to rich and poor alike. There is no word here that points to a ‘community of goods,’ though this was the occasion, were that doctrine correct. The giving up of wealth when it is an idol, the crucifixion to the world, here enjoined, have a moral quality. There is none in a forced equality of possessions, nor involuntary poverty with the hope of winning heaven. Agrarianism, no less than avarice, makes wealth the chief good; trusting in poverty, no less than trusting in riches, fosters pride.
