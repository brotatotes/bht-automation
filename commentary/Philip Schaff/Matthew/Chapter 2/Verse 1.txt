<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Bethlehem of Judea. </strong> A small town situated on the crest of a small hill about six miles south of Jerusalem. The present inhabitants (about 5 , 000 ) all belong to the Greek church. The name means: <em> house of bread</em>, probably given on account of its great fertility. It is called Bethlehem Judah (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jdg+17:7-8">Judges 17:7-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1sa+17:12">1 Samuel 17:12</span>) to distinguish it from another town in Galilee (tribe of Zebulon) of the same name; also Ephrath (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+35:19">Genesis 35:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:7">Genesis 48:7</span>) and Ephrata (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:2">Micah 5:2</span>); also ‘the city of David’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:4">Luke 2:4</span>), because his birth-place (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ru+1:1-19">Ruth 1:1-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1sa+16:0">1 Samuel 16:0</span>). Its insignificance and its honor are contrasted in the prophecy (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:2">Micah 5:2</span>) quoted by the scribes (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:6">Matthew 2:6</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Herod the king, </strong> generally called in history Herod the Great, the son of the Edomite Antipater by an Arabian mother. Antipater, who was made procurator of Judea by Cæsar, appointed his son governor of Galilee at the age of fifteen. Herod was made tetrarch by Antony, but driven away by Antigonus, a Maccabæan prince. Fleeing to Rome, he was there crowned king of Judea by the Senate, through the favor of Antony, and by the help of the Romans actually obtained the throne. Securing the favor of Augustus he reigned thirty-seven years. A skilful ruler, fond of architectural embellishment, but extremely cruel and jealous, being charged with the murder of his wife and three sons. He died at the age of seventy, shortly after putting to death the third son, in the 750 th year of Rome. This date shows that the birth of Christ must have taken place at least four years before the common era. For forty days before his death he was at Jericho and the baths of Calirrhoe, hence the events mentioned in this section must have occurred before that time. He was the first ruler of the Jews who did not acknowledge the rights of the Messiah. The Asmonean princes all did. Before the death of him who had been foisted on the throne by Roman enactment, one was ‘born King of the Jews,’ in <strong> </strong> accordance with <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span>.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Magi, </strong> sages. Originally a class of priests among the Persians and Medes, who formed the king’s privy Council, and cultivated astrology, medicine, and occult natural science. They are frequently referred to by ancient authors. Afterwards the term was applied to all Eastern philosophers; and there were many in more Western countries who made astrology and the like their trade; for example, Simon Magus and Elymas the sorcerer. Hence the term ‘magician’ has a bad meaning, not implied in the word ‘magi,’ from which it is derived. The tradition that the Magi were three kings (Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar) appears to have arisen from the number of their gifts, and from the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:3">Isaiah 60:3</span>. The earlier fathers speak of them as twelve and even fifteen in number. They are justly regarded as the first fruits and representatives of heathen converts to Christianity. Hence the festival of Epiphany Jan. 6 ), also called ‘the three kings,’ celebrating Christ’s manifestation to the Gentiles, though originally instituted for a wider purpose, was very early associated with this visit of the Magi, and celebrated as a missionary festival. The date of the visit was probably more than twelve days after the birth of Jesus.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> From the east. </strong> Either: they came from the east, or: their home was in the east. The latter is the more probable meaning, and would imply the former. ‘The east’ may refer to Arabia, Persia, Chaldea, or more remote countries. In all these astrologers were found, and in all there was an expectation of some great deliverer to come about this time, derived, as is supposed, from the prophecy, Dan. 14 : 24 . Comp. the Star of Jacob in Balaam’s prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="nu+24:17">Numbers 24:17</span>. Persia or Mesopotamia was probably their residence. The way was doubtless long, but they found Christ, while those nearer Him had not even looked for Him. The hope of a Saviour was <strong> </strong> <em> given</em> to the Jews as a <em> chosen race</em>, but the same hope was given to <em> chosen individuals</em> among the Gentiles. Comp. the many instances in Old Testament history.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> To Jerusalem. </strong> At the capital they looked for the King, or for tidings of him. For a description of the city, see map and Bible dictionaries. The excavations of the Palestine Exploration Fund tend to alter the commonly received views in regard to some of the localities.</p>
