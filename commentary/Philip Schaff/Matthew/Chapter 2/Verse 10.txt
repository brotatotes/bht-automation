Matthew 2:10.  When they saw the star.  This shows that for some time, at least, they had not seen it.
	 They rejoiced with exceeding great joy.  Literally, ‘rejoiced a great joy exceedingly.’ The reappearance of the star indicated to them their success and the truth of their calculations. The joy, however, was not at the standing of the star, but at its appearing again, hence miraculous guidance is not necessarily implied.
