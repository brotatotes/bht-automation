Matthew 2:19.  When Herod was dead.  Herod died at Jericho about the time of the Passover (April) in the year 750 after the building of Rome, four years before the date from which we reckon our time. The common Christian era was not fixed until five hundred years later. (See  Introd.,  § 8 .) The length of the stay in Egypt has however been variously reckoned from a few weeks to three years in accordance with the various dates assigned to the Nativity. The Evangelist adds no comment on Herod’s character, no terms of reproach. He can learn little, who will not of himself make proper inferences. Josephus describes the horrible death of Herod, amid alternate designs of revenge and fits of despair.
	 Matthew 2:20.  They are dead,  etc. A similar expression is used (Exodus 4:19) in a revelation made to Moses, with which Joseph was certainly acquainted.
