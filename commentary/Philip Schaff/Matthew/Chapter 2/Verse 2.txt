The word ‘born’ is emphatic; the one sought was not only newly born, but a born king, not one placed on the throne by accident. The question involves a deeper meaning than the magi designed. A born King of the Jews is the hope of the Gentiles also, according to the promise now so widely fulfilled.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> His star. </strong> Comp. <em> Zumpt</em> on the year of our Lord’s birth; <em> Upham</em> on the star of Bethlehem. The event was worthy of such a display of power. Explanations: ( 1 ) A meteor or a comet. Improbable. ( 2 ) A miraculous star appearing for their guidance, and then disappearing (seen by them only, as some think). ( 3 ) A remarkable conjunction of the heavenly bodies, viz., of the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, and an extraordinary star. First proposed by the devout astronomer Kepler. Jupiter and Saturn were conjoined in the year of Rome 747 , and seen twice (May 20 and Oct. 27 ), Mars was added in the following spring. In 1603 a fourth star was in conjunction. It is supposed that this occurred at that time also. The recent astronomical calculations on this subject have been verified at the Greenwich Observatory. ‘Abarbanel, a Jew of the fifteenth century, speaks of the same conjunction as occurring before the birth of Moses, and found in its recurrence in his day (A. D. 1463 ) a sign of the speedy coining of the Messiah.’ Astrologers would attach more importance to such a conjunction than to the appearance of a new star, hence the phenomenon must have been noticed by the Magi. The Greek word used, however, points to a single star, and the date is two years earlier (B. C. 7 ) than that in which Christ is generally supposed to have been born. These difficulties are not insuperable, however. ( 4 ) <strong> </strong> The expectations of the Magi were aroused by the remarkable conjunction, and their watching was rewarded by the sight of the miraculous star. This is, perhaps, the best theory. It recognizes the astronomical fact, and teaches even more fully the lesson that the <em> expectant</em> study of nature leads to the discovery of the supernatural. Equally with the last view it shows us the Magi, because earnestly seeking the Messiah, led to Him by nature, by science, if astrology can be so termed. God can use the imperfect researches of men, and blesses investigations which fail of obtaining the whole truth; otherwise modem science would be unblessed no less than astrology. Astrology did not, at all events, prevent them from recognizing ‘His Star.’ Among ancient nations there was a general belief that strange phenomena in the sky betokened important events, especially the birth of great men. A sign in heaven will precede the second coming of Christ (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:30">Matthew 22:30</span>).
