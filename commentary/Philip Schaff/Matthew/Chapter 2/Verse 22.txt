(He had ten wives and fourteen children.) ( 1 ) <em> Herod Antipas,</em> the murderer of John the Baptist (frequently mentioned in Gospels and <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:27">Acts 4:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>), and ( 2 ) <em> Archelaus,</em> were sons of Malthace the fourth wife of Herod; ( 3 ) <em> Herod Philip I. </em> (‘Philip,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:17">Mark 6:17</span>) was the son of Mariamne, the third wife, and lived a private life, having been excluded from all share in his father’s possessions; ( 4 ) <em> Herod Philip II.</em> (‘Philip the tetrarch,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:1">Luke 3:1</span>), was the son of Cleopatra, the fifth wife of Herod, and the husband of Salome, the daughter of Herodias (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:6">Matthew 14:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:22">Mark 6:22</span>), and his half-brother Philip. The name, ‘Archelaus,’ means ‘ruler of the people.’ Herod excluded Archelaus by will from any share in his dominions, but afterward bequeathed him ‘the kingdom.’ The Emperor Augustus allowed him to be ‘Ethnarch’ over Judea, Idumea, and Samaria. He was actually reigning at the time referred to in this verse. He was afterward summoned to Rome and banished into Gaul. Herod Agrippa I. (‘Herod the King,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:1">Acts 12:1</span>, etc.) and Herod Agrippa II. (‘King Agrippa,’ Acts 25-26) his son, were descendants of Aristobuius, the murdered son of Herod the Great.

The name is derived from a word signifying a ring or circle. The Galileans, though Jews in religion, were looked down upon by inhabitants of Judea (Jews in the strict sense), probably because provincials, and living more closely allied with the heathen. Samaria lay between Judea and Galilee.</p>
