The latter took place on the fortieth day, and the interval which this allows is too brief for the events of this section. On the relative position of the Adoration of the Magi and the presentation, see Luke 2:22-39. On the childhood of Jesus, see Luke 2:40-52.
	 Peculiar to Matthew, who follows the thread of the history, rather to discover proofs of the Messiahship of Jesus than to present a full and chronological narrative of events. In this section the fulfilment of Old Testament prophecy is asserted in accordance with this design.

Herod, the king of the Jews through Roman favor, represents the fruitless hostility of Jew and Gentile to the Christ of God; which results, however, in great human distress. Egypt and Galilee protect Him whom Jerusalem persecutes. Flight and persecution follow the angelic anthem and the adoration of the Magi. Egypt the cradle of God’s people, in both dispensations. ‘Jesus has sanctified even the afflictions of our childhood’ (Starke). Nazareth a symbol of the humiliation of Christ and the humble condition of His people.
