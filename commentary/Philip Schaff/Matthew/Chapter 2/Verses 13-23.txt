<p>CHRONOLOGY. We place the flight into Egypt a <em> fter</em> the presentation in the temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:22-39">Luke 2:22-39</span>). The latter took place on the fortieth day, and the interval which this allows is too brief for the events of this section. On the relative position of the Adoration of the Magi and the presentation, see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:22-39">Luke 2:22-39</span>. On the childhood of Jesus, see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:40-52">Luke 2:40-52</span>.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> Peculiar to Matthew, who follows the thread of the history, rather to discover proofs of the Messiahship of Jesus than to present a full and chronological narrative of events. In this section the fulfilment of Old Testament prophecy is asserted in accordance with this design. The flight into Egypt Herod, failing to discover the Messiah by craft, seeks to destroy Him without discovery, by indiscriminate cruelty. The return to Judea and the residence in Galilee. Herod, the king of the Jews through Roman favor, represents the fruitless hostility of Jew and Gentile to the Christ of God; which results, however, in great human distress. Egypt and Galilee protect Him whom Jerusalem persecutes. Flight and persecution follow the angelic anthem and the adoration of the Magi. Egypt the cradle of God’s people, in both dispensations. ‘Jesus has sanctified even the afflictions of our childhood’ (Starke). Nazareth a symbol of the humiliation of Christ and the humble condition of His people.</p>
