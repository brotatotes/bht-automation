<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:16">Matthew 20:16</span>. The proverbial expression of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:30">Matthew 19:30</span>, recurs with a different order. The parable, therefore, illustrates the truth that the order in the calling of individuals and nations will in many (not all) cases be reversed in their final position in heaven. An encouragement to those called late in life; a solemn warning to those called early, urging them to be humble, and ever mindful of their unworthiness before God, lest they be overtaken by others or forfeit their reward altogether. The admonition was intended, first, for the Apostles, especially for Peter, whose question called forth this parable; then for Jewish Christians generally, in their feelings to the Gentile converts, and in their legal tendency; and lastly, for all Christians who enjoy special spiritual privileges and the great blessing of an early acquaintance with the Saviour.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;">‘Many are called, but few are chosen.’ This is to be omitted, though found in many authorities. If genuine, it means, many are called to be heirs of salvation, yet few chosen to be preeminent. Free grace <em> within</em> the Church is thus indicated.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> An exclusive meaning is not to be pressed upon the various times of hiring, which show the repeated call. At these <em> quarters</em> of the natural day, laborers would be waiting. Special applications: The rooming, the age from Adam to Noah; the third hour, from Noah to Abraham; the sixth hour, from Abraham to Moses; the ninth hour, from Moses to Christ, and the eleventh hour, from Christ to the end of the world. The different ages in the life of individuals: childhood, youth, manhood, old age, and the years of decrepitude. Lange: the first laborers, Jewish Christians generally, who were characterized by a mercenary spirit; the Apostles are included as a warning to them; the second class, ‘standing in the marketplace,’ the Jewish proselytes; those hired at the sixth and ninth hour, the Gentile races; ‘the eleventh hour’ laborers, the fruits of missionary labors in latter days.
