<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:18">Matthew 20:18</span>. <strong> We go up to Jerusalem</strong>. On the Journey to death which He had previously predicted (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span>).
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Delivered onto the chief</strong> <strong> priests</strong>. More detailed than chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:22">Matthew 17:22</span>: ‘into the hands of men.’ A double betrayal is implied: first by His professed friends to His declared enemies; then by His own people to the Gentiles.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> They shall condemn him to death</strong>. A reference to the judicial condemnation on the part of the Sanhedrin (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:1">Matthew 27:1</span>).
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:19">Matthew 20:19</span>. <strong> And shall deliver him unto the Gentiles</strong>. Comp. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:2">Matthew 27:2</span> ff.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> To mock, and to scourge,</strong> and to crucify. Mark and Luke add: ‘spit upon.’ Fulfilled in every detail.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> And the</strong> <strong> third day he shall be raised</strong> <strong> up</strong>. This is added as before. The request of Salome indicates that the disciples did not understand the prediction as a whole (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:34">Luke 18:34</span>), plain as it is to us.
