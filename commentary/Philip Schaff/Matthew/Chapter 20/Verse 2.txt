<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:2">Matthew 20:2</span>. <strong> For a penny</strong>, or ‘shilling’ <em> (denarius). </em> Between 14 and 15 cents, the usual pay for a day’s labor. Explanations: The general idea is of reward, but with a special reference to temporal rewards, which may be received while eternal life is lost. Inconsistent with the dignity of the parable; and inapplicable to the Apostles. Besides the penny was paid at the close of the day, <em> i.e., </em> at the end of man’s life or the day of final account, just when the temporal reward ceases. Eternal salvation is meant; for while the idea of reward is present, the whole drift of the parable teaches us that God’s grace is free (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:15">Matthew 20:15</span>). The mercenary spirit of the first laborers has a primary reference to the Jews and their prejudice against the Gentiles. This envious disposition is thus rebuked. The Gentile converts went to work as soon as they were called, without a definite agreement as to price, trusting in the justice and mercy of the householder. They are commended, and to them was given far more than they could ask or deserve. Those first called represent <em> nationally</em> the Jews, called with a definite covenant; <em> individually,</em> those called in early life and who have spent their days in God’s service. Such are warned against feasting, or claiming of higher reward than those called afterwards; a necessary caution.
