<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:26">Matthew 20:26</span>. <strong> </strong> But not to shall it be among you. <strong> </strong> To maintain superiority of rank by force is not Christian, even if encouraged by ecclesiastical organizations. It is worst of all in such organizations, for freedom in the Christian communion is necessary to true civil freedom.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> But whosoever</strong> <strong> would become great among </strong> you, <em> i.e., </em> great in the next life, <strong> let him be your minister</strong>, <em> i.e.,</em> in this life. Deep humility manifesting itself in a service of love is the measure of Christian greatness, actually constituting it here, but acknowledged hereafter. This does not forbid official orders in the Church, but real greatness is independent of such orders. However necessary, they are intended to advance the liberty of the Church. Office in the Church is to be a service.
