<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Came</strong>. His appearing in the world was <strong> not to be</strong> <strong> ministered unto, not to be personally served by </strong> others, nor to exercise an external authority for His own external interest, <strong> but to minister</strong>, to serve others, as His whole ministry showed. Christ’s <em> example</em> enforces the lesson of humility, but a deeper truth is now for the first time declared

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> A ransom</strong> <strong> for</strong> <strong> many</strong>. ‘Ransom’ may mean only the payment for a life destroyed (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:20">Exodus 21:20</span>), the price paid for the redemption of a slave (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="le+25:5">Leviticus 25:5</span>). As however it also means ‘propitiation’ (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:7">Proverbs 13:7</span>), and the word translated ‘for’ means ‘in the place of,’ this passage affirms that our Lord’s death was vicarious; by His death as a ransom-price the ‘many’ are to be redeemed from the guilt and power of sin. As soon as the disciples could bear it, they were taught this central truth of the gospel, to which they gave such prominence, after the Holy Ghost came upon them. This tender rebuke of their ambition bases the cardinal grace of humility upon the cardinal doctrine of the Atonement.
