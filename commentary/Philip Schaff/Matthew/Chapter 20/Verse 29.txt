<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:29">Matthew 20:29</span>. <em> </em> <strong> And at they went out of Jericho.</strong> <em> </em> Comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:46">Mark 10:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:35">Luke 18:35</span>. Probably after the conversation just mentioned our Lora entered Jericho, and meeting a multitude there passed out of the city with them and returned again to encounter Zaccheus (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:2-10">Luke 19:2-10</span>). On this excursion He passed the blind men. He left Jericho for Bethany on noon of Friday ( 8 th of Nisan), a week before the crucifixion. On Saturday He was in Bethany (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1">John 12:1</span>). Jericho was in the tribe of Benjamin on the borders of Ephraim, about two hours journey from the Jordan, and the road thence to Jerusalem was difficult and dangerous (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:30-34">Luke 10:30-34</span>). The district was a blooming oasis in the midst of an extended sandy plain, watered and fruitful, rich in palms, roses, and balsam: hence probably the name (‘the fragrant city’). Built by the Canaanites, and destroyed by Joshua (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="jos+6:26">Joshua 6:26</span>), it was rebuilt and fortified at a later day, and became the seat of a school of the prophets. Herod the Great beautified it, and it was one of the most pleasant places in the land. In the twelfth century scarcely a vestige of the place remained, there is now on the site a wretched village, Richa or Ericha, with about 200 inhabitants. Robinson, however, locates the old Jericho in the neighborhood of the fountain of Elisha (two miles northwest of Rich).
