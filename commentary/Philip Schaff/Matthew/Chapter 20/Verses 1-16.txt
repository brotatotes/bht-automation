<p>The direct reply to Peter’s question is found <strong> </strong> in all three accounts; the parable is peculiar to Matthew. It loses most of its seeming difficulties, when connected with the previous conversation. The question of Peter had reference to a <em> preeminent</em> reward, and after the promise to them (which is changed immediately into a promise to all) this parable teaches that this reward is of free grace, and that the Apostles themselves, though first called and first to forsake all, should not <em> on that account</em> expect a preeminent reward. Self-sacrifice for Christ, not priority in time, is the ground of preeminence. Chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:30">Matthew 19:30</span>, introduces a statement to be illustrated (‘But many,’ etc.); chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:16">Matthew 20:16</span>, repeats it as enforced (‘So the last,’ etc.).
