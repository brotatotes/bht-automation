<p>CHRONOLOGY. The final journey to Jerusalem begins. The approach of His death calls for a third prediction to the Twelve, more specific in its details. The <em> crucifixion</em> is mentioned only in Matthew’s account. On the way from Perea (see note at the beginning of chap. 19 ) to Jericho, Salome, the wife or Zebedee, prefers an ambitious request in behalf of her two sons. This was probably occasioned by the prediction, and leads to further instruction. Reaching Jericho about a week before the Passover, our Lord performed the miracle mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:30-34">Matthew 20:30-34</span>. Matthew mentions two blind men, Mark and Luke but one, the former giving his name. Matthew and Mark say that the miracle occurred as they went out of Jericho; Luke ‘as He was come nigh unto Jericho.’ He also narrates the interview with Zaccheus and the parable of the ten pounds, as following this miracle and immediately preceding the journey to Jerusalem. Accepting Luke’s order, we suppose that our Lord remained for a day at Jericho, and that the healing occurred during some excursion into the neighborhood.
