<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:1">Matthew 21:1</span>. <strong> Bethphage</strong> (‘house of figs’). Mark and Luke add: ‘and Bethany’ (‘house of dates’). The two places were probably near each other, but of the former no trace remains. Bethphage was probably nearer to Jerusalem. Some suppose that Bethany lay on the road from Jericho to Jerusalem, and our Lord having turned aside to visit it, now returned to Bethphage on the direct route.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The mount</strong> <em> </em> <strong> of Olives</strong>. This lay between Bethphage and Jerusalem, about ‘a Sabbath day’s journey’ from the city (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:12">Acts 1:12</span>). There were three roads to the city, a winding northern one, a steep footpath directly over the summit, and a southern road, usually taken by horsemen and caravans. The usual opinion has selected the middle road as that taken by our Lord on this occasion, but the view that He passed over the southern or main road, accords best with the various accounts of the procession and its incidents. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:41">Luke 19:41</span>. The hill is about seven hundred feet high, overlooking every part of Jerusalem, which lies west of it, separated from it by the valley of the Kidron (‘brook Cedron,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:1">John 18:1</span>). The Garden of Gethsemane is on the west side of the Mount. The temple was in the foreground as one looked down on the city from this elevation.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Then Jesus sent two disciples</strong>. Their names are not given. ‘The sending of the two disciples proves the deliberate intention of Jesus to give a certain solemnity to this scene. Till then He had withdrawn from popular expressions of homage; but once at least He wished to show Himself as King Messiah to His people. It was a last call addressed by Him to the population of Jerusalem. This course, besides, could no longer compromise His work. He knew that in any case death awaited Him in the capital.’ (Godet.)
