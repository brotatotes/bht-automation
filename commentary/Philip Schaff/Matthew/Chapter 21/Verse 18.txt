<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:18">Matthew 21:18</span>. N <strong> ow in the morning</strong>. On Monday morning. To give point to the incident, Matthew, unites the two morning walks from Bethany (on Monday and Tuesday).
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> He hungered</strong>. An actual physical want; it may have been occasioned by His leaving Bethany very early in His zeal to purify the temple where He had seen the abuses as He looked about on the previous evening. Human want and Divine power are exhibited simultaneously. On Sunday He entered Jerusalem amid hosannas, on Monday in hunger. This hunger may symbolize His longings for some better fruit from His chosen people.
