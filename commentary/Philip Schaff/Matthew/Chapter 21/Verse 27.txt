<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:27">Matthew 21:27</span>. <strong> We know</strong> <strong> not</strong>. A falsehood; as <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:25-26">Matthew 21:25-26</span>, show.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Neither tell I you</strong>, etc. Christ answers their thought: we <em> will</em> not tell. This refusal is similar to that made when a sign from heaven was demanded (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:38">Matthew 12:38</span> ff.). The answer assumes their proven and confessed incompetency to decide on the authority of a prophet, and consequently His superiority to their questioning. Such a defeat increased their opposition.
