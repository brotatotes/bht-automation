Matthew 21:27.  We know  not. A falsehood; as Matthew 21:25-26, show.
	 Neither tell I you, etc. Christ answers their thought: we  will not tell. This refusal is similar to that made when a sign from heaven was demanded (chap. Matthew 12:38 ff.). The answer assumes their proven and confessed incompetency to decide on the authority of a prophet, and consequently His superiority to their questioning. Such a defeat increased their opposition.
