<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:32">Matthew 21:32</span>. <strong> In the way of righteousness</strong>. In the way of repentance, turning to that righteousness of life (which the Pharisees professed to esteem); perhaps with an allusion to Christ Himself as the Way (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Did not even repent</strong> <strong> afterward</strong>. Even after seeing the repentance of these classes, you did not profit by it. Remarkable cases of conversion are designed to be means of influencing others. In the parable the refusing yet repenting son is put first because it suited the application to the publicans who ‘went before.’ In the more general application there is no such priority. The proud and hypocritical are always harder to influence than open sinners.
