<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:38">Matthew 21:38</span>. <strong> This is the heir</strong>. ‘Heir’ in virtue of His human nature, <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1-2">Hebrews 1:1-2</span>.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Keep his inheritance</strong>. Not ‘seize.’ An expression of folly (in addition to the wicked resolve), as though the death of the heir would permit them to hold the possession, while the householder lived. This assumes an unwilling conviction of the Messiah-ship of Jesus, on the part of the rulers. Up to this point the parable was History, here it becomes Prophecy. In the attempt to maintain their own authority, which He had challenged, by putting Him to death, they foolishly defied God. Some of them might have thought, if we try to kill Him, He will save himself, if He is the Messiah (comp, the taunt during the crucifixion, chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:40">Matthew 27:40</span>); but this prophetic word should have banished that thought.
