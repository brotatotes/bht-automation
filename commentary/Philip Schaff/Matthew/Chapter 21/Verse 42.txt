<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>. <strong> The stone</strong>, etc. From <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span>. The ‘Hosannas’ at our Lord’s entry to Jerusalem were taken from the same Psalm. The original reference of the passage is doubtful, whether to David or to Zerubbabel (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:8-9">Zechariah 3:8-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:7">Zechariah 4:7</span>); but it is properly applied to the Messiah. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>, which Peter cites in connection with it (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:6-7">1 Peter 2:6-7</span>; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span>).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The builders rejected</strong>. The rulers of the Jews (‘the husbandmen’), whose duty it was to build up the spiritual temple, now addressed in rebuke and warning.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The head of the corner</strong>. The most important foundation stone, joining two walls. A reference to the union of Jews and Gentiles in Christ (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:19-22">Ephesians 2:19-22</span>) may be included, but the main thought is, that the Messiah, even if rejected by the ‘builders,’ should become the corner-stone of the real temple of God. This involves the important idea, that the ‘builders’ would be themselves rejected: the parable left the Son dead outside of the vineyard, this citation, representing Him as victor and avenger (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:44">Matthew 21:44</span>), points to the resurrection.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> This</strong> head of the comer <strong> was from the Lord</strong>, etc. ‘This’ must grammatically refer either to ‘head’ or ‘comer.’ Others understand it as ‘this thing,’ this exaltation of the despised one.
