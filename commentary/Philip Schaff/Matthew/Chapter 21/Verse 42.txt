Matthew 21:42.  The stone, etc. From Psalms 118:22. The ‘Hosannas’ at our Lord’s entry to Jerusalem were taken from the same Psalm. The original reference of the passage is doubtful, whether to David or to Zerubbabel (Zechariah 3:8-9; Zechariah 4:7); but it is properly applied to the Messiah. Compare Isaiah 28:16, which Peter cites in connection with it (1 Peter 2:6-7; comp. Romans 9:33).
	 The builders rejected. The rulers of the Jews (‘the husbandmen’), whose duty it was to build up the spiritual temple, now addressed in rebuke and warning.
	 The head of the corner. The most important foundation stone, joining two walls. A reference to the union of Jews and Gentiles in Christ (as in Ephesians 2:19-22) may be included, but the main thought is, that the Messiah, even if rejected by the ‘builders,’ should become the corner-stone of the real temple of God. This involves the important idea, that the ‘builders’ would be themselves rejected: the parable left the Son dead outside of the vineyard, this citation, representing Him as victor and avenger (Matthew 21:44), points to the resurrection.
	 This head of the comer  was from the Lord, etc. ‘This’ must grammatically refer either to ‘head’ or ‘comer.’ Others understand it as ‘this thing,’ this exaltation of the despised one.
