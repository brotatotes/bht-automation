Matthew 21:44.  And he that falleth on this stone,  i.e., the corner-stone, Christ (Matthew 21:42). This verse expands the clause: ‘He will miserably destroy these miserable men,’ adding the thought that Christ Himself is the Judge, whose coming will result in a twofold punishment.
	 Will be broken. Probably a reference to Isaiah 8:14-15. He who runs against or falls over the cornerstone, making Christ a spiritual offence or stumbling-block (comp. 1 Peter 2:8), will be bruised. This is the punishment of the active enemy of the passive Christ.
	 And whomsoever it shall fall,  it will  scatter him as chaff. When Christ is the active Judge this utter destruction will be the full punishment of His enemies. Repentance may intervene and avert this final result. There is a reference hire to Daniel 2:34-35; Daniel 2:44, the stone in that prophecy being identified with that mentioned in Psalms 118:0, Isaiah 8:0, and with Christ Himself. In addition to the striking fulfilment in the case of the Jewish rulers, there is an obvious application to all who oppose Christ, who take offence at Him as the corner-stone.
