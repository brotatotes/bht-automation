<p style="margin-left:0.06em;"><strong> And he sat</strong> <strong> thereon</strong>, lit., ‘on them,’ the animals, not the clothes. He rode on the colt (Mark and Luke), but the plural here is justified by the usage of the Greek language. It suggests moreover that this unbroken colt remained quiet because the mother was with it, thus affording an incidental evidence of truthfulness. Some suppose that the mother represents the Old Theocracy running idly by the side of the young Church, but this analogy is forced, since the mother went along to keep the colt quiet.
