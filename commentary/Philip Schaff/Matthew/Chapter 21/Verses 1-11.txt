The date of the public entry   into Jerusalem (narrated by all four Evangelists) was  Sunday, the   10  th of the month Nisan. We hold that our Lord ate the Passover at the usual time (see on chap.

A remarkable contrast to the procession to Golgotha (Luke 18:26 ff.), both strictly in keeping with the purpose of His mission, ‘to give His life a ransom for many  .’
