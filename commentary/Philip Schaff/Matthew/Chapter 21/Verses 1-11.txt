<p>The date of the public entry <strong> </strong> into Jerusalem (narrated by all four Evangelists) was <em> Sunday, the </em> <em> 10</em> <em> th of the month Nisan.</em> We hold that our Lord ate the Passover at the usual time (see on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:17">Matthew 26:17</span>), and was crucified on Friday. Reckoning back from this date, we infer that He left Jericho on Friday, the 8 th of Nisan, reached Bethany the next day (‘six days before the passover;’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1">John 12:1</span>). On the evening of that day, after the Sabbath had ended, the anointing by Mary in the house of Simon the leper took place (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:2">John 12:2</span>). On the reasons for preferring this date, see on chap. 26 .; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:3-9">Mark 14:3-9</span>. John explicitly says (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:12">Matthew 12:12</span>) that the entry took place ‘the next day. The date is significant, for on the 10 th of Nisan the Paschal lamb was selected (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:3">Exodus 12:3</span>), being kept until the 14 th.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> This public entry was intentional, not accidental, nor caused by the zeal of His followers, as is evident from all the details, from the prophecy cited, and from the reply to the Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:40">Luke 19:40</span>: ‘If these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out’). It prepared the way for His sufferings by a public avowal of His mission, was a temporary assumption of His rightful royal prerogative, to hasten a decision in Jerusalem. A merciful measure to believing hearts, one of judgment to His enemies. A glimpse of glory given to men, but only increasing the hatred of the rulers, and hastening His death. A remarkable contrast to the procession to Golgotha (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:26">Luke 18:26</span> ff.), both strictly in keeping with the purpose of His mission, ‘to give His life a ransom for many <em> .’
