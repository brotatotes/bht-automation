<p>TIME. <strong> </strong> <em> Tuesday</em>, in the temple, after the discourse about the fig tree. The events recorded in chaps, 22 , 23 , took place on the same day; the discourse in chaps, 24 , 26 , was delivered in the evening as our Lord returned from Jerusalem to Bethany (on the Mount of Olives).

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"> The assault of the high priests quickly repelled by the question about the Baptist (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:23-27">Matthew 21:23-27</span>): two parables directed against them (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:28-32">Matthew 21:28-32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:33-44">Matthew 21:33-44</span>); their continued hostility (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:45-46">Matthew 21:45-46</span>). A Third parable (chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:1-14">Matthew 22:1-14</span>), which might be included in this section, is placed by itself, because peculiar to Matthew and probably uttered later (see <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:45-46">Matthew 21:45-46</span>).
