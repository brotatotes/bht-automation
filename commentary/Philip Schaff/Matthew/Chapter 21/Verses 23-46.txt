TIME.    Tuesday, in the temple, after the discourse about the fig tree. The events recorded in chaps, 22 , 23 , took place on the same day; the discourse in chaps, 24 , 26 , was delivered in the evening as our Lord returned from Jerusalem to Bethany (on the Mount of Olives).
	 The assault of the high priests quickly repelled by the question about the Baptist (Matthew 21:23-27): two parables directed against them (Matthew 21:28-32; Matthew 21:33-44); their continued hostility (Matthew 21:45-46). A Third parable (chap. Matthew 22:1-14), which might be included in this section, is placed by itself, because peculiar to Matthew and probably uttered later (see Matthew 21:45-46).
