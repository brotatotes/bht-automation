Matthew 22:11.  To look upon the guests. The Pharisees and all legalists think the opening of the doors leads to unrighteousness, there follows therefore a hint of the gospel method of righteousness. The coming in judgment (comp. Zephaniah 1:7-8) is represented as taking place at the feast, and hence not only without terror but an occasion of joy, for the properly clothed guests. God, not man, is to finally discriminate between the guests. Had not on a wedding garment. Each guest should and could have one. The character of the guests (Matthew 22:10) indicates that the king himself provided the wedding garments. The lesson is not that each guest should take pains to provide himself with the proper habit. The gift of the wedding garment accords far better with the Scripture doctrines of grace. On the other view poverty would have been a valid excuse, yet the man was ‘speechless.’ ‘The wedding garment’ is not faith; that is the putting on of the garment; it is ‘righteousness,’ given of God in Christ; to be distinguished but not divided, as imputed and in-wrought. Other views: ( 1 .) Charity or holiness; this leads to legalism by throwing the gospel basis of holiness into the background. ( 2 .) Christ Himself; a less exact statement of our interpretation. ( 3 .) Baptism; this is not justified by the parable nor by the general tenor of Scripture.
