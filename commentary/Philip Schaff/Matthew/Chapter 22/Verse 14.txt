A proverbial expression; see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:16">Matthew 20:16</span>. Here the application is more general. The ‘called’ are all those invited, both Jews and Gentiles.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> But few chosen</strong>. The general sense is: Few pass safely through the two stages of sifting. The one man in the parable therefore stands for a large class. It is implied that the guests who stand the test are ‘chosen’ by God.
