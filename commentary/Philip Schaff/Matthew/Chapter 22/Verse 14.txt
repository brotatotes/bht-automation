Matthew 22:14.  For many are called. A proverbial expression; see chap. Matthew 20:16. Here the application is more general. The ‘called’ are all those invited, both Jews and Gentiles.
	 But few chosen. The general sense is: Few pass safely through the two stages of sifting. The one man in the parable therefore stands for a large class. It is implied that the guests who stand the test are ‘chosen’ by God.
