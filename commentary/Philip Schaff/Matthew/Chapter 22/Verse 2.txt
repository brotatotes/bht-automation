<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> A marriage feast for his son</strong>. The word includes any great feast, but here a marriage feast is meant, since the word ‘son’ must not be thrown into the background. It was Christ’s marriage, <em> i.e.</em>, with His covenant people, according to the imager of the Old Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:5">Isaiah 54:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:4">Ezekiel 16:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:19-20">Hosea 2:19-20</span>; Song of Solomon throughout; comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:0">Psalms 45:0</span>) See, also, in the New Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:25">Ephesians 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span>;) where the Church is the Bride, and this marriage feast is the union of Christ and His Church in glory. The union of the Divine and human natures of Christ underlies the other union, but is not prominent here. Believers, as individuals, are guests, the Church as an ideal whole is the Bride.
