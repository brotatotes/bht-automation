Matthew 22:2.  A man that was a king. Evidently God: the householder of the former parable.
	 A marriage feast for his son. The word includes any great feast, but here a marriage feast is meant, since the word ‘son’ must not be thrown into the background. It was Christ’s marriage,  i.e., with His covenant people, according to the imager of the Old Testament (Isaiah 54:5; Ezekiel 16:4; Hosea 2:19-20; Song of Solomon throughout; comp. Psalms 45:0) See, also, in the New Testament (Ephesians 5:25; Revelation 21:9;) where the Church is the Bride, and this marriage feast is the union of Christ and His Church in glory. The union of the Divine and human natures of Christ underlies the other union, but is not prominent here. Believers, as individuals, are guests, the Church as an ideal whole is the Bride.
