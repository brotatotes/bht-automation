<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:3">Matthew 22:3</span>. <strong> His servants</strong>. In this prophetic parable, not the prophets but the first messengers of the gospel.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> To call them that were bidden</strong>. The Oriental custom was to invite twice: first to the feast generally (‘bidden’), then to the beginning of the feast itself (‘call’). Those ‘bidden’ were the Jews. The second invitation was a summons to expected guests, rather than an invitation. The first servants, whose message was rejected, were John the Baptist, Christ, and His disciples up to this time.
