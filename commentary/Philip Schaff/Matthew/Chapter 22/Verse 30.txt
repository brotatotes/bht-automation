Matthew 22:30.  Neither marry, spoken of the man;  nor are given in marriage, of the woman, since the father gave away the bride in marriage. This relation is not to be reestablished in the state after the resurrection, because those raised up  are as angels in heaven. Comp. especially the fuller answer in Luke 20:35-36. There the immortality is brought out; as there is no death there, there will be no birth there. Personal intercourse doubtless remains, but the Jews looked at marriage more in its physical relations. Equality with angels in mode of existence is affirmed, but the redeemed are distinguished from them. This answer opposes another error of the Sadducees, a denial of the existence of angels.
