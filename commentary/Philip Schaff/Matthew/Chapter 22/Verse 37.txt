<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> With all thy heart</strong>, literally, ‘in all thy heart.’ The whole is a demand for supreme affection. If we distinguish between the phrases, the first refers to ‘the whole energy of the reason and the intellect;’ <strong> soul,</strong> ‘the whole energy of sentiment and passion;’ <strong> mind</strong>, ‘the whole energy of thought and will in its manifestation.’ To this Mark adds: ‘with all thy strength,’ which refers more especially to the manifestations of thought and will.
