Matthew 22:37.  Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,  etc. Quoted from the Septuagint version of Deuteronomy 6:5.
	 With all thy heart, literally, ‘in all thy heart.’ The whole is a demand for supreme affection. If we distinguish between the phrases, the first refers to ‘the whole energy of the reason and the intellect;’  soul, ‘the whole energy of sentiment and passion;’  mind, ‘the whole energy of thought and will in its manifestation.’ To this Mark adds: ‘with all thy strength,’ which refers more especially to the manifestations of thought and will.
