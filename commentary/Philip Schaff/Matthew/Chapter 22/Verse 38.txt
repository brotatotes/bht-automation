<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:38">Matthew 22:38</span>. <strong> This is the great and first Commandment.</strong> ‘Great’ as embracing all the others; first’ as preceding the other table in the Decalogue. Our Lord here declares the unity of the first table of the law, its absolute greatness. Hence no part of this table (the first five commandments) can be regarded as abrogated. This ‘unqualified surrender of our whole being to God’ is to be the aim of our strivings after holiness. God’s essential perfections and His manifested grace alike demand this.
