<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:4">Matthew 22:4</span>. <strong> Other servants</strong>, with a plainer message, probably the Apostles and Evangelists, as they proclaimed the full gospel to the Jews from the day of Pentecost.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> I have made ready my</strong> <strong> dinner</strong> (not ‘supper,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:16">Luke 14:16</span>). The series of wedding feasts began with a dinner, preceding the actual marriage. It refers to the beginning of privileges, which culminate in ‘the marriage supper of the Lamb.’ Although the guests were the subjects of the King, whom He might constrain, He invites them even with urgency, to become guests and friends.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> My oxen and my</strong> <strong> fatlings</strong>. Probably a figurative allusion to the slaying of the sacrifice, as meat for the feast. This thought of Christ as slain is necessarily included, when a distinctly evangelical sense is put upon the phrase: all things are ready. The connection of the two clauses suggests a meaning which may now be profitably used in inviting to the Lord’s Supper.
