<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:42">Matthew 22:42</span>. <strong> What think ye of the Christ?</strong> ‘The Messiah.’ The Pharisees included the acknowledged interpreters of the Old Testament. Our Lord would prove the insufficiency of their interpretation on a point which they rightly deemed of most importance. What they thought of Him, He does not ask them. Since He has been abundantly proven to be ‘the Christ,’ the question comes to <em> us</em> in this form, as an all-important one. One answer only can be correct.

<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> Whose Son is he</strong>. Not merely a genealogical question, as our Lord shows.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The Son of David.</strong> A common title applied to the Messiah. A correct answer, but incomplete. This incompleteness is then proven. On this one-sided view of the Messiah, as a descendant of David, the king and warrior, their false political false hopes had been based.
