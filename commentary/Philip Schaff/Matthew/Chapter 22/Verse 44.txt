Matthew 22:44.  The Lord (Jehovah)  said to my Lord.  From Psalms 110:1, entitled, ‘a Psalm of David,’ probably written after the prophetic address of Nathan, 2 Samuel 7:12. It is quoted frequently in the New Testament as referring to Christ. The Jews referred it to the Messiah, since no objection was raised at this point ‘My lord’ implies superiority, not only to David himself, but to his own royal race and the people of Israel, or the inquiry would not cause perplexity.
	 Sit thou at my right hand (the place of honor and trust and power),  till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet  (until He is complete victor). This refers to an exaltation, exceeding any attainable by a mere man; and to a triumph beyond any political one. The latter thought opposes the false hopes of the Jews, while the whole passage shows the superhuman exaltation of the Messiah.
