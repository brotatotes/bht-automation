<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:45">Matthew 22:45</span>. <strong> How is he his son? </strong> The solution is not given here; but plainly preached by the Apostles from the day of Pentecost: the Messiah was Son of David according to the flesh, yet the preexistent eternal Son of God: the God-man (comp. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:3-4">Romans 1:3-4</span>). If the Pharisees were ignorant of this solution, it was their own fault, since the Old Testament plainly pointed to it. Probably they were not ignorant. (The words of Caiaphas, chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:63">Matthew 26:63</span>, indicate knowledge on this point.) Our Lord’s claims involved this: He had been called the ‘Son of David;’ He had claimed to be the Son of God some time before (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:24-38">John 10:24-38</span>), and they afterwards accused Him of so doing. They at least knew what His solution was, and that He claimed to be both ‘Son of David’ and ‘Lord.’
