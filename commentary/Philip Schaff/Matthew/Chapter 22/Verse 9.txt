Matthew 22:9.  The partings of the highways. Places where streets meet, public squares, etc., in the king’s city, God’s world, not Jerusalem. Some refer it to the outlets of country-roads, of highways, in the English sense, applying it to the going out into the distant world to invite the Gentiles. In Luke 14:23, where ‘hedges’ is added, the latter meaning is evident.
