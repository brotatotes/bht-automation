<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:9">Matthew 22:9</span>. <strong> The partings of the highways</strong>. Places where streets meet, public squares, etc., in the king’s city, God’s world, not Jerusalem. Some refer it to the outlets of country-roads, of highways, in the English sense, applying it to the going out into the distant world to invite the Gentiles. In <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:23">Luke 14:23</span>, where ‘hedges’ is added, the latter meaning is evident.
