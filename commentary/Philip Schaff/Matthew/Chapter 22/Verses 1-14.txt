<p>Mark states (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:12">Matthew 12:12</span>) <strong> </strong> that, after the parable of the wicked husbandmen the rulers ‘left Him and went their way; ‘hence this parable (peculiar to Matthew) was not spoken directly to the rulers. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:1">Matthew 22:1</span>, however, indicates that it was aimed at their thoughts and designs. The parable in <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:15-24">Luke 14:15-24</span> (‘the great supper’) resembles this one which is properly called, ‘the marriage of the king’s son,’ but with essential differences. The former was delivered in Perea, at the house of a Pharisee, and was occasioned by an exclamation of one who sat at meat with Him. The one was a supper, given by a man of wealth; this a marriage feast given by a king. In the former case the infinite goodness and grace of the Lord is brought out, here judgment is made prominent. The two-fold invitation: 1 . Preparatory (through the centuries of Jewish history). 2 . Peremptory, at the time of the wedding (when the New Dispensation was ushered in). The two-fold rejection: 1 . by indifference (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:5">Matthew 22:5</span>), 2 . by persecution (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:6">Matthew 22:6</span>). The two-fold punishment: 1 . on the persons; 2 . on the place of the persecutors. The invitation to the Gentiles: 1 . without any preliminary (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:9">Matthew 22:9</span>); 2 . universal (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:10">Matthew 22:10</span>). The two-fold sifting: 1 . through the invitation; 2 . at the feast itself (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:11-14">Matthew 22:11-14</span>). The excuses of indifference (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:5">Matthew 22:5</span>), the speechlessness of self-righteous profession. The wedding feast implies the offer of the wedding garment.
