<p>The defeated and embittered Pharisees send the Herodians to ensnare our Lord with a political question. The reply sends them away in astonishment (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:15-21">Matthew 22:15-21</span>). The Sadducees now appear with a flippant question, probably intended to provoke a new conflict with the Pharisees. The answer produces new astonishment (<span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:23-33">Matthew 22:23-33</span>). On the final question of the Pharisees, see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:34-35">Matthew 22:34-35</span>. Our Lord now puts a question, which the Pharisees cannot answer, and thus all His enemies are silenced. The three assaults, and the final victory. 1 . The assault of cunning, a political dilemma. 2 . The assault of the scoffers. 3 . The theological assault. The victory won on the great theological battleground, the doctrine of the Person of Christ.
