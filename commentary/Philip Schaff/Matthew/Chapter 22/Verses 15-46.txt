The defeated and embittered Pharisees send the Herodians to ensnare our Lord with a political question. The reply sends them away in astonishment (Matthew 22:15-21). The Sadducees now appear with a flippant question, probably intended to provoke a new conflict with the Pharisees. The answer produces new astonishment (Matthew 22:23-33). On the final question of the Pharisees, see note on Matthew 22:34-35. Our Lord now puts a question, which the Pharisees cannot answer, and thus all His enemies are silenced. The three assaults, and the final victory. 1 . The assault of cunning, a political dilemma. 2 . The assault of the scoffers. 3 . The theological assault. The victory won on the great theological battleground, the doctrine of the Person of Christ.
