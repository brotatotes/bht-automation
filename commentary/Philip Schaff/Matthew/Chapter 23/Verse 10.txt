Matthew 23:10.  Leaders. Higher than ‘Rabbi,’ leaders of sects, etc.
	 For one is your leader, even the Christ. Hence the disciples were and ought to be called Christians, not by any human name (comp. 1 Corinthians 1:12). As Matthew 23:9-10 refer distinctly to the Father and the Son, some have referred Matthew 23:8 to the Holy Ghost; in order to find here a hint of the Trinity. A possible, but improbable, interpretation.
