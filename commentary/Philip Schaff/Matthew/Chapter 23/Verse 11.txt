<p><span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:11">Matthew 23:11</span>. <strong> The greater among you shall be your servant </strong> (or ‘minister,’ as the word is translated in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:26">Matthew 20:26</span>). Not, ‘shall be called.’ The Pope, whose usual title is a violation of <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:9">Matthew 23:9</span>, is called: ‘Servant of servants.’ ‘The greater among you,’ implies a difference among Christians, but not that one is the ‘greatest.’ The greater have always been those who ministered.
