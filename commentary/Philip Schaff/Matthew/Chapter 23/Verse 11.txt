Matthew 23:11.  The greater among you shall be your servant  (or ‘minister,’ as the word is translated in chap. Matthew 20:26). Not, ‘shall be called.’ The Pope, whose usual title is a violation of Matthew 23:9, is called: ‘Servant of servants.’ ‘The greater among you,’ implies a difference among Christians, but not that one is the ‘greatest.’ The greater have always been those who ministered.
