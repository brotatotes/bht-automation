Matthew 23:12.  And whosoever shall exalt himself, etc. A universal rule of Godâ€™s dealings, including both worlds in its scope. Here it points to the speedy humiliation of the Pharisees. The possession of humility is the first requisite in entering the kingdom of heaven (chap. Matthew 18:3-4) and the absence of it made the Pharisees the murderers of the King.
