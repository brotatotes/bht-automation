Matthew 23:14. This verse, though misplaced, is a part of the word of God (Mark 12:40; Luke 20:47).
	 Ye devour widows’ houses,  i.e., seize upon the property of the unprotected, here represented by a particular class.
	 Even while,  the force of ‘and’ is best represented thus.
	 For a pretence ye make long prayer. The guilt was thus aggravated and  the greater damnation, or ‘condemnation,’ is threatened. There are many ways of swindling the defenceless, but to do it with pretended piety, is worst of all. Priestly Pharisaism very early showed itself in securing legacies, so that the widows were left destitute, nor has this form of sin altogether ceased.
