Matthew 23:16.  Ye blind guides. Wilfully blind, self-deluded (‘fools and blind,’ Matthew 23:17), they persisted in leading others astray. The method here spoken of is that of arbitrary distinctions in regard to oaths, perverting religion and morality.
	 Who say. Thus they taught.
	 By the temple. A common oath, comp. chap. Matthew 5:34-37, where kindred oaths are referred to, and all swearing forbidden.
	 It is nothing,   i.e., not binding; like the ‘mental reservation’ allowed and taught by the Jesuits.
	 By the gold of the temple.  Either the gold which adorned it, or the gold in its treasury.
	 He is a debtor. This they regarded as a binding oath. Whatever their reason may have been, the Pharisees thus put the gold above the temple. A sign of covetousness, and of a tendency to exalt church ornaments above the house of God itself.
