Matthew 23:17. Fools and blind. The distinction was foolish and false, revealing the character of those making it.
	 The temple that hath sanctified the  gold.  Any sanctity in the gold came from the temple, and the sanctity of the temple came from God. No inanimate thing can witness an oath. Hence Matthew 23:20-22 declare that every oath is an oath by God. Pharisees reversed the order of the hallowed things. Their casuistry is rebuked, but neither of the oaths is sanctioned.
