<p style="margin-left:0.12em;"><strong> The temple that hath sanctified the</strong> <strong> gold. </strong> Any sanctity in the gold came from the temple, and the sanctity of the temple came from God. No inanimate thing can witness an oath. Hence <span class="scriptRef" com="scn" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:20-22">Matthew 23:20-22</span> declare that every oath is an oath by God.
