Matthew 23:26.  Thou blind Pharisee. ‘Blind,’ failing to see that the great matter should come first.
	 Cleanse first. Begin with inward purity.
	 That the outside thereof may become clean also.  Outward morality is very important, but it naturally follows purity of heart. The former without the latter is not real morality.
