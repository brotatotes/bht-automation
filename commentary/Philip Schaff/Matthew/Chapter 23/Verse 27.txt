Matthew 23:27.  Whited sepulchres. On the 15 th of Adar, before the Passover, the Jews whitewashed all spots where graves were situated. This was done to prevent the passage over them, which occasioned Levitical defilement (Numbers 19:16; comp. Ezekiel 39:15, from which passage the custom is derived).
	 Outwardly indeed appear beautiful.  Beside the ‘whitening,’ much care was bestowed upon sepulchres by the wealthy Jews.
	 Full of dead men’s bones, etc. Comp. the proper sanitary regulation of Mosaic law concerning dead bodies (Numbers 5:2; Numbers 6:6).
